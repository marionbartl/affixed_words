According to Florida law , a person cannot be arrested for using force–even deadly force–unless the police first determine that there is probable cause to believe that the force used was unlawful .
But what happens in those situations in which the police believe that the force used was unlawful ?
Are the police allowed to actually state their belief to a jury at the person ’s trial ?
According to Florida ’s First District Court of Appeal , the answer is no .
In the case of Bartlett v. State of Florida , Laurie Lynn Bartlett was charged with second - degree murder for killing her boyfriend with a knife .
At her trial , the lead detective was allowed to testify that before he arrested Ms. Bartlett , he ruled out the possibility that she stabbed her boyfriend in self - defense .
Bartlett was ultimately convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in prison .
Bartlett appealed her conviction arguing that the detective should not have been allowed to express his belief to the jury that she did not act in self - defense .
The appellate court agreed and reversed her conviction .
The court stated that although Florida law requires the police to decide whether the force used by someone was unlawful before arresting that person , the police are not allowed to testify about that finding to a jury precisely because the final decision as to whether someone acted in self - defense is to be made by a jury , not by the police .
As the court of appeals stated , " [ B ]y allowing the [ prosecutor ’s ] questions and [ the detective ’s ] detailed answers on a matter within the realm of an ordinary juror ’s knowledge and understanding , the trial [ judge ] improperly invaded the province of the jury as the fact - finder and allowed the detective to serve as a fact - finder . . . by determining that self - defense was not a viable defense for [ Bartlett ] . "
The appellate court went on to state that although the detective was allowed to testify about what he actually saw when he arrived at the scene of the stabbing ( for example , a knife , blood , the boyfriend ’s wounds ) , he should not have been allowed to express his opinion about whether Bartlett stabbed her boyfriend in self - defense .
That particular issue was for the jury–and the jury alone –to decide .

BBC News , Miami
The Castro family has had a massive security cordon around it A Cuban exile blogger from Miami says he used a female internet alter ego to gain access to a member of the usually impervious family of Fidel Castro .
Luis Dominguez says he used the character to begin an online relationship with 40 - year - old Antonio , the son of ex-leader Mr Castro .
He refused to apologise for the deception , saying he wanted to show the " opulent lifestyles " of the Castros .
Cuban authorities have not confirmed or commented on the online chats .
Daily life
Many internet users have engaged in a series of flirtatious chats only to find the person they have met online is not who they say they are .
I use whatever tools I have to be able to get back at these people
Luis Dominguez
As anyone who covers Cuban politics and the Castro family knows , gaining access of any sort is far from easy .
The Castro family has had a massive security cordon around it for decades - in large part due to the many attempts to remove the island 's communist government from power .
ONLINE ROMANCE ?
tonycsport : Hi claudiacartagena82 : Hi , sorry I know you wrote me last night tonycsport :
Yes claudiacartagena82 : But I was n't at the computer .
I saw it this morning .
Did you get my picture in your email ?
tonycsport :
Yes , I 'm looking at it .
You sent the same picture twice claudiacartagena82 : Yeah but bigger tonycsport :
Yes , it 's true claudiacartagena 82 : I do n't have that many photographs in this computer .
I 'll have to look for some more .
The ones I have here are from a wedding tonycsport :
Well , as long as it was n't you who got married hehehe claudiacartagena82 :
No it was a friend 's wedding .
I 'm single .
It 's because I work so much here , and in Colombia men are macho and I do n't like that .
I spend so much time searching for information and reading tonycsport :
Hehehe , very good .
You know , I do n't see myself as macho claudiacartagena 82 :
Tell me about yourself , are you single ?
tonycsport : Yes claudiacartagena82 : Aa-ha Extract translated from the original Spanish Mr Dominguez used Antonio Castro 's alleged weakness for young women and sports .
Mr Dominguez created Claudia , a 27 - year - old Colombian sports journalist .
Claudia made contact with Antonio and they chatted on and off for an eight - month period .
Antonio shared details of his daily life in Cuba and his trips around the world with his uncle Raul , the Cuban president , but did not reveal any state secrets .
However , Mr Dominguez says that by showing what he describes as the opulent lifestyles the Castros live in a communist country like Cuba he has achieved his aim .
Mr Dominguez has published pictures and documents of his chats with the younger Mr Castro on his blog .
He refuses to apologise for violating Antonio Castro 's privacy and says he has no regrets about what he did .
" I 'm a Cuban and I'm a Cuban American and I have not been able to go back to my country since 1971 when I left .
" I use whatever tools I have to be able to get back at these people .
In Cuba people are put in prison for no reason at all .
Their rights are violated ...
So , why can't I do the same thing to them ?
I have no remorse whatsoever . "

Need Cash ?
Be an Extra or a Nude Model Americans line up to grab some extra cash as movie extras and nude models .
May 11 , 2009  --
On any given weekday , the office of Central Casting in New York looks a bit like an unemployment office .
Dozens of people , many recently laid off , come in to fill out forms and look for work .
But the jobs they 're seeking are n't just any jobs .
If hired , they could be rubbing elbows with Angelina Jolie or with the cast of " Gossip Girl " as extras .
As the recession hits Americans everywhere , many are thinking creatively and using their bodies , whether as extras in movies and TV shows or as nude models in art classes to pull in some serious , much - needed cash .
Need Extra Cash ?
Be an Extra
" There 's definitely been a spike in registration , " Todd Feldman , casting director at Central Casting , told " Good Morning America . "
" You see more guys in suits , maybe Wall Street guys that are out of work at the moment . "
Extras make anywhere from $ 80 to $ 130 a day and no previous acting experience is required .
Everyone , all ages , genders and races , is encouraged to apply by registering with a casting agency .
" We have a large database , and we basically , we put in your height , weight , " Feldman said .
" And if we 're looking for a stand - in for , you know , George Clooney for a film , we want to have him look exactly like George Clooney . "
And it 's not just New York and Los Angeles that are looking for extras .
Right now the hottest areas for filming outside those two hubs are South Carolina and Louisiana , according to senior casting agents at Central Casting .
Click here to visit Central Casting 's
Web site where you can apply for an extra job no matter where you are .
Beyond the financial benefit , Feldman said being an extra gives workers an unequalled look at the industry .
" If you want to learn about filmmaking , you want to be on set and you just want to learn the whole process , it 's just an amazing experience , " he said .
" You get to watch everything . "
Amy Yu , a banker at Morgan Stanley who lost her job last fall , was one of the would - be extras .
Yu was paired with Christopher Johnstone , an aspiring opera singer currently between jobs , and the pair helped round out a scene at a yacht club on the television show " All My Children . "
They may have appeared on screen for a short time and pretty far from the camera , but it was relatively easy cash .
And it could mean a big break later .
Hollywood stars Tom Cruise , Brad Pitt and Eva Longoria got their showbiz starts as extras .
In addition to earning money , many extras are treated to full meals on the set .
But being away from the camera is n't the only way to make cash -- some do it by being the center of attention and wearing just their birthday suits .
Show Some Skin for Money , in Art Class
At schools like the New York Academy of Art there 's money to be made as nude models for the students to sketch , paint or sculpt .
Models for art classes can make anywhere from $ 15 to $ 20 an hour working at a school and can make even more working for private artists .
And they do n't always have to be nude -- clothed models churn a profit , too .
Model Derrick
Young , a former banker , said the work is fulfilling , but a lot harder than you might think .
" You 're sometimes working eight or nine hours a day , " Young said .
" That 's a long time to be silent and hold completely still . "
Often , models are required to hold the same pose for several hours at a time for up to fifteen weeks to accomodate the demands of the art classes .
But the discipline could pay off , some very famous people worked as nude models .
Madonna was a nude model at the New York Academy of Art before her first album was released .
OTTAWA–Prime Minister Stephen Harper is expected to present a rosy picture of his Conservative government 's handling of the recession Thursday in a slick made - for - TV presentation designed to forestall a quick summer election .
The planned event in the southwestern Ontario industrial city of Cambridge will feature the Prime Minister releasing the government 's report on the effectiveness of government policies at the Armenian Community Centre .
The presentation will be moderated by Senator Mike Duffy , a former television journalist , and feature Harper , flanked by Human Resources Minister Diane Finley and Gary Goodyear , the local MP and Minister of State for Science .
It will include a staged interview segment between Harper and Duffy .
Although it is the second of quarterly performance reports demanded by the opposition Liberals as a condition for supporting the Jan. 27 budget , it will be the first of any substance and will be key to whether the minority government survives the summer .
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff has threatened to try and pull the plug on the government if the report does not show real progress in the rolling out of $ 22.7 billion in stimulus earmarked for this year .
" We 'll wait and see and make our judgement after we read it , " said Liberal finance critic John McCallum , adding he did not expect much of substance .
But , the fact Harper is releasing the document suggests it will present a glowing portrait of government action .
The setting is also important because it is in a part of the country , southwestern Ontario 's industrial , blue - collar belt .
that has been battered by layoffs in the automotive , machinery and fabrication businesses .
" It 's a good report , yes , " Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said in a brief remark upon leaving Question Period on Wednesday .
" It shows a lot of accomplishment . "
The report will contain specifics on infrastructure spending , employment , and the latest projections for economic growth .
The update is also expected to point to the analysis issued by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development this week which cited Canada among four industrialized countries showing signs of having reached a bottom in their decline .
In recent comments , Flaherty said that many Canadians are taking advantage of the up to $ 1,350 tax credit for home renovations .
But McCallum speculated the report would be a " smokescreen " masking government inaction , citing a complaint by big cities mayors last week that they have yet to see federal infrastructure funds .
" We 're really going to focus on to what extent the money that they promised got into the pockets of the people actually doing the work and thereby led to jobs , " he said .
Canada has lost 363,000 jobs since October , but the deterioration in the labour market has slowed noticeably since the massive losses of the December - February period .
And with the restructuring of the auto sector proceeding amid hopes for a recovery in car sales , there are expectations that the remaining jobs in auto assembly and parts plants can be saved .

NDP Leader Jack Layton refused to speculate about whether he is prepared to vote non-confidence in the government .
To force an election , the Liberals would need the support of both the NDP and the Bloc Quebecois , who have shown no indication of being eager to face the electorate .
Part of the reason may be that recent polls have shown the Liberals as the key beneficiaries of Tory slippage in support , particularly in the key provinces of Ontario and Quebec .
Some Liberals want to strike while the iron is hot with the minority government vulnerable on a number of fronts , including the impact of the deep recession , rising unemployment , the ballooning deficit , and the Lisa Raitt affair , in which the embattled natural resources minister got into trouble over her taped comments about the medical isotopes crisis .
Liberal MPs also do n't want to continue propping up Harper and fending off NDP and Bloc Quebecois accusations that they 're spineless and unprincipled .
Yet , Liberal insiders say senior advisers – including party pollster Michael Marzolini – are urging caution , fearing that voters wo n't pay attention during the summer and that the party 's war chest is still relatively empty .
Insiders say Ignatieff may be prepared to risk a non-confidence vote on the assumption either the NDP or Bloc will vote against it .
Layton , asked repeatedly Wednesday whether he is prepared to vote non-confidence , was non-committal .
" Right now , I 'm focused on trying to get some results .
We 'll see what the government comes forward with . "

Attempts to provoke teens into discussion on the complex issue of going steady .
Provides little support for the practice .
Ken Smith sez :
A film devoted to a problem that no longer exists .
" Marie Miller " and " Jeff " are faced with social trauma because they 've let their relationship " drift into " what others perceive as " going steady . "
But is that really what THEY want ?
" This question is not answered for them , and it is not answered for you " warns the title card at this film 's opening .
The film substitutes opening and closing title cards for a narrator .
While Going Steady has no narration , the angst - ridden self - examination by Jeff and Marie more than fill up the dead air , and leaves the impression that going steady is about as much fun as an abscessed tooth .
Jeff : " Am I going steady ?
What does that mean ?
How did I get into this anyway ? "
Jeff 's mom : " You 'll likely go steady with several different girls before you begin to think seriously about marriage . "
Marie : " What about petting ?
I 've heard you can get too deeply involved if you 're going steady . "
Marie 's mom : " I hope Jeff does n't feel he has the right to -- take liberties . "
Marie : " Oh , mother ! "
Apparently , parents wanted to prevent their aimless postwar teens from " drifting into " going steady so that they would n't be " drifting into " marriage ( or sex ) .
Thankfully , Jeff and Marie become aware of their dangerous lassitude and end the film smiling , carefree , and significantly further away from uncontrollable urges .
Going Steady ends with a title card : " This story has n't answered all your questions , has it ? "
Truer words were never to appear in a Coronet social guidance film .

Subject : I Say Hold Out For Diane
The need for this whole film and discussion would have been moot if they just had invented the " - ish " ending for words , Diane is way better looking than Marie whose face has too much of that Rana pipiens look to it .
Not to mention what a princess complex is just below the surface ... she wants to depend on Jeff to attend to her social needs but longs for other boys to call her and ask her out .
How typical - wants to have it BOTH ways - yet offers little .
The need for this whole film and discussion would have been moot if they just had invented the " - ish " ending for words , i.e . , " going steadyish " .
Not uncommon 20 years later .

It 's so amazing to be able to watch them now .
These have helped me to better understand how things were back in the 1940's and 1950's when my grandma was young and why some of her ideas seem so different from those in the younger generations .
Thank you for these .

Well now , Barney does n't seem nearly as conflicted as Marie and Jeff about his relationship , even if the activity he 's about to get involved in sounds a lot more suggestive than " going steady . "
Imagine if the term " making fudge " were substituted every time one of the main characters said " going steady . "
That might be all you 'd need to bring the film up to date .

Get the cyanide
The funniest , or creepiest , aspect to this film is how both kids , when confronted with the idea that they might be " going steady " , talk and act as if they 'd just told they might have multiple sclerosis .
They both treat the news as unpleasant and unwelcome , but they decide eventually that the only thing to do is learn to live with their steadiness .
I 've never seen such a grey and depressing look at love and I 'm not forgetting all those V.D. films where sex means inevitable syphilis .

Teenages have a lot of social pressures ;
What is right to do , what is n't .
In this film it seems the way these teenagers handled the problem of going steady was fine .
For 1951 , I think the film is excellent and got teens to think .

Subject : Waiting by the Telephone Teenagers Jeff and Marie have aimlessly drifted into a relationship where Jeff simply shows up at the door whenever he wants .
Marie hangs around waiting for him .
She wonders why no other boys ask her out .
In the meantime , Jeff asks MarieÂs friend Diane out , but she refuses because she assumes Jeff and Marie are going steady ( besides , she Âs also going steady Âwith Hal ) .
ÂGoing steady ?
Me !
How did I get into this !
Â wonders Jeff .
Over a game of checkers , JeffÂs dad explains to him that he should go steady with a few girls but ÂdonÂt make any commitments .
Â
Diane , while setting MarieÂs hair in bobby pins , recommends going steady because it means being guaranteed a date on Saturday night and you ÂdonÂt have to make an effort to be your best all the time .
Â
But Marie worries about petting and Âgoing too far . Â
Next we see Jeff combing his hair in the bathroom mirror .
ÂDonÂt expect too much and donÂt make any commitments !
Â he tells his reflection .
Jeff
Âs happy because now he has an excuse not to commit himself to a relationship with a girl .
MarieÂs relieved because she Âs fearful about petting .
This film was obviously made to discourage teenagers from drifting into premarital sex .
But JeffÂs inability to make a commitment and MarieÂs fear of sex could lead to problems down the line .

The reason this Coronet behavior modification film seems so broad - minded might lie in its apparent denial that " going steady " might lead to premarital sex .
Not at all the usual party line .
It lacks the paranoia and tension of most films in its genre , which makes it worth a look .
The script sounds like the writer was paid a dollar every time someone said the name of the film .
Or perhaps it was written by a parrot .

Is hard to believe but Queen Elizabeth seems to be running out of money .
The daily newspaper Telegraph reports that a newly published account reveals the Queen will run out of funds by 2012 unless the government increases the funding for the Royal household for the first time in 20 years .
From the Telegraph :
The total cost of keeping the monarchy increased by £ 1.5 million to £ 41.5 million [ $ 69.2 million , does not include security ] during the last financial year …
The Queen ’s Civil List , which pays for the running of the Royal household including staff salaries , was £ 13.9 million [ $ 22.8 million ] but the government provides only £ 7.9 million which has been frozen since 1991 .
The reserve , which was £ 35 million at its peak , has now dwindled to £ 14 million and Buckingham Palace estimates it will have disappeared by the end of 2011 when a new Civil List settlement is due to come into effect .
A senior Royal household official told to the paper that on current spending , the Queen will be unable to balance the books in two years time .
“ The Queen is naturally very thrifty , ” the official told the Telegraph .
But accounts show travel expenses for the Royal family rose significantly .
One of the biggest expenses was the cost of Royal travel , up £ 300,000 , to £ 6.5 million .
The figures were swelled by the £ 1.3 million spent on two overseas trips , to South America and the Far East , by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall .
They are the most expensive trips undertaken by members of the Royal Family in modern times .
As the recession persists in Britain tax payers continue to show their displeasure at where their taxes are going .
A breakdown of the figures showed that £ 9.9 million went on salaries , administration £ 1.5 million , housekeeping and furnishings £ 700,000 , ceremonial functions £ 400,000 , £ 1.1 million on catering and hospitality , £ 600,000 on the garden parties which were attended by 50,000 people .
The money provided by the taxpayer to the Queen is equivalent to 69 pence [ $ 1.13 ] per person in the country .
The 1990s presented a decade of hope , low gas prices , economic growth , low unemployment and lots of car sales .

The Explorer started a size war that shaped every single lineup of every U.S. automaker , and eventually affected the product decisions of foreign automakers .
But it left such a terrible PR pox upon the U.S. automakers that they became derided for lack of foresight even today .
It 's role in Jurassic Park would raise awareness of the new vehicle .

Ripple is based on a simple idea that has only recently become feasible , thanks to computer technology and the internet .
The system keeps track of the source of all IOUs ( I owe you ) , so that debts that are not repaid are automatically borne by the issuer .
Ripple cuts the banks right out of the picture by allowing anyone to act as a bank and grant credit within the Ripple system to anyone they know .
National monetary systems rely on trust in large financial institutions .
A bank account balance , stored as electronic bits in a computer , represents a promise by the bank to pay the account holder .
That promise is only meaningful if the bank is trustworthy .
Banks , in turn , leverage those deposits to issue new money by making loans to trustworthy individuals as determined by an often labour - intensive screening process .
By cutting out the institutional middlemen , Ripple is both more community - oriented and more efficient as a means of exchange .
Conceived by Ryan Fugger and quite formally defined by Sylvain Poirier , Ripple is a P2P monetary system based on trust that already exists between people in real - world social networks .
Banking and the Trusted Intermediary
Banking was invented to solve the problem of the trusted intermediary : I 'd like to buy something from you on credit , but you do n't know if my credit is good , so you can't accept my IOU .
If we can find someone who you trust , and I can obtain their IOU , I can use it to pay you .
Goldsmiths were trusted by everyone in the region because they held gold in their vaults , and so they were natural candidates to be ideal trusted intermediaries .
The catch was , you had to obtain their IOU , which was the original paper money , either by borrowing it at interest , or by earning it from someone who already had it .
We have become so used to our banking system , we do not realize that any trusted intermediary will do .
For example , a mutual friend might vouch for me by agreeing to assume the debt if I failed to repay .
We might even arrange for the mutual friend to simply assume the debt so that I could just pay her .
In general , a chain of more than one trusted intermediaries , each a mutual , trusted friend between the previous and the next , works the same way .
How Does Ripple Work ?
Each participant indicates which other participants he or she trusts , by offering to accept their IOUs up to a certain amount , like a line of credit .
To make a payment to someone who trusts you , you simply adjust your IOU balance with them to indicate that that you owe them the amount of the payment .
To pay someone who does n't trust you , the Ripple system finds a chain of credit connections between you and the payment recipient .
Then you pay the first person in the chain , who pays the second person , and so on until the recipient gets paid .
This is exactly what happens when someone writes a normal cheque .
Their bank deducts from his account ( which is his IOU balance with the bank ) , and pays the central bank , who credits the recipient 's bank , who further credits the recipient 's account .
In other words , the payer gives some of his bank 's IOUs back to his bank , his bank gives some of the central bank 's IOUs ( national currency ) back to the central bank , who passes them along to the recipient 's bank , who issues its own IOUs ( bank account digits ) to the recipient .
Note that all three intermediaries are banks .
Ripple lets everyone act like a bank .
Ripple Key Traits
1. Ripple is a way to make payments across currencies
Think of Ripple as a way for a user of one community currency to pay and accept payments from users of other community currencies .
Ripple allows someone who uses two currencies to easily act as a broker or intermediary for transactions between the two currency communities of which he is a member .
But more than that , Ripple is a protocol for discovering chains or two or more of such intermediaries , so that payments can be made between two currency communities that have no members in common .
All this can be done quite seamlessly to the end user .
Integrating Ripple into a community currency means that the power of that currency is no longer limited by the number of people that accept it , but rather by the number of people in the Ripple network that it is connected to .
This allows the smallest community currency to become just as useful for payment as a national currency , and overcomes the primary advantage of a national currency over community currencies .
This can all be done without adding any complexity for the end user .
2. Ripple allows anyone issue their own currency
A currency issuer could be defined as one who acts as a payment intermediary between subscribers to that currency .
It does this by vouching for the currency put forward as payment between two subscribers , and agreeing to make good on the debt it represents .
Every Ripple node is like a LETS system , in that it operates as a payment intermediary , vouching for payments between its neighbouring nodes , just like a LETS system operates as a payment intermediary between its members .
Ripple allows all these separate currency issuers to connect to a larger payment network without interfering with the operation of their individual currencies .
Ripple makes no assumptions about how a currency is issued , except that balances be electronically stored by the issuer .
Give Me An Example
Imagine you went on a camping trip with your friend and a group of her friends who you had just met .
At the end of the trip , everyone has to chip in for gas , but you have no cash to pay the driver .
Since you do n't really know him , it makes no sense for you to owe the driver .
Instead , you arrange for your friend to owe the driver , and for you to owe your friend .
Your friend is acting as an intermediary , vouching for you IOU to the driver .
In this simple example , there is no need for an automated system to keep track of the debt chain , and the debts will probably be paid off in normal currency .
But Ripple builds on this exact concept to create a web of automated intermediaries .
Suppose Alice and Bob grant each other $ 100 credit on the Ripple network , and Bob and Carol do the same .
Now suppose that Alice wants to buy a $ 10 item from Carol , whom she does n't even know .
Ripple finds that Bob is a one - link chain connecting Alice and Carol .
Alice pays
Bob by passing him a $ 10 IOU , and then Bob passes Carol his own $ 10 IOU ( not Alice's ) .
In the end , Carol is owed $ 10 not by Alice , whom she does n't know or trust , but by Bob , whom she trusts enough to loan up to $ 100 .
This is fine with Bob , since he knows the IOU he has from Alice balances what he now owes Carol .
How does this so - called " payment " do Carol any good ?
Suppose she wants to buy something for $ 5 from Dan , a complete stranger to her , but a friend to Alice .
Ripple will find the connection through Bob and Alice , and then she will pay Bob by cancelling $ 5 of his $ 10 debt .
Bob will pay Alice by cancelling $ 5 from her debt , and Alice will pay Dan by passing him a $ 5 IOU .
After all that , Alice owes $ 5 Dan and $ 5 to Bob , who owes $ 5 to Carol .

June 4 , 2009  -- David Carradine , star of the 1970s drama " Kung Fu , " was found dead in a Bangkok , Thailand , hotel room from an apparent suicide by hanging , according to police and local media .
He was 72 .
Michael Turner , a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok , confirmed the actor 's death .
Citing unnamed police officials , the Nation newspaper reported Carradine was found dead this morning by a chamber maid at the Park Nai Lert Hotel , where he was staying while shooting his latest film , " Stretch . "
Carradine was reportedly found naked in the room 's closet hanging from a rope , possibly from the curtains , according to the Nation and police .
" He was found hanging by a rope in the room 's closet , " Lt. Colonel Pirom Jantrapirom of the Lumpini police station in Bangkok told Reuters .
Police have yet to determine if Carradine died today or Wednesday , according to the U.S. Embassy .
" Yes , I can confirm that Mr. Carradine has passed away here in Bangkok , " Turner told The Associated Press today .
" We send our heartfelt condolences to his family and his loved ones .
It 's still under investigation , but it looks like Mr. Carradine passed away either late last night or early this morning .
The embassy was informed about it today . "
His body , police said , was to be autopsied .
Carradine did not show up for a scheduled dinner Wednesday evening , according to the Nation .
Carradine 's friends were shocked to learn of the veteran actor 's death .
" David was one of the first actors I ever worked with when I started my career and the closest person to a brother that I ever had in my life , " said actor Michael Madsen , who worked with Carradine on " Kill Bill " and in the upcoming " Six Days in Paradise . "
" It is shocking to me that he is no longer with us .
I had been thinking about calling him for the last several days and advise anybody who has been thinking about reaching out to a loved one to do so .
I have so many great memories of David that I would n't even know where to begin ...
He has a very special place in my heart , " Madsen said .
Carradine was perhaps best known for his role as Caine , a Chinese martial - arts master wandering the American West in the 1970s television series " Kung Fu . "
Though he had starred in more than 100 films , his career was most recently revived in Quentin Tarantino 's " Kill Bill " ( 2003 ) and " Kill Bill II " ( 2004 ) in which he played a steely assassin .
The actor spoke openly about his earlier abuse of drugs and alcohol but had reportedly remained sober for several years .
" I did n't get into drinking till I was in my 40s , and by that time I had stepped away from the rest of drugs , " he told the Irish Times in 2004 .
" There was only a period of a few years when I was drinking too much .
I had a friend who was a mentor , and he suddenly said , ' I 've never seen you abuse a substance before . '
I said , ' Am I doing that now ? '
And I was .
That was spring of 1996 .
I like to think that I stopped drinking on St. Patrick 's Day , but it was actually a month later , " he told the paper .
Born in 1936 in Hollywood , Calif. , Carradine came from a showbiz family .
His father was actor John Carradine , and his brother was actor Keith Carradine .
Of primarily Irish ancestry , Carradine 's ambiguous features landed him a lifetime of roles playing a range of ethnicities , although he was often cast as Chinese .
He most recently starred as Poon Dong , a Chinese mobster , in the action film " Crank : High Voltage . "

Curfew in Jalandhar after Vienna Gurudwara clash
National , Religion , Mon , 25 May 2009 IANS
Jalandhar , May 24 ( IANS )
A clash between two groups in a gurudwara in Austrian capital Vienna in which 11 people were injured Sunday triggered tension in Punjab , with curfew being imposed in this city and several vehicles being torched here and elsewhere in the state .
Security was heightened in several parts of the state after protestors here torched a truck and a State Bank of India ATM and damaged several vehicles .
The protestors blocked roads and highways in and around Jalandhar and nearby industrial town of Phagwara .
' Curfew has been imposed in Jalandhar city following violence .
Road and rail traffic has been affected , ' Jalandhar range inspector general of police ( IGP ) Sanjiv Kalra said .
Train traffic through Jalandhar , including the New Delhi - Amritsar Shatabdi train , was affected as protestors blocked rail tracks too .
The Punjab Police was out in substantial numbers here and in Phagwara , Hoshiarpur , Patiala and Nakodar towns after some members of a Sikh sect , Guru Ravi Dass Sabha , took to the streets protesting against the Vienna incident .
Trouble was brewing in these places late Sunday evening , police officials on the spot said .
There was considerable tension at the ' Sachh Khand ' Dera ( sect ) headquarters following the Vienna incident .
' I am in a very serious situation .
I cannot say anything at this point , ' IGP Kalra had earlier told IANS .
Protestors were out on the streets in Jalandhar and blocked traffic on several roads , including National Highway ( NH ) No.1 that passes through Jalandhar .
The police had to direct traffic through alternative and village roads .
Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal condemned the Vienna incident and urged people in Punjab to remain peaceful .
He urged the central government to take up the matter with the Austrian government so that the guilty were punished .
In Vienna , at least 11 people were wounded , many severely , in an armed attack involving rival Sikh groups in a gurudwara Sunday morning .
The incident took place during a sermon by two guest gurus from India .
According to reports , several bearded and turbaned men equipped with at least one firearm stormed the shrine during sermon .
During the melee , members of the congregation pounced upon the attackers and overpowered them , beating some severely .

The Bay Area 's first confirmed cases of swine flu have been identified in Marin County , health officials there said today .
An unidentified woman , 60 , and her 20 - month - old granddaughter tested positive for swine flu and were notified Monday night , Marin County officials said in a press release .
Both victims had recently traveled to Mexico with family members .
The woman and child were described as having had a " moderate " flu illness after their return from Mexico ; the child has already recovered and her grandmother is now experiencing only mild symptoms , according to the Marin County officials .
Other family members were tested and were receiving medication as a precaution .
Marin County has activated an operations center along with the Sheriff 's Office of Emergency Services and is coordinating with federal , state and regional health officials .
A press briefing is scheduled for 3 p.m. today .
As of Monday night , 13 cases of swine flu had been confirmed in California - five each in San Diego and Imperial counties , and three in Sacramento County .
The CDC has advised against unnecessary travel to Mexico , where nearly 2,000 people have been sickened by swine flu , with 149 dying .
Peter Schiff is reportedly considering a run at Chris Dodd 's Connecticut senate seat , having hinted about it last night on Comedy Central 's " The Daily Show " with Jon Stewart .
Reuters spoke with Schiff 's brother Andrew , a spokesman who told the wire service " We did n't announce last night and we 're not announcing now ...
But we 're seeing how Peter fits in with the national Republicans and whether they would actively support a candidate of Peter 's persuasion . ''

Close your eyes and think of Kenneth from 30 Rock .
I can barely count the number of emails making that observation .
I 'm told Olbermann 's open mic got it right : Jindal 's entrance reminded one of Mr Burns gamboling toward a table of ointments .
Stylistically , he got better as he went along but there was , alas , a slightly high - school debate team feel to the beginning .
And there was a patronizing feel to it as well - as if he were talking to kindergartners - that made Obama 's adult approach so much more striking .
And I 'm not sure that the best example for private enterprise is responding to a natural calamity that even Ron Paul believes is a responsibility for the federal government .
And really : does a Republican seriously want to bring up Katrina ?
As for the biography , it felt like Obama - lite .
With far less political skill .
It was also odd for Jindal to keep talking about the need for tax cuts - when Obama just announced a massive tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans .
He gave no alternative proposal on the financial collapse ; and tried to attack government spending simply because it 's government spending .
In a deepening depression , grown - ups can take a slightly different view of such spending in the short term .
But give him his due : he did in the end concede that the GOP currently has a credibility problem on the fiscal issues they are now defining themselves with .
This matters - it matters for the future of the GOP and the possibility of minimal accountability after an age that disdained it .
The rest was boilerplate .
And tired , exhausted , boilerplate .
If the GOP believes tax cuts - more tax cuts - are the answer to every problem right now , they are officially out of steam and out of ideas .
And remember : this guy is supposed to be the smart one .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

( CNN ) --
An anti-abortion activist accused of killing Kansas physician George Tiller was " obsessed " with the doctor and had debated whether to kill him in the past , his former roommate said Thursday .
Scott Roeder , 51 , is being held on a first - degree murder charge and two counts of aggravated assault .
" It was almost his calling to do something about this particular doctor , " Eddie Ebecher said .
Tiller , 67 , was one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late - term abortions , and he already had survived one attempt on his life before being gunned down in his church Sunday morning .
Ebecher 's former roommate , Scott Roeder , has been jailed on first - degree murder and aggravated assault charges in Tiller 's death .
Roeder has not yet entered a plea to the charges , and police have not disclosed a motive in the case .
But associates have said the 51 - year - old suspect was a regular among the anti-abortion protesters that routinely gathered at Tiller 's Wichita clinic .
Ebecher said he lived with Roeder in a Kansas City suburb for almost two years .
He said he and Roeder met through the anti-government Freemen movement in the 1990s and consider themselves part of the " Army of God , " a group that has celebrated the slayings of Tiller and other doctors who provide abortions .
Ebecher said Roeder 's interest in Tiller became intense in the past two years .
But he said that when Roeder once raised the prospect of killing Tiller , he warned him against it .
" He came to me and asked me my advice if he thought it was a good idea to assassinate the doctor , " Ebecher said .
" I told him no . "
Most of the leading U.S. anti-abortion groups have condemned Tiller 's killing and disavowed Roeder , arguing they wanted the Wichita clinic shut down through peaceful means .
But the Army of God 's Web site hailed Roeder as an " American hero , " declaring Tiller is " now in eternal hell fire for shedding the blood of innocent children . "
The site also features tributes to Paul Hill , who was executed in 2003 for killing a doctor and his volunteer escort in Pensacola , Florida ; Eric Rudolph , who set off fatal bombs at the 1996 Olympic games and a Birmingham , Alabama , abortion clinic ; and others who have attacked abortion clinics , doctors or others .
A Kansas judge Thursday set Roeder 's bail at $ 5 million .
In court papers , Roeder stated he had about $ 10 in the bank , made about $ 1,100 a month and listed his 1993 Ford Taurus as his only significant asset .
Relatives said Roeder had suffered from mental illness over the years and had refused treatment at times .
He served prison time in Kansas in the late 1990s after being arrested with explosives in his car , but his conviction was later overturned on appeal .
His ex-wife , Lindsey Roeder , said this week that her ex-husband turned to anti-government activism in the early 1990s after struggling financially , then became involved in the anti-abortion movement .
" That 's not the man I married , " she said .
" It 's the man I divorced . "
Ebecher , who also goes by the name " Wolfgang Anacon , " said he often went with Roeder to anti-abortion rallies , including one at Tiller 's Wichita clinic , which was the scene of regular protests .
" He was a highly religious individual and had very high moral convictions in order to carry out this act , " Ebecher said .
He added , " I feel that Scott had a burden for all the children being murdered , and that he wanted to release the children from that kind of torture in the future . "
Ebecher said that just days before Tiller 's slaying , he got a call from his old roommate that in hindsight sounded like a warning .
" He was going through the events of his life and he was going to miss certain people and things were not going to be available to him anymore , " Ebecher said .
" I should have picked up that something imminent was going to happen , but I did n't . "
A series of unusual spring dust storms has left the snowcapped mountains of western Colorado stained brown and red , even a bit pink .
The dust is speeding up the runoff to rivers that supply millions of people with water and raising fears of an increasingly arid West .
Twelve dust storms barreled into the southern Rockies from the deserts of Arizona , Utah and New Mexico so far this year .
In contrast , four storms hit the mountains all year long in 2003 .
Eight occurred in each of the last three years .
“ This year ’s been really , really strong , ” said Jason Neff , a hydrologist at the University of Colorado - Boulder .
“ Something ’s been going on , and I do n’t think we ’re exactly sure what . ”
The storms leave a dark film on snow that melts it faster by hastening its absorption of the sun ’s energy .
That , coupled with unseasonably warm temperatures , has sped up the runoff here , swelling rivers to near flood stage , threatening to make reservoirs overflow and fueling fears that there will not be enough water left for late - summer crops .

“ It creates a high - pressured game of Twister for water managers , ” said Thomas Painter , director of the Snow Optics Lab at the University of Utah .
“ They ’re having to make decisions quickly to hold on to water or release water . ”
Painter has found that dust can speed up snowmelt by as much as 35 days -- in other words , snow that would normally disappear by May 15 would instead be gone by April 10 .
Ever since European settlement of the West , there has been dust , caused by outside forces breaking the fragile crust that holds undisturbed desert soil in place .
Initially , grazing cattle kicked up the dust .
Scientists say it is now more likely to be caused by off - road vehicles , mountain bikers or energy exploration .
In a study last year , Neff found that the amount of dust in the Rockies is five times greater than before the late 19th century .
“ This is really the story of the wholesale transformation of the West , ” Painter said .

Even without the dust storms , forecasters predict that global warming will reduce the soil quality in the western United States to dust - bowl levels by 2050 , said Jayne Belnap , a scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey .
The Southwest ’s temperatures are expected to rise by 10 degrees Celsius by 2100 .
“ It ’s just a harbinger of the future , ” Belnap said of the dust storms .
“ This is the kind of world we need to imagine we ’re going to be living in and decide if we can afford this dust . ”
Dust and soot are contributing to the disappearance of mountain snows and the disturbance of water supplies all over the world .
The Asian “ brown cloud ” rising from that continent ’s megalopolises is blamed for speeding up the melting of glaciers and snow in the Himalayas .
Dust blown from the plains of eastern Africa is helping destroy the snows of Mt. Kilimanjaro .
In California , the Sierra Nevada snowpack gets some soot from Asia and from the state ’s own smog - emitting centers , but little dust .
State officials have begun to study whether that soot could be contributing to a sped - up snowmelt that , if it continues unabated , could someday overwhelm the reservoir system .

Because winds in the western United States blow from the southwest , dust from the deserts of California , the Great Basin and the Colorado plateau is deposited on the southern Rockies .
The amounts of wind - blown dust in the West peaked in the 1920s , reaching seven times the historic norm .
Scientists think the level of dust dropped after Congress sharply limited cattle grazing in 1934 , near the height of the Dust Bowl .
Today , levels are five times the historic norm .
It is only recently that scientists have begun to study dust ’s effect on snow and water supplies .
Painter and his colleagues only started tracking storms in 2003 .
“ We have n’t thought about dust as a serious environmental issue , ” Neff said .

This year ’s storms put the issue front and center , especially the final three , which swept through southeastern Utah and southwestern Colorado within a few days of one another in late March and early April .
Mountains that usually remain snow - covered until midsummer are already almost bare along the entire western stretch of Colorado .
“ We ’ve seen several days with just incredible obstruction in the air , ” said Steve Vandiver , general manager of the Rio Grande Water Conservation District , 7,500 feet high in the San Luis Valley of southern Colorado .
Now the snowmelt is about 20 days early , and Vandiver ’s system is on the brink of flooding .
He said some farmers and ranchers who rely on streams that normally run all summer long will be without water .
“ This whole system was built around the runoff coming pretty much as the crops came up , ” he said .

The dust left its smear on a number of Colorado ’s storied ski resorts , leading to grousing by some skiers about slushier , dirtier snow .
Jeff Hanley , a spokesman for the Aspen Skiing Co. , said that as long as slopes were being groomed the dust was not a problem .
“ It did n’t affect our operations .
It just looked kind of funny , ” he said .
“ You ’d ski and turn around and look at your tracks and they ’d be red chocolate . ”
He said the industry is not worried -- yet .
“ If it ’s going to be a regular thing for the next few years , that ’s one thing , but we do n’t know that yet . ”

But some scientists note that the West has ended an unusual , 50 - year wet period and is returning to its normal , more arid state .
Belnap , the USGS scientist , said that the sort of activities that kick up dust may not be increasing -- they just may be more damaging because conditions are drier .
“ We ’ve been talking about this for 20 years , but it ’s been wet and we ’ve had a lot of plants ” helping to hold the soil down , Belnap said .
“ It ’s not necessarily that everyone ’s doing more .
You ’ve suddenly got a drier surface . ”

So it seems the best way of finding out about lisp packages is releasing a similar package yourself ;) :
Right on the foot of releasing Deflate , I get to notice Chipz , a similar , but more capable package by Nathan Froyd , the release of which in early 2008 seems to have slipped my notice completely .
So anyone who is interested in RFC 1951 Deflate ( or even BZIP2 decompression ) , please have a look at Chipz as well , which is likely to better fit your needs !

Since CRC - 32 calculations can overshadow deflate performance itself on some implementations , and since inflate.cl does not perform CRC - 32 checksum calculations at all , the columns showing Deflate and Chipz without CRC - 32 calculations might be more indicative of actual deflate performance .
Note that this was all done on a MacBook Air 1.8 GHz Core2 Duo under Mac OS X 10.5.7 , timing was done as an average of 3 runs each .
What can be learned from the results is that 64bit implementations with their bigger fixnum range help quite a bit in performing 32 bit algorithms ( like CRC - 32 ) well even without extensive / effective declaration fine - tuning or special 32 bit arithmetics operators .
British forces were defeated at the Battle of Maiwand in 1880
British military intervention in Afghanistan has a chequered history , making it easy to conclude that British forces will fail again .
But such a conclusion is a mistake and does a disservice both to troops fighting there and to history itself , writes military historian Dr Huw Davies .
General comparisons of Britain 's first three wars in Afghanistan and the current conflict , are difficult and fraught with pitfalls and traps .
However , if one compares the specific experiences of soldiers and officers , there is much to learn from Britain 's history in Afghanistan .

Many know that the British tried three times between 1839 and 1919 to subjugate Afghanistan , and each time they failed .
But when dealing with the history of British military involvement in Afghanistan , and in the difficult business of looking for parallels between then and now , it is necessary to separate the general from the specific .
The reasons for the wars in the 19th Century were somewhat different and incomparable with the reasons for the war now .
If general comparisons of the conflicts are made , without looking at the specifics , it might be easy to conclude that there is little hope for success in Afghanistan .
The First Anglo - Afghan War broke out when Britain invaded Afghanistan because she feared Russian encroachment into Central Asia .
The British were eventually routed and the 16,000 strong army forced to flee Kabul in the winter of 1841 .
Only one man survived the retreat .
Britain invaded Afghanistan again in 1878 for largely the same reasons .
Despite a terrible defeat at Maiwand on 27 July 1880 , the British were surprisingly successful elsewhere on the battlefield .
Unlike today , the Afghans showed an inability to adapt their tactics and the British dominated in several battles .
Yet the British failed to achieve a political settlement and , as they were unable to occupy the country , chose instead to isolate it , while retaining influence in Afghan foreign affairs .

The third war broke out when Afghanistan declared independence from this quasi-British rule in 1919 .
However , for Britain , the Bolshevik Revolution had reduced the Russian threat and , with military spending crippled in the wake of the World War I , interest in Afghanistan gradually waned .
General comparisons , then , suggest that Britain has neither the military capability , nor the political will , to complete or attain victory in a conflict in Afghanistan .
Much has changed since 1919 , though .
The British Army has fought innumerable counter - insurgency campaigns elsewhere , the lessons of which are proving useful now .
Technological advancements have also allowed swifter and more reliable analysis of intelligence , a critical aspect of any counter - insurgency campaign .
The Cultural Dimension
It appears that there is also a renewed focus on the importance of understanding the culture , traditions and customs of the Afghan population .
It is here that the specific experiences of British officers and soldiers in 19th Century Afghanistan can prove useful .
Troops behind fortifications at Kabul during the Second Afghan War During the First Anglo - Afghan War , for example , certain British officers spent much of their time learning about the culture of the local populations .
In doing so , political , economic and social solutions to violent problems were unearthed .
In 1839 , the British military had the difficult task of convincing the Afghan population to accept the new ruler , Shah Shuja , as he was from a different tribe to that of the deposed ruler , Dost Mohammed .
Shah Shuja 's ascension to the throne in Kabul inevitably caused a shift in the balance of power , and those who had enjoyed political power under Dost Mohammed were cast aside and replaced with their rivals .
This in turn caused widespread political disenfranchisement that manifested itself in violent rebellion .
Why , then , did the British fail in Afghanistan in 1841 , and will the same thing happen today ?
Audio - slideshow : Old Afghanistan
The instinctive reaction of the British then , as now , was to meet violence with violence .
But then , as now , commanders quickly recognised that violence was not necessarily the solution .
Instead , the granting of some reasonable demands might buy off the support of those that were politically disenfranchised .
Then , as now , the difficulty for the British lay in identifying and separating those who were die - hard supporters of the rebellion against British authority , from those who simply felt oppressed and whose loyalty could be bought .
Cultural understanding proved critical for the British in reaching these conclusions .
Inevitably , then , as now , there were those whose resistance to and hatred of the West could never be defeated without recourse to violence .
Captured guns are inspected towards the end of the second Afghan war Why , then , did the British fail in Afghanistan in 1841 , and will the same thing happen today ?
In 1841 , those in political charge in Afghanistan and British India did not perceive this " cultural solution " as being worthy of any merit .
Despite the efforts of a minority of officers and soldiers , the preferred British method was retaliatory violence .
For most , the " cold , hard steel of the bayonet " enforced the authority of the British Empire .
Ultimately , this almost indiscriminate use of violence alienated that segment of the population that might otherwise have supported Britain and Shah Shuja .
The difference now is that much more attention is being devoted to understanding the culture of Afghanistan and to finding solutions that do not necessarily involve military action .
Efforts are being made , with some success , to incorporate cultural understanding in all military activities , from fighting to reconstruction .
But with a resurgent Taliban , apparently committed to an extremist vision of Islam and harbouring terrorists , it will also be necessary and unavoidable to use military force .
Awareness of the cultural dimension will not necessarily guarantee victory , but ignorance of it , history shows us , will guarantee defeat .

Opera Software has told the world it will soon " reinvent the web . "
With a cryptic post to its website - at the url www.opera.com/freedom - the Norwegian outfit claims this epic feat will be accomplished in less than four days .
" On June 16th at 9:00 am ( CEDT ) , " the post reads , " we will reinvent the web . "
Opera boast
We asked Opera to explain itself , and it seems the company will reinvent the net with a webcast .
" With 15 years of continuous innovation , Opera will introduce a technology that will forever change the fundamental fabric of the Web , " reads an email from the company .
" Join us at this exclusive video - based press briefing for a glimpse of the future of Web computing and one of Opera 's most significant innovations to date . "
We 'll fill on in on this supposedly net - shattering technology as soon as the cast hits the web - or maybe before , if we can get someone to talk .
In a recent Tweet , Opera browser designer Jon Hicks says the company has managed to shrink the net down to the size of your thumb .
" We 've put the internet on a USB stick , " he writes , " so that you can always have a connection wherever you are ! "
But we 're taking this with a grain of salt .
Opera 's teaser page includes a graphic that would seem to indicate the pending announcement has something to do with the cloud .
But since since the digerati insist on using the moniker to describe almost anything , this is n't very helpful either .
The teaser comes just days after Opera unveiled the first edition of Opera 10 , which includes a server - side technology dubbed Turbo , designed to speed page loads on slow networks .
So we can't expect a new browser on Tuesday .
But the Opera faithful do n't know what to expect .
" The page suggests it 's something about web clouds ... a large update to Link , perhaps ? , " asks one user , referring to an service that lets you sync your browser bookmarks and other data via the web .
" Although that would be great ( settings sync , password sync , cookies sync , rss feeds sync etc ) , it 's hardly ' reinvention . '
" My other idea is that Opera is out of server capacity for Turbo , and wants all Opera users with fast connections to be a part of the global Opera Turbo farm , to compress and push out lofi-web to people with slow connections .
Nah .
P :
Or perhaps MS has given in , and start providing Windows with IE and Opera ... freedom to choose between them ?
Extremely unlikely . "
That , at least , we can be sure of . ®

Blind Amputee Has to Fight AIG for New Plastic Leg , Wheelchair
While execs get bonuses , John Woodson gets " cheapest they could get away with . "
April 16 , 2009  --
An Oklahoma man who lost an eye and a leg in Iraq says the giant insurance company AIG refused to provide him a new plastic leg and fought to keep from paying for a wheelchair or glasses for the eye in which he has 30 percent vision .
" They bought the cheapest thing that they could get away with , " said 51 - year old John Woodson , a truck driver for the KBR contracting firm who lost his leg when his truck hit a roadside bomb in Iraq .
" Everything 's been a struggle , a constant fight , " said Woodson , injured in Oct. 2004 .
" It 's been hell since . "
Watch 20 /20 Friday at 10 pm E.T. to see this joint investigation involving the Los Angeles Times and Pro Publica , a non-profit investigative group .
Woodson is covered by AIG under a government - mandated program that provides medical and disability benefits for employees working for U.S. contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan .
AIG covers about 90 percent of the claims for overseas workers .
Still in constant pain , Woodson says he was infuriated to see AIG executives receive huge bonuses , travel on private jets and be pampered at a California spa .
" They 're getting their bonuses but they fight you , they 'll constantly fight in order to try to get you to give up , " said Woodson , of Poteau , Oklahoma .
Woodson is one of a number of injured contractors whose alleged difficulties with AIG were examined in the joint investigation .
AIG said it could not discuss any specific case , but that it strives to provide " quality " care .
" We think we 're helping the military with our insurance program , " said AIG executive John Russo .
In Woodson 's case , when his fuel truck hit the hidden bomb outside Baghdad , he was blown through the roof of his cab and thrown about a hundred feet away , also damaging his back and breaking his pelvis .
Woodson says he was told by an AIG representative in the hospital that he would be fully covered by AIG , but that when he returned home , he quickly discovered AIG was prepared to challenge almost all of his medical needs .
AIG Refused to Buy Him a New Leg , Woodson Says
" I 've had to argue for everything , you constantly stay on the phone , writing letters , e-mailing , trying to get things to happen , " Woodson said .
To cushion the impact on his injured back and pelvis , Woodsen asked AIG for a new plastic leg with a spring in the foot .
" It was just so painful just to walk , " Woodson said .
He says AIG refused to buy him a new leg , which he says would have cost about $ 8,000 .
AIG also refused , he said , to provide him a water - proof leg so he could remain standing and take a shower .
U.S. military amputees are normally provided three different legs , to cover a full range of walking , showering and exercising .
In the end , Woodson says he thinks it was pressure from his lawyer and Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) that forced AIG to finally provide an improved leg , with replacement parts , but not a new one as his doctor had ordered .
Woodson 's lawyer , Toby Cole , says he sees a pattern of AIG " delaying and denying " claims from contractors injured in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" It 's difficult for me to think it 's anything but a concentrated effort just to ignore these guys , " said Cole .
In its statement , AIG says the " vast majority " of claims are " paid without dispute when the proper supporting medical evidence has been received . "
More than 30,000 contractors have filed claims for injuries suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan .
More than 1,400 have died .

Last month , Iran broke an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) to stop attacks on villages in the Pshdar district , according to a fresh report coming out of Iraq .
The Iranians shelled homes in Razga , killing an 18 - month - old boy named Mohammed Ahmed and injuring three others .
The Mayor of Qaladze said , “ I was with the family until they buried the child . ”
Christian Peacemaker Teams ( CPT ) , an international NGO which works for justice and peace and intervenes in war zones , visited the family .
The attack injured Ali Hamed Ahmed , the father of young Mohammed , in his head , back and leg making him unable to walk .
A mortar shell hit the roof of the family ’s home while they slept at 9 pm .
Four rockets landed inside the village within the same hour .
All families are reported to have fled on foot to the neighbouring villages of Tutma , which is an hour and a half away , and Cuzina , which is three hours away .
Families returned to Razga when local media announced that it was safe .
“ Other families returned as well , ” said Ali Hamed Ahmed .
Iraqi Kurdish parliament member Zrar Khalel told CPT : “ There was an agreement with the KRG and Iran broke it .
It is up to the KRG to confront them . ”
Christian Peacemaker
Teams in the region learned in a United Nations security briefing that the KRG has asked Iran why it broke the agreement .
Iran answered that it was targeting PJAK militants .
Ali Hamed Ahmed ’s uncle drove to the scene of the attack in Razga to rescue the family and took them to a hospital in Qaladze , where records confirm their treatment .
They are now staying at a relative ’s house , as are so many of the displaced families in the Pshdar district .
It will be unsustainable for them to stay long , say observers .
There are 50 families living in Razga .
“ We are all separated and homeless , ” says Ali Hamed Ahmed .
“ I sold my few animals at a low price . ”
Many displaced families sold their animals at the same time , he explains .
“ The price rose again .
They will be too expensive to replace . ”
The latest reports from Christian Peacemaker Teams in the Middle East and elsewhere are available from http://www.cpt.org/
On April 4 2007 , Curtis Melvin — a PhD student at George Mason University — decided to start the " North Korea Uncovered " project .
Two years later it became the definitive reference for the country 's secrets , thanks to an army of amateur spies .

Curtis describes the project like this :
This Google Earth project offers an extensive mapping of North Korea 's economic , cultural , political , and military infrastructures .
Through the topic menu , users of this program have easy access to geographical information on North Korea 's agriculture projects , aviation facilities , communications , hospitals , hotels , energy infrastructure , financial services , leisure destinations , manufacturing facilities , markets , mines , religious locations , restaurants , schools , and transportation infrastructure .
In addition to locations of economic interest , this map also displays anti-aircraft locations , the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) and Northern Line Limit Line ( NLL ) , incarceration facilities , political monuments , political residencies , military bases , and nuclear facilities .

As you can see , it really includes everything you can think about , from nuclear power plants to military communication towers to ostrich farms to not - secret - anymore prison camps .
And of course , all surrounded by all kind of crap and poverty , all courtesy of Kim Jong - il , one of the biggest asses in the history of evil dictators .
How did Curtis get all this info ?
Easy — and risky : Using his own trips and a network of curious amateur spies who have been visiting the country through these two years .
Truly impressive work .

Will Oracle be good to Java 's developers ?
That 's the question on everyone 's mind at this year 's JavaOne developer conference , the last show before Oracle 's planned US $ 7.4 billion buyout of Java 's creator , Sun Microsystems .
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison made a surprise appearance at the show 's opening keynote Tuesday and tried to assuage developer concerns .
While he implied that there would be some changes , he said , essentially , that it will be business as usual for Java when the acquisition is concluded .
But Oracle is no Sun .
Sun has long struggled to keep its diverse community of developers happy , creating a burdensome bureaucracy to manage the development of Java standards and gradually releasing key components of the platform under an open - source license .
While Sun has made some money from Java licenses , it has missed out on big opportunities to sell lucrative Java development tools and middleware servers .
Sun remains , at its heart , a hardware company ; Oracle sells software .
To some extent , Sun 's failure to cash in on Java has helped it remain a neutral steward of the technology , but that dynamic will change under Oracle .
At JavaOne this week , one Sun employee summed up the difference between the two companies , saying an Oracle staffer had told him recently , " We 're not a nonprofit company like you guys . "
Developers at the show are chiefly concerned with three things : Will Oracle keep Java open ?
Will it use its control over Java to favor its own products ?
And , finally , which Java technologies will be killed off after the merger ?
Using its control over Java to favor Oracle 's own products would drive developers away from the platform , show attendees said .
" The worst - case scenario would be if Oracle did some tight integration , " said Kevin Hooke , a Java developer with a large technology consulting firm .
Similarly , rolling the annual JavaOne conference into Oracle 's Open World event -- a plan rumored to be in the works , according to show attendees -- would hurt the Java development community , which has pushed for independence from Sun ever since Java 's inception .
" If you fold JavaOne into an Oracle - only conference , you 're going to harm the foundation of Java , " Hooke said .
Publicly Sun executives are forging ahead as if the Oracle merger were n't happening .
Aside from Ellison 's brief appearance , Sun executives either made no mention of the acquisition or declined to comment on the issue at the show .
Sun has acknowledged , however , that it can't say for sure whether Oracle will continue to develop things like its cloud computing services if the acquisition goes through .
JavaOne attendees were particularly worried about whether Oracle would continue to support Sun's GlassFish , OpenJDK and JavaFX products .
Oracle already sells two application servers , the WebLogic and Oracle Application Servers , so it may see no need to support the open - source Glass Fish .
OpenJDK is another open - source product , a version of the core desktop Java SE platform , released under the GNU General Public license .
It remains to be seen whether Oracle will nurture the Java community as Sun has done , or shift much of Java 's development in - house , said Jarec Basham , software and systems development manager at Infoterra , a U.K. company that provides satellite imagery and geospatial data to a variety of industries .
" I think it depends how Oracle sees the revenue growing .
They seem like more of a ' spreadsheet - driven ' company , " he said .
Although Oracle may not have much experience in the desktop software business , Ellison did make a point of mentioning JavaFX -- a Java - based alternative to Microsoft 's Silverlight and Adobe AIR -- during his JavaOne appearance .
" We 'd like to see accelerated development based on this exciting new platform Java with FX , " he said .
An analyst at the show agreed that Oracle would likely keep FX alive .
" Given that Oracle has all of these applications that will need flashy front ends , I do n't think it 's impossible that Oracle will actually invest in JavaFX so that they have the whole stack , " said James Governor , an analyst with RedMonk .
" Oracle does n't want to be beholden to Silverlight … it also does n't really want to be beholden to Adobe . "
Attendees -- especially those who used Sun's Solaris operating system -- expressed relief that Sun 's initial suitor , IBM , did n't succeed .
Because IBM 's product line is so similar to Sun's , that would have meant a lot more dropped projects , and a lot more pain for Sun users who would be forced to migrate their software .
Under Oracle , developer community relations probably wo n't be as good as they were with Sun , said Surya Pasula , a Java architect with Kaiser Permanente .
But while there may still be questions about Java 's future , he said the Oracle buyout is " better than IBM . "
Murali Gundu , lead software engineer with Comcast 's StreamSage division , which develops video search services for Comcast customers , said he was " extremely happy about Oracle , " because it has so much expertise in databases and data retrieval and can build an optimized stack down through the OS and the servers .
There would have been too much overlap and redundancy with IBM , he said .
" If it had been IBM that acquired Sun I would have had much more doubt , " he said .
With Oracle , " I am more confident that Java will stay forever . "
The most straightforward comment on the acquisition came from Ellison after Sun Chairman Scott McNealy asked him if this would be the last JavaOne and if Oracle planned to " close the technology up . "
Ellison 's reply : " Sun has done a fantastic job inventing Java , expanding Java , opening up Java , giving Java to the world , and we 're going to do more of the same .
I do n't expect a lot of changes , just an expanded investment and a lot of enthusiasm coming from Oracle . "
Oracle 's CEO did n't answer McNealy 's question about whether JavaOne would be back next year .

Internetsperren : Erst das Gesetz , dann der Protest
Der Bundestag wird am Donnerstag die Netzsperren beschließen .
Die von 130.000 Kritikern eingereichte Petition berät das Parlament dagegen erst nach der Wahl .
BERLIN taz | Mehr als 130.000 besorgte Bürger haben jetzt die Online - Petition gegen Internet - Sperren unterzeichnet .
Damit ist sie inzwischen die größte Online - Petition aller Zeiten .
Ihr Ziel wird sie aber verfehlen .
Am Montagabend einigten sich die Koalitionsexperten in allen noch offenen Punkten .
Einer Verabschiedung des Gesetzes am Donnerstag steht damit nichts mehr im Wege .
Die umstrittene Regelung sieht vor , dass Internetfirmen künftig den Zugang zu ausländischen Kinderporno - Seiten erschweren müssen .
Das Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) soll täglich eine Liste der zu sperrenden Seiten zusammenstellen .
Wer als Internet - Surfer in Deutschland versucht , eine gesperrte Seite aufzurufen , wird zu einer erläuternden Stoppseite weitergeleitet .
Die im AK Zensur zusammengeschlossenen Gegner der Internetsperren kritisierten umgehend : " Damit ist die Büchse der Pandora geöffnet . "
Es werde eine " Internet - Zensur - Infrastruktur " aufgebaut , die für beliebige Inhalte genutzt werden kann .
In zwei Punkten konnte sich SPD - Unterhändler Martin Dörmann zuletzt noch durchsetzen .
Die Internetsperren werden nicht im Telemediengesetz geregelt , sondern in einem eigenen " Zugangserschwerungsgesetz " .
Das soll eine Ausweitung auf andere Themen als Kinderpornografie psychologisch hemmen .
Außerdem wird das Gesetz auf drei Jahre befristet und müsste dann vom Bundestag neu beschlossen werden .
Schon vorige Woche war ein Verbot eingefügt worden , die IP - Adressen von Surfern , die auf Stoppseiten landen , für die Strafverfolgung zu nutzen .
Außerdem will die Koalition ein unabhängiges Kontrollgremium einrichten , das laufend überprüft , ob wirklich nur Kinderporno - Seiten auf der Sperrliste landen .
Die fünf Experten des Kontrollgremiums müssen laut Gesetzentwurf vom Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragten Peter Schaar berufen werden - obwohl dieser gestern in der taz protestierte : " Ich kenne mich in der Thematik doch gar nicht aus . "
Der Abgeordnete Dörmann hielt trocken dagegen : " Die Aufgaben des Datenschutzbeauftragten werden vom Gesetzgeber festgelegt . "
Außerdem verstehe er die Kritik auch gar nicht .
" Das Kontrollgremium dient dem Schutz der Informationsfreiheit , und das ist eine zentrale Zuständigkeit von Herrn Schaar . "
Ein Sprecher des Datenschutzbeauftragten versicherte inzwischen , dass man gesetzliche Pflichten selbstverständlich erfüllen werde .
Wenn das Gesetz im Bundestag beschlossen ist , wird es am 10 .
Juli im Bundesrat beraten .
Es ist nicht zustimmungspflichtig .
Auch mit einem zeitraubenden Einspruch wird nicht gerechnet , da die meisten Kritikpunkte der Länderkammer inzwischen aufgenommen wurden .
Der AK Zensur hat ein für Mittwoch geplantes Gespräch mit der SPD aus Enttäuschung abgesagt .
Der Blogger Felix von Leitner erklärte die SPD zu " Verrätern " .
SPD - Medienexperte Dörmann dankte der Internet - Community trotzdem : " Ohne deren Druck hätten wir unsere rechtsstaatliche Linie in den Verhandlungen mit der Union nicht durchsetzen können . "
CDU - Verhandlungsführerin Martina Krogmann sah sich nicht als Gegnerin von Dörmann : " Das Parlament hat den Regierungsentwurf in fast allen Punkten nachgebessert . "
Und was passiert nun mit der Massenpetition gegen Internetsperren ?
" Die geht jetzt den normalen Geschäftsgang " , sagte am Dienstag ein Mitarbeiter des Petitionsausschusses zur taz .
Erst gebe das zuständige Wirtschaftsministerium eine Stellungnahme ab , dann berate der Ausschuss , die Initiatorin der Petition , Franziska Heine , werde eingeladen - vermutlich aber erst nach der Bundestagswahl .

US President Barack Obama has warned that a nuclear - armed North Korea poses a " grave threat " to the world .
At a news conference with South Korean President Lee Myung - bak , Mr Obama said the US would " vigorously " pursue an end to the country 's nuclear programme .
North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test on 25 May , before test firing a number of short - range rockets .
" Under no circumstance are we going to allow North Korea to possess nuclear weapons , " said Mr Lee .
' Break the pattern '
Mr Obama said that he and his South Korean counterpart had agreed that a new UN resolution designed to halt North Korea 's nuclear ambitions should be fully enforced .
And he pledged to end a cycle of letting North Korea create a crisis in order to be rewarded with concessions from the international community .
" This is a pattern they 've come to expect , " Mr Obama said .
" We are going to break that pattern . "
Mr Lee was in Washington for talks with the US president .
The two men also discussed a free trade deal signed by the US and South Korea two years ago .
During last year 's presidential election campaign , Mr Obama criticised the agreement , saying its terms were too favourable to South Korea .
In their meeting in Washington , the leaders agreed to initiate working - level talks to resolve their differences .

If you want to get to grips with the scale of the challenge facing the newspaper industry , consider this slightly amazing piece that was published in Advertising Age a couple of days ago .
It describes at some length and in jolly detail ( as do the various links from it , which are also worth following ) the ways in which those massive cyber success stories YouTube and Twitter are believed to be losing money hand over fist , currently surviving only on the largesse of venture capitalists and Google ( which recently bought YouTube despite it being loss - making ) .
Zillions of hits every day , the confidence of their users and unrivalled niches on the internet have apparently failed so far to create the conditions for monetisation ( the dread word ) .
That ’s what newspapers are up against .
It ’s a cultural problem .
YouTube is indispensible for viral marketers , the music industry and people who love videos of cute fluffy creatures being tickled .
Yet there are very few adverts on it – not even the bog standard Google ones , which is really quite hard to understand .
Surely if people are prepared to put up with ads on Facebook they would n’t mind on YouTube , especially if it were a “ use it or lose it ” situation .
Full story here .

Hyper-Deflation on the Streets of Paris
Scarcely a block from our office in Paris is a monetary phenomenon that has escaped the financial press .
In one of the highest - cost economies in the world , you can buy a woman ’s shirt for 2 euros .
A dress ?
Four euros .
A man ’s jacket can be had for the price of a cup of coffee .
The shop is tended by Chinese merchants … apparently dodging France ’s employment laws by only hiring family members .
The merchandise , too , dodges high rents by squatting the sidewalk , under improvised blue awnings .
How come such cheap duds in such a dear city ?
The latest figures show negative consumer price inflation in 14 countries .
In Ireland prices are collapsing at a 4.7 % rate .
In the United States , they are falling at 1.3 % annually – their biggest drop in 59 years .
In Britain , consumer price inflation is still positive … but falling .
But clothing on the Boulevard de la Villette seems to have been thrown out of an airplane .
It is not in deflation ; it is in hyper - deflation .
What could cause it ?
A guess : excess capacity , inspired by excesses of credit , consumption and claptrap during the Bubble Epoque .
Spurred by what seemed like insatiable demand from the United States and Britain , Asians built superfluous factories … Greeks bought superfluous ships … and Americans built superfluous malls .
Now , the feet are in the other shoes – the cheap ones .
The action of the bubble years produces an equal and opposite reaction : excess supply bedevils the market .
Unable to sell superfluous brand name clothing , the rag trade strips off the alligators and polo sticks and dumps clothes on discount racks .
Last week , we warned about the extremely destabilizing effects of hyperinflation .
One day middle class men are saving money for their daughters ’ dowries .
The next , they are putting knives between their teeth and swimming across the Rhine .
Today , we deny hyperinflation thrice before the cock crows … and then deny we denied it .
First , Professor Alan Blinder in The New York Times : “ the clear and present danger , both now and for the next year or two , is not inflation but deflation . ”
Second , BusinessWeek elaborates :
“ … the inflationary effects of the new money are being fully offset , or more than offset , by the far - reaching and long - lasting impact of household debt repayments .
Whether it ’s voluntary frugality or under the coercion of creditors , Americans have abruptly switched from living beyond their means to saving more and working down the debts they incurred during the bubble years . ”
Third , as Ambrose Evans Pritchard puts it in the Telegraph : “ the Fed ’s efforts to boost the money supply are barely keeping pace with the deflation shock .
Stimulus is not gaining traction .
The credit system is broken . ”
Professor Blinder explains why :
“ In normal times , banks do n’t want excess reserves , which yield them no profit .
So they quickly lend out any idle funds they receive .
Under such conditions ,
Fed expansions of bank reserves lead to expansions of credit and the money supply and , if there is too much of that , to higher inflation .
In abnormal times like these , however , providing frightened banks with the reserves they demand will fuel neither money nor credit growth – and is therefore not inflationary . ”
Reserves are what nobody wanted in the bubble years ; now we live in a world of squirrels .
Bankers add to their reserves ; so do individuals and businesses .
Americans saved an average of 7 % of disposable income since the ’30s .
In the 2002 - 2007 bubble , that rate fell to zero .
Now , it ’s back to nearly 5 % and rising .
Thrift is making a comeback .
People are changing their own automobile oil .
They are cutting their own hair and planting their own gardens .
When consumers cease consuming , producers cease producing .
And shippers have nothing to ship .
World trade has collapsed by more than it did at this stage of the Great Depression .
And at 65 % of capacity , there are more idle factories in America than at any time since they stopped making tanks and airplanes after WWII .
Business earnings are falling , with no pricing power in sight .
In this respect , this downturn is much more deflationary than Japan ’s recession of the ’90s .
When Japan went into a slump , the rest of the world continued to grow .
Japan could continue to manufacture and export products – at a profit .
Still , with so much excess capacity , producer prices in Japan fell in nine of 10 years in the ’90s .
And now the denial :
These commentators are right ; deflation is the immediate problem .
Our guess is that it will be deeper and more vexing than even they believe .
The feds ’ money machine is broken .
They can add reserves .
But they ca n’t turn the reserves into price inflation at the consumer level .
Result : deflation … maybe hyper-deflation .
But far from eliminating the danger of hyperinflation , falling prices practically guarantees it .
In other words , it ’s not inflation we worry about ; it ’s the lack of it .
Unable to stimulate inflation in the usual way , the feds are forced to resort to extraordinary measures .
Only central banks with their backs against the wall – like Germany in the ’ 20 s … Argentina in the ’ 80s … and Zimbabwe in the ’00s … would dare to risk hyperinflation .
But if its efforts to produce mild inflation do n’t work , the United States will eventually be in the same desperate position .
Enjoy your weekend ,

As noted in its announcement , ' Project Expose MSM ' invites all members of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition ( NSWBC ) , other active ( covert or overt ) government whistleblowers , and reporters , to publish their experiences in regard to their own first - hand dealings with the media , where their legit disclosures were either intentionally censored / blacked out , tainted , or otherwise met with a betrayal of trust .
The first report , exposing Michael Isikoff and Newsweek was posted here .
This second project report is based on the first - hand documented experience of Mr. Sandalio Gonzalez , retired Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) Special Agent in Charge .
Time Magazine reporters Tim Burger and Tim Padgett had an opportunity to speak at length with Mr. Gonzalez and several other veteran DEA agents with direct knowledge of a major corruption case involving several DEA agents on drug traffickers ' payrolls in Colombia .
The involved corrupt US officers were also directly involved in helping Colombia 's paramilitary death squads launder drug proceeds .
Further presented at the meeting with Time 's reporter was the documented cover up of this major scandal by the DEA and Dept. of Justice Inspector General ( OIG ) offices .
Despite direct corroboration by a number of other sources , including several veteran DEA agents and other government officials with first - hand knowledge of the case ; documented evidence disclosed and provided ; and despite being given an ' exclusive ' to the story as insisted on by the magazine , Time never published the story , and no reasons were ever provided ...
Name , title , and / or background :
Name : Sandalio Gonzalez
Title : Special Agent in Charge ( Ret. ) , DEA
Background : Mr. Gonzalez retired from the DEA as Special Agent in Charge of the El Paso , Texas Field Division in January 2005 after 32 years in law enforcement .
He began his career in 1972 at the local level in Los Angeles , California and joined the DEA in 1978 .
For more detailed background information see here .
Name of Publication and / or Editor and / or Reporter :
Publication : Time Magazine
Reporters : Tim Padgett & Tim Burger
Editor : Unknown
Method :
Complete blackout .
No reason provided .
The disclosure was supported and corroborated by three other highly credible veteran DEA agents , officials , and documents .
Description of Disclosure and Significance :
By Sandalio Gonzalez
In late fall of 2005 , Time Magazine 's DC Office was provided with detailed information and documents regarding a major story involving the DEA .
The story had not been broken publicly before , and several publishers were competing to get what they referred to as an ' Exclusive Scoop ' , since they had been briefed generally and shown sample documents .
Time Magazine seemed anxious to see and hear it all , and we were told they 'd run it ' big time ' if they were given documents , provided with access to witnesses , and all this ' exclusively . '
Well , Time Magazine was in fact given everything they asked for ; exclusively .
After Time 's DC office reporter Tim Burger received the initial / sample documents and statements ( with NSWBC acting as coordinator and third party ) , they sat on the story for more than a month .
Later we were told that the story was transferred to their Miami Office .
After follow ups and pressure by NSWBC on the status of this ' exclusive story ' with Time , one last meeting was set up with Tim Padgett , Time 's Miami bureau reporter .
The meeting with the Time reporter in Miami was attended by several other current and former DEA agents as sources and witnesses .
Some of these witnesses had to travel to attend the meeting and provide the Time reporter with their reports .
The three agents disclosed their account and documented information involving the never - public - before scandal and the subsequent cover up by the US government .
Sibel Edmonds , Director and Founder of NSWBC , and Professor William Weaver , Senior Advisor for NSWBC , had also flown to Miami to attend and monitor the interview .
The center of the report dealt with ' never - before - public ' documents and first hand witness statements , the Kent Memo [ PDF ] , and related subjects and information .
This case and its facts , statements , and documents , given to Time Magazine before and during that meeting , involved one of the most serious allegations ever brought against DEA officers .
On Dec. 19 , 2004 , Thomas M. Kent , an attorney in the wiretap unit of the Justice Department 's Narcotics & Dangerous Drugs Section ( NDDS ) , submitted his memo [ PDF ] to his section chief Jody Avergun , who would soon thereafter leave the DOJ to become the Executive Assistant to DEA Administrator Karen Tandy , with full knowledge of the reported corruption and cover up , and did nothing to correct it .
The copies of this memo were forwarded to several high - level officials within DOJ and DEA .
In his memo , Mr. Kent reported several corruption allegations involving the DEA 's office in Bogotá , Columbia .
The allegations in the memo were supported by several credible DEA agents in Florida with impeccable records .
These agents - witnesses - were muzzled and retaliated against after they attempted to expose the corruption .
Based on Mr. Kent 's report , supported by other DEA agents , the DEA 's Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) and DOJ's Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) covered up the report and the corruption charges and sabotaged investigations by the Florida DEA office .
Here are the major points covered by Mr. Kent in the memo :
Several DEA agents in Colombia are in fact on drug traffickers ' payrolls .
Some of these corrupt US officers are directly involved in helping Colombia 's paramilitary death squads launder drug proceeds .
The implicated agents have been protected by " watchdog " agencies within the Justice Department .
Here is an excerpt from Mr. Kent 's Memo :
" As discussed in my ( prior ) memorandum dated December 13 , 2004 , several unrelated investigations , including Operation Snowplow , identified corrupt agents within DEA .
As further discussed in my memorandum , OPR 's handling of the investigations into those allegations has come into question and the OIG investigator who was actively looking into the allegations has been removed from the investigation . "
And here is another regarding other agents and witnesses who had come forward :
" As promised , I am providing you with further information on the allegations and evidence that is already in files at OPR and OIG .
Agents I know were able to vouch for my credibility and several individuals close to the prior investigations that uncovered corruption agreed to speak with me …
Having been failed by so many before and facing tremendous risks to their careers and their safety and the safety of their families , they were understandably hesitant to reveal the information I requested , including the names of those directly involved in criminal activity in Bogotá and the United States .
They agreed to reveal the names to me on the condition that I not further disseminate these for the time being .
They are prepared to provide the Public Integrity Section with those names and everything in the files at OPR and OIG , and then some , if called upon to do so " .
According to the report , one of the corrupt agents from Bogotá was actually caught on a wiretap in 2004 while he was discussing criminal activity related to the paramilitary group called the United Self - Defense Forces of Colombia ( AUC ) .
The group is known to be involved in narco - trafficking and arms dealing at the highest levels , and has been involved in death squads responsible for murdering thousands of Colombians .
Kent reports that during the wiretap , this DEA agent discusses his involvement in laundering money for the AUC .
However , despite being caught on tape the agent faced no reprimand .
Just the opposite , according to Kent , the agent was promoted : " That call has been documented by the DEA and that agent is now in charge of numerous narcotics and money laundering investigations . "
The memo also alleged that DOJ officials shut down a money laundering investigation because they knew it was connected to the DEA corruption case in Bogotá :
" In June 2004 , OPR and DEA , the two agencies embarrassed by the prior allegations ( involving the Bogotá agents ) and likely to come under tremendous scrutiny for their own actions in response , demanded that my case agent turn all of the ( investigation ) information ... over to OPR , " Kent states in the memorandum .
" One week after submitting the ( information ) to OPR , the money laundering investigation was shut down . "
In addition to the facts included in Kent 's reports , Time Magazine was also provided with corroborated reports on related cases , including a case of major leaks from the US Embassy in Bogotá that contained extremely sensitive intelligence .
That meeting gave Time Magazine one last chance , and the benefit of the doubt , to live up to its word given to us previously ; to expose this major case and even more serious cover up by the Justice Department 's IG .
We made it clear that after waiting for Time Magazine for months they had to give us a response within a day or two as to whether they were running the story , and if so when .
The reporter , Tim Padgett , did seem genuinely interested , and made it clear that he had to persuade the editors and magazine management .
He appeared to have his reservations as to the magazine 's willingness and or courage to ' touch ' a story of this magnitude .
We never heard back from him , or Tim Burger , or anyone else from the magazine .
Time Magazine never delivered the ' exclusive scoop ' given to them , all packaged with credible DEA witnesses and envelopes containing official documents .
In fact , the MSM has never thoroughly covered this story .
The only coverage of Kent Memo was given by web - based publisher , Narco News .
Response by Tim Padgett , reporter , Time Magazine , Miami Office :
Mr. Padgett was contacted twice via e-mail , and replied as follows after the second request :
For the record , I had no reservations about Time Magazine 's " willingness
and or courage to ' touch ' a story of this magnitude . "
Time regularly takes on controversial stories ; we simply decided in the end , after examining the material at hand , not to pursue this one .

Reponse by Tim Burger , reporter , Time Magazine , DC Bureau :
Despite several requests for response , Mr. Burger did not reply .
Response by Time Magazine :
Despite several requests for response , Time Magazine editor(s ) did not reply .
Statement from Professor William Weaver , Senior Advisor , NSWBC :
This disheartening episode is , unfortunately , very familiar , and the story of DEA corruption and entanglement with Colombian drug cartels appears to have been ignored after initial interest for a variety of reasons .
First , it is not easily digestible and therefore runs afoul of editors ' and reporters ' prejudice toward stories that may be quickly and simply related to the public .
Emphasis on simplicity instead of on what the public should know about cuts down on research and reporter time , which are expensive , and feeds into the common belief that the public is largely incapable of understanding , or uninterested in , complicated stories .
Second , running such a story may anger sources of information from government that reporters have come to rely upon .
As great as any one story may be , a reporter 's career in these areas often depends on keeping friendly relations with cultivated sources .
Ultimately , sometimes these sources end up dictating what shall and shall not be published .
Finally , a story must make it past editors and staff who have interests that conflict with the goal of getting important news to the public .
Considerations of effects on advertisers , sources of information , how shareholders and management will view decisions to publish particular stories , and other matters unrelated to " newsworthiness " affect a potential story 's fate .
We need only look to The New York Times ' decision to delay reporting the existence of the probably unconstitutional Terrorist Surveillance Program ( TSP ) for an example of how forces inside MSM may outflank the newsworthy nature of a story .
The story concerning the Bush Administration TSP was set to break just before the presidential election in 2004 , but apparent appeals by Bush Administration officials and President Bush himself to The New York Times delayed publication until December 2005 .
And the story only came to light because of a whistleblower and the fact that the matter appeared destined to emerge in other forums .
The refusal of The New York Times to publish the story in 2004 very possibly is the only reason that Bush prevailed over John Kerry .
Time Magazine 's failure to investigate the events outlined in the Kent Memo and by veteran , decorated DEA agents concerning wide - ranging government corruption is another abysmal example of how the public is ill - served by the MSM .

Unlike many things beyond some of my own writing ( hey – you ’ve got to like your own stuff , right ? ) , this actually made me laugh out loud when I saw it …
It ’s a segment from BBC TV’s Charlie Brooker ’s " Newswipe " show – which looks at the inner workings of the news media .
And , much to his international audience ’s likely surprise , Brooker has discovered the extremes of some of the US ’s most notable news sources .
MSNBC ( and my man , Keith O. ) gets a little drive - by mention … but the main target of Brooker ’s delightful mocking is FOX News and its troika - of - morons , Billo , the Manatee , and Ever - Cryin ’ Beck .
Residents of Somerville 's Nunnery Grounds neighborhood have long tolerated concrete vistas of Interstate 93 and Mystic Avenue , honking cars , and black grime on their windowsills .
Now , they are increasingly worried about an invisible highway nuisance : the tiniest pieces of pollution emitted by passing traffic .
Community members in Somerville , as well as Boston 's Chinatown , have joined with Tufts University researchers to determine whether microscopic " ultrafine particles " spewed by combustion engines are harming the health of people who live close to highways .
In a study that is the first of its kind in the state and among the first in the nation , the scientists will measure these tiny pollutants in various locations and collect and map heart disease data from residents .
For decades , researchers have studied the dangers of coarse particles emitted by power plants and vehicles , which can aggravate asthma and other health problems and are regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency .
Ultrafine particles are less understood and not subject to direct government limits , even though many scientists believe they could be even more harmful .
" Since we see associations with asthma and cardiovascular disease with people living near highways , you have to ask what 's causing that , " said Doug Brugge , director of the Tufts Community Research Center and the scientist leading the study , which will begin this summer .
" There is a lot of smoke suggesting that there is a fire . "
Researchers suspect the health risk from ultrafine particles is greatest downwind and within 300 feet of busy highways .
Farther away , the particles tend to dissipate or collide with other particles to become larger .
The particles , each thousands of times smaller in diameter than a human hair , are easy to breathe in , and they readily spread throughout people 's circulatory systems and enter their brains .
On their surfaces , they can carry toxic chemicals and metals .
Eric Barry , whose house in east Somerville overlooks I - 93 , said he grew concerned recently after he read articles about the health risks of living close to the highway .
He has had asthma since he was a child and worries that the pollution could exacerbate it .
" This house is what we could afford , " he said .
" If I could live farther away , I would . "
Last year , Brugge and colleagues found high levels of ultrafine particles in some Somerville neighborhoods near I -93 and Mystic Avenue , and deaths from heart and lung disease are more common in Somerville than they are on average in the state .
But this does not prove that highway pollution is the culprit .
People 's genetic predisposition to disease , their habits , and their exposures to other environmental harms may be to blame .

GOP is addicted to the negativity that is killing its candidates
Republicans bitterly oppose the public insurance option , saying it would undermine the private insurance industry and lead to a national health insurance system .
Some conservative Democrats also are skeptical of the public plan option , even as they and Baucus support Obama ’s overall reform goals .
37 percent of the general population and 42 percent of Hispanics said they 'd feel less favorably toward the Republican Party if Senate Republicans " overwhelmingly oppose " Sotomayor , 54 , a Latina federal appellate judge from New York .
Hard as it is to believe , the political right is looking uglier ( right - wing domestic terrorists ) and uglier ( rooting for Iranian nutcase Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ) .
One of the Republican sociopaths is even screeching today in the party newspaper that Obama should cancel the minimum wage hike , long a GOP bugaboo .
They love CEOs getting big bonuses but hate it when working families can afford to eat .
And , of course , the entire Republican Senate caucus is opposing health care reform , the single most important issue facing American families today .
Senate Republicans under pressure are Charles Grassley ( IA ) the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee who has publicly denounced a government - run insurance plan ( while taking over $ 2 million in so - called " donations " from the Medical - Industrial Complex and Big Insurance ) , Olympia Snowe ( ME ) the only Republican who withheld her name from a recent GOP letter blistering Obama ’s support for the public plan , Pat Roberts ( KS ) , a die - hard obstructionist , and Mike Enzi ( WY ) , a Finance Committee member and the ranking Republican on the Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee who has signaled the potential for a deal despite his recent sharp criticism of the Democrats ’ handling of the legislation .
Also getting pressured are Susan Collins [ ME ] , Mike Crapo [ ID ] , Orrin Hatch [ UT ] , Lisa Murkowski [ AK ] and Lamar Alexander [ TN ] , who has taken immense sums -- over $ 2.5 million -- from Big Insurance and the Medical - Industrial Complex .
Meanwhile the Republican Senate Whip , John Kyl , is still putting his energy into attacking Sonia Sotomayor .
Yesterday he " refused to rule out using procedural tactics to stall the confirmation . "
And KKK supporter Jeff Sessions ( R - AL ) , the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee , specifically chose last month to obstruct the confirmation , " is unlikely to make any decision about trying to slow down the nomination for the next several weeks . "
Interestingly , all this Republican plotting and obstruction comes right on the heels of a new poll showing that many Americans , especially Hispanics , are building up huge resentments against the Republican Party for this kind of behavior .
Even after weeks of vile , racist attacks by GOP spokespersons from Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly to Jim DeMint , Michael Steele and Mitt Romney , only 21 % of Americans say they 're not certain whether or not she should be confirmed .
And the poll reveals a real danger for the GOP if they persist in their negative strategy :
The consistent attacks on Judge Sotomayor are likely to cause the Republicans serious damage in states where they had hoped to make inroads among Hispanics : Texas , Florida , North Carolina , Arizona , New Mexico , Nevada , Colorado and New Jersey , each of which has important electoral races coming up next year the GOP is starting to realize they may be blowing .
Labels : Hispanic voters , obstructionist Republicans , Sonia Sotomayor
The ability to learn and to establish new memories is essential to our daily existence and identity ; enabling us to navigate through the world .
A new study by researchers at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital ( The Neuro ) , McGill University and University of California , Los Angeles has captured an image for the first time of a mechanism , specifically protein translation , which underlies long - term memory formation .
The finding provides the first visual evidence that when a new memory is formed new proteins are made locally at the synapse - the connection between nerve cells - increasing the strength of the synaptic connection and reinforcing the memory .
The study published in Science , is important for understanding how memory traces are created and the ability to monitor it in real time will allow a detailed understanding of how memories are formed .
When considering what might be going on in the brain at a molecular level two essential properties of memory need to be taken into account .
First , because a lot of information needs to be maintained over a long time there has to be some degree of stability .
Second , to allow for learning and adaptation the system also needs to be highly flexible .
For this reason , research has focused on synapses which are the main site of exchange and storage in the brain .
They form a vast but also constantly fluctuating network of connections whose ability to change and adapt , called synaptic plasticity , may be the fundamental basis of learning and memory .
" But , if this network is constantly changing , the question is how do memories stay put , how are they formed ?
It has been known for some time that an important step in long - term memory formation is " translation " , or the production , of new proteins locally at the synapse , strengthening the synaptic connection in the reinforcement of a memory , which until now has never been imaged , " says Dr. Wayne Sossin , neuroscientist at The Neuro and co-investigator in the study .
" Using a translational reporter , a fluorescent protein that can be easily detected and tracked , we directly visualized the increased local translation , or protein synthesis , during memory formation .
Importantly , this translation was synapse - specific and it required activation of the post - synaptic cell , showing that this step required cooperation between the pre and post - synaptic compartments , the parts of the two neurons that meet at the synapse .
Thus highly regulated local translation occurs at synapses during long - term plasticity and requires trans - synaptic signals . "
Long - term memory and synaptic plasticity require changes in gene expression and yet can occur in a synapse - specific manner .
This study provides evidence that a mechanism that mediates this gene expression during neuronal plasticity involves regulated translation of localized mRNA at stimulated synapses .
These findings are instrumental in establishing the molecular processes involved in long - term memory formation and provide insight into diseases involving memory impairment .
This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health , the WM Keck Foundation and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .
Unless you are a true baseball fan , you have probably never heard of Bob Feller .
Maybe you have heard of Nolan Ryan .
They were classic power pitchers .
They threw hard and they threw for strikes .
Even if you are a baseball fan , unless you live and breathe the Detroit Tigers , you have probably never heard of Joel Zumaya .
Right .
Who ?
While playing in the American League Championship in 2006 , he threw a fastball clocked at 104.8 MPH , the fastest in history .
How can a guy who threw that fast not be on the cover of every Wheaties box in the civilized world ?
Because the following year he was 1 - 4 with a 4.28 ERA ; hardly the stuff of legends .
In two months , a 20 - year old from San Diego State named Stephen Strasburg could shatter the draft pick signing bonus record by securing as much as $ 15 million guaranteed , handily beating the $ 10.5 million those zany Chicago Cubs gave pitcher Mark Prior from USC in 2001 .
Why ?
Because Strasburg has been clocked at 103 MPH and hits 101 quite often .
103 is something only officially done by two other players in history , both of them in the major leagues .
That 's not supposed to be done by college kids and it's part of what makes baseball superior to football or basketball , where you can quit college and be an All - Star your first year in the pro leagues .
Baseball success is an elusive mistress - but she returns your phone call promptly if you throw 103 MPH .
Why is it so difficult ?
Is there a cap on how fast a ball can be thrown ?
The awesome power of physics is going to answer that , just like we discussed the physics of a moving baseball and the farthest home run ever hit First , let 's be practical about how blazing fast 104 MPH is .
A 90 MPH fastball , the go - to pitch and speed for the top echelon of pitchers , is travelling at 132 feet per second .
Since the ball is closer to the batter when it is released and because the batter is in the middle of the plate depth , we are really only talking about 55 feet to see a pitch rather than just over 60 .
That means the batter has .4167 seconds to react .
Boosting that speed to 104 is bordering on unthinkable to hitbut it explains why a lot of pitchers can be so successful without triple - digit speed .
So if we know exceptional humans can pitch 95 MPH and up , we at least have some ranges to work with , just like we know a human will likely never run a 30 second mile - there are physical limits to the possible .
Basically , it takes energy to throw a ball .
We discussed drag forces on a ball before and we know that at the moment of release a ball has about 1/6th horsepower of energy .
A horsepower - second is the energy of a 1 HP motor running for 1 second , which would lift 550 lbs. one foot .
If a throw takes .11 seconds that means an average force on the ball of 12 lbs. - a mean acceleration equivalent to 40 G's .
Yep , 40 times gravity .
So a pitcher is transmitting power of 1.5 horsepower to the ball but his body is also in motion , the total power is more like 3 HP .
It takes 20 lbs. of muscle to generate 1 HP so 3 HP is obviously impossible using just a human upper body .
This is why pitchers talk about the importance of leg strength ( 4 ) - 60 lbs. of muscle has to come from somewhere .
Is there a demon in the air at 105 MPH ?
So back to how fast a pitcher can throw .
In my favorite movie , The Right Stuff , some engineers and pilots in the late 1940s felt like the sound barrier was a hard limit to airplane speed - the plane would come apart if you tried to go beyond .
Yet Chuck Yeager broke that sound ' barrier ' in late 1947 ( 5 ) and from then on records got broken time and again .
So is there a sound barrier , a demon in the sky , for baseball , or do we just need a Chuck Yeager ?
Maybe there is a demon .
Or at least a body barrier .
Like I mentioned in Note 4 , there is a lot of energy in stored tendons at the mid-point of throwing a baseball .
Glenn Fleisig , a biomechanical engineer who studies pitching at the American Sports Medicine Institute in Birmingham , Ala. , subjected cadaver elbows to increasing amounts of rotational force .
His experiments showed that an average person 's ulnar collateral ligament ( UCL - the part that connects the the humerus and ulna in the elbow ) breaks at about 80 Newton - meters .
The torque on an elite pitcher 's elbow when he throws a fastball ?
About 80 Newton - meters .
So pitchers are already doing things that would destroy a normal person 's arm .
So unlike running or swimming , there has n't been a huge leap in pitching speed because pitchers were already pretty good decades ago but , like we have discussed in previous articles , conditions that impact the ball help .
We established that a fastball is faster in Denver .
If Stephen Strasburg , the fireballer from San Diego State , makes the majors and continues to grow in strength the way previous major league pitchers have done , playing in Denver with a 30 MPH wind at his back could have him throw a pitch at 110 MPH .
One of those records , like Joe DiMaggio 's hitting streak , that would be very tough to beat until we start putting tennis rackets on the shoulders of baseball players .
Here , just for fun , are four types of pitches you can throw to get you out of most pick - up games you come across on your way home - with your dignity intact .
Fastball , a 2 - seam fastball , a curveball and a ( circle ) changeup .
Just do n't generate too much torque .
In fairness to Bob Feller , radar guns did not exist when he pitched .
In fairness to common sense , being clocked at ' 104 MPH ' because they used a motorcycle going that fast is not really going to be considered scientifically valid .
Ted Williams , arguably one of the best batting eyes in the history of the game , who faced Bob Feller and numerous others , instead said Steve Dalkowski was the fastest pitcher ever .
If you 've never heard of him , it 's because he had a career record of 46 - 80 and a 5.59 ERA - in the minor leagues .
So speed is not everything .
However , should you happen to like great baseball anecdotes , here are some Dalkowski gems : *
He was once pulled in the second inning of a game because he had already thrown 120 pitches . *
He once hit a batter in the head so hard the ball rebounded to second base ( that 's over 127 feet ) . *
In one game , three of his wild pitches penetrated the backstop screen which is supposed to protect fans . *
He once threw a ball through the outfield fence to win a bet .
They tried to measure his speed at the Army Proving Ground in Aberdeen , Md. but he had to throw the ball through a metal box about the size of home plate , through which a laser was being beamed , and could n't hit the target .
There was also no mound there but the consensus among people who watched him play in games said he threw 115 MPH in actual pitching conditions .
Unfortunately , he hurt his elbow fielding a bunt in an exhibition game in 1963 and was never the same - he also never got to play in the major leagues .
(2) Let 's hope it's not 160 MPH , as in George Plimpton 's The Curious Case of Sidd Finch .
His catcher had to practice by snaring balls dropped out of the Goodyear blimp , so they could reach terminal velocity .
Plimpton 's Sports Illustrated article on the matter came out April 1 , 1985 , the kind of April Fool 's prank most of us only dream about .
Unthinkable to some .
Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams had ridiculously great batting eyes .
As much as modern fans want to hiss at Barry Bonds because of steroids allegations , there is no doubt his batting eye is in the top 10 in history .
But Stan Musial , who would be as famous as Joe DiMaggio if he had n't played in a small market like St. Louis , once told a rookie the secret to batting was hitting the top third of the ball if he wanted a grounder , the middle third if he wanted a line drive and the bottom third if he wanted to pop it up .
Clearly Stan Musial was not using eyeballs the way ordinary players , much less regular people , do .
(4) It also tells you why pitchers blow their arms out or they just wear down .
At the mid-point of the throw , the tendons of the arm are storing all that energy and then it is released as spring - energy from those stretched tendons .
Imagine the strain !
(5) Classified , of course , so the commies did n't send spies from Hollywood to steal the secret of really fast planes .
But , in the days when journalists did journalism and not primarily liberal good works , word still got out .
Here is my Time magazine from 1949 when the world learned of it :

The Peapod electric vehicle is , “ awkward - looking , strange and offbeat , ” says Peter Arnell , CEO of the Arnell Group–he ought to know , he designed the plug - in car .
“ It creates the right amount of disruption for people to pay attention to it in this marketplace . ”
Arnell , a famed brand architect , and mastermind behind the disastrous Tropicana packaging redesign , spoke about his newest product yesterday at the Greener by Design conference .
The Chrysler Peapod is definitively a neighborhood electric vehicle , with a maximum speed of 25 mph , a 30 - mile range , and the ability to go from 0 to 20 mph in 5.9 seconds .
It wo n’t survive a crash with an SUV too well , though .
When asked about the Peapod ’s safety record , Arnell explained that the car does n’t need to comply with U.S. crash test and safety regulations since it does n’t go above 25 mph .
“ Message and brand is most important now , “ Arnell said .
Arnell ’s Peapod wo n’t become a mainstream vehicle soon –it ’s too limited in speed and durability –but the car , inspired by bullet trains , sea turtles , and Buzz Aldrin ’s space helmet , is attracting attention .
Arnell believes that the Peapod ’s smiley - face grill is a welcome change from the aggressive - looking fronts on other cars .
“ Grills today look like Darth Vader , very aggressive and performance - oriented .
We thought when this thing comes rolling down the road it might be nice if it ’s just smiling at you , ” he said .
At the very least , Arnell ’s Peapod will give some publicity to the nascent electric vehicle market .
The Peapod also proves that EVs can be designed and rolled out quickly if car companies are motivated enough .
Arnell and his team went from design to physical product in only six months .
While the design is simple , the car is slow , and most of the elements inside are stock items , the Peapod is a testament to the inefficiency of car companies that have been sitting on EVs for years .
As of Wednesday , 2,420 people are on the waiting list for the Peapod .
The $ 12,500 vehicle will be released in the late fall .

2002 : Mozilla 1.0 is released .
The first major milestone for the open source browser does n't do much to impress users or shake loose Microsoft 's crown .
However , it proves to the world that free software can succeed not just in the server room , but also on the desktop .
The first browser wars effectively ended in 1998 when Microsoft Internet Explorer toppled Netscape Navigator .
Throughout the the mid-1990s , the makers of the two most popular web browsers battled tooth and nail to capture the largest share of users among the web 's early adopters .
Even though the geeks tended to favor Navigator , every new Windows computer shipped with IE on the desktop , giving Microsoft a significant advantage .
Despite its best efforts , Netscape could n't compete with that kind of blanket distribution .
Realizing it had nothing left to lose , the company took a nod from the burgeoning free software culture , spearheaded by the Linux operating system , and released the bulk of its web browser code under an open source license in March , 1998 .
The plan was laid out : Netscape 's browser would continue to be developed under the guidance of the newly formed Mozilla project , which would distribute the code base from its website , organize the community development efforts and work alongside Netscape to create the next version of the company 's browser .
" By giving away the source code for future versions ( of Navigator ) , we can ignite the creative energies of the entire net community and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the browser market , " said Netscape president and CEO Jim Barksdale in a press release announcing the transition .
Within months , the Mozilla crew decided to alter its strategy .
Mozilla was getting nowhere with the old , bloated Navigator code , so it chose to throw most of it away and write a new browser from scratch , complete with a new rendering engine called Gecko .
The team , largely funded by Netscape and , later , new parent company AOL , tinkered away for years , pushing back deadlines and delaying releases while Internet Explorer 's dominance continued to grow .
" When Mozilla opened source code in 1998 , everyone expected things to happen overnight .
But it took a few years for the project to catalyze , " Netscape founder Marc Andreessen told Wired.com in 2003 .
Eventually , the grand plan got off the ground .
The team released Netscape 6 , the first major browser built on Mozilla 's open source code base , at the end of 2000 .
It was a huge milestone , but many of Mozilla 's contributors felt the browser was far too bloated .
Others felt it was compromised by AOL / Netscape 's insistence on adding features that would boost its business .
" We came to the conclusion that Netscape could n't ship a good browser as long as the business of Netscape was getting in the way of creating a product that people actually wanted to use , " Mozilla director of community development Asa Dotzler told Wired.com last year .
" We realized somebody else needed to do it . "
Mozilla set out to build its own browser , free of influence from its corporate overlords .
A year and a half later , the team had created Mozilla 1.0 .
It was released on June 5 , 2002 , for Windows , Mac and Linux .
It had some killer features like pop -up blocking , tabbed browsing , full web - standards compliance and protections against the latest security threats .
Free software advocates praised the release , but Mozilla 's geek cred only went so far .
Users it found it slow , buggy and weighed down by unnecessary features like a built - in e-mail client .
Plus , it was difficult to use – it was a product built by geeks , for geeks , and it smelled like it .
Months after launch , the browser had only captured a minuscule percentage of the market .
The goal was to beat Microsoft with open source .
Netscape could n't do it .
And , according to Dotzler , " we realized Mozilla could n't do it , either . "
While Mozilla 1.0 was n't a success , what followed certainly was .
Two Mozilla contributors , Ben Goodger and Blake Ross , proposed taking things back to basics .
The Mozilla source code was stripped down and rewritten once again , and all of the extraneous features were canned .
In late 2004 , a faster , slimmer and easier - to - use browser emerged : Mozilla Firefox .
By every measure , Firefox was a huge success .
The browser has grown to capture a full quarter of the browser market , and it 's still winning new users today .
Firefox also stands as one of the exemplars of the free and open source software movement – proof that software developed publicly and transparently , then given away , can compete with commercial applications written in proprietary code .
And it was that original gamble by a few true believers at Netscape – the ones who argued , even when their backs were against the wall , that opening up the code to its flagship product was a good idea – which eventually led to Firefox 's success .
As former Mozilla contributor Jamie Zawinski says in the 2000 documentary Code Rush , the company 's strategy guaranteed Netscape 's browser would stick around even after the AOL acquisition , the dot - com bust , the continuing dominance of Microsoft and whatever other forces threatened to kill it off .
" The nature of what Netscape did meant that the code belongs to the community now , " he says .

Five MLB trades that do n’t need to happen
I get it – baseball trades are fun .
They ’re fun to speculate about , they ’re fun to debate and they ’re fun to analyze .
But just because a club needs a bat , an arm or is just looking to shrink salary , does n’t mean that a trade needs to happen .
I ’ve compiled a list of five trade rumors and where they originated .
I then discuss why each of them makes sense , but why they also do n’t necessarily need to happen .
Rumor # 1 : The Red Sox will trade for Pirates shortstop Jack Wilson ( Pittsburgh Post - Gazette )
Why it makes sense : Boston is growing impatient waiting for Jed Lowrie to recover from a wrist injury that has held him out since mid-April .
They ’re also tired of watching Julio Lugo ( who is equally bad offensively as he is defensively ) make a mockery of the game whenever he trots onto the field .
While Nick Green has done well filling in for Lowrie while he ’s been hurt and for Lugo while he continues to work on being the most overpaid player in professional sports , the Sox feel they could do better with Wilson .
( There ’s also a rumor making the rounds that Boston would n’t have to give up any top prospects in order to acquire Wilson – they just would need to take on the rest of his salary . )
Why it does n’t need to happen : Wilson is excellent defensively , but he brings very little to the table in terms of offense .
He ’s also overpaid himself , as he ’ll make $ 7.25 million this year and $ 8.4 million in 2010 despite being limited at the dish .
While waiting for Lowrie to return to the field has been a slow death for the Sox , he ’s cheaper than Wilson and gives the team a better overall player at the position ( when he ’s healthy , of course ) .
Plus , Green has played well and Boston might be better served holding onto prospects in order to make a more productive move around the trade deadline ( i.e. adding another bat in case David Oritz plans on hitting south of .200 all season ) than one involving Wilson .
Rumor # 2 : The Giants will trade for Marlins second baseman Dan Uggla ( Sun-Sentinel )
Why it makes sense :
The Giants are playing better than most expected this season , but they ’re doing it all with pitching .
They ’ve surrendered the fewest runs this year ( 233 ) , but have scored the third fewest ( 248 ) themselves .
San Fran might not be able to catch the streaking Dodgers in the NL West ( as of this writing , the Giants are seven games back of L.A. in the division despite being six games above .500 ) , but if they continue to play well , the Wild Card is certainly attainable .
But they need offense – badly .
While Uggla ’s batting average has been atrocious all season , he does have 11 home runs and 40 RBI so the thought is that he could add much - needed pop to the Giants ’ lineup .
Why it does n’t need to happen : Yes , the Giants do need offense .
But do n’t forget that they play in a pitcher ’s park so even if they did acquire Uggla , who knows how his power would translate to AT&T Park .
And his average is death so if he ’s not going to hit home runs , he ’s not worth acquiring ( and do n’t forget that his defense is brutal , too ) .
The Giants ’ current starting second baseman is Emmanuel Burriss , who has zero pop and has struggled at the plate despite tearing it up in the spring , but he has an outstanding glove and he ’s young .
It ’s rumored that the Marlins would be looking for young pitching in exchange for Uggla , but it ’s not worth it for the Giants to give up a young arm like Jonathan Sanchez ( even though he ’s struggling ) to acquire Uggla while there are still options within the organization ( and I do n’t necessarily mean Burriss , who has been brutal , but Kevin Frandsen , who has been absolutely hosed by the organization this season ) .
Plus , the Giants are n’t one bat away from making a deep postseason run – they ’re two or three bats away .
Acquiring Uggla is n’t going to change that .
The Giants have also been linked to players like Adam Dunn and Paul Konerko and I would say the same thing about them as I do about Uggla – those players are n’t worth giving up young arms with the Giants still a year or two away from seriously competing .
Unless they could get a young bat in a deal , San Fran GM Brian Sabean should stand pat and continue his rebuilding plan .
Rumor # 3 : The Cardinals will trade for Astros shortstop Miguel Tejada ( St. Louis Post - Dispatch )
Why it makes sense : Manager Tony La Russa desperately wants to add another bat to the lineup to help protect Albert Pujols and upgrading the left side of the infield while Troy Glaus and Khalil Greene continue to miss time is a necessity as well .
Tejada would cover both needs as he ’s hitting .344 with six home runs and some feel as though he can play third base if needed , although he has never actually played there before .
Why it does n’t need to happen :
First and foremost , there ’s no guarantee that the Astros would want to trade within their own division .
Plus , despite currently being three games under .500 and in last place , Houston is only four games back of the Brewers in the NL Central , so they ’ll hang onto Tejada if they feel as though they have a shot at the playoffs ( however slim those hopes may be ) .
But looking at this from the Cardinals ’ perspective , acquiring Tejada does n’t make as much sense as going after someone like Cleveland ’s Mark DeRosa , who is also rumored to be available .
Tejada will earn $ 13 million in 2009 and is set to become a free agent in 2010 .
Chances are , St. Louis would n’t re-sign Tejada in the offseason and they ’d probably have to pay Houston a premium because it would be a trade down within the division .
Throw in the fact that Tejada is n’t that great of a defensive player and adding him makes little sense .
A guy like DeRosa would still give the Cards a quality bat , a better defender who has actually spent time at third base , and cheaper player to boot .
Rumor # 4 : The Padres will trade Adrian Gonzalez ( ESPN.com ’s Buster Onley )
Why it makes sense :
It does n’t make sense unless you look at it from the view of the Padres ’ front office , who wants to cut team salary significantly .
( That ’s why San Diego has been actively shopping Jake Peavy . )
Why it does n’t need to happen :
This is more of a notion than a rumor .
As previously noted , the Padres want to cut salary but they ’ve been unable to move Peavy , so speculation has it that they could wind up dealing Gonzo if the right trade comes along .
But while cutting salary is important to the front office , GM Kevin Towers ca n’t just give up a young slugger like Gonzalez in a cost - cutting move .
Obviously Towers would get a couple of prospects in exchange for Gonzo , but would he be willing to take a lesser deal just to free up some money ?
If so , that would be incredibly disappointing for a Padre fan base that has embraced Gonzalez and hopes that he ’ll still be around when San Diego eventually is competitive again ( whenever that might be ) .
Rumor # 5 : The Red Sox will trade Brad Penny ( Boston Globe )
Why it makes sense : With John Smoltz set to come back soon from a rehab assignment , Penny will be expandable to the Red Sox , who have discussed moving him to the pen ( despite his unwillingness ) when Smoltz returns to the mound .
Boston seemingly has an abundance of starting pitching and if they could get a couple of prospects or a position player of worth in exchange for Penny , why not move him ?
Why it does n’t need to happen :
A lot has been made about Boston ’s pitching depth , but things could go from good to ugly at the drop of a dime .
Dice - K has been brutal and has already made one trip to the DL .
Josh Beckett started off slow , recovered to pitch incredibly well over the last month but then was shelled yesterday in Philadelphia .
Smoltz is set to return from his rehab assignment , but who knows how he ’ll pitch once he faces major league batters again .
So essentially yes , the Red Sox do have a ton of depth .
But that could vanish in a heartbeat and while Penny has looked good in his last three starts , teams are n’t going to be willing to overpay for the 31 - year old ’s services – especially knowing that Boston has an abundance of arms .
In the end , holding on to Penny for depth and in case of injuries to other starters might be worth it in the end .
Of course , if some club offers a top prospect in exchange for Penny ( which is doubtful ) , then all bets are off .

Criminals have built a massive " botnet " network of hacked computers that has infected an estimated 1.9 million computers worldwide , including systems within U.S. and U.K. government networks , security vendor Finjan reported Tuesday .
A group of six criminals has run the operation since February , controlling the botnet from a server located in the Ukraine , Finjan said .
Using a network of Web sites , they have installed their malware by tricking victims into viewing malicious Web code that then installs the malware .
Nearly half of the computers hacked by the gang are located in the U.S. , but they have also hit a sizeable number of machines in the U.K. , Canada , Germany and France , Finjan said .
Finjan researchers found " compromised computers in 77 government - owned domains ... from the U.S. , U.K. , and various other countries , " the company said in a statement .
Finjan has contacted institutions that were hacked by the gang and is working with law enforcement on the issue , the company said .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A Pentagon official has been charged with leaking classified information to a business client who was taking orders from China 's government , the Justice Department said Wednesday .
James Wilbur Fondren Jr. , 62 , is accused of " conspiracy to communicate classified information to an agent of a foreign government " from November 2004 until February 2008 , department officials said in a written statement .
Fondren , who began working as a civilian deputy director for the Washington liaison office for U.S. Pacific Command in 2001 and has been on administrative leave with pay since mid-February of last year , turned himself in to federal agents Wednesday morning .
" The allegations in this case are troubling -- providing classified information to a foreign agent of the People 's Republic of China is a real and serious threat to our national security , " said Dana Boente , acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia .
Do n't Miss Woman admits helping pass secrets to China
An unsealed criminal complaint revealed the course of the FBI 's investigation of Fondren .
Fondren , a retired Air Force colonel , began providing private consulting services from his Virginia home in February 1998 , according to an affidavit from FBI special agent Robert Gibbs .
His sole client was a friend , Tai Shen Kuo , a naturalized U.S. citizen from Taiwan who maintained business interests in the United States and China , according to the affidavit .
Fondren went to work three years later in the U.S. Pacific Command 's Washington liaison office , where he had top security clearance , Gibbs said .
The FBI 's investigation revealed that even after taking the Pentagon job , Fondren continued to provide consulting services to Kuo , who , unbeknownst to Fondren , was paid by the Chinese government to collect information , according to the affidavit .
At one point , the affidavit says , Kuo told Fondren that he was providing information to the government of Taiwan , Gibbs said .
Fondren incorporated Defense Department documents and other classified information into e-mailed " opinion papers " that he sold to Kuo for between $ 350 and $ 800 each , Gibbs said .
Kuo was arrested in February 2008 when he was staying at Fondren 's Virginia home , according to the affidavit .
At the time , Kuo possessed a draft unclassified copy of a document called " The National Military Strategy of the United States of America 2008 . "
Fondren later admitted to the FBI that he gave the copy to Kuo , Gibbs said .
Another Pentagon official , Gregg William Bergersen , was arrested the same day as Kuo and was accused of providing Kuo with government information , the affidavit said .
Kuo 's dealings with Bergersen were separate from his alleged dealings with Fondren , Gibbs said .
Bergersen pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to disclose defense information and was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison , the Justice Department said in a news release .
Kuo admitted he had obtained national defense information from Bergersen and was sentenced to a prison term of 15 years and eight months , the department said .
Yu Xin Kang , a Chinese citizen living in New Orleans , Louisiana , who was arrested on the same day as Kuo and Bergersen , admitted she helped Kuo pass information to the Chinese government and was sentenced to 18 months in prison , the department said .
" Espionage is a profoundly serious crime , and the FBI will continue to work with our law enforcement and intelligence community partners to ensure the protection of our nation 's most sensitive information , " said Arthur Cummings of the FBI 's National Security Branch .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The Bank of Russia intends to cut the share of U.S. Treasurys in its foreign exchange reserves , a central bank official said Wednesday , according to media reports .
Alexei Ulyukayev , first deputy chairman of Russia 's central bank , said Wednesday the bank plans to reduce the amount of Treasurys it holds in reserves , the Interfax news agency and other media outlets reported .
Ulyukayev also said that Russia would switch some of its reserves into bonds issued by the International Monetary Fund , according to the reports .
As of May 29 , Russia 's international reserves stood at $ 401.1 billion , the third biggest in the world .
" The idea is basically sound .
It all depends on the mix and timing , " said James Fenkner , principal and portfolio manager of Red Star Asset Management , a hedge fund that invests primarily in Russian assets .
Russia exports commodities denominated in U.S. dollars , while its imports , such as machinery and luxury goods , are primarily denominated in euros .
The " reserve mix should represent economic interests , " Fenkner said .
" Of course , the Russians are also well aware of U.S. fiscal and monetary weakness and , like the Chinese a few weeks ago , do n't want to hold a potentially depreciating asset . "
China , which has the world 's biggest foreign exchange reserves , held $ 767.9 billion of Treasury securities at the end of March , making it the world 's largest holder of U.S. government debt , according to the Treasury Department 's Web site .
It is followed by Japan , which holds $ 686.7 billion , while Russia is number fifth with $ 138.4 billion .
Russia , China to invest in IMF bonds
In late May , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the IMF 's managing director , said in a statement that Russia intends to invest up to $ 10 billion in the first - ever notes to be issued by the fund .
On Tuesday , Strauss - Kahn said in a separate statement that China plans to invest up to $ 50 billion in IMF notes , thereby helping other fund members weather the global crisis .
" The new notes will offer members a safe investment instrument with reasonable return , " Strauss - Kahn said .
Paul Biszko , senior emerging markets analyst at RBC Capital Markets , said that Russia 's statement Wednesday is similar to comments made in the past .
" This is very preliminary , and I 'm not sure it would be market - moving given the size of it , " Biszko said .
" It 's not a material amount -- we 're talking about $ 10 billion relative to the size of the Treasury market .
The motivation would be to diversify away from the dollar . "
The IMF bonds , which have n't been issued yet , would most likely be denominated in the so - called Special Drawing Rights ( SDRs ) , so in a basket of currencies .
" I do n't think it 's new news , " Biszko said .
" We 've heard [ similar ] comments from many countries over the last several years .
Maybe we 've had a bit more frequency in recent months .
It 's a lot of talk and we 're unlikely to see any significant action in the short term . "
Biszko said that some more clarity on the issue may come next week , when Russia will host the first summit of the leaders of the so - called BRIC group of major emerging markets , which includes Brazil , Russia , India and China .
Treasury yields rise
In the bond markets on Wednesday , yields on benchmark 10 - year Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y , 0.689 % , which move inversely to prices , rose 8 basis points to 3.939 % .
See Bond Report .
" The bond market fell hard and yields went up after the announcement [ by Russia ] , " said Ashraf Laidi , chief currency strategist at CMC Markets .
" I 'm sure there is also some saber - rattling ahead of the G7 in Italy [ at the weekend ] , " he said .
" Europeans want to keep a strong dollar .
But every time oil goes up , the Russians want to flex their muscles . "
Russia is a major global exporter of commodities , particularly oil , natural gas and metals .
The weakening of the dollar since early March has helped lift commodities prices , especially oil , boosting the income of commodities - producing nations .
But it also hurts the value of their Treasury holdings .
Calls from Russia , China and other nations have been growing for another global reserve currency to replace the dollar .
The dollar also came under pressure earlier after the reports , Laidi said .
But it regained some steam as falling stocks on Wall Street led some to buy dollars as a safe haven .
The Wall Street Journal reports on Steve Jobs ’ illness :
While Mr. Jobs has been on sick leave , some Apple directors have gotten weekly updates about his medical condition from the CEO ’s physician , according to a person familiar with the matter .
Mr. Jobs ’s recovery “ is coming along ” and he is on schedule to return to work later this month , said this person , who has seen Mr. Jobs in recent weeks .
“ He was one real sick guy , ” added this person .
“ Fundamentally he was starving to death over a nine - month period .
He could n’t digest protein .
[ But ] he took corrective action . ”
Mr. Jobs occasionally has come into Apple ’s headquarters since his leave began , said a person who has seen him there .
There has also been talk , or perhaps hope , of Jobs making a surprise appearance at this years WWDC , but that seems increasingly unlikely as the conference nears .
After all , Phil Schiller and other Apple executives are already slated to deliver the keynote .
I somehow doubt that Jobs will show up just as a way of saying , “ Oh hey guys , just wanted to stop in and say ‘ Hi ’ and let you guys know that I ’m okay . ”
Still , Jobs is poised to return to his CEO duties at Apple at the end of June , and according to the aforementioned WSJ report , Apple might try and time Jobs ’ return to coincide with a major Apple sponsored media event .
But two people who do business with Apple said senior Apple managers have told them the company is now trying to coordinate Mr. Jobs ’s return with a product launch or public event .
At this point , Apple has more than proved that it can survive quite well without Jobs at the helm – so from that perspective , a triumphant return by Jobs to introduce an amazing new product might seem un-necessary .
But realistically , given Jobs ’ personality , you can bet that he ’d like to come back with a bang with a product that will knock everyone ’s socks off .
With so many pundits so quick to cast - off Jobs while he ’s been out , I would imagine that Jobs would like to convey the following message as loudly and dramatically as possible ..
“ Hey Bitches , I ’m baaaack ” .
And with the Palm Pre garnering a shit - ton of good press and reviews over the past few days , you can bet that Jobs ’ competitive juices are flowing as strong as ever .
It ’s almost like Jordan coming back lookin ’ to add some more rings to his fingers .
Holla .
just hit this thing and the guy will give you the scoop
“ I am grateful to those who encouraged me to seek this office .
While I certainly appreciate the honor of consideration , I feel at this point in time I can better serve the Republican Party of Florida by completing my second term as Chairman . "
The departure of the universally loathed Bush - Cheney team has n't done much to revive the battered Republican brand -- not if you believe the surveys that show that only 1 in 5 voters admits to being a Republican or if you see the dismal -- and still declining -- approval ratings for the GOP congressional leadership .
This morning the Gallup poll shows that Americans of every single age group -- from 18 year olds to people over 60 prefer Democrats to Republicans .
Watch : And , after a great big thumbs down from GOP supremo Rush Limbaugh , the Eric Cantor / Mitt Romney / Jeb Bush ill - starred rebranding initiative , and " listening tour " / pizza party is a big dud , especially among the Republican base .
There are n't any Democratic - Republican contests coming up between now and November , 2010 but what all this is doing is absolutelyGOP congressional recruiting efforts .
The clownish antics of RNC head Michael Steele , the stunning catastrophe the GOP suffered in NY - 20 , the ugliness of their extremely unpopular strategy of obstructionism , the ugliness of utterly abandoning their constituents to become lockstep adherents of piggish capitalism , and the likelihood that the Republican congressional rump will not just remain a minority but will shrink into even greater irrelevance , are combining to send first tier recruits running for the hills .
Even though Ann Kirkpatrick ( D - AZ ) has proven herself to be one of the most mediocre members of the freshman class , a bumbling idiot who votes with Republicans even on the most popular Democratic issues -- like yesterday 's Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act ( which even 60 felt compelled by public opinion to support ! ) -- the only Republican who could have probably dispatched her , state Rep. Bill Konopnicki , pretty much said thanks but no thanks .
In Virginia , Republicans were counting on Thelma Drake to pick herself off the mat and slug it out with Blue Dog Glenn Nye again .
Nye has n't been supporting Obama 's program and would probably not get much enthusiasm from Democrats who pay attention .
Nevertheless , Drake just announced she 's not interested .
Right now the only candidate the Republicans have for the seat is an African - American former Virginia Beach party chairman , Chuck Smith , who would probably have as much of a shot to win as I would .
As long as the GOP is admitting minorities , maybe they 'll try bringing back former closet case / former congressman Ed Schrock , who represented the district before being outed on a gay phone - sex and pick - up service .
Meanwhile the Florida Republican Party chairman , Jim Greer , has been considered the GOP 's best bet to take on another weak Democratic freshman , Suaznne Kosmas .
This week thereported that he 'll be taking a pass on that one .
Expect to see a lot more message like this from Republicans around the country : Some of the messages will say " at this point in time I can better serve the party by completing my obligations as " a goat cheese maker or as a crack cocaine cooker or as a dishwasher at the Olive Garden on 4th Street .
Nobody wants to be with the sore loser team .
Tom Ridge , apparently , is so enjoying his stint as a lobbyist for Albania that he 's stopped taking frantic phone calls from John Cornyn , as has Illinois congressman Mark Kirk whose 53 - 19 % polling lead over Roland Burris has n't persuaded him to get into the race .
After Dean Heller excused himself to go to the men's room and then climbed out the back window , the GOP has n't been able to find a legitimate candidate willing to run against Harry Reid .
Right now they 're trying to decide between a New York bankster , John Chachas , who once spent some time in Ely , Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki who would have to run his campaign from a prison cell since he 's been indicted for stealing state funds ( but when he was state Treasurer , not as Lt Governor ) , or a former state assemblywoman , Sharron Angle , a Club For Growth religious extremist ( and Scientology shill ) who is considered so far to the right that should she ever break her losing streak and get into any public office again -- not likely -- she would give Michele Bachmann and Virginia Foxx a run for their money when it comes to TV bookers looking for hysterical lunatic fringe Know Nothings to spout nonsense in front of a camera .
Even the absolute worst excuse for a Democrat outside the Old Confederacy , Idaho reactionary Walt Minnick , who votes with the GOP more frequently , at least on important matters , than with Democrats , looks like he 'll skate to an undeserved re-election in an overwhelmingly red district with no credible challenger .
Minnick beat a neo - fascist incumbent with just 51 % of the vote in 2008 -- while McCain McCain got 62 % of the vote in the district ( somewhat less than Bush 's 69 % but still proof positive that ID - 01 is one of the most backward and ignorant districts in America ) .
But yesterday Idaho Treasurer Ron Crane , the GOP 's first choice for the seat , announced that he will not be running .
A local KKK grand dragon or Aryan Nation fuehrer may be all the GOP will manage to field .
Although Arnold Schwarzenegger has bowed out of challenging Barbara Boxer , she will have a GOP challenger , kind of .
Chuck DeVore , a sad sack fifth tier opponent from Irvine , has somehow been diverted into making his clownish race a pissing match with ex-Eagles superstar Don Henley .
is more hopeful than most about Republicans being able to recruit credible Senate candidates , even if their efforts to find any potential winners in the House races have come to naught .

THE GERMAN CLASS " 52 " LOCOMOTIVE
a. General
This is a summary of information and conclusions regarding the much publicized German class " 52 " locomotive recently adopted as standard to replace the class " 50 " locomotive .
The information has been sifted from various German sources , some of which conflict and many of which are of a propaganda nature .
Questionable statements have been eliminated as far as possible .
The evidence points to the conclusion that the earlier class " 50 " locomotive , for which a program of 7,500 locomotives per year was announced by the Germans in March 1942 , was a transition model of a class introduced shortly before the war and was only intended as a stop - gap to tide over a critical period .
As proof of this , in the accounts of the class " 52 " locomotive there are several references to a " transition " model , and the photographs which have appeared in the German press are believed to have been of this simplified class " 50 " locomotive .
Furthermore , technical experts severely criticized the older design from available photographs , particularly on the ground that the frame was light and the cylinder saddle weak .
The class " 52 " locomotive is apparently stronger in these respects .
In further evidence that the class " 50 " locomotive , which was light , was constructed as a temporary expedient to provide means for rapidly increasing production , the German press announced that the first of the class " 52 " locomotives left the factory early in September -- although the design and subsequent production of the model class " 52 " locomotive is estimated to have required 15 months .
Evidently considerable progress had already been made on class " 52 " at the time that the simplified class " 50 " was temporarily adopted as a standard model .
b. The Design of the Class " 52 "
A comparison of photographs of the classes " 50 " and " 52 " shows that , contrary to German press accounts , they are lighter models of the class " 44 , " and have the same basic design .
In comparison with transition class " 50 " the new class " 52 " has a deeper frame , stiffer cylinder saddle , and a welded tender of the modified Vanderbilt , frameless type in place of the riveted type carried on a frame .
The bracket for the valve motion has been stiffened by a bridge girder between the bracket and cylinder .
A snow plough has been fitted to the locomotive .
The smoke deflector plates , the forward steam dome which contained the preheater , the feed pump , and the feed water heater have been eliminated .
It is evident that the side and main rods have been redesigned ; the brake rigging and similar apparatus are simplified ; the locking device on the smoke box has been replaced by a ring of cleats ; and the cylinder - exhaust branches are rectangular instead of circular in cross section .
The class " 52 " locomotive is claimed to be more effectively protected against freezing than the class " 50 , " by thicker lagging , steam jackets around exposed piping , and transfer of exposed parts to a position nearer the boiler .
Although it is difficult to verify all these claims from photographs , it appears that the boiler , cylinders , and exhaust branches are well insulated .
The photographs do not indicate which pipes were brought nearer the boiler or which pipes have been steam - jacketed .
However , contrary to normal practice the air - compressor valve mechanism at the top of the compressor has been covered by a casing and insulated .
It has been reported that a closer fit has been made on class " 50 " locomotive journal - box covers in order to prevent snow from entering , and , no doubt , this has been done on the class " 52 " locomotive also .
The precautions taken against freezing would adapt the locomotive for service on the Eastern Front .
Minor differences noted are the mounting of the headlight generator above the firebox instead of on the smoke box ; the replacing of two oil lubricators by a single lubricator above the boiler ; and the fact that the sand dome , instead of being separate , is inclosed by the rear steam - dome casing .
c. Data on Locomotives of Class " 44 , " " 50 , " and " 52 "
Class " 44 " " 50 " " 52 " Wheel arrangement 2-10 - 0 2-10-0 2-10 -0
Weight of locomotive , empty ( long tons ) 99.5 80 82 Weight of tender , empty ( long tons ) 28.6 26 18 Water capacity of tender ( gal ) 7,930 6,870 8,980 Fuel capacity of tender ( long tons ) 10 8 10 No. of cylinders 3 2 2 Diameter of cylinders ( in ) 23 5/8 23 5/8 23 5/8 Piston stroke ( in ) 26 26 26 Driving - wheel diameter ( in ) 55 1/8 55 1/8 55 1/8 Leading - wheel diameter ( in ) 33 1/2 33 1/2 33 1/2

Superheater heating surface ( sq ft ) 1,076 685 685 Maximum speed ( mph ) 50 50 50
* Information as received .
This converts to 3,314 and 3,229 pounds per square inch , which is much too high .
Probably should be pounds per square inch instead of kilograms per square centimeters .
** This is probably evaporative heating surface .
d. Comments on Data and Weights
As shown in the table , the locomotive class " 52 " without water in the boiler is 2 tons heavier than class " 50 , " contrary to some accounts that both are of same weight .
The class " 52 " tender is lighter , but has a larger fuel and water capacity .
The main reduction in weight obtained in class " 52 " is effected by adopting the frameless tender of welded construction , mounted on two trucks with roller bearing axles .
The lower portion of the tender is of half - round cross section ; the upper portion is flat sided with a curved roof plate .
The elimination of the feed water heater effects a reduction in weight of 2,100 pounds , while a further reduction is obtained by simplified rods , substituting cleats for the lock on the smoke - box door , reducing the number of parts in the locomotive , and probably by substituting welding for rivets and bolts .
Although the class " 52 " locomotive is believed to be actually heavier than the class " 50 " without the tender , press accounts refer to marked savings in the weight of semi- finished parts required to produce finished parts .
The following intermediate ( semi- finished ) and net ( finished ) weights can be deduced from the information given :
Weight in Tons ( 2,240 lbs ) of Semi-Finished Parts
to Construct the Locomotives
Locomotive
Tender Locomotive
and Tender Int. Net Diff. Int. Net Diff. Int. Net Diff .
Class " 50 " 123 80 43 42 26 16 165 106 59 Class " 52 " 114 82 32 26 18 8 140 100 40
If the expected output of 7,500 locomotives per year is attained , 187,500 tons of material would be saved at the 25 tons per locomotive shown in the table .
A reduction of 16 tons of the total of 25 is accounted for in the tender .
Part of the economy in weight of the locomotive is achieved by the use of drop forgings instead of hand forgings for the whole of the valve - motion gear and side rods , and throughout the brake rigging .
Reference is also made in German accounts to economy of material by using plain instead of forked ends in the motion gear , and by the adoption of a " gas tube in place of the firebox wrapper plate " ( probably an arched , firebox crown sheet ) .
According to German accounts , a reduction has been secured in the quantity of non-ferrous metals by using 495 pounds of copper in the class " 52 " as against 1,600 pounds in the class " 50 " locomotive .
It is claimed that 840 pounds of this reduction has been accomplished by the substitution of steel - backed for bronze - backed bearings for the 2 big -ends of the main rod and for the 10 axle bearings , and that a further saving of 55 pounds of copper is obtained by substituting a steel casing for the former bronze steam - whistle casing .
It is further claimed that 138 pounds of tin were saved in the steel - backed bearings , and 2 pounds of tin in using the steel whistle casing , although the main economy in tin as compared with the class " 44 " is the result of the replacement of plain by ball bearings for the tender axles .
e. Reduction in Labor Requirements
Careful consideration has been given in the design of the class " 52 " locomotive to economy in man-hours required for its construction .
After comparing various reports , it is estimated that a class " 52 " locomotive can be built in 24,000 man-hours , representing a building period of about 10 weeks , as against 30,000 man-hours for class " 50 " and 60,000 man-hours for class " 44 . "
The economy of 6,000 man-hours is an estimate based on the prototype model , and not a figure based on actual experience .
The 24,000 man - hour figure might possibly be attained in the largest and best - equipped plants , but it is practically certain that well over 30.000 man-hours will be required in many of the smaller European plants .
There is no doubt that a welded tender of the frameless type could be built in about half the time required for the framed type .
The wide adoption of drop forgings and changes of design to reduce machining would lead to economy in labor .
The following table compiled from data in the German press shows certain features in class " 44 " and " 50 " locomotives which have been changed in the " 52 " class , with the resultant saving in intermediate weight and man-hours .
Class with
which the
" 52 " is
compared Part Remarks Intermediate

saved Class " 44 " 2 safety couplings Eliminated 128 lb 40 Class " 44 " Smoke - box door lock Replaced by cleats 181 lb 3 Class " 50 " Hand rails or running boards Nine eliminated 234 lb 12.5 Class " 44 " Bell Eliminated 33 lb 10 Class " 50 " Eight coupling rods Drop - forged instead of hand - forged 10,400 lb 632 Class " 50 " Steam dome with feed water heater Eliminated 2,100 lb 174 Class " 50 " Two smoke deflector plates Eliminated 1,950 lb 110 Class " 50 " Two connecting rods Built up from two drop forgings and rolled section , instead of hand - forged 2,600 lb 79
Reports claim a reduction in machining time of a cylinder block of from 28 to 4 hours , and it is claimed that a further reduction to 1 hour will be attained upon completion of a special machine .
A highly specialized tool for machining locomotive cylinders would be very costly to build , and it is doubtful whether the German machine - tool industry is now in a position to accept orders for such a machine .
If such tools were manufactured , only a limited number of plants could be equipped with them .
Due to the transport difficulties involved , the machined cylinders would hardly be shipped to factories distributed throughout Europe .
Too much weight need not be attached to actual figures given ; however , they show that every attempt is being made to economize in labor and speed up production .
It is stated in one report that by limiting the finish to one coat of paint , 235 man - hours have been saved .
f. Production of Class " 52 " Locomotive
A paper entitled " Estimated Main - Line Steam Locomotive Output in Axis Europe , " based on the class " 50 " design , gave an annual output of 3,400 locomotives by the end of 1942 , 4,040 by July 1943 , and 6,040 by the end of 1943 , on the assumption that all class " 44 " locomotives under construction when the plan was announced would be completed , and that all future locomotives would be of the simplified class " 50 " design .
However , the adoption of class " 52 " as standard modifies these estimates .
Although the tender or class " 52 " could be built in about half the time of the class " 50 " tender , this would not appreciably affect the relative production rates of the locomotives proper .
The following points should be considered : ( a ) modifications in design for greater output , ( b ) modifications in methods of production , and ( c ) extension of subcontracting .
The conclusion already stated on the first two points is that through these modifications , the class " 52 " engine can possibly be built in 24,000 man-hours as against 30,000 man-hours for the class " 50 " by the largest and best - equipped works , providing drop forgings are used in place of hand forgings and that they can be obtained without delay .
If the locomotives are built in a number of scattered minor works , as appears likely , such forgings will have to be obtained from outside shops in a great many cases .
Due to difficulties of regular supply , the economy in man-hours resulting from use of drop forgings will be a maximum of 10 percent and will most probably average about 5 percent .
The production of the necessary dies for the drop forgings will lead to some delays resulting in a small drop of the estimated locomotive output in first half of 1943 , followed by a rise to about 6,400 instead of 6,040 by the end of the year .
If the above assumptions are correct , the chief advantage of the new class " 52 " design over the class " 50 " will not be an increase in production , but the substitution of a sound for a defective design as a standard production model .
Considering the last point , there is very little reliable information on which to base an answer to the question whether the Germans can increase locomotive output by subcontracting beyond the present estimated 10 percent .
Reports have been received of proposals to convert the leading European locomotive works to assembly plants , with all components made either in other locomotive works or in plants not hitherto engaged on locomotive production .
If this is done , the machine capacity of selected plants would be lost or used for purposes for which the plants were not laid out .
Also , a carefully synchronized plan would have to be worked out to cover movement of parts over a transport system that is already heavily taxed .
Considering that the delivery of locomotives from some leading French works is months overdue owing to various unexpected difficulties , the required degree of synchronization would be nearly impossible to obtain .
Press accounts , apparently referring to the class " 50 " locomotive , refer to 18 percent of the total man-hours being performed by subcontractors at the present time .
Such component parts of locomotives as air compressors , feed pumps , injectors , and parts of the braking apparatus have usually been obtained from an outside firm .
Some of the smaller firms obtained even the boiler from an outside source , and it is difficult to deduce whether the figure of 18 percent includes these parts or only parts normally manufactured by the locomotive builder .
Some European works have always made a practice of subcontracting locomotive tenders , and a few have subcontracted boilers .
Until it is established that the 18 percent is in fact over and above the figure accounted for by subcontracting before the war , the figure of 10 percent additional output obtained by subcontracting should be used when estimating total output .
g. Utility Value of the Class " 52 " Locomotive
The conclusion drawn from published data and photographs is that the class " 52 " locomotive appears to be of sound design throughout , and should have a useful life comparable with prewar engines .
The elimination of the feed water heater at a sacrifice of approximately 7 percent in thermal efficiency will increase fuel costs but reduce maintenance .
The elimination of safety couplings and bell , and the use of thin tires , are justifiable in wartime , and there will be no difficulty in changing these parts at a later date .
There is no evidence that the class " 52 " ; ocomotive has been designed for a short working life .
The retention of extension piston rods to reduce cylinder wear on class " 52 " is direct evidence to the contrary .
From the viewpoint of normal continental practice the class " 52 " is a light model of moderate power , suitable for operating branch lines and local services , but not suitable for heavy , main - line post - war traffic in the Reich .
From German accounts , the construction of the class " 42 " is to be initiated in 1944 for heavy service .
This class has never previously been built in quantity but it is thought to be comparable in performance to the class " 44 . "
It is thought probable that if the class " 42 " is built , the class " 52 " locomotives will also be continued in construction .
THE DEAN of Manchester Cathedral has condemned the British National Party after the extremists picketed a service at Manchester Cathedral on Sunday .
Members of the far right wing group - whose followers have been branded ' Nazi thugs ' by political leaders - gathered outside the cathedral on Sunday with loudhailers , playing tunes like ' Rule Britannia ' and handing out leaflets that said : ' Judas Archbishops Betray Ordinary People ' , in response to Church of England warnings that the party is divisive in the run-up to the European Parliament elections .
Shocked worshippers were met by the protesters as they filed out of the church , forcing the Dean of the Cathedral , the Very Revd Rogers Govender , to come out and confront them .
The BNP leaflet described the bishops as ' cowardly yes men , functionaries and time servers ' .
The leaflet quotes from the bible , adding ' archbishops may betray us , but God will not ' , and calls for a BNP ' day of prayer ' .
Speaking afterwards Dean Govender , said ; " Manchester Cathedral is a place of tolerance with an inclusive Christian community .
" It seems odd that the BNP , feeling threatened by these values , decided to picket an act of Christian worship with loudspeakers and offensive leaflets .
" We are proud to be part of the Hope Not Hate campaign ; we reject the teachings of the BNP and believe Jesus would reject the BNP as well .
" We hope this incident will remind good people what little respect the BNP has for Greater Manchester and its communities . "
A spokesman for anti-fascist campaigners Searchlight said : " This shows the sheer desperation gripping Nick Griffin 's campaign .
" He clearly sees his hopes of a European seat slipping through his fingers .
What kind of person would subject churchgoers attending a peaceful Sunday service this diatribe of prejudice and hate " .

On Thursday morning , a sunny day in Shrewsbury , Griffin makes small talk as we drive in his Mondeo estate to a garden centre : " Normally we'd do this in a pub but it 's too early for that . "
From the moment we meet , there is an unspoken compact : he has never met me before but does not flinch or blanch when he does .
I refuse to be shocked or angered , regardless of how sweeping or wild his claims about race .
At Dobbie 's Garden Centre , less than five minutes ' drive out of Shrewsbury , the BNP leader and I share a table .
I sip black coffee , he swigs from a bottle of James White 's apple juice .
We talk about the BNP 's election to two seats – North - West England for him and Yorkshire and Humberside for Andrew Brons – in the European Parliament ; about being pelted with eggs ; racism ; whether his party deserves to be ignored because its views are abhorrent , or whether non-supporters should be told what he stands for and make up their own minds .

Is he a racist ?
The denial is out of his mouth before I finish the question .
Does he have a problem personally with me because I am black ?
" None at all . "
So why does he want to give me £ 50,000 to leave Britain ?
" This country is the most overcrowded in Europe . "
He argues that by paying non-whites to go away he is actually working to preserve racial diversity .
So , why are people throwing eggs at him ?
He laughs , nervously .
" Obviously it 's the immigration , race perception thereof , at one level , and also quite simply the people throwing eggs , the Union of Anti-Fascists , is based on the Communist Party , a little group of hardline Stalinists who 've never really changed their views .
So there 's an ideological opposition , and racism is merely an excuse , or alleged racism is merely an excuse . "
This is a recurrent theme .
He is beset by enemies on all sides , including the hard left , smug liberal elitists and and nutty neo -Nazis .
The last , he claims , have not forgiven him for distancing himself from his public statements of a decade ago , the Holocaust denial that saw him convicted in 1998 .
" The BNP has changed enormously , and in the course of changing enormously I 've made myself literally the most unpopular person with Britain 's neo -Nazis in the entire world . "
Griffin grew up in Barnet , north London , where his mother walked him to school together with a West Indian neighbour and her children .
At the age of eight he moved to Southwold , Suffolk .
His father , Edgar , was a Conservative councillor who provided right - wing books for his son to read and took his family to National Front meetings .
In 1975 , the younger Griffin joined and became close to the party 's national organiser , Martin Webster .
He went to Cambridge , where he gained a boxing blue .
He lost an eye in 1990 when a shotgun cartridge exploded in a fire in France .
In 1995 he joined the BNP .
He took over as leader in 1999 , ousting its founder , John Tyndall , in a coup .
A year earlier he was convicted of incitement to racial hatred after publishing material that denied the Holocaust .
In 2005 , he was tried , then retried and acquitted a year later , for alleged incitement to racial hatred .
Recently , he has started an autobiography – " names have been changed to protect the guilty " he laughs .
He has spent the past 10 years changing the party 's image from a pack of violent thugs to something electable , softening its stance on repatriation and inter-racial marriage in an effort to make the BNP less nasty – not anti-black , but pro-English .
So , how would he feel if I moved in next door ?
He laughs , nervously again , and points out there is no house next door to his detached stone farmhouse home 10 miles from Welshpool .
" In simple terms , if you moved in next door it would n't bother me in the slightest .
One family does n't make any difference at all but , erm , where does it stop ? "

So if I moved next door and my brother the other side , then that would trouble you ?
" Well , then that would concern me because , historically , in the 1970s I spent a lot of time in the old East End with the old community , and it was a wonderful place : poor , rough and ready , but extraordinarily hospitable and really good people with an identity of their own .
" Some of them are still there , and there 's an enormous amount of really bitter hostility towards mass immigration in the old , white East End .
They do n't even vote for us ; they 're so alienated by the process they simply do n't bother .
If that was done to any other ethnic group , at the very least the liberal elite would be saying this is a terrible shame .
In fact they 'd want to stop it . "
Sitting in his suit and tie , with neatly combed hair and trotting out psephological jargon , he comes across as a sort of racist version of Tony Blair : coolly spouting dodgy dossiers of misinformation to justify a " war " against weapons of mass immigration and miscegenation .
Most people do n't believe him ; we 're not sure whether he sincerely believes himself , but he 's going to keep pushing his line for as long as he can .
At the moment he is trying to soft - sell repatriation .
" We 're not talking about turfing everybody out .
We 're talking about encouraging some to go .
It would benefit them if we did a proper , sensible deal with countries that have suffered hugely from brain - drain , with people coming here – it's the final form of colonialism .
Instead of stealing , erm , gold and old statues , we steal the people and best brains , and the countries suffer as a result .
" We would help to stabilise all sorts of countries if some of their nationals or people who originate from there returned to their homelands with some of the skills that they 've learnt here and applied them to make those a better place instead of coming here because it 's convenient for Britain and easier than training our own people . "
Xenophobia as humanitarianism is just one of his verbal gymnastics .
Why does he want me out of Britain so badly ?
" Large - scale multi-cultural , multi-racial societies are clearly seen to be fundamentally unstable .
They only work when there 's some repressive force to keep them in place .
When the force is removed you get something like the former Yugoslavia or Rwanda .
All the real horrors of human society are based on two tribes going to war .
" I would say in 30 years it 's inevitable that Europe will face a decision which is absolutely unavoidable between whether Europe will continue on the lines it is , which is founded on Christianity ... a choice between that and becoming an Islamic caliphate .
There 's no question about it , the government figures show it . "
What would he do , then , if one of his three daughters brought home someone like me ?
" I would be as disappointed , as I know many Sikhs , Hindus and black people would be , and I 'd talk to them both about it , try and put them off .
But in the end that 's their business .
" Children grow up and do their own thing .
I would n't go as far as , say , someone from the orthodox Jewish community could well do , which is to hold a funeral , a symbolic funeral for them .
But I would ask you again – unless you 're going to condemn the Chief Rabbi , Jonathan Sacks , for writing a book called Will We Have Jewish Grandchildren ?
– do n't call me a racist , or some kind of wicked bigot , for saying I would be very disappointed . "
Here lies a clue to his single - handed conversion of the BNP into electability over the past 10 years : while what he says is frequently outrageous , deeply racist and often factually dubious , the way he says it – pointing to other ethnic groups allegedly acting in the same way – is designed to appear as devoid of malice , and simply an appeal for an equal hearing .
Colour , he claims , is being replaced by culture .
Muslims , he says , are a community with whom everyone has a problem .
I point out I do n't have a particular problem with Muslims .
But he does , and he expounds at length about it .
He believes there is a fault line in British society .
" The fault line is n't colour : Enoch Powell got that wrong .
The fault line is between Islam and the rest .
Islam will conquer Europe .
It wo n't do it through guns : it will just do it through having lots of children . "
He blithely claims Muslims routinely groom young , non-Muslim girls for sex , that the Koran is a manual for the overthrow of the West .
I cannot let this pass : surely he does n't believe any of that .
It 's nonsense is n't it ?
" Nope .
There 's an utter gulf of comprehension between us , is n't there ? "
I point out that the vast majority of people in this country are either highly antipathetic towards him or just apathetic .
A minority may support him , but they are out of touch with reality .
Most sensible people ignore the BNP or think they 're a bunch of crazy folk .
" Your perception of a vast number thinking we 're a bunch of dangerous crazies is coloured by the fact that your work colleagues , the social circles you mix in and so on [ are liberal ] – a self - reinforcing groupthink thing . "
I suggest that he can't stop multiculturalism , and he spirals off into fantasy .
" If we 'd been sat in café anywhere from East Berlin to the Urals in 1988 , anyone who was of the mindset of Pravda , Izvestia and so on would have said you can't stop Communism .
Inevitability is the chief weapon of totalitarianism , and we do live in a totalitarian society . "
Can he see why some people might think he was like King Canute trying to hold back the tide of multi-culturalism ?
" You may well be right .
I could have a more comfortable life if I went along with the flow and said ' yes , it 's inevitable ' .
Do you think I should just pass by on the other side of the road and let it happen ?
Why should I do that ?
" So yeah , we may not win .
I do n't believe we have a God - given right to win or come to power .
It 's not even likely .
But the more successful we become , the more opponents will have to co-opt our policies . "
Why such outbursts ?
Did black children steal his lunch at school or beat him ?
" I do n't hate or have any problem with black people other than I hope very much that they remain black people .
Other than I hope their children will look as black as they are , and as different and as interesting .
And where it does n't happen : it 's not my business .
No , I have n't got a problem , so where does it come from ?
I do n't really know . "

Should we ignore the BNP , denying it the oxygen of publicity , or engage , thereby giving it a platform ?

Not a lot of people have been mentioning Tenk ’s previous SCF Game 7 .
You know , when he scored both goals in a 2 - 1 Cup - winning game for the Lightning over the Flames ?
So I ca n’t wait to see if he can duplicate that feat tonight .
What IS cool is this story , sent to me by Kristin , of Tenk hanging out with his stepsons prior to leaving for Detroit and the last game of the season .
His wife Debbie , pictured here with him and some sweet dogs , has three sons , one of which is older than Sidney Crosby , Jordan Staal , etc. , etc. , etc .
The two younger ones had a USHL tryout , and Tenk wanted to be there with them .
Nice way to take your mind off the stress involved with the looming task .
He accompanied his stepsons to a Youngstown Phantoms ’ tryout before leaving for Detroit and Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals .
Young hockey hopefuls trying out for the Youngstown Phantoms this week got a special treat on Wednesday — a member of the Pittsburgh Penguins was at the Ice Zone as his stepsons took part in the tryouts .
Ruslan Fedotenko , who plays on the same line with Penguins ’ star and fellow Russian - native Evgeni Malkin , was able to take in Wednesday ’s practice before the team heads to Detroit for Friday night ’s deciding Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals .
The Phantoms are a 16 - 20 - year - old franchise in the United States Hockey League , which will play a 32 - game home slate at the Covelli Centre starting in October .
“ I want them to play in the USHL because it is a high quality league and they will learn a lot , and that is where I started with the Sioux City , Iowa , team of the USHL [ in 1998 - 99 ] , ” said Fedotenko at the Ice Zone , where he and his wife , Debbie ( Heelan ) accompanied stepsons Larkin ( 18 ) and Derek ( 19 ) Jacobson .
Fedotenko , 30 , who hails from Kiev , Ukraine , and is in his eighth NHL season and first with the Penguins , was greeted at the Ice Zone by Alex Zoldan , the new Phantoms ’ president , and Brian Wojtowicz , head of team ’s corporate sales department .
“ It is great if you can have a Penguin visit the tryouts before the biggest game of his life and watching his stepsons try out for the team , “ said Zoldan .
Fedotenko said he and his wife have another stepson , Kyle ( 22 ) , who played club hockey for the University of Iowa and just recently graduated .
Awesome .
I stole that top picture from this place .
Here ’s more , which are just unbelievably great .
May 21 , 2009 -- Democracy Now ! --
The Nigerian military has been accused of killing hundreds , maybe thousands , of civilians in the oil - rich Niger Delta .
The military offensive began eight days ago ( May 13 , 2009 ) but has received little international attention .
We go to Nigeria to speak with Denzil Amagbe Kentebe of the Ijaw National Congress .
We ’re also joined by Sandy Cioffi , director of the new documentary Sweet Crude about the Niger Delta .
The village of Oporoza , where much of the film was shot , has just been burned down .
Guests :
Denzil Amagbe Kentebe , chair of the Ijaw National Congress ( INC ) , Lagos Chapter .
Sandy Cioffi , director of the new film “ Sweet Crude . ”
During the making of the film , Sandy and her crew were detained by the Nigerian military and held for seven days .

JUAN GONZALEZ : We turn now to Nigeria , where the Nigerian military continues to carry out attacks by land , air and sea on the oil - rich Niger Delta .
Reports indicate hundreds , possibly thousands , of Nigerian civilians may be dead .
Entire villages have reportedly been burned to the ground .
The military offensive began eight days ago but has received little international attention .
Aid groups and journalists have been blocked from entering the remote region , which is accessible only by boat .
On Wednesday , a coalition of environmental and human rights groups called on the International Criminal Court to launch an immediate investigation into the killings .
The Nigerian military has claimed the attacks have only targeted militant camps as part of a peace - keeping effort .
AMY GOODMAN : For years , activist groups in the Niger Delta have advocated for fair distribution of oil wealth to local communities in the impoverished region .
Last week , one of the main militant groups in the Niger Delta , the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , known as MEND , declared an oil war and threatened all international industry vessels that approach the region .
Eighty percent of the oil extraction in Nigeria is in the Niger Delta .
Major oil firms in the area include Shell and Chevron .
We ’re joined right now by Denzil Amagbe Kentebe .
He ’s on the phone from Nigeria , chair of the Ijaw National Congress , Lagos chapter .
He is from Bayelsa State , the site of the ongoing military attacks .
We welcome you to Democracy Now !
Can you describe what is happening at this point ?
DENZIL AMAGBE KENTEBE :
Well , what has happened at this point is that there ’s a lot of criminal , unjustified and inconsiderate , callous action , which tends to be genocidal , by the Nigerian military on the people of the Niger Delta region .
Women and children have been displaced .
The military is saying they are restricting their actions only to the militant camps , that civilians do not live in the militant camps .
And we have thousands and thousands and thousands of people being displaced , being killed , and no one is allowed to go into the war zone , because this is a war .
And this is genocidal , as I have said earlier on .
JUAN GONZALEZ : And , Denzil , what has been the reason that the government has given for this offensive ?
DENZIL AMAGBE KENTEBE :
Well , the government does n’t really have any reason .
They are claiming that the militants have been disrupting the oil flow .
And what the citizens of the Niger Delta region are claiming is that 80 percent of the oil , of the crude oil , that flows from the country comes from this region .
But there is no development .
There is no potable drinkable water .
There is no infrastructure in place .
And so , these people are demanding that , you know , you should do something in this area .
That is a crime of the people that have been killed by the Nigerian military .
AMY GOODMAN : Describe exactly what the actions are , what communities are under siege right now .
And what are the numbers you understand of people who have been killed ?
DENZIL AMAGBE KENTEBE :
Well , people that have been killed , as of the last count yesterday , we have almost 500 people , civilians , men and women , children , dead .
Yesterday , a woman and a little boy were shot dead in the city of Warri , which is far away from any of the militant camps .
The burning and destruction is completely going on in Okerenkoko , Oporoza , Kunukunuama , Kurutie and many other places around the Niger Delta region , especially in the Delta State area .
JUAN GONZALEZ : What about human rights groups ?
Have they been allowed at all , or international aid organizations , to enter the region ?
DENZIL AMAGBE KENTEBE :
No , when this started about nine days ago , we foresaw what was a deliberate , calculated attempt to destroy the people of this region for their oil .
And we immediately called on the United Nations and all international agencies to come to our aid .
So far , no one has been in here , no one has called , and no one is even allowed in the area , even the local press .
The military is saying they are not destroying , but they have no evidence to prove otherwise .
We have gotten information from the citizens that have been displaced .
Thousands and thousands of people are living in the forest , as we speak .
Without access to any kind of food , water , clothing , they ’re living in the big forest , as we speak , children inclusive .
AMY GOODMAN : And what has been the reaction right now ?
What is the Nigerian government saying ?
DENZIL AMAGBE KENTEBE :
Well , the Nigerian government is very lackadaisical about this .
To them , it ’s twelve military men were killed , according to them .
And as such , they are going to raze down all these communities .
They are more interested [ inaudible ] being deprived in oil funds than the number of people that have been killed .
There was an executive council meeting yesterday where nothing was discussed about the civilians that were killed , that have been killed in this process .
And that is unjustifiable .
That is callous .
[ inaudible ]
AMY GOODMAN : We ’re going to go to break , then come back to this story .
Denzil Amagbe Kentebe , chair of the Ijaw National Congress , the Lagos chapter , is speaking to us from Nigeria .
This is Democracy Now ! , democracynow.org , the War and Peace Report .
Back in a minute .

AMY GOODMAN : We ’re continuing to talk about Nigeria .
We want to turn now to an excerpt from a new documentary called Sweet Crude .
It ’s by Sandy Cioffi .
SANDY CIOFFI : Oil was discovered in the Niger Delta in the last days of British colonial rule in the late 1950s .
When the British left , their colonial power structure remained .
That was the same moment that the oil companies were coming in to set up their own system .
They began funneling billions of dollars into a succession of military governments in exchange for the promise of extracting oil in an unregulated environment .
MICHAEL WATTS :
For thirty years , oil companies did exactly what they wanted to , because they had the backing of military governments who did n’t ask anything of them , except that they had the oil continuing to flow .
After fifty years then , and after 700 billion or more dollars of oil revenues , the Niger Delta is one of the most polluted landscapes on the face of the earth .
SANDY CIOFFI : On my first visit , the NAGS students taught me that the rain that falls every afternoon in the Delta is toxic enough to destroy a metal roof or fishing net .
This acid rain is a consequence of the ubiquitous gas flaring .
They explained that the shorelines covered in toxic sludge had once been white sand beaches and that people in the Delta used to live well into their sixties .
After fifty years of oil production , life expectancy has dropped to forty .
CHRIS EKIYOR : Before the coming of oil , we had good fishes , good rich estuaries , good coastal land .
We had no pipe - borne water ; we had fresh water that was floating , unpolluted , that our parents and our grandparents had .
And we held it .
They were just living , and they were getting by .
And then this thing called oil came .
ORONTO DOUGLAS : In the Niger Delta , we have been colonized by the Nigerian elite , by the corporations .
Their strategy is to get the whole of the people in taking this oil without any form of resistance .
But that is not going to be possible , because our people — these are our ancestral homes .
We will prefer to die on this land of our ancestors than surrender it because of oil and gas , which is a very temporary resource .
In twenty to thirty years , or thereabout , there will be no more oil .
The land will be left devastated , the waters polluted , the people angry , hungry , because there will be no land where they can fish and farm .
AMY GOODMAN : An excerpt of Sandy Cioffi ’s film called Sweet Crude , as we turn now to another clip from her film .
It ’s about what ’s going on in the Niger Delta .
MICHAEL WATTS :
It feels to me like it ’s stuck , and yet it ’s at a tipping point .
And it could be really a disaster , depending on which way it tips .
I think it ’s going to take something pretty dramatic , actually , and it could be dramatic in the sense of being a tragedy , or it could be an individual or collective act of extraordinary bravery and courage and innovation .
Either of those could happen .
CHRIS EKIYOR : So , we ’re looking like a time bomb .
A time bomb .
And when it blows , it ’s going to blow us all away .
Everybody will be involved .
UNIDENTIFIED : Today , we have a very delicate situation , a situation that is waiting to explode anytime in the Delta .
Even if you move in the military to wipe out those young men who are carrying guns , I can rest assure the world that maybe the children that are going to be born today will carry guns tomorrow .
OMOYELE SOWORE :
There ’s a limit to the amount of beating the human body and spirit , you know , and resilience can take before it turns into resistance .
And that ’s what has happened , you know .
This is what they planted , and now they are reaping it .
CHRIS EKIYOR : There ’s two things that can happen .
We all get together and look for peace , nonviolently .
Or the world sits by and watches and thinks it ’s a Nigerian problem .
Nobody wants war .
This is the time that the world should get together for peace .
AMY GOODMAN : Excerpts of Sandy Cioffi ’s film Sweet Crude , as we go back for a final comment to Denzil Amagbe Kentebe .
What do you think needs to happen right now ?
Denzil Kentebe is chair of the Ijaw National Congress , Lagos chapter , speaking to us from Nigeria .
DENZIL AMAGBE KENTEBE : Nigerian government needs to allow international humanitarian organizations to come into this region to at least take care of the wounded , take away the dead , and take care of our children , and begin a process of developing these areas , so the people who have been displaced can go right back to their homes .
We call on the youths who have been carrying arms , which we do not support , by the way — the Ijaw National Congress does not support armed struggle .
We have always believed in dialogue .
And we have been dialoguing with the Nigerian government to date .
So we call on all those carrying arms , both the military and the youths that are agitating , to drop their arms for the sake of peace .
That ’s my last comment .
AMY GOODMAN : We ’re going to turn now to Sandy Cioffi .
Sandy Cioffi is joining us from Seattle , Washington , director of the film Sweet Crude .
On Wednesday , as we were saying , the village of Oporoza , where much of Sweet Crude was filmed , was burned down .
Sandy , the latest news you have from the area and why you focused in Sweet Crude , of course , before this latest attack , on that area ?
SANDY CIOFFI : Well , I focused in the area that I did , because the Gbaramatu Kingdom is typical of the Niger Delta , which is to say that like the conditions you heard earlier , the people there really have no drinking water , hospitals , etc. , though billions of dollars come out of the ground , but most importantly because this moment , as you heard , is such a tipping point .
And I do n’t think there could be a more tragic piece of news than to hear that instead of preventive diplomacy , that now the Nigerian military has decided to actually go ahead and open fire in the way that they have .
JUAN GONZALEZ : And , Sandy , as we were speaking to Denzil Amagbe Kentebe , he was telling us about what ’s happening there now .
When you were filming , what kind of interaction did you have with the Nigerian government ?
And what kind of restrictions did they place , if any , on you when you were filming ?
SANDY CIOFFI : Oh , well , they actually detained me in military prison at one point , so that was very restrictive .
It is not a government that is very friendly to journalists , to say the least .
They ’ve actually been named by Reporters Without Borders one of the press freedom criminals .
And the Nigerian government , as you may know , is really a newly democratic government .
It has been a military dictatorship for years , and that legacy continues .
It ’s , largely speaking — the Niger Delta , that is — an occupied land .
And I think what ’s very disappointing right now is that there were steps .
There was a report called a Technical Committee report .
And although that sounds quite dry , understand that from the perspective of the international community and some very strong leadership , I want to say , by Senator Russ Feingold on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , there was actually a move toward pushing , especially as we entered a new State Department and new administration here , pushing the Nigerian government toward demilitarizing the Delta , toward amnesty for militants , toward third - party mediation .
So , what the Nigerian government is currently engaged in is flouting completely what my understanding is of both the Obama administration ’s position on Nigeria as well as what was an understanding with Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
AMY GOODMAN : Sandy , I want to ask you about the militant leader known as Tompolo .
According to many press reports , he is one of the targets of the current offensive by the Nigerian military .
As a leader of MEND , or the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , he has been accused of carrying out kidnappings and attacks .
You interviewed Tompolo on the condition you did n’t film his face .
I just want to play part of what he said .
This is from your documentary , Sweet Crude .
TOMPOLO : [ translated ]
We are not in this for money , for our own personal self .
We are a people invested in a cause .
And that cause is to liberate our people from abject poverty and deprivation in the midst of plenty .
We are not violent people .
We did not start the struggle with arms and guns .
It is not part of our philosophy to use guns and weapons .
But the multinational corporations of Shell and Chevron , with the collaboration of the federal government , have given the struggle arms .
They introduced guns into our radius .
Anytime we rise up to make demands , they send the Nigerian military to suppress us , to kill our people .
And , of course , you will agree with me , you cannot sit down and fold your hands and watch your people be killed and destroyed .
AMY GOODMAN : Sandy Cioffi , director of the new film Sweet Crude , speaking to us from Seattle .
Tompolo , tell us about him .
SANDY CIOFFI : Well , Tompolo has long been considered one of the leaders of a more political aspect of the movement .
As you can understand , in an area where you have the amount of money and the amount of corruption that you do , stemming mostly from the Nigerian government in collusion with oil companies — and this is decades - old — you actually have had companies that have armed young groups against each other in their interests in keeping control over the Niger Delta .
And as one might expect , there has been resistance .
And in that resistance , there have been several leaders along the way .
Tompolo is a leader in an area called Delta State .
Now , it ’s certainly not mine to judge whether the choice to be involved in an armed resistance is the correct choice .
When I asked him about Nelson Mandela , he said that he hoped that a move toward a political struggle could really occur , but that at the time the feeling was that without arms , that the people of the Niger Delta were laid to bear against the Nigerian military .
I think that Tompolo ’s position at the time , that I think remained the case , was the request that the international community intervene so that a ceasefire was something that would be trustworthy .
I think to simply request that the militants no longer use guns , when the Nigerian military is occupying their villages , was considered unreasonable .
AMY GOODMAN : In April 2006 , militants from the Niger Delta kidnapped six foreign oil workers and held them for two weeks .
One of the oil workers kidnapped , Mason Hawkins , was a contractor for Shell .
He appears in the documentary Sweet Crude .
MASON HAWKINS :
They wanted us to , you know , look at these little villages .
They all had dirt floors .
And there was no schools .
It was a pitiful life to live .
I did n’t like being a captive .
But then , looking back on it , I think those people did what they thought they had to do to try to get , you know , something out of all of that billions of dollars .
And I can ’t — I can’t hold it against them .
They want their fair share .
And they ’ll tell you right quick what they want .
And it ’s not unreasonable .
AMY GOODMAN : Mason Hawkins .
Final comment , Sandy Cioffi ?
Also , you ’ve called for a International Criminal Court investigation ?
SANDY CIOFFI : Yes .
I think , as Mason Hawkins is saying , you know , some people call it the resource , others say the petroleum - poverty paradox .
Obviously , water and oil do n’t mix , but blood and oil sadly commingle very easily .
And this is a moment that I would ask that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the American president , in concert with the international community , call for an immediate ceasefire , so that the Red Cross , which I understand is trying to make their way from Warri into the creeks , as well as other aid groups , could get in to help civilians and so that there could be an immediate call for international mediation and peace talks .
AMY GOODMAN : Sandy Cioffi , I want to thank you very much for being with us , director of the new film Sweet Crude .
SANDY CIOFFI : Thank you .
AMY GOODMAN : In the coming days , we will look at the trial against Shell around the execution , the state execution , of Ken Saro - Wiwa that actually occurred November 10th , 1995 .
And we ’ll be bringing you that in the next few days .
Over the past six months , we heard different bits ’n’pieces of information when it comes to GT300 , nVidia ’s next - gen part .
We decided to stay silent until we have information confirmed from multiple sources , and now we feel more confident to disclose what is cooking in Santa Clara , India , China and other nV sites around the world .
GT300 is n’t the architecture that was envisioned by nVidia ’s Chief Architect , former Stanford professor Bill Dally , but this architecture will give you a pretty good idea why Bill told Intel to take a hike when the larger chip giant from Santa Clara offered him a job on the Larrabee project .
Thanks to GDGTPreview , we managed to complete the puzzle what nVidia plans to bring to market in couple of months from now .
What is the GT300 exactly ?
Even though it shares the same first two letters with the GT200 architecture [ GeForce Tesla ] , GT300 is the first truly new architecture since SIMD [ Single - Instruction Multiple Data ] units first appeared in graphical processors .
GT300 architecture groups processing cores in sets of 32 – up from 8 in GT200 architecture .
But the difference between the two is that GT300 parts ways with the SIMD architecture that dominate the GPU architecture of today .
GT300 Cores rely on MIMD - similar functions [ Multiple - Instruction Multiple Data ] – all the units work in MPMD mode , executing simple and complex shader and computing operations on - the - go .
We ’re not exactly sure should we continue to use the word “ shader processor ” or “ shader core ” as these units are now almost on equal terms as FPUs inside latest AMD and Intel CPUs .
GT300 itself packs 16 groups with 32 cores – yes , we ’re talking about 512 cores for the high - end part .
This number itself raises the computing power of GT300 by more than 2 x when compared to the GT200 core .
Before the chip tapes - out , there is no way anybody can predict working clocks , but if the clocks remain the same as on GT200 , we would have over double the amount of computing power .
If for instance , nVidia gets a 2 GHz clock for the 512 MIMD cores , we are talking about no less than 3TFLOPS with Single - Precision .
Dual precision is highly - dependent on how efficient the MIMD - like units will be , but you can count on 6 - 10 x improvement over GT200 .
This is not the only change – cluster organization is no longer static .
The Scratch Cache is now much more granular and looks like L1 cache organization , allowing for larger interactivity between the cores inside the cluster .
GPGPU e.g. GPU Computing applications should really benefit from this architectural choice .
When it comes to gaming , the question is obviously – how good can GT300 be ?
Please do bear in mind that this 32 - core cluster will be used in next - generation Tegra , Tesla , GeForce and Quadro cards .
This architectural change should result in dramatic increase in Dual - Precision performance , and if GT300 packs enough registers – performance of both Single - Precision and Dual - Precision data might surprise all the players in the industry .
Given the timeline when nVidia begun work on GT300 , it looks to us like GT200 architecture was a test for real things coming in 2009 - 2010 timeframe .
Just like the CPU , GT300 gives direct hardware access [ HAL ] for CUDA 3.0 , DirectX 11 , OpenGL 3.2 and OpenCL .
You can also do direct programming on the GPU , but we ’re not exactly sure would development of such a solution that be financially feasible .
But the point in question is that now you can do it .
It looks like Tim Sweeney ’s prophecy is slowly , but certainly – coming to life .

Mark Cavendish saunters through the chic minimalism of the St Martins Lane hotel in central London with a messy grin plastered across his face .
He waves cheerily and shouts " Hello , mate , " in a gravelly Isle of Man bark .
" Great to see you again , " he says , stretching out his hand and sounding nothing like the bolshiest and most driven man in British sport .
A year ago , when we last met , on the eve of his second Tour de France , Cavendish was blunt and fierce – promising he would win at least one stage as well as an Olympic gold medal in Beijing .
Cavendish revered the gruelling demands of the Tour far more than the populist appeal of the Olympics , and he ended up winning four stages in France .
He was denied even a medal in Beijing , where he was furious with the British track team and Bradley Wiggins , his partner in the Madison , but Cavendish has moved on .
Apart from winning three stages at this year 's Giro d'Italia he also entered his first classic in March , the majestic Milan - San Remo race , which he won in a brutal sprint after riding with grit over some steepling climbs .
He will begin this year 's Tour , starting in Monaco on Saturday , with his position as the dominant sprinter in world cycling underpinned by an aura that amuses him – and helps explain his good mood .
" It 's so ironic that the better you get the easier it becomes to win , " he says with a throaty chuckle .
" The space I 'm now being given by the peloton is ridiculous .
They 're looking over the shoulder to make room for me and that 's the biggest irony of all .
Instead of plotting ways to close me down it seems as if , when things get tight in the last ' k ' , someone will see me and move over so they can wave me through .
I 'm thinking , ' Should n't you at least try to beat me ? '
To be honest , it can get boring . "
A year ago Cavendish seemed to burn with righteous indignation that there were still supposedly informed people within cycling – or " dickheads " as he more pithily described them – who doubted his self - proclaimed status as the fastest man on the road .
There is no debate now ; but the peloton might be stirred by a laughing Cav suggesting that beating them all so consistently is becoming " boring " .
Cavendish shrugs .
" I 'm not getting bored with cycling or winning – I love it .
But I need to give myself new targets all the time .
And so I have bigger and bolder aims now .
I 've got everyone 's respect , but I need to keep it interesting . "
In the restaurant the slight but intensely coiled figure of Cavendish declines all offers of breakfast or even a jag of caffeine .
He 's too busy talking .
" Part of what makes me so successful , " he says , eyes suddenly blazing , " is that I never settle on anything I 've achieved .
I always set my next target . "
Cavendish starts with deceptive simplicity when listing his new ambitions .
" My short - term targets are clear .
I want to reach Paris this time , " he murmurs in reference to the fact that , after winning four of the first 14 stages last year , he pulled out of the Tour in order to prepare for the Olympics – which was why he was so angry when that commitment could not be matched by an exhausted Wiggins , who was trying to win his third gold medal .
" I also want to win green , " he says , referring to the jersey worn by the Tour de France cyclist who wins most points as a sprinter .
" This year , realistically , it 's only a possibility .
Next year , and the year after that , the green jersey is a probability .
" But the dream can become a target because the way the Tour is set out this year it 's basically either a sprint or a mountain stage .
Green is usually about consistency but this year it 's different .
So that bodes well for my chances .
If you normally go for green you have to sprint more conservatively – you have to be content with fourth and fifth places .
I do n't like that .
I always go for broke .
It 's win or nothing for me .
But , maybe , this year the green on Tour might suit me .
It could even come without me actually targeting it .
That would be fantastic . "
The extent to which Cavendish reveres cycling history can be heard in his evocative description of his Milan - San Remo victory .
" When you grow up as a cycling fan , as a connoisseur , you understand why that race means more than the Tour de France .
You appreciate the classics the most .
For any young rider even competing in the San Remo is one of the biggest things – but to win it is beyond emotion .
You ca n't put it into words . "
Cavendish , briefly , covers his face .
He looks out from behind the slatted windows of his fingers and says , huskily : " I still sit back and go , ' Fuck , I can't believe I 've won it .
It 's just beautiful . ' "
His win was marked by a cry of desolation from Heinrich Haussler as Cavendish flashed past him at the death .
" It was sheer anguish because he knew I 'd beaten him by 15 cm . "
That reflection prompts another sincere tribute from Cavendish to the efforts of his team - mates at Columbia .
" We 've got an amazing group who all want the same thing .
In our team we 've got so many different nationalities and that tells you everything .
Usually , if it's a German or French sponsor they want lots of German or French riders .
For the brand it makes sense , but you 're not going to get much coverage if you 're unsuccessful .
Our team prides itself on ability rather than nationality . "
That endorsement clashes with the aims of the UK cycling gurus , led by Dave Brailsford , trying to compete next year in the Tour with a wholly British Team sponsored by Sky .
Cavendish smiles thinly when asked if he would feel any additional delight should he , one day , win Tour stages in a team full of British cyclists .
" No .
If I was a mediocre sprinter I might feel that – but I 'm the fastest in the world .
I 'm the most in - demand sprinter in the world .
My nationality is irrelevant .
Whenever Team
Sky is mentioned now , I 'm mentioned – but I 'm not in demand because of my nationality .
I 'm in demand because of my ability . "
Could anything entice him to leave Columbia for Team Sky ?
" Look , if the British team , in 10 years time , is the best team in the world , I 'll be there .
In two years time if a French team is the best team in the world , I 'll be there .
But at the minute Columbia is the best team for me .
I can guarantee that I 'm going to enjoy myself and have a successful career with them .
So all this talk about a British team is irrelevant to me .
Politically , I 'm not that interested in nationality .
For me it all boils down to ability . "
In his absorbing and often riveting new book , Cavendish trashes the contribution of some former leading members of British cycling – in particular , Simon Jones , acclaimed as the UK's coach of the year after the 2004 Olympics .
" He was a dickhead and all their scientific analysis of riders is complete bollocks when it comes to me .
They kept telling me I was n't hitting the numbers but look what 's happened since .
I could n't give a fuck about Simon Jones . "
With more warmth , he describes Brailsford , the feted performance director of British cycling , as " a media darling " .
He is also amused at the way in which Britain 's Olympic gold - medal winning track cyclists are so heavily reliant on the sports psychologist Steve Peters – who has done so much to ease the often tortured psyches of Wiggins and Victoria Pendleton , and even Chris Hoy .
" I like Steve .
But all that stuff about ' taming your inner chimp [ of negative thought ] ' is hilarious . "
What does Peters make of Cavendish 's self - belief ?
" I think he 's quite fascinated by me .
He talks a lot about me .
These are things about self - confidence people usually have to learn but I 've always done them instinctively . "
Who else in cycling has that conviction ?
" Lance Armstrong . "
As he returns to the Tour , Armstrong 's clouded reputation in France will raise the perennial controversies surrounding doping and cycling .
But Cavendish is entranced by the seven - time winner of the Tour .
" When I first read he was saying all these great things about me , I was blown away .
Any kid who grew up wanting to be a cyclist would have dreamed about being recognised by Armstrong one day .
But now I speak to him at races – I can text him .
It 's pretty surreal .
" Before the Giro I still had that awe thing but we spoke most days and it just got warmer and warmer .
Now it 's just great .
He 's going to get a lot of flak in France and I feel for him .
But he 's going to concentrate on the race because I know he still wants to win the Tour . "
Cavendish will be sprinting after the green jersey , rather than the yellow , and also revelling in the publication of his book .
" Outside of cycling , there are three things I 've always wanted – a boat , even if it 's a paddling boat , a spiral staircase in my house , and a book about me .
I 've only got the last one so far , and I 'm proud of it .
I know so many people fluff their lives up in a book to make themselves look good or to make people feel sorry for them .
But I just want to be frank and to the point .
And I want to win bike races .
I 've always said I do n't want to be known for my name .
I want to be known for my achievements .
That 's all that matters . "

City Director Erma Hendrix has long seemed a few bricks shy ( memorably , she stooged for G.W. Bush in his road show to privatize Social Security ) , but she seemingly outdid herself this week by scapegoating gay people in her latest broadside against a day center for homeless in the former Job Corps building at I - 30 and 21st .
The city has the matter under study .
Neighbors have objected .
" A lot of them are homosexuals .
They 're criminals , " Hendrix was quoted in the Democrat - Gazette in explaining her opposition to the homeless center in her ward .
It has come to our attention that in the city of Little Rock ’s quest for a location for a homeless center city Board Director Erma Hendrix has weighed in with some extremely homophobic remarks regarding a proposed location .
In response to the proposed location - the former Job Corps site , sandwiched between Interstates 30 and 630 , Director Hendrix is quoted as saying , “ A lot of them are homosexuals .
They ’re criminals . ”
This is an outrageous tactic to try and keep those most vulnerable in our society , the homeless , from having access to a center in a particular area of the city .
Scapegoating the Lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer community to support this agenda is inappropriate and inexcusable scare .
We are asking our membership to POLITELY contact Mayor Stodola and Director Hendrix and ask that these remarks be retracted and that an apology is issued to our community .
And finally urge the city to support the implementation of a homeless center as soon as possible .
Les bans sont publiés à la mairie du 20e arrondissement de Paris depuis le 6 juin , parmi ceux d'une dizaine d'autres couples .
Le mariage aura lieu , mardi 16 juin , devant la maire socialiste de l'arrondissement Frédérique Calandra dans la plus stricte intimité .
Julien Coupat et Yldune Lévy sacrifieront ainsi à l'une des plus anciennes institutions bourgeoises tout en faisant un pied de nez à la justice française .
Les deux jeunes gens , mis en examen dans l'affaire de Tarnac , étaient en effet soumis jusque - là à un strict contrôle judiciaire qui les empêchait théoriquement de se rencontrer .
Le code civil obligeant le couple marié à la vie commune , ils ont invoqué la loi pour appuyer leur demande de modification de ce contrôle judiciaire .
Le juge Thierry Fragnoli , bien conscient du ridicule qu'il y aurait à empêcher leur union , a dû lever définitivement l'interdiction de se rencontrer au couple , dans une ordonnance du 15 juin .
Le parquet ne s'y est pas opposé .
Le contrôle judiciaire spécifiait par ailleurs que Julien Coupat ne pouvait se rendre à Paris .
Cette interdiction reste valable , mais a été suspendue le temps du mariage .
En revanche , Julien Coupat ne peut toujours pas rencontrer les sept autres mis en examen dans cette affaire où il leur est reproché le sabotage de caténaires de la SNCF .

( CNN ) --
Texas billionaire Allen Stanford was taken into custody Thursday night on a fraud - related charge in Stafford , Virginia , the FBI said .
Allen Stanford , right , poses with his Antigua cricket team in November 2008 .
FBI Supervisory Special Agent M.A. Myers would not provide further details on Stanford 's arrest , but his attorney , Dick DeGuerin , told CNN that Stanford had surrendered to agents .
Stanford , accused of a $ 9.2 billion fraud by U.S. regulators , denied all wrongdoing in a tearful interview in April during which he threatened to punch his questioner in the mouth .
" I would die and go to hell if it 's a Ponzi scheme , " Stanford , who was ranked at No. 205 in Forbes magazine 's list of 400 richest Americans with assets of more than $ 2 billion , told ABC News .
The assets of Stanford and his financial groups , based in Antigua and the Caribbean , are frozen while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigates allegations he ran " a massive Ponzi scheme , " a pyramid scheme in which new investors ' money is stolen to pay profits to existing clients .
During his ABC interview , Stanford complained that he had to fly commercial airlines after the federal government confiscated his six private jets .
" They make you take your shoes off and everything , " he said .
" It 's terrible . "
Stanford threatened to punch the interviewer when he was questioned about reported links to alleged money laundering for a Mexican drug cartel , charges he vehemently denied with the threat before backing down .
Before his arrest , Stanford faced an array of civil claims .
He and his wife owe back taxes , penalties and interest of at least $ 226.5 million , the IRS said in court documents filed in Dallas , Texas , last March .
The final total could be even higher because the Stanfords have not filed their income tax return for 2007 .
The IRS says they owe $ 110 million in back taxes , $ 55.8 million in penalties and $ 60.7 million in interest for the 1999 through 2003 tax years .
The Securities and Exchange Commission has said that Stanford was behind " a fraud of shocking magnitude . "
FBI agents served Stanford with SEC papers accusing him and three of his companies of orchestrating a $ 9.2 billion investment fraud scheme .
With the filing , the IRS joins thousands of other creditors in the case who are seeking a crack at Stanford 's remaining assets .
In February Antiguan and Barbudan regulators took control of Stanford 's financial institutions on the twin- island nation , a day after federal agents served the Texas businessman with papers accusing him of running an investment fraud scheme .
In a complaint filed in February in federal court in Dallas , Texas , the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Stanford International Bank of using a network of financial advisers to sell about $ 8 billion of " certificates of deposit " to investors .
The bank boasted it had a unique investment strategy that had allowed it to reap double - digit returns on its investments for the previous 15 years , the SEC said .
The civil complaint alleged an additional scheme relating to $ 1.2 billion in sales .
Stanford 's bank claimed its network had $ 51 billion in deposits and assets under management or advisement , with more than 70,000 clients in 140 countries .
The allegations against Stanford and his companies sparked runs on Stanford banks in Antigua and in Venezuela , where the government took over the local subsidiary in February after it recorded " extraordinary " withdrawals , according to Venezuela 's superintendent of banks .
The SEC complaint also named James Davis , SIB 's chief financial officer ; Laura Pendergest - Holt , chief investment officer of Stanford Financial Group ; and investment adviser Stanford Capital Management .
Stanford , who sponsored a cricket team and series of matches in Antigua , had his ties to the sport severed earlier this year when the England and Wales Cricket Board announced it would not play any further Stanford Twenty20 matches in Antigua as well as shelving plans for the Quadrangular Twenty 20 events .
Under the deal struck between the ECB and financier Stanford last summer , England were due to play four further $ 20 million matches in the Caribbean , while the proposed Quadrangular events were scheduled to take place annually from 2009 to 2011 , with each edition worth around $ 9 million .

Volatile tennis dad Damir Dokic has foreshadowed an appeal to a European Union court after he was sentenced to 15 months in jail for threatening to blow up the Australian ambassador to Serbia and possessing illegal weapons .
Tennis star Jelena Dokic is reportedly preparing to fly to Serbia from London to support her father and could arrive in Belgrade around 8 pm Melbourne time at the earliest .
Dokic , 50 , received a 10 - month sentence on a charge of endangering the safety of Ambassador Clare Birgin and seven months for illegally owning two nail bombs and 20 bullets .
Immediately after the sentence was handed down overnight Australian time , Dokic 's lawyer , Bosiljka Djukic , indicated she would appeal to the Ruma District Court and also to EU courts in Strasbourg due to lack of faith in local authorities .
" You can make your own conclusion on whether the sentence is political , '' she told reporters as she left court .
It took three years and three generations for Apple to finally get it right , but it looks like the iPhone is finally ready to take on Research In Motion in the enterprise .
The iPhone software Version 3.0 features some of the most enterprise - friendly features we 've seen in any iPhone to date .
And its focus on design , apps and a full - featured experience ensures it will continue to be a major player in the space going forward .
Of course , RIM can't be happy about it .
That company is currently leading in the enterprise without much competition from other companies .
According to the company in its 2009 Annual Report , " The enterprise market continues to be very important to RIM 's business . "
It claimed in that report that more than 175,000 organizations are now using BlackBerry Enterprise Server behind a corporate firewall .
Its healthiest user base growth has come from the government , law enforcement , health care and education sectors .
And with the help of two new BlackBerry devices released over the past year - the BlackBerry Bold and the BlackBerry Storm - the company is doing its part to stay ahead .
But is it enough ?
Apple has slowly , but surely , made progress with its iPhone .
When it was first released in 2007 , it had few enterprise - friendly features .
Last year , with its iPhone 3G , it added faster network connectivity and an App Store that allowed developers to create business - focused apps .
But it was n't until Apple finally announced the iPhone 3.0 software that the enterprise took notice .
It features push e-mail , calendar , and contacts ; Exchange support ; copy and paste ; Spotlight search ; voice memos ; and an improved calendar .
It 's a more capable software package .
It also does n't help RIM that Apple is releasing the iPhone 3G S.
That device is reportedly twice as fast as the current iPhone 3G .
And at a price that 's relatively affordable - $ 199 for the base model - it 's not a stretch to say the iPhone 3G S is the most attractive iPhone yet .
But just how attractive is that iPhone ?
Let 's dig a little deeper to see why it 's the best choice for the enterprise when it hits store shelves next week .
The New Features
Say what you will about the BlackBerry and its enterprise support , but with the inclusion of push e-mail , calendar and contacts in the new iPhone , it 's immediately more attractive than previous versions of the software .
And thanks to Exchange support , more companies will find reasons to use it .
But there 's one feature that the iPhone finally has that makes it all the more appealing to the enterprise : tethering .
Cell phone carriers have seen a huge growth in wireless data usage .
The iPhone is selling like hotcakes , and its users generate large amounts of traffic .
Not surprisingly , as cellular providers deploy faster network technologies , users generate even more data .
Here 's data from Verizon :
Customers ' demand for more , faster connectivity is pressuring cell carriers to accelerate their timelines for deploying next generation cellular technologies ( the so - called " 4G " technologies ) .
One of the most promising of these technologies is LTE , Long Term Evolution .
LTE will provide much more bandwidth than current 3G cellular system .
Aside from speed , LTE makes a significant change to cellular networks : Voice is now an IP service .
With LTE , your handset is a voice over IP ( VoIP ) device .
This eliminates the distinction between the " phone part " of your smartphone ( voice calls , SMS , voicemail ) , and the " Internet part " ( email , web , games , etc ) .
In other words , your phone will need an IP address all the time , even just to receive voice calls .
Independently , the number of cellular subscribers is increasing rapidly .
According to the United Nations , more than 40 % of the world population has a cell phone :
One research company predicts there will be 5.2 billion cellular subscribers , worldwide , by 2011 .
Another firm estimates 2 billion new cellular subscribers by 2013 .
If even a small fraction of these are using 4G , e.g. IP - based , communication , it will place substantial strain on IP v4 address reserves .
The problem , of course , is that we 're running out of IP v4 addresses .
The IANA pool will most likely be depleted by the end of 2010 .
This has led many people to wonder if LTE deployments will require IPv6 .
Now we have an answer : Yes .
Verizon has posted specs for any LTE device that will be permitted on its LTE network .
IP v6 support is mandated .
IP v4 is optional .
That 's quite a statement , since IP v4 traffic currently dominates the Internet .
A few relevant quotes from Verizon 's spec :
" The device shall support IPv6 .
The device may support IPv4 .
IPv6 and IP v4 support shall be per the 3GPP Release 8 Specifications ( March 2009 ) " .
( section 3.2.4.1 )
and
" The device shall be assigned an IPv6 address whenever it attaches to the LTE network . " ( section 3.2.4.2 )
IP v4 support appears optional : " If the device supports IP v4 , then the device shall be able to support simultaneous IPv6 and IP v4 sessions . " ( section 3.2.4.4 )
Verizon appears to be trying to conserve IP v4 addresses by disallowing long - term address leases : " If the device supports IP v4 , the device shall request an IP v4 address if an application using the LTE bearer requests a data connection using an IP v4 address .
Once the application is closed , the IPv4 address shall be released by the device " .
( section 3.2.4.3 )
I 'm curious how this will affect handset manufacturers .
Windows Mobile and Symbian ( used in Nokia phones ) already support IPv6 .
Google is working on IP v6 support in Android .
The iPhone and Blackberry do n't currently support IPv6 .
I 'm curious if version 3.0 of the iPhone OS will add IP v6 support .

I spent the weekend with a friend who lives in a hipper , up - and - coming neighborhood .
It was an eye - opening experience .
While we were chilling out on Friday night , about 7 pm , an invisible signal went out from inconsiderate person high command : it is time to blast your loud music .
The music of choice seemed divided between hip - hop that thumps and some kind of hip - hop / heavy metal crossover that wails and then thumps .
The blasting continued until about 2 am , intermittently interrupted as people drove their cars in and out of the neighborhood , although sometimes they posted themselves somewhere to do their thumping .
It was n’t the worst experience , but I do n’t know if I ’d want to live with the constant noise especially since it ’s unnecessary noise .
You can hear the music fine at lower volumes , even pretty high volumes .
These volumes were designed to broadcast the music like an identity , and subject other people to it .
I ’ve been asking people all week : would you bypass fear of censorship to live in a quiet neighborhood ?
Meaning : would you voluntarily pay extra to live in a neighborhood that banned and enforced loud music with thumping bass , even if that infringed on someone else ’s “ freedom ” ?

Scolding Americans for our various sins is proving popular among an elite group of self - appointed moralists .
Take well - meaning environmentalists who warn us that our plush lifestyles heat up and pollute the planet .
To listen to former Vice President Al Gore or New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman , we must immediately curtail our carbon emissions - or face planetary destruction .
Yet these influential prophets of doom do not have lives remotely similar to the lesser folk they lecture to .
From time to time , Al Gore hops on a private jet - and purchases " carbon offsets " penances for the privilege .
His mansion not long ago consumed more energy in a month than the average American home does in a year .
Friedman lives on a sprawling estate reminiscent of the grandees of the 18th - century English countryside .
The rest of us would find these environmental scolds more convincing if they chose to live modestly in average tract homes .
That way they could limit their energy consumption , and provide living proof to us of how smaller is better for an endangered planet earth .
Elite critics in the business of racial grievance offer the same contradictions .
Recently , Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates got into a spat with a white policeman who arrested him in his own home for disorderly conduct .
Gates immediately cried racism .
He argued that his own plight was emblematic of the burdens that the black underclass endures daily from a racist white America .
But Gates is one of the highest paid humanities professors in the United States .
And Gates - not the middle - class Cambridge , Mass. , white cop - engaged in shouting and brought up race .
Within hours , the African - American mayor of Cambridge , the African - American governor of Massachusetts , and the African - American president of the United States , all rallied to their chum 's side .
Yet this well - connected , well - paid Harvard resident apparently wants us to believe in melodramatic fashion that he is living under something like the United States of decades ago .
Indeed , citing racial grievance at times proves a valuable asset for wealthy celebrities .
Michael Jackson and O.J. Simpson posed as victims of various racial oppressions when they found themselves in their own self - created legal problems .
Race - baiter Rev. Jeremiah
Wright simply retreats back to his three - story mansion on a golf course in between his day job of denouncing whites as exploiters .
Then we have other aristocrats on the barricades railing about the economic inequality of America .
Former Sen. John Edwards preached about " two Americas , " one poor and abandoned , one wealthy and connected .
Edwards should know since he built himself a multimillion - dollar gargantuan mansion in which he might better contemplate upon the underprivileged outside his compound .
Sen . Chris Dodd sermonizes about corporate greed and credit card companies ' near extortion .
But Dodd managed to squeeze out of the corporate world a low - interest loan , a sweetheart deal for a vacation home in Ireland , and thousands in campaign donations .
Former Sen. and Cabinet nominee Tom Daschle was a big proponent of hiking taxes to nationalize our health care system .
The problem , however , was that the populist Daschle both hated paying taxes and loved limousines - and so he avoided the former but welcomed the latter .
In the old days , critics for the most part of what we called the " system " were at least blue - collar workers , underpaid teachers or grassroots politicians whose rather modest lives matched their angry populist rhetoric .
Now the most vehement critics of America 's purported sins are among the upper classes .
And their parlor game has confused Americans about why they are being called polluters , racists and exploiters by those who have fared the best in America .
Do the wealthy and the powerful lecture us about our wrongs because they know their own insider status ensures that they are exempt from the harsh medicine they advocate for others ?
Millionaire
Gore is not much affected by higher taxes for his cap - and - trade crusade .
Or does the hypocrisy grow out of a sort of class snobbery ?
Do elites hector the crass middle class because it lacks their own taste , rare insight and privileged style ?
Judging from the police report , Gates seemed flabbergasted that the white Cambridge cop did not know who he was " messing " with .
Or is the new hypocrisy an eerie sort of psychological compensation at work ?
Perhaps the more Al Gore rails about carbon emissions , the more he can without guilt enjoy what emits them .
The more professor Gates can cite racism , the more he himself is paid to spot it .
And the more a Tom Daschle wants to tax and spend for health care , the less badly he feels about his own chauffer and tax avoidance ?
Here 's a little advice for all of America 's aristocratic critics : a little less hypocrisy , a little more appreciation of your good lives - and then maybe the rest of us will listen to you a little more .
Britney Spears obtained restraining order against stalker
Britney Spears obtained a temporary restraining order today against Miranda Tozier - Robbins , who was arrested last April 2009 for trespassing on Spears ’ property in Calabasa , California .
Tozier - Robbins was ordered by Judge Lawrence Mira to stay at least 100 yards away from the pop star and her property .
Spears ’ alleged trespasser was supposed to be arraigned this morning on two misdemeanor charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct .
After Tozier - Robbins showed up more than two hours late in the Malibu courthouse , the hearing was moved to next week .
The once “ American Idol ” hopeful announced she would be defending herself in the proceedings , but the Los Angeles Superior Judge advised her against entering a plea until the next hearing .
Her $ 5,000 bail was waived provided she returns to court next week .
Tozier - Robbins would have to wait for a week before the judges decide on returning the confiscated footage of Britney Spears .
Those in the United States living with HIV / AIDS are more likely to use marijuana than those in Kenya , South Africa or Puerto Rica to alleviate their symptoms , according to a new study published in Clinical Nursing Research , published by SAGE .
Those who did use marijuana rate it as effective as prescribed or over the counter ( OTC ) medicines for the majority of common symptoms , once again raising the issue that therapeutic marijuana use merits further study and consideration among policy makers .
A significant percentage of those with HIV / AIDS use marijuana as a symptom management approach for anxiety , depression , fatigue , diarrhoea , nausea , and peripheral neuropathy .
Members of the University of California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) International HIV / AIDS Nursing Research Network examined symptom management and quality of life experiences among those with HIV / AIDS in the US , Africa , and Puerto Rico , to gain a fuller picture of marijuana 's effectiveness and use in this population .
With data from a longitudinal , multi-country , multi-site , randomised control clinical trial , the researchers used four different evaluation tools to survey demographics , self - care management strategies for six common symptoms experienced by those living with HIV / AIDS , quality of life instrument and reasons for non-adherence to medications .
Either marijuana use for symptom management is vastly higher in the US , or participants elsewhere chose not to disclose that they use it : nine tenths of study participants who said they used marijuana live in the US .
No African participants said they used it , and the remaining ten percent were from Puerto Rico .
The researchers found no differences between marijuana users and nonusers in age , race , and education level , income adequacy , having an AIDS diagnosis , taking ARV medications , or years on ARV medications .
But the two groups did differ in that marijuana users had been HIV positive longer , and were more likely to have other medical conditions .
Transgender participants were also more likely to use marijuana .
Participants using marijuana as a management strategy were spread fairly consistent across all six symptoms , ranging from a low of 20 % for fatigue to a high of 27 % for nausea .
Prescribed medications were used by 45 % of those with fatigue , ranging down to almost 18 % of those with neuropathy .
The findings contained nuances when comparing marijuana to other medications .
Those who used marijuana rated their anxiety significantly lower than those who did not , and women who used marijuana had more intense nausea symptoms .
For those who use both marijuana and medications for symptom management , antidepressants were considered more effective than marijuana for anxiety and depression , but marijuana was rated more highly than anti-anxiety medications .
Immodium was better for diarrhoea than marijuana , as were prescribed medications for fatigue .
However , marijuana was perceived to be more effective than either prescribed or OTC medications for nausea and neuropathy .
However , the differences in perceived efficacy in all these results were slight .
As found in previous studies , those who used marijuana were less likely to comply with their regime of ARV medications .
But perhaps counter - intuitively of the many reasons given for skipping pills , ' forgetfulness ' was no different in this group than among those who did not use marijuana .
Marijuana use is known to contribute to patients ' lack of compliance with ARV drugs , however those who use marijuana to target a particular symptom are actually more likely to stick closely to their ARV regimen too .
The researchers point out that of those who used marijuana for their symptoms , it is not known whether they also used the drug for recreation .
Patterns of how marijuana use interferes with patients ' adherence to medication regimens , along with other drugs , warrant further study .
The 775 participants were recruited from Kenya , South Africa , two sites in Puerto Rico , and ten sites in the United States .
They had on average been diagnosed for a decade - the majority ( 70 % ) were taking anti-retroviral ( ARV ) medications and more than half had other medical conditions alongside HIV / AIDS .
It is hard to pinpoint the marijuana use targeted to alleviate symptoms of those other illnesses as distinct from those relating solely to HIV / AIDS .
Data suggest that marijuana is a trigger among those susceptible to psychosis , and is also associated with the risk of suicidal thoughts .
However it is not linked to an increased risk of lung cancer ( over and above risks associated with smoking it along with tobacco ) .
The question of the use of marijuana for symptom management when legal drugs are available remains a practice and policy issue .
" Given that marijuana may have other pleasant side effects and may be less costly than prescribed or OTC drugs , is there a reason to make it available ? " asks study leader Inge Corless .
" These are the political ramifications of our findings .
Our data indicate that the use of marijuana merits further inquiry . "
An actress who works in Southern California ’s pornography industry has tested positive for HIV , renewing county and state health officials ’ concerns that the adult entertainment industry lacks sufficient safety measures to prevent the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases .
The new case was confirmed to The Times and pornography industry websites Wednesday by the Adult Industry Medical Healthcare Foundation , a San Fernando Valley - based clinic that serves adult - film stars in Sherman Oaks and Granada Hills .
Public health officials , however , said no official report had been made at the state or county level .
Dr. Jonathan Fielding , health officer for Los Angeles County , said Wednesday that his office was launching an investigation .
Officials from the state Division of Occupational Safety and Health also said they will look into the circumstances of the case , which is the first publicly confirmed HIV infection in Southern California ’s porn industry since 2004 , when an HIV outbreak shut down production for four weeks .

At that time , a porn actor who had returned from working in Brazil spread the virus to three actresses who had performed with him .
A transsexual performer unrelated to the other cases also tested positive .
In the latest case , HIV tests of the woman ’s partners have been negative for the virus , according to Adult Industry Medical Healthcare Foundation officials .
Those partners are not being allowed to perform at this time and are being encouraged to test again in 14 days , said Brooke Hunter , the clinic ’s administrator .
“ This is really not a major event , ” Hunter said , adding that the infected actress had worked “ very infrequently . ”
Sharon Mitchell , the clinic ’s founder , told AVN , an adult industry website , that the clinic had recently changed its policies on disclosure of new cases .
“ What we do is just handle everything privately unless there ’s a widespread problem , ” she said .

As the clinic downplayed the positive test , public health officials cited their ongoing battle with the porn industry over the use of condoms during filming .
The two sides have been at odds for years , and despite the intense scrutiny , Fielding said he is concerned that condoms are still not being used .
“ You would n’t send someone to work on a high - rise building without a hard - hat , so why are we allowing these performers to perform without condoms ? ”
Fielding said .
Deborah Gold , a senior safety engineer with the state Occupational Safety and Health Division , said her agency repeatedly had attempted to crack down on unsafe workplaces in the adult entertainment industry , issuing several citations against employers , including a gay male production company that touted its condom - free filming .
Despite those efforts , she said , numerous investigations have found that condoms were not used and that no training had been conducted to prevent unsafe contact .

Los Angeles County has been receiving reports from the clinic of 60 to 80 new cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea a month among adult performers , Fielding said .
The clinic ’s testing protocol recommends that adult performers get screened for HIV every 30 days .
Fielding called that schedule insufficient to protect against transmission because it takes nine to 11 days after exposure for HIV to appear on test results .
“ Let ’s say you were infected on Monday , tested on Wednesday and perform on Friday .
You would show up as negative , but you ’re not negative , ” Fielding said .

Written by Ed Sutton < esutton@mindspring.com >
In April , when Somali pirates captured the MV Maersk Alabama and kidnapped the captain of the ship for four days , the news shocked many .
While earlier reports of piracy may have made the news , they did not capture the public ’s attention in the same way that this incident did .
The fact is that piracy is not just a legend from days long past , but is a dangerous trend that is actually on the upswing and for the past few years .
Read the following facts to discover what you might not know about modern - day pirates .
Weapons used .
Many modern pirates have heavy - duty firepower , including automatic weapons , mortars , and rocket - propelled grenades .
Pirates are also often equipped with cell phones and other tech gadgets to keep in contact with organizers who feed them information about ships and their locations .
Many pirates ’ weapons are specialized to their geographic location , with the most dangerous usually being in the South China Sea and Somalia .
Geographic occurrences .
With the recent news about the pirate capture off Somalia , it may appear to some that modern pirates are isolated to this geographic area .
While the political upheaval in Somalia does provide an ideal , lawless hideout for pirates , the fact is pirates are often found in many places around the globe .
Some areas most frequented by pirates include the Red Sea , the Indian Ocean , and the waters of Indonesia and Singapore .
Financial loss .
The estimated annual loss due to piracy worldwide is about $ 13 to $ 16 billion .
Unfortunately , most carriers decide not to report piracy incidents due to the financial burden .
When an incident of piracy is reported , ship owners experience insurance rates that can increase by as much as 30 % as well as the daily loss incurred during an investigation that can often run about $ 1000 a day .
Ties to government and organized crime .
Many modern pirates have ties to the government and organized crime , such as the pirates in Somalia and the Far East , with some pirates in the South China Sea reportedly working under the protection of the Chinese government .
Other pirates take advantage of a lack of government involvement , such as the pirates near Brazil , where there is no Coast Guard or its equivalent .
Anchored ships vs. high seas kidnapping .
Pirates boarding ships at sea and kidnapping the crew have been making the news but an older report suggests that 72 % of pirate attacks occur on anchored ships where the pirates either steal the ships or take cargo and crew members ’ belongings .
Recent trends show that kidnapping the crew in order to get ransom money is on the rise , as pirates cannot only profit from the ransom but stolen goods as well .
High ransom .
When kidnapping is involved , ship owners sometimes must pay high ransom prices to help their kidnapped crew .
Ransoms average around $ 120,000 .
Some owners will hire security organizations to escort their ships , at costs of around $ 120,000 per trip to avoid the high ransom payments , danger to their crew , and potential loss of the ship and its cargo .
Frequency .
Piracy is a frequent activity happening much more often than what makes the news .
Take a look at the Live Piracy Report and the Live Piracy Map at the ICC Commercial Crime Services and you will see that reported piracy incidents are currently occurring at about 20 - 30 per month .
While not all incidents result in kidnapping or theft , many do .
Environmental pirates .
Not all pirates use lethal weapons and are seeking riches .
Some pirates , such as those in the group Sea Shepherd , are known to ram ships , throw rancid butter on their decks , or even sink ships in an attempt to disrupt their activities .
Usually target ships are participating in whaling or fishing that harms other marine wildlife such as dolphins , seals , and sea turtles .
Little deterrent .
Due to the current legal situation , most pirates who are captured are merely questioned and released .
Unfortunately , there are almost no laws against modern pirates .
Local laws pertain specifically to citizens and may not apply to pirates , and finding witnesses and translators can be difficult once pirates are detained .
Additionally , many countries do not want to take on the expense of imprisoning pirates , so they are often returned to their life of piracy –complete with few deterrents to slow them down .
Help from London .
London , the world headquarters of shipbroking and insurance , is also likely a hub for intelligence that is sent to Somali pirates .
It is thought that at least one of the known pirate groups has " consultants " in London sending information to the pirates that include the layout of the ships , cargo , and routes .
With this much information , the pirates have plenty of time and ability to carefully plan their attack so that the ships have little defense .
OTTAWA , June 18 ( Reuters ) - Following is the prepared text of a speech by Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney to the Regina & District Chamber of Commerce in Saskatchewan .
It is a pleasure to be back in Saskatchewan .
This great province has been one of the fastest - growing parts of the country in recent years , benefiting from increasing diversification into biotechnology and alternative energy , among other industries .
Today , I will refer to the traditional backbone of this economy : agriculture .
I do so because lately there has been much talk of “ green shoots ” in the global economy .
From the initially careful references to data that suggested a slowing of the rate of decline in global activity , the use of the term “ green shoots ” has quickly evolved .
Some now refer to green shoots as if the global recovery is a foregone conclusion or even as if sustainable growth had already begun .
Would that it were so easy .
Saskatchewanians know that it is a long , anxious time between the appearance of seedlings and the harvest .
Much hard work remains , and external forces can profoundly influence the outcome : too little or too much rain , hail , pests , and disease can all frustrate even the most promising beginnings .
And , in the end , global forces of supply and demand determine the prices received .
Old adages usually contain great wisdom : Just as you do n’t count your chickens before they are hatched , we should n’t presume that green shoots today guarantee a bumper crop tomorrow .
Financial Stability and the Bank of Canada
I want to extend this analogy to provide some perspective on recent developments in Canadian financial stability .
Financial stability is the resilience of the financial system to unanticipated adverse shocks .
This resilience determines the extent to which Canadian households and businesses have access to the credit they need at appropriate terms and conditions .
While our financial system is one of the soundest in the world , the ferocity of the once - in - a - lifetime global financial tempest has affected all Canadians , regardless of their location or occupation .
So , does our financial system still leave us well positioned for our green shoots to mature into a viable crop of summer wheat ?
The Bank of Canada is well placed to make this judgment .
As part of our commitment to promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada , the Bank actively fosters a stable and efficient financial system .
The Bank constantly assesses the major risks to the soundness of our system , and helps to develop policies to mitigate them .
In essence , we worry not only about prospects of external shocks ( the equivalent of weather or crop prices ) , but also about the buffers that our banks , businesses , and households have ( the equivalent of the financial reserves farmers need to carry in case the harvest disappoints ) .
Twice a year , the Bank publishes its Financial System Review , or FSR - the most recent edition appeared earlier this week .
My talk today will draw on that analysis and assessment .
I will concentrate on three risks , in particular : 1 ) the liquidity and funding positions of our banks , 2 ) the adequacy of their capital , and 3 ) the financial health of Canadian households .
I will conclude with a few observations on the economic outlook .
Assessment of Overall Financial Stability
Since the autumn , the global economy has been in a deep and synchronized recession that was triggered by the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
In recent months , financial market conditions have improved noticeably and further , gradual progress is likely as numerous international policy initiatives gain traction .
Equity markets have seen strong gains in recent months , and credit markets have also rallied .
While there is still a long way to go before economic and financial conditions return to normal , markets seem to be turning their backs on worst - case scenarios .
The panic that engulfed global financial markets last fall is over .
Developments in Canadian financial stability over the past six months reflect the competing influences of improved financial market conditions on the one hand and a deterioration in the economic outlook on the other .
Overall , the level of risk to the Canadian financial system is judged to be broadly unchanged since last December .
I would sound a note of caution familiar to those who work the land .
We are well prepared but will still be tested .
While the strong position of our banks has improved further in recent months and the balance sheets of Canadian households remain relatively sound , the global recession will mean that these reserves will be drawn upon in the months ahead .
Let me now turn to the three risks that I cited a moment ago , starting with liquidity and funding for banks .
Liquidity and Funding
At the heart of the financial crisis was the collapse of wholesale funding markets for banks .
Since August 2007 , the very short - term interbank and repo markets have been under great strain .
During the most intense periods of the crisis around the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008 and Lehman Brothers and others in the fall of last year , these markets seized up entirely :
Good collateral became unfinanceable overnight , firms failed , and risk aversion across all financial markets skyrocketed .
This crisis of confidence was less acute in Canada , but still produced severe strains in our wholesale funding markets .
Heightened uncertainty made counterparties reluctant to extend financing beyond the shortest maturities , resulting in intense funding pressures for Canadian financial institutions .
Banks cut back their market - making activities in order to conserve balance sheet capacity , which further aggravated market volatility .
These dynamics raised the risk of an adverse feedback loop between the financial system and the real economy .
The Bank of Canada responded to these pressures by dramatically expanding our liquidity facilities , and the Government of Canada implemented a program to purchase insured mortgages with the help of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation , thereby increasing the access of Canadian institutions to longer - term financing .
Reflecting both the strength of our banks and the scale of our actions , conditions in Canada have been consistently better than elsewhere .
Since December , these policies have gained considerable traction , helping to reinforce the improvement in domestic funding conditions as the global financial crisis subsided .
This improvement has been reflected in a decline in the spreads on bank financing in money markets , a moderate extension of maturities , and a substantial reduction in the cost of term funding for Canadian banks .
In addition , policy initiatives have allowed banks to increase substantially their holdings of government securities , which has helped boost their liquidity situation in a capital - efficient way .
These improvements have been further supported by strong growth in retail deposits and slowing credit growth .
Market - making activity in Canadian financial markets has also been recovering , although it remains less than satisfactory .

Baseband 101
The ‘ baseband ’ is the generic nickname given to the internal components of the iPhone that handle the phone calls and Internet access .
This ‘ baseband ’ is a tiny and unique independent computer system that runs inside your iPhone , it is separate to the main system that handles the applications ( such as email and google maps ) and it talks to the main part of the phone over an internal communications network .
Think of it like a cable modem or other peripheral that is attached to your home PC that needs occasional updates .
When a software update is released and presented to you within iTunes the baseband is sometimes updated ( to fix bugs or add new features ) .
The 3.0 update for the iPhone 3G contains such an update , so running the vanilla updater straight away with iTunes will reprogram and update the baseband .
SIM Free / SP Unlocked / Factory Unlocked iPhone 3G
This applies if you bought your iPhone 3G for $ $ $ $ $ $ $ .

Agra was founded by Raja Badal Singh around 1475 A.D.
However the mention of Agraban in the Mahabharata suggests that it has been the sister of Matura , an ancient city in the vicinity , from a very early period .
Sikandar Lodi made this place his capital when the Lodis ruled North India .
But according to an ancient legend , the name of Agra is derived from Agra vans .

Intel wins deal to supply Nokia with computer chips
Intel has secured a deal with mobile giant Nokia to supply future mobile phones with Intel ’s processor chips , reports indicate .
The deal is said to be Intel ’s first major foothold with ventures into the mobile market .
Analysts state that Intel processors are installed in about 80 % of all computers , but Intel has relatively been unsuccessful with penetrating into the mobile market .
Intel has released its
Atom processor earlier , a processor which is optimized for mobile functionality , with this venture in mind , but so far has only been relatively successful with laptops and notebooks .
Intel is pushing into lessening its dependence on computer sales , which currently make up about 90 % of its total sales volume .
With analysts estimating about 1.21 billion mobile phone sales annually , Intel is wanting to generate sufficient sales metrics in relation to this that may significantly leverage their computer sales .
Traditional Chinese medicine on sale at a market stall ( Image : Sipa Press / Rex Features
Eating a vulture wo n’t clear a bad case of syphilis nor will a drink made of rotting snakes treat leprosy , but these and other bogus medical treatments spread precisely because they do n’t work .
That ’s the counterintuitive finding of a mathematical model of medical quackery .
Ineffective treatments do n’t cure an illness , so sufferers demonstrate them to more people than those who recovery quickly after taking real medicines .
“ The assumption is that when people pick up treatments to try , they ’re basically observing other people , ” says Mark Tanaka , a mathematical biologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney , who led the study .
“ People do n’t necessarily know that what somebody is trying is going to work . ”
The World Health Organization is demanding better proof that folk medicines work before they can be approved .
And the Malaysian government has rejected more than a third of the 25,000 applications to register traditional medicines it has received because the treatments are ineffective or dangerous .

Despite these efforts , quack medicine persists around the world .
Some Nigerians treat malaria with witchcraft , a South African health minister recently claimed that garlic and beetroot treat HIV , and western health stores brim with unproven treatments for almost any disease imaginable .
For instance St John ’s wort does nothing for attention deficit hyperactive disorder in children , a recent placebo - controlled trial concluded .
Contagious treatments
To understand why these quack medical treatments persist in the face of better proven remedies , Tanaka applied mathematical models used to measure evolutionary fitness to medical treatments .
His model accounted for factors including the rate of conversion to a treatment , the effectiveness of a treatment , the rate at which people abandon a treatment , the odds of recovering naturally , and the chances of dying .
The model starts with a single person demonstrating a treatment – rubbish or not – and measures how many people are influenced to go on to give the treatment a try .
Under a wide range of conditions , quack treatments garnered more converts than proven hypothetical medicines that offer quicker recovery , Tanaka found .
“ The very fact that they do n’t work mean that people that use them stay sick longer ” and demonstrate a treatment to more people , he says .
Bad treatments do n’t always win out .
Recurring diseases are more likely to promote effective treatments than rare diseases because repeated demonstration weeds out bad treatments , Tanaka found .
‘ Just ask ’
But is this model valid in cultures where evidence - based medicine predominates , and government groups such as the US Food and Drug Administration vet most medical treatments ?
Tanaka thinks so , pointing to the popularity of alternative medicines and the debate over the effectiveness of FDA - approved drugs .
“ In many situations people will just observe and copy anyway , regardless what the official information is , ” he says .
And in some cases , one peer - reviewed study may conclude that a drug works , while another shows it does n’t .
“ Even where there is a bit of clinical research , we do n’t really know yet whether at lot of medicines are effective , ” he says .
“ I think it ’s an interesting idea .
It ’s quite clever ” , James Holland Jones , a biological anthropologist at Stanford University in California , says of the model .
However , language allows people to vet unproven remedies without trying them , he adds – that is , you can just ask if a treatment was effective .
“ You do n’t necessarily have to copy everything . ”

A man in the United States popped out to his local petrol station to buy a pack of cigarettes - only to find his card charged $ 23,148,855,308,184,500 .
That is $ 23 quadrillion ( £ 14 quadrillion ) - many times the US national debt .
" I thought somebody had bought Europe with my credit card , " said Josh Muszynski , from New Hampshire .
He says his appeals to his bank first met with little understanding , though it eventually corrected the error .
It also waived the usual $ 15 overdraft fee .
Josh Muszynski : ' I thought someone had bought Europe '
" It was all back to normal , " Mr Muszynski told his local television station , WMUR .
" They reversed the negative balance fee , which was nice . "
Debt crisis
His nightmare began when he checked his online bank account a few hours after buying the cigarettes .
He thought he would be a couple of hundred dollars in the black .
But his overdraft had pushed him into the red - by an amount equivalent to many times the entire US national debt .
" It is a lot of money in the negative , " he said .
" Something I could never , ever , afford to pay back .
The 17 - digit amount on his online bill shocked Mr Muszynski
" My children could not afford it , grandchildren , nothing like that . "
In panic , Mr Muszynski rushed back to the petrol station , but they were unable to help .
He says he then spent two hours on the phone with the Bank of America .
Eventually , it assured him it would be fixed - and the next morning , it had been .
But no - one has yet explained to Mr Muszynski how such a astonishing error could have been made .

Because a toaster would 've been too sane
by Jeremy Hooper
Perilous to my mind , body , and soul ?
Hell , it 's my bank account that he should have really mentioned !
These wedding things be mucho costly !
But hey at least my spouse , unlike Mrs LaBarbera , wo n't have to deal with a lifetime of seeing his husband bizarrely enthralled with a kind of sex that he claims to not desire .
So yea -- score one for my couples therapy - less home !
Your thoughts
Actually he has it wrong .
Religion is perilous to mind , body and soul .

Wait ... did he seriously , out of the blue and unsolicited , email you just to insult you about your marriage ?
Of all the things I * could * say about this , all I 'm going to say is , did n't this boy 's mother teach him any manners ?
Etiquette ?
What a smug and ugly person he is on the inside .
Posted by : zortnac | Jun 4 , 2009 2:28:56 PM
... I think that Mr. LaBarbera 's email is full of enough patronization to last me about another century .
But congratulations on your marriage .
I wish you and your husband all the best !

" Wait ... did he seriously , out of the blue and unsolicited , email you just to insult you about your marriage ? "
Yes , he most surely did .
This was not part of a larger conversation .
And in fact , the only recent place I 've even mentioned my upcoming wedding ( 9 days -- Eeek ! ) was in a comments thread on one of yesterday 's posts .
I 'm assuming that 's why he also mentioned Tim Kincaid , a frequent G - A - Y comment contributor .

Wonder if now would be the time to tell him that my partner is Jewish ?
That my ceremony is civil , not faith - based ?
That a nun is coming to my ceremony ?
That he was never invited in the first place ?
Posted by : G - A - Y | Jun 4 , 2009 2:35:30 PM
" .. the further you go down this road , the more perilous it will be for you .. "
Sounds a bit like a threat to me !
Is LaBarBear taking his marching orders from Operation Rescue ?
Or the Army of God ?
He looks like his mug would fit perfectly with the rest of those on the most - wanted list , and certainly speaks as one who hallucinates a double - sided conversation with his invisible " friend " .
Mr. LaBarBear 's brain fart will not be MOCKED !
Maybe it 's time for a restraining order ?

Yeah you cant be a pro-gay christian , just like you can't be an anti-slavery christian in 1840 , or a feminist christian in the 1900s , or a racemixing christian in the 1950s , Christianity as you know has n't changed its rules or stances on issues one centimeter since Jesus stopped talking .
Posted by : Penguinsaur | Jun 4 , 2009 2:37:53 PM
Yea , Dick , I 'll have to say that even though I am the furthest thing from a chicken little , and even though I deal with " pro-family " people ALL OF THE TIME ( with typically cordial results ) , this one really takes me by surprise .
It 's so personal , unwarranted , and meant to intimidate .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Jun 4 , 2009 2:39:19 PM
Tell Pete that he's not a real " Christian " unless he follows all the rules .
Including , not judging others , and bearing false witness , just to name two .
And until he does , he'd be better off examining his own faults instead of the faults that he perceives others to have .
I believe there 's a bible verse about that too ... have him check Matthew 7:5 .
Being a self - righteous prig is not a good example for anyone to set , let alone a supposed Christian .

It 's a twofer .
He managed to insult both of us in one email .
But he did pick up on my nefarious scheme to convert you to my fraudulent pro-" gay " version of ( c) hristianity .
Bwahahaha .
You will convert !!
Posted by : Timothy Kincaid | Jun 4 , 2009 2:58:18 PM
Poor , poor Peter .
He may feel up against it a bit due to all the recent pro-equality marriage rulings .
Perhaps this is a way to make himself feel better .
It 's like I always say , if people of PL's ilk campaigned even half as hard against other issues like divorce , deadbeat parents , child abuse , etc. , then I might be moved to think that his motives are based on Christian beliefs .
But the fact that he predominantly singles out this one thing and attacks people both broadly and individually on it , using Jesus as his fortress of rationalization , suggests to me that he has no idea what Christianity is about .
What Mrs. L must have to put up with .
Did n't realize your marriage was coming up so soon , Jeremy .
I 'm sure it 'll be a joyous occasion , just as mine was a few years ago .
I 'll give you a piece of advice my aunt gave me and my husband on our wedding day :
Take a moment away from everyone that day , and just stop and look around .
Try to soak in as much of the details as you can .
Because otherwise , it 'll pass so quickly you 'll barely remember it !
Take care !
Posted by : Christopher | Jun 4 , 2009 3:01:49 PM
Well , now .
This pisses me right off .
It 's one thing if it 's part of a dialog you 've been having with him , but unsolicited , out of the blue email about how wrong your wedding ( congratulations , by the way ) is ?
And then to wrap it up with " God bless " ?
What a dick .

Posted by : zortnac | Jun 4 , 2009 3:47:23 PM
Let 's be fair to Peter and figure that like most Christians he has only read the parts of the Bible that uphold his prejudice against things .
He probably has n't gotten the full scope of the book or the marriage examples set down in it .
If he had , he would understand that marriage in the Bible is nothing special .
It is full of deceit , polygamy ( not actually mentioned as a " sin " , btw. ) , adultery , insect , and other " sins " .
One good way to get a wife , according to the book , is to rape her and then pay her father and forcibly keep her as a wife .
If biblical marriage is " real marriage " , they can keep it .
Posted by : Jess B. | Jun 4 , 2009 3:53:47 PM
So many things I can say , but it all boils down to , " What a self - righteous jackass ! "
It 's scary to contemplate that kind of mindset , one that must piss into everyone 's punch bowl .
Dare you to send him a link to your registry .
( No , kidding ! ;-)
Congratulations !
It 's kind of a cool feeling , is n't it ?
The countdown , I mean , not these kinds of unsolicited commentaries .
@ Christopher : I am glad for my straight friends and other bisexual people that LaBarberians do not spend much time on issues like divorce and deadbeat parents .
They do n't need that kind of intrusion in their lives .
Besides , these people think that " child abuse " is raising a child in a way that they would n't .

Statements and letters like this hit home as I too have a wedding approaching http://tinyurl.com/5txynq and coming from a very conservative ( Upstate , N.Y. ) fundamental born - again radical Christian family , you really have to let things like this fall off of you like the dew on a leaf .
You cannot hold someone accountable for knowing calculus when they 've never learned algebra .
Literalists pick and choose what they want to spew out and we need to rise above this child - like mentality and do our best to love them through it .

That that ass - hat thinks it 's acceptable to comment on the validity of your impending marriage is infuriating .
Fortunately , it can turn around on him just as easy : Hey Peter !

How about that ?

" It 's so personal , unwarranted , and meant to intimidate . "
But that 's their MO : they want to stick their big noses into our lives and bedrooms and ultimately want us to subscribe to their belief system .
This to me is religious persecution : if my faith tells me that I am a perfect child of God , who are these people to say differently and to use our law making system to discriminate against me ?
There are so many ways to defeat them it 's remarkable .
What will be satisfying will be all of this documentation of bigotry for future generations to examine and study .

Have a beautiful day : you certainly deserve it !

Tim Geithner says it 's impossible because we have a strong independent Federal Reserve , but Warren Buffett has no reason to be politically correct .
And in his interview with CNBC , he told Becky Quick : we are monetizing the debt .
We are using printed paper to pay our government .
It 's obvious , really .
That 's what quantiative easing is , but the government says it 's not that way .
So Buffett is concerned about inflation -- in sounds like it 's inevitable to him -- though he says deflation is something we 'll never see in our lifetime .
MIAMI -- Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte ' Stallworth took full responsibility for killing a pedestrian while driving drunk in Florida and began serving a 30 - day jail sentence Tuesday after he pleaded guilty to DUI manslaughter .
Stallworth also reached a confidential financial settlement to avoid a potential lawsuit from the family of 59 - year - old Mario Reyes , according to Stallworth 's attorney , Christopher Lyons .
Reyes was struck and killed March 14 by Stallworth , who was driving his black 2005 Bentley after a night drinking at a swanky hotel bar .
A source told ESPN's Kelly Naqi that while the financial terms of the settlement with the family have not been disclosed , Stallworth was covered by two insurance policies : a car insurance policy and a $ 5 million umbrella policy .
Stallworth , 28 , told Miami - Dade Circuit Judge Dennis Murphy that he hopes to get involved in drunken - driving education programs .
" I accept full responsibility for this horrible tragedy , " said Stallworth , who was accompanied at the hearing by his parents , siblings and other supporters .
" I will bear this burden for the rest of my life . "
Stallworth faced 15 years in prison .
According to the plea agreement , Stallworth needs to serve only 24 days of his 30 - day sentence .
Murphy agreed to give Stallworth credit for the one day he already served , April 2 , which was the day of his arrest and booking .
In addition , Stallworth received an additional five days of credit because of a Florida state statute stating anyone who is sentenced to 30 days ( besides civil , contempt , drug treatment and house arrest cases ) automatically gets five days ' credit time served for every 30 days , spokesperson Janelle Hall of the Miami Dade County Corrections Department told Naqi .
After his release from jail , Stallworth must serve two years of house arrest and spend eight years on probation .
Lyons said the plea agreement will allow Stallworth to resume his football career .
Donte ' Stallworth , accompanied by his lawyer , Christopher Lyons , has a lifetime suspension from holding a driver 's license , and must serve two years ' house arrest and eight years on probation .
AP Photo / Alan Diaz
The Akron Beacon Journal reported that according to an NFL source , commissioner Roger Goodell is expected to discipline Stallworth before the Browns start training camp July 31 .
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league is reviewing the matter for possible disciplinary action .
Stallworth could face suspension without pay for some games this year .
The Browns released a statement Tuesday evening , saying " The Browns are very conscious of the seriousness of the charges to which Donte ' Stallworth plead guilty to today .
We are continuing to evaluate the situation and will make the decisions that we believe are in the best interest of the Cleveland Browns . "
Stallworth must also undergo drug and alcohol testing , will have a lifetime driver 's license suspension and must perform 1,000 hours of community service .
Lyons said after five years , Stallworth could win approval for limited driving for reasons such as employment .
Lyons noted that Stallworth stopped immediately after the accident , called 911 and submitted to roadside alcohol testing despite spending most of the night drinking at a Miami Beach hotel .
" He acted like a man , " Lyons said .
" He remained at the scene .
He cooperated fully . "
Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle cited Stallworth 's lack of previous criminal record , cooperation with police and willingness to accept responsibility as factors in the plea deal .
Rundle also said the Reyes family -- particularly the victim 's 15 - year - old daughter -- wanted the case resolved to avoid any more pain .
" For all of these reasons , a just resolution of this case has been reached , " Rundle said .
None of the Reyes family attended the hearing .
Their attorney , Rodolfo Suarez , read a statement saying the family wants to " bring closure to this emotional and tragic event . "
Suarez was not immediately available to comment after the hearing .
After Stallworth spent the night drinking at a bar in Miami Beach 's Fountainebleau hotel , police said he hit Reyes , a construction crane operator who was rushing to catch a bus after finishing his shift at about 7:15 a.m .
Stallworth told police he flashed his lights in an attempt to warn Reyes , who was not in a crosswalk when he was struck .
Stallworth had a blood - alcohol level of .126 after the crash , well above Florida 's .08 limit .
Stallworth stopped after the crash and immediately told officers he had hit Reyes .
Police estimated Stallworth was driving about 50 mph in a 40 mph zone .
Stallworth signed a seven - year , $ 35 million contract with the Browns before last season but was injured much of the year .
The California native and University of Tennessee college star also has played in the NFL for the New England Patriots , Philadelphia Eagles and New Orleans Saints .
The night before the crash , Stallworth earned a $ 4.5 million roster bonus from the Browns .
David Cornwell , a Stallworth attorney handling the NFL situation , said he has kept top league officials apprised of the case .
" Whenever it is appropriate to do so , we are prepared to discuss the circumstances under which Donte ' will resume his career , " Cornwell said .

Google has ?
announced ?
the availability of the first official Chrome developer release for Linux and Mac OS X .
The search giant says that the release is a preview intended for testing purposes only and that the software is still unsuitable for regular users .
When Google launched Chrome last year , the browser was available only on Windows .
Development on the Linux and Mac OS X ports began shortly after the initial Windows release and has progressed at a steady pace .
The Chrome team aims to build ports that feel native and conform well with the underlying platform , but also retain some of the browser 's unique characteristics , such as the distinctive angled tab skyline .
This approach to cross-platform software development is very challenging , especially on Linux where the inherent diversity and modularity of the platform makes it difficult to translate many elements of the original Chrome vision .
The browser 's source code is available for download under an open license , but Google uses separate branding to create differentiation between the underlying open source project and their own official builds .
The project is called Chromium and the official browser is called Chrome .
Until now , the Linux and Mac OS X port was only available in the form of Chromium builds .
This is the first time that Google has released Mac and Linux binaries with the Chrome name and branding .
It 's a significant milestone for the browser , and it demonstrates Google 's commitment to supporting it in an official capacity across all three platforms .
We recently tested a Linux build of Chromium on the Linux platform .
Despite its incompleteness , it showed significant promise .
The official preview build is nearly identical and exhibits roughly the same strengths and limitations .
For a more detailed examination of the browser 's current status , you can refer to our review from late May .
One point that is worth reiterating is that its performance on Linux is good .
It loads pages swiftly and it starts up almost instantly .
Maintaining that performance advantage as the program matures is going to be the key to making Chrome a compelling option relative to other native WebKit browsers .
Installation packages are available from the Chromium website .
For Mac OS
X users , Google provides a standard DMG image that contains the Chrome application bundle .
At the present time , the only Linux distributions that Google supports are Ubuntu and Debian .
The Linux packages are in the standard .DEB format .
During the installation process , the DEB package will install a cron script that adds the Chrome package repository to the user 's APT sources .
Users should keep in mind that the Mac and Linux ports are not yet complete and some of the functionality may not work as expected .
Google is particularly emphatic about this in reference to the browser 's privacy and security features .
The company has published a detailed privacy notice that thoroughly describes the missing privacy features in the Linux port and articulates some of the potential risks of using the test builds .
Chrome warning message on Linux
The preview is a great tool for developers who are eager to observe the progress of Chrome on the newly - supported platforms .
It also provides users with the opportunity to get an early look .
It 's an important step forward for Google and it could help attract more contributors to the project .
Dark Beginnings , the KUBARK Torture Manual & the storied Bush - family / CIA legacy ...
Ernest A. Canning Byon 5/13/2009 , 8:35 am PT
Guest Blogged by Ernest A. Canning
" Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities . "
- Voltaire
I do n’t want to give the wrong impression .
All nations possess a legitimate need to gather intelligence .
There have been large numbers of extraordinarily dedicated CIA employees , like Ray McGovern and Valerie Plame Wilson , who have sought to protect this nation from harm .
But there is the dark side of the agency , a covert branch which has engaged in deception , intrigue , torture and assassinations , all designed to destabilize democratic governments in order to advance and consolidate the power and influence of a US - based , multi-national corporate empire .
In Part I of this five - part series , I described how the George W. Bush administration did not wait for legal " permission " from its Department of Justice before embarking on its plan to use torture as means of forcing confessions and other information from detainees .
In " Prosecute or Perish " I stressed that the current torture scandal is the product of a half - century of CIA torture ; that by failing to prosecute those who tortured in our name in the same manner that we prosecuted the Japanese officers who waterboarded my father during World War II , we not only will expose our nation to the charge of hypocrisy but will endanger the very survival of our constitutional democracy and the rule of law .
As I noted in Part I , we cannot move forward unless we honestly examine our past --- which , in this instance , mandates a careful look at the origins of the CIA ...
Dark Beginnings
In a sense , it may be said that the CIA was a stepchild of Nazi Germany .
As noted by Joseph Trento in Prelude to Terror ( 2006 ) , its founder , Allen Dulles , had done business with the Nazis before World War II .
Dulles served in the O.S.S. in Bern , Switzerland .
From 1945 to 1947 , preceding the creation of the CIA , Dulles ran his own private and entirely illegal intelligence service in which he “ began a massive ex-Nazi recruitment * campaign , using a State Department refugee office as a front . ”
The recruitment campaign , Prof. Alfred McCoy observed , in A Question of Torture ( 2006 ) , entailed more than the use of war criminals as spies .
It included German scientists “ who had directed Nazi experiments into human physiology and psychology ” and whose early research would lay the ground work for CIA torture techniques …
The National Security Act of 1947 created the CIA to be an instrument of the newly formed National Security Council ( NSC ) .
Five months after that formation , notes McCoy , the NSC promulgated a top secret authorization for the CIA to conduct propaganda programs that would be “ supplemented by covert psychological operations . "
During his Feb. 16 , 2007 interview on Democracy Now , McCoy explained :
From 1950 to 1962 , the C.I.A. ran a massive research project , a veritable Manhattan Project of the mind , spending over $ 1 billion a year to crack the code of human consciousness , from both mass persuasion and the use of coercion in individual interrogation .
And what they discovered --- they tried LSD , they tried mescaline , they tried all kinds of drugs , they tried electroshock , truth serum , sodium pentathol ...
In A Question of Torture , McCoy reveals that in 1950 the CIA ’s “ Project Bluebird ” began testing LSD on unwitting American soldiers .
From 1953 to 1963 , MKUltra , a covert operation under the control of Richard Helms , not only injected North Korean prisoners with LSD but “ spiked drinks at a New York City party house , paid prostitutes to slip LSD to their customers … , pumped hallucinogens into children at summer camp , attempted behavior modification on inmates … and collected powerful toxins from Amazon tribes . ”
The project was terminated when the CIA ’s inspector general , having discovered it during a routine audit , determined MKUltra jeopardized “ the rights and interests of all Americans . ”
In The Shock Doctrine ( 2007 ) , Naomi Klein provides an extended discussion of the CIA - funded electroshock experiments carried out by Dr. Ewen Cameron of McGill University as “ a means to blast his patients back to their infancy … ; ” a tool designed to make the mind a “ blank slate ” on which to write a new reality .
Klein quotes from Cameron ’s 1962 scientific paper :
There is not only a loss of the space - time image but a loss of all feeling that it should be present .
During this stage the patient may show a variety of other phenomena , such as loss of a second language or all knowledge of his marital status .
In more advanced forms , he may be unable to walk without support , to feed himself …
All aspects of his memorial function are severely impaired .
Obviously , its memory destroying features makes electroshock a counter - productive tool in the gathering of actionable intelligence .
But that finding would n't keep the CIA from continuing to search for a way to unlock the key to forced self - incrimination ...
KUBARK : The CIA ’s 1963 Torture Manual
Neither the drug nor the electroshock experiments satisfied the agency ’s maniacal quest to crack the code of human consciousness without loss of the victim ’s ability to pass on useful intelligence .
Perceived success came by way of academic studies that combined the relatively simple techniques of sensory deprivation with the KGB ’s use of self - inflicted pain .
This combination produced the how - to - torture manual , KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation — July 1963 .
( " KUBARK " was an early cryptonym for the CIA itself . )
The KUBARK manual , which begins by stating that it is “ intended as a guide for interrogation of resistant sources ” notes , under the subheading , “ Deprivation of Sensory Stimuli , ” that “ the chief effect of arrest and detention , and particularly solitary confinement , is to deprive the subject of many or most of the sights , sounds , tastes , smells , and tactile sensations to which he has grown accustomed . ”
In addition to a McGill University study on sensory deprivation in which student volunteers sitting in a cubicle with goggles , gloves , headphones , and earmuffs began to hallucinate within 48 hours , KUBARK references a study at the National Institute of Mental Health in which two subjects were outfitted in “ black out masks , which enclosed the whole head but allowed breathing and nothing else . ”
The subjects were immersed up to their necks in tanks of slow flowing water , each for a period of less than three hours .
It cites a sensory deprivation experiment involving 17 paid volunteers who lay flat on their backs inside a tank type respirator with their arms and legs inside “ comfortable but rigid cylinders to inhibit movement and tactile contact . ”
The only sound was the dull , repetitive humming of the respirator motor .
Only 6 of the 17 paid volunteers completed the 36 hour test .
“ The results confirmed … that ( 1 ) the deprivation of sensory stimuli induces stress ; ( 2 ) the stress becomes unbearable for most subjects ; ( 3 ) the subject has a growing need for physical and social stimuli , and ( 4 ) some subjects progressively lose touch with reality … . ”
These studies formed the basis for the first basic component of the CIA torture paradigm , sensory deprivation --- also described by McCoy as “ sensory disorientation . ”
Pay close attention to the 1963 KUBARK torture instructions , for , in the final segment of this series , you will see them reproduced in the Feb. 14 , 2007 report [ PDF ] from the International Committee of the Red Cross ( " ICRC " ) regarding the treatment of 14 high - value “ ghost detainees ” who were ordered transferred to Guantanamo by the Bush Administration .
KUBARK says coercion is used to induce a child - like “ regression ” that will lead the victim to look at the interrogator as a father figure .
Control must be exerted , starting with the timing and manner of arrest to insure surprise and maximum discomfort .
The detainee ’s clothes are immediately stripped “ because familiar clothing reinforces identity . ”
Arrest and detention are designed “ to deprive the subject of … the signs , sounds , tastes , smells , and tactile sensations to which he has grown accustomed ….
Results produced only after weeks or months of ordinary imprisonment … can be duplicated in hours or days in a cell which has no light … which is sound proofed , in which odors are eliminated … . ”
The KUBARK manual explains the preference for self - inflicted pain .
“ Persons of considerable moral or intellectual stature often find in pain inflicted by others a belief that they are in the hands of inferiors , and their resolve not to submit is strengthened . ”
Where such pain is intense , it will likely produce “ false confessions . ”
But “ whereas pain inflicted on a person from outside himself may actually focus or intensify his will to resist , his resistance is likelier to be sapped by pain which he seems to inflict upon himself … .
When the individual is told to stand at attention for long periods , an intervening factor is introduced .
The immediate source of pain is not the interrogator but the victim himself . ”
Per KUBARK , psychological factors --- such as fear engendered by threats to torture --- are more effective than pain induced directly by torture .
It would be a mistake to dismiss the brutal impact of this relatively simple method .
As we noted previously in " Fixing the Facts and Legal Opinions Around the Torture Policy " , citing A Question of Torture , a 1956 CIA - commissioned , Cornell University study of KGB torture techniques revealed that the simple act of standing in place for eighteen to twenty - four hours produces " ' excruciating pain ' as ankles double in size , skin becomes ' tense and intensely painful , ' blisters erupt oozing ' watery serum , ' heart rates soar , kidneys shut down , and delusions deepen . "
This too should be kept in mind when , in the fourth and final article , we turn to the ICRC ’s description of the disorientation caused by application of the twin techniques of sensory deprivation and self - inflicted pain to the 14 high - value “ ghost - detainees ” whose testimony is documented in the ICRC 's report .
But the tactics used , and exposed in the ICRC 's report were not new to the post - 9/11 period , as many have misreported .
The techniques were true and tested , and had found their way into covert U.S. foreign policy long before " everything changed " in September of 2001 , as we 'll discuss in the next chapter of this series ...

Here is a short , graphic video demonstrating three of the CIA 's torture techniques --- sensory deprivation ( hooding ) combined with self - inflicted pain ( forced stress position ) and waterboarding --- three techniques approved for use by the Bush Administration ....

Today , Memeorandum featured a post by climate disruption denier Michael Andrews and writer for the website DailyTech that claimed , among other things , that “ even NASA ’s own study acknowledges that solar variation has caused climate change in the past . ”
Not exactly news , but given that this article has been linked by other prominent denier sites like American Thinker , Newsbusters , and WattsUpWithThat , I figured that it was worth a little more looking .
And I ’m glad I did , because I came across a great post at The Phoenix Talking Politics blog that pointed out something I ’d missed : Andrews got all hot and bothered by a general interest piece that ran in ScienceDaily in May , 2008 .
Oops .
And just in case you think this is isolated to just a couple of denialist sites , here ’s a list of various blogs parroting , reposting , or linking to Andrews , Watts , or Newsbusters ( in no particular order ) : Climate Change Fraud , CongressCheck.com , Truth11 , Salt Lake Tribune message boards , Truth is Contagious , Climate Realists , Republic Broadcasting Network , Prairie Pundit , Hyscience , Deceiver , Jumping in Pools , Bluffton Today , The Witless Knower , Political Wrinkles forum , The American Right forum , Bob ’s Bites , Cool Science News , Lucianne.com , The Global Warming , Righting the Ship , Micky ’s Muses , Fabius Maximus , Melvin Udall , The Political Fish , Right of Course , The Political Asylum forum , Rantings of Mine , Atomic Fungus ( as of about 24 hours after the original posting .
More will be forthcoming , I ’m sure . )
Apparently a significant number of climate disruption deniers are getting desperate for vindication .
Talk about embarrassing .
What ’s far more embarrassing , however , is what was written in the American Thinker piece :
This report may represent the third time that NASA ’s DR .
James Hansen , Al Gore ’s point man on his AGW hoax , has had to backtrack on his claims that humans are responsible for climate change .
…
Could Dr. Hansen ’s Reign of Error as head of the Goddard Institute for Space Flight be coming to an end ?
To say that American Thinker is confused is to be generous .
Hansen runs the NASA Goddard Institute for Space STUDIES at Columbia University in New York City , not the Goddard SPACE FLIGHT CENTER in Greenbelt , Maryland .
American
Thinker must have been in such a hurry to slam Hansen that they forgot to check their facts .
Just a hint , guys – getting your facts this wrong does n’t do your already nonexistent credibility on this issue any good .
( For the record , the latest science supports the idea that part of climate disruption is natural , so anyone who says that the sun has some impact is entirely correct .
However , anyone claims that the sun is the dominant factor over human emissions of greenhouse gases is incorrect .
In fact , we know that solar energy output ca n’t be the dominant factor – if it were , then the stratosphere would be heating up , but instead it ’s cooling off as energy from the surface is prevented from entering the stratosphere by greenhouse gas buildup in the troposphere . )
After the rape and pillage of the last several decades , do we really care all that much about the survival of the insurance companies ?
If they were providing adequate service at a reasonable cost , it might not be so infuriating .
But to pay all that money and get so little in return ?
Yet the Senate Republicans , the Party of No , the Handmaidens of Corporate Welfare , are more concerned about losing their political patrons than the fact that people all over the country are , quite literally , dying .
WASHINGTON —
The mood was upbeat in early March when scores of powerful lawmakers and lobbyists joined President Obama in the East Room of the White House to talk about fixing the nation 's health care system .
Still , Sen. Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa , rose to tell Obama that many Republicans had a problem with his plan to let the government compete with private insurers .
" There 's a lot of us that feel that the government is an unfair competitor , " Grassley said .
" We have to keep what we have now strong , and make it stronger . "
Translation :
We can't possibly let you cut into insurance companies ' obscene profit margins !
Three months later , disagreement has turned to discord over a key element of Obama 's health care prescription : his insistence on a " public plan " to compete with private insurers .
America 's Health Insurance Plans , an industry trade group , is joined by the American Medical Association , U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others that have expressed misgivings about greater government involvement .
" We 're not sure that the government is very good at running a health plan , " said Nancy Nielsen , president of the AMA , which heard Obama defend his plan Monday .
Except for Medicare , with that measley 3 % in administrative costs - and the V.A. system .
But we 'd rather not talk about that !
That has led to a number of compromise proposals , designed to inject choice and competition into the market without letting the government set prices or shift costs to the private sector .
" What I am trying to do — and what a public option will help do — is put affordable health care within reach for millions of Americans , " Obama told the American Medical Association .
The first Senate and House bills to emerge this month would offer a public plan , but a third bill , in the Senate , to be unveiled soon might not include it .
Ten of 11 Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee wrote Obama this month in opposition .
An analysis by the Lewin Group , a health care consulting firm , found that a public plan such as Medicare would draw 119 million people away from private insurers .
That 's because a plan patterned after Medicare could pay doctors and hospitals 20 % to 30 % less than its private competitors .
Limiting who can join and regulating what the plan must pay providers would reduce the upheaval , the analysis said .
In other words , we need to make sure the people who need it can't get it ...
Actual U.S. Unemployment : 15.8 %
This morning 's news that U.S. unemployment has hit 13.7 million , pushing the rate to 8.9 percent , tells only half the story of this recession .
The total number of Americans who are not working full - time but ought to be is actually about 22 million , or 15.8 percent , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Who are those other 8.3 million Americans ?
Call them the unofficially unemployed .
As The Ticker points out each time the Bureau releases the monthly unemployment figure , it does not include many out - of - work Americans .
There are many reasons for this .
The bureau , which is under the Labor Department , cannot use unemployment compensation records to count the out - of - work , because they are not reliable or up - to - date enough .
The bureau also cannot count every out - of - work person .
Instead , as The Ticker reported here in December : " In the case of the monthly jobs report , the Labor Department contacts 60,000 households to determine the unemployment picture for the entire workforce , which consists of about 154 million Americans . "
The problem with this methodology is that it does not include millions of Americans who are not working full - time who ought to be .
Those , in the bureau 's words , who are " marginally attached to the labor force . "
Those numbered an additional 2.1 million Americans in the first quarter of this year , the bureau said .
Alarmingly , that number was up 35 percent from the first quarter of 2008 .
Of this number , the bureau categorized 717,000 as " discouraged " workers , or those that have simply given up looking for work for any number of reasons .
That number was up 70 percent from the first quarter of 2008 .
" Discouraged " workers include a disproportionate number of young people , blacks , Hispanics and men , the bureau said .
On top of all of this , add an additional 3.6 million unemployed Americans who say they want a job but have not looked for work in the past 12 months .
The remaining 2.6 million or so officially unemployed Americans include part - time workers who would prefer to have full - time jobs , those who have not looked for work because of illness or transportation reasons and those who believe they have other impediments .
But even though these workers do n't count toward the official monthly unemployment number , they are nevertheless a true weight on the economy .
They do n't pay payroll tax , or as much of it as they would ; they do n't contribute to Social Security or other government entitlement entitlements and they do n't spend as much .
The 15.8 percent figure is the highest since the bureau began keeping these figures in 1994 .
Excluding the current recession , the highest previous rate came in January 1994 , when it hit 11.8 percent .
The number was 8.7 percent in December 2007 , when the current recession began .
That means the number of the unofficially unemployed has shot up 7.1 percentage points since then .
By comparison , the official unemployment rate has risen 3.9 percentage points since December 2007 .
This suggests that a greater percentage of people are becoming disenfranchised from the workforce than are getting laid off .
By the way , in February , the White House predicted unemployment would top out at 8.1 percent this year , a figure that was blown through the following month .
It has made no call on how high the unofficial unemployment rate will go .

As modern cosmologists rely more and more on the ominous “ dark matter ” to explain otherwise inexplicable observations , much effort has gone into the detection of this mysterious substance in the last two decades , yet no direct proof could be found that it actually exists .
Even if it does exist , dark matter would be unable to reconcile all the current discrepancies between actual measurements and predictions based on theoretical models .
Hence the number of physicists questioning the existence of dark matter has been increasing for some time now .
Competing theories of gravitation have already been developed which are independent of this construction .
Their only problem is that they conflict with Newton ’s theory of gravitation .
“ Maybe Newton was indeed wrong , ” declares Professor Dr. Pavel Kroupa of Bonn University´s Argelander - Institut für Astronomie ( AIfA ) .
“ Although his theory does , in fact , describe the everyday effects of gravity on Earth , things we can see and measure , it is conceivable that we have completely failed to comprehend the actual physics underlying the force of gravity . ”
This is a problematical hypothesis that has nevertheless gained increasing ground in recent years , especially in Europe .
Two new studies could well lend further support to it .
In these studies , Professor Kroupa and his former colleague Dr. Manuel Metz , working in collaboration with Professor Dr. Gerhard Hensler and Dr. Christian
Theis from the University of Vienna , and Dr. Helmut Jerjen from the Australian National University , Canberra , have examined so - called “ satellite galaxies ” .
This term is used for dwarf galaxy companions of the Milky Way , some of which contain only a few thousand stars .
According to the best cosmological models , they exist presumably in hundreds around most of the major galaxies .
Up to now , however , only 30 such satellites have been observed around the Milky Way , a discrepancy in numbers which is commonly attributed to the fact that the light emitted from the majority of satellite galaxies is so faint they remain invisible .
A detailed study of these stellar agglomerates has revealed some astonishing phenomena : “ First of all , there is something unusual about their distribution , ” Professor Kroupa explains , “ the satellites should be uniformly arranged around their mother galaxy , but this is not what we found . “
More precisely , all classical satellites of the Milky Way – the eleven brightest dwarf galaxies – lie more or less in the same plane , they are forming some sort of a disc in the sky .
The research team has also been able to show that most of these satellite galaxies rotate in the same direction around the Milky Way – like the planets revolve around the Sun .
Contradiction upon Contradiction
The physicists do belief that this phenomenon can only be explained if the satellites were created a long time ago through collisions between younger galaxies .
“ The fragments produced by such an event can form rotating dwarf galaxies , ” explains Dr. Metz , who has recently moved across to the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft - und Raumfahrt ( German Aero- space Center ) .
But there is an interesting catch to this crash theory , “ theoretical calculations tell us that the satellites created cannot contain any dark matter . ”
This assumption , however , stands in contradiction to another observation .
“ The stars in the satellites we have observed are moving much faster than predicted by the Gravitational Law .
If classical physics holds this can only be attributed to the presence of dark matter , ” Manuel Metz states .
Or one must assume that some basic fundamental principles of physics have hitherto been incorrectly understood .
“ The only solution would be to reject Newton´s classical theory of gravitation , ” says Pavel Kroupa .
“ We probably live in a non-Newton universe .
If this is true , then our observations could be explained without dark matter . ”
Such approaches are finding support amongst other research teams in Europe , too .
It would not be the first time that Newton ’s theory of gravitation had to be modified over the past hundred years .
This became necessary in three special cases : when high velocities are involved ( through the Special Theory of Relativity ) , in the proximity of large masses ( through the theory of General Relativity ) , and on sub-atomic scales ( through quantum mechanics ) .
The deviations detected in the satellite galaxy data support the hypothesis that in space where extremely weak accelerations predominate , a “ modified Newton dynamic ” must be adopted .
This conclusion has far - reaching consequences for fundamental physics in general , and also for cosmological theories .
Astrophysicist Bob Sanders from the University of Groningen declares : " The authors of this paper make a strong argument .
Their result is entirely consistent with the expectations of modified Newtonian dynamics ( MOND ) , but completely opposite to the predictions of the dark matter hypothesis .
Rarely is an observational test so definite . "
U.S. Mortgage Market Remains Solidly Frozen
On May 28 I wrote Mortgage Market Locks Up .
Ten year treasury yields started to soar and 30 year mortgages for good borrowers jumped a full point from 4.5 % to 5.5 % .
Mish , I ’ve attached two rate sheets to this e-mail .
One shows the rates from May 21st , and the other from today June 5th ( after a re-price ) .
You can see on May 21st 4.625 % was paying .375 points , and today 5.625 % is paying .25 points .
So in a little over 2 weeks rates have jumped 1 % .
That is a huge jump .
When you add in the effect of the new Home Valuation Code of Conduct ( HVCC ) appraisal process , many loans originations will never close .
This is because it is taking 15 - 25 days to get an appraisal back , and often those appraisals are coming 10 - 25 % low .
So locks expire or appraisals kill the deal , the latter possibly on purpose .
You are going to see the recovery in housing come to a complete halt .
Trade up buying is already dead .
Michael Becker On Wednesday I called Jeff Bell a Certified Mortgage Planning Specialist at Cobalt Mortgage for his take on the situation .
Jeff commented : " Mortgage rates jumped again to 5.75 % and refis are frozen solid .
The trade - up market is dead but some new houses are still moving .... for now . "
Fannie Mae 4.5 % Mortgage Backed Securities
The current price is 96.66 % .
Compared to a couple short weeks ago , that is a crash .
Interestingly Jeff Bell also commented on the new Home Valuation Code of Conduct ( HVCC ) , and is not too pleased with it .
One problem is lenders are requiring applicants to put up $ 500 for appraisals and if the amounts do not come in , even if they miss by a tiny bit , the deal is denied and the applicant is out $ 500 .
Jeff had a $ 1.2 million sale fall through because an appraisal was $ 20 K short .
A couple years back lenders were letting anything slide , now they appear to be looking for excuses to kill any deal , especially with the recent spike in rates .
If the appraisal and paperwork is not perfect , goodbye loan and goodbye $ 500 appraisal fee .
Customers are not too happy to say the least .
Two weeks ago when rates were hovering around 5.5 % Mark Hanson commented " Mortgage banks that made unhedged commitments at 4.25 - 4.75 % are now in a position to lose substantial sums of money . "
Today it 's an even bigger loss .
Mark thinks that new loan applications will dry up above 5.5 % .
Michael Becker and Jeff Bell made similar comments .
10 - Year Treasuries yielded 3.73 % on May 28 .
The yield is 3.93 % today .
Treasury Yield Curve 2009-06-11
Interest Rate Buydowns Dead , ARMs Alive
Refis and trades up are not the only things dead .
A couple weeks ago when rates started to spike , one could have paid a point or less and bought the rate down to 4.5- 4.75 % .
Now , Jeff Bell informs me that the same buydown today might cost as many a 6 points !
Wow !
Obviously no one will be willing to pay that much for a buydown .
Instead , ARMs are back in vogue and 4.75 % is doable on a 5 year ARM .
Excuse me for asking , but are n't ARMs resets and recasts one of the problems we are currently facing ?
Mortgage - Bond Yields Climb to New High Since Fed ’s Buying Plan
Please consider Mortgage - Bond Yields Climb to New High Since Fed ’s Buying Plan .
Yields on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage securities rose , setting a new high since the Federal Reserve announced plans to buy the bonds to drive down interest rates on new home loans and further thwarting the effort .
U.S. mortgage applications fell last week to the lowest level since February as a jump in borrowing costs discouraged refinancing and signaled that Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’s bid to cap rates is stalling , according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released today .
The Fed initially said on Nov. 25 that it would buy as much as $ 500 billion of mortgage securities , before announcing in March that it would expand the program to as much as $ 1.25 trillion , as well as buy $ 300 billion of Treasuries .
Fed Is Out Of Control
The question on my mind at the time was whether or not the mortgage action was a brief outlier .
It was n't .
Things are now worse .
Two days ago Michael Becker , a Mortgage Consultant at Green Pastures Mortgage & Finance wrote : What now Big Ben ?
You 've already blown over a third of your $ 1.25 trillion commitment and all you have to show for it is more garbage on your balance sheet and a locked up refi market .
One thing is clear , Ben Bernanke and the Fed have lost control of the mortgage market ( not that the Fed was ever in control in the first place ) .
They were n't .
It was all an illusion .
For now , the stock market is shrugging this off .
If rates stay above 5.5 % for long , do n't expect that to last .
And it may not last anyway .

TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) --
The clicking of dozens of news cameras drowned out the sobs of the 13 - year - old girl , but her face explained what was happening in the departure hall of Japan 's Narita International Airport .
Arlan and Sarah Calderon hug their daughter Noriko farewell .
Noriko Calderon , wearing her school uniform , was being forced to make one of the most wrenching choices of her young life :
To stay in the country of her birth rather than join her parents being deported to the Philippines .
The scene was the emotional climax to a story a decade and a half in the making -- one that has tugged at heartstrings in Japan , but ultimately failed to sway to an unyielding bureaucracy that activists say violates human rights .
Sound off :
Do you think Japanese authorities are doing the right thing ?
Filipinos Arlan and Sarah Calderon illegally entered Japan in the early 1990s on fake passports .
They married and had a daughter , Noriko .
Arlan found a stable job working for a construction company .
Noriko grew up Japanese , attending school and never learning her parents ' native language .
Noriko , like many Tokyo girls her age , loves hip - hop and hopes to be a dancer or a teacher at a dance school someday .
But her future in the only country she 's ever known went into limbo when Japanese immigration authorities arrested her mother in 2006 .
Her parents decided to fight Japan 's notoriously rigid immigration laws and for three years under a harsh media spotlight , they argued their case all the way to the country 's High Court , saying Arlan is gainfully employed and their daughter only speaks Japanese .
The family lost their case in the High Court , and Japan ordered Arlan and Sarah Calderon be deported back to the Philippines .
Watch CNN interview with family »
Activists claim Japan 's notoriously rigid immigration laws violate human rights .
An estimated 500 families are in the same situation according to lawyers , who accuse Japan of not respecting the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child .
Do n't Miss Japanese girl born to Indian surrogate arrives home
Japan 's Immigration Bureau in a statement to CNN said the couple 's illegal presence in the country as an " extremely malicious " violation that " shakes the foundation of Japan 's immigration control . "
But when it came to 13 year old Noriko , the government gave the girl a choice :
Her country or her parents .
" Japan is my homeland , " says Noriko , when asked why she is choosing to stay behind .
She will move in with an aunt , allowed to stay in Japan under a visa that the government will reassess yearly .
Her life , say her parents , will be better in Japan .
She 'll have schooling and the dreams a big city like Tokyo can offer her , versus the impoverished farm community her parents will move back to in the Philippines .
But as the Calderons packed up their small apartment in the days leading up to the deportation , the reality of what would soon happen to the family became more and more harsh .
" Until I 'm an adult , I need my parents , " Noriko said , her pink cheeks stained with tears .
" We wo n't be there when she needs us the most , " said Arlan Calderon .
" She has to protect herself on her own .
I 'm so sorry about that . "
Shogo Watanabe , the Calderons ' attorney , collected more than 20,000 signatures in Japan to try and keep the family together in the country .
" Children should be protected when their parents are punished .
It 's the child 's right .
But there 's no consideration for that at all .
I do not think the government is being flexible , " said Watanabe .
Under Japanese immigration laws , the Calderons wo n't be allowed back into Japan for five years .
They 've asked for a special waiver to visit their daughter after a year , but it has n't been granted yet .
So their last , public hug could be the last time they see their daughter until she 's 18 .
By last night a number of rightie bloggers were bristling with outrage that anyone would assume Dr. Tiller ’s murderer was an anti-abortion activist .
This morning I see that the person who has been accused of the murder — let ’s not forget the presumption of innocence — was an anti-abortion activist .
Peter Slevin and Robert Barnes write for the Washington Post that the accused man , Scott Roeder , “ is known in anti-abortion circles as a man who believes that killing an abortion doctor is justifiable . ”
As news of Roeder ’s arrest traveled , Kansas City activist Regina Dinwiddie remembered the day a dozen years ago when Roeder hugged her in glee after trying to frighten an abortion provider by staring him down inside a Planned Parenthood clinic .
“ He grabbed me and said , ‘ I ’ve read the Defensive Action Statement and I love what you ’re doing , ’ ” Dinwiddie said in a telephone interview .
She was a signer of the 1990s statement , which declares that the use of force is justified .
“ I said , ‘ You need to get out of here .
You can get in a lot of trouble , ’ ” Dinwiddie recalled .
Dinwiddie said she does not consider death of Tiller , the nation ’s most prominent provider of controversial late - term abortions , to be a homicide .
Another anti-reproductive rights activist , described Roeder as “ anti- government ” and recalls Roeder had visited Rachelle “ Shelley ” Shannon , convicted of shooting Dr. Tiller several years ago , in prison .
Also , in May 2007
Tiller ’s place of worship was identified on the Operation Rescue website , with the suggestion that people go there and “ ask questions ” ( i.e. , harass ) the pastor and church members .
Dr. Tiller was killed while handing out bulletins in the church ’s lobby .
Today rightie bloggers are bristling with outrage at the suggestion that hate speech they and others have flung at Dr. Tiller over the years had anything whatsoever to do with his murder .
Little Lulu :
Every mainstream pro-life organization has unequivocally condemned the killing .
I repeat : Every mainstream pro-life organization has unequivocally condemned the killing .
To me , this is akin to giving a known pyromaniac a can of gasoline and a book of matches and then denying you meant for him to start a fire .
Condemning the act after it has occurred does not whitewash one ’s complicity in it .
Malkin also is amused that so many of us are calling the murder of Dr. Tiller an act of terrorism .
“ Interesting how the t- word has been rediscovered , ” she says .
Malkin , you might recall , was at the forefront of the right - wing hysteria campaign against the recent Department of Homeland Security report to federal , state and local law enforcement regarding the threat of terrorism from right - wing extremists groups .
Malkin bristled with outrage at the suggestion that people such as , for example , anti-abortion activists might be capable of violence , and called the report a “ hit job ” on conservatives .
Seems that it ’s Lulu who needed to rediscover the “ t - word . ”
Today many people are focusing on Bill O’Reilly ’s long and highly visible crusade against Dr. Tiller .
It ’s one thing to declare that one is opposed to third trimester abortions ; it ’s another thing to lie about them .
O’Reilly said this on his radio program last year :
Now , a guy in Kansas , George Tiller , OK , can kill a baby — kill a baby — a half - hour before the baby ’s supposed to be birthed for no reason whatsoever other than the mother has a pain in her foot .
OK ?
Mother ’s health : pain in the foot , migraine headache , whatever it may be .
That ’s an outright lie .
Kansas law allows no such thing .
O’Reilly can tell one lie after another on radio and television , and call it “ journalism , ” and there appears to be no way to stop him from doing so as long as his employer , Rupert Murdoch , approves of it .
However , I sincerely hope Dr. Tiller ’s heirs take O’Reilly and Murdoch to court and sue their socks off .
This nation has a deep commitment to free speech without government censorship .
One of the few values Left and Right hold in common is the right of someone to say any damnfool thing he likes without penalty of law .
About the only exception is where personal injury is involved .
Many other western democracies place some limits on what people can say when it might incite violence , or sometimes just because — literature denying the Holocaust is banned in some places .
I do n’t want to go that way .
However , maybe it ’s time we revisited libel laws .
As a rule journalists — including faux journalists like O’Reilly — have little to fear from libel lawsuits , because the plaintiff has to prove “ actual malice . ”
Publishing or broadcasting an untruth , even when it causes harm , is not necessarily libelous if the defendant can claim it was an innocent mistake .
Of course , O’Reilly ’s been in “ reckless disregard for the truth ” territory for some time .
Perhaps we need to clarify exactly how far a public mouthpiece can go before he wanders into the litigation zone .
Update : See also “ O’ Reilly ’s campaign against murdered doctor ” at Salon .
But there ’s no other person who bears as much responsibility for the characterization of Tiller as a savage on the loose , killing babies willy - nilly thanks to the collusion of would - be sophisticated cultural elites , a bought - and - paid - for governor and scofflaw secular journalists .
Tiller ’s name first appeared on “ The Factor ” on Feb. 25 , 2005 .
Since then , O’Reilly and his guest hosts have brought up the doctor on 28 more episodes , including as recently as April 27 of this year .
Almost invariably , Tiller is described as “ Tiller the Baby Killer . ”
Tiller , O’Reilly likes to say , “ destroys fetuses for just about any reason right up until the birth date for $ 5,000 . ”
He ’s guilty of “ Nazi stuff , ” said O’Reilly on June 8 , 2005 ; a moral equivalent to NAMBLA and al - Qaida , he suggested on March 15 , 2006 .
“ This is the kind of stuff happened in Mao ’s China , Hitler ’s Germany , Stalin ’s Soviet Union , ” said O’Reilly on Nov. 9 , 2006 .

Now , that wo n't stop NeoCons and their expat / SAVAK / Shah people from pushing their agenda .
Reza Pahlavi's appearance before the National Press Club yesterday is certainly part of such efforts .
If you missed it , it is worth a look :
He certainly had some valid things to say , but there are some major problems with his remarks :
Because of his father 's regime , he is really in no position to be talking about any government acting unjustly .
The Shah 's injustice is directly related to the excesses and ferocity of the Revolution .
Moreover , among the people who support him are expats who stole billions of dollars from the people of Iran during the Shah 's regime , and ex-SAVAK people who I suspect still participate in our intelligence community .
When these people return the money they stole , and stand for their crimes against the Iranian people , then maybe they have the right to an opinion on the future of Iran .
When your governance distorts a country to the point where a violent revolution is required to get you to change , you have failed .
Very few people in Iran or the diaspora take Reza Pahlavi seriously .
He has absolutely no credibility .
That includes many who are diametrically opposed to the current Islamic Republic .
There are supporters , but they are a tiny minority .
To make a comparison , Reza Pahlavi is significantly less qualified to do anything regarding Iran than Ahmed Chalabi in Iraq .
We know how that turned out .
There is no single " moment of truth . "
Any solution will develop over time .
The people and the protesters in Iran have no doubts about " who stands with them . "
Does the never - Shah think that someone will be able to intervene ?
Does he think that the protesters are expecting the US to ride in like the cavalry ?
More thoughtful people need to push back pretty hard against this kind of political grandstanding .
I 'm pretty certain that Mr. Mousavi would laugh at this display if he saw it .
It remains difficult to predict how things will turn out in Iran .
However , Power Struggle provides a more useful framework of description for events than comparisons to the 1979 Revolution .
See this excellent article by Arshin Adib - Moghaddam in Today 's Guardian .
The Shah fell because there was widespread opposition to his rule , and his horrible mismanagement and injustice unified that opposition .
Today , there are distinct camps and a much more even split .
This split goes back to the early days of the Revolution , but it did not surface too clearly because of the united cause against Iraq from 1980 - 1988 .
During that time they fought for their survival , but as soon as the war ended the rifts surfaced again .
Mousavi left politics and the position of Prime Minister was eliminated .
Montazeri ( assumed to be heir to Khomenei ) began to slip because the hard - liners won out in the power struggle of 88 - 89 .
He 's been under house arrest for years , but as Grand Ayatollah , he is untouchable .
So what will happen now ?
Who knows .
Elections in Iran do matter -- the protests clearly attest to that .
The power struggle we are seeing also shows that the outcome matters .
If Khamenei and Ahmadinejad succeed they will have power , but they will also be fearful .
The result will be oppression .
If that occurs the world should not condemn and disengage .
In order for Khamenei and Ahmadinejad to survive they must be able to constantly point to a hostile outside world .
Part of their gambit here might be to turn further to the right to bring about more isolation of Iran .
An isolated Iran is the one they will be able to continue ruling .
One can hope that saner , less fanatic heads prevail .

With summer upon us , how many green vacationers ’ fancies will turn to thoughts of nudism ?
Going without clothes on beaches and other vacation spots is commonly called naturism — a description that implies helping the planet , as some practitioners claim to be doing .
Spending more time with nothing on stems waste and pollution in all sorts of ways , according to an article by Kathy Blanchard on The Naturist Society ’s Web site .
“ Living more hours naked each day results in a dramatic drop in my laundry , which in turn reduces my water and energy use ( along with my related bills ) , ” Ms. Blanchard wrote .
“ It also reduces the amount of soap I release , in my case , into the Puget Sound . ”
She also advocates naturist holidays — staying close to home wherever possible , to cut down on fuel usage — but sometimes traveling to places where it is possible to leave the car behind and backpack or paddle naked into the wild .
“ For those few days , we use virtually no fuel , our diet is minimal with low ecological impact , and we return healthier , ” she wrote , adding that the “ trips are coolly green clothes - free vacations . ”
Where to go ?
France is already a top destination for “ textilists ” ( a term some naturists use to describe clothes - wearers ) but also seems to be one of the most appealing spots for vacationing in the buff .
According to the tourist authority in the Aquitaine region on the French Atlantic coast , “ ‘ green ’ naturism is growing fast in popularity . ”
Of the 1.5 million people who practice naturism in France , nearly a third come to Aquitaine , while “ foreign naturists ” account for more than half of vacationers in the centers and campsites across the region .
( Presumably their fossil fuel use in transportation could cancel any climate benefits of going clothes - free . )
In the Swiss Alps , nude hiking in winter seems to be a growing phenomenon — although some locals are trying to outlaw the practice , as my colleague John Tagliabue wrote this year .
The prospect of winter raises another issue : for people going without clothes , global warming may have a fringe benefit .
Michael Hewitt says in an article in the article in The Independent that a few nudists seem happy that the demise of winter may be in the offing .
However , others may side with groups like EcoNudes , which believes that living in the buff has “ a positive effect on global warming , climate change and society . ”
Although some soldiers ran from Custer ’s Hill , they did hold their ground and fight from their position as long as they could .
The participating warriors called it a Last Stand .
Deal with it
The Battle of the Little Bighorn , fought on the banks of the river of that name in Montana Territory in June 1876 , is the most often discussed fight of the Indian wars .
It has been said that we will never know what happened there because there were no survivors .
That is nonsense .
There were thousands of survivors .
The Indians clearly told us what happened .
We need only to listen to what they said .
There are also many misconceptions about Lt. Col. George A. Custer and the 7th Cavalry , among them being that Custer had long yellow hair and that he and his regiment carried sabers into the battle .
In reality , Custer ’s hair was cut short , and the regiment left its sabers behind .
An examination of 10 of the major myths about the Battle of the Little Bighorn follows .
The first two myths are widely held fallacies that do not require Indian testimony to discredit ; the last eight myths are largely discredited by eyewitness accounts of those on the winning side .
Custer and All His Men Were Killed
The 7th Cavalry on June 25 , 1876 , consisted of about 31 officers , 586 soldiers , 33 Indian scouts and 20 civilian employees .
They did not all die .
When the smoke cleared on the evening of June 26 , 262 were dead , 68 were wounded and six later died of their wounds .
Custer ’s Battalion – C , E , F , I and L companies – was wiped out , but the majority of the seven other companies under Major Marcus Reno and Captain Frederick Benteen survived .
Custer Disobeyed His Orders
Many Custerphobes insist Custer violated Brig . Gen. Alfred Terry ’s orders .
We only need to read Terry ’s written instructions to clarify the situation .
Terry wrote that he “ places too much confidence in your zeal , energy , and ability to wish to impose upon you precise orders which might hamper your action when nearly in contact with the enemy . ”
Terry gave Custer suggestions that he should attempt to carry out , “ unless you shall see sufficient reason for departing from them . ”
In addition to the written orders , Terry entered Custer ’s tent before he left on his final march , and told him , “ Use your own judgment and do what you think best if you strike the trail . ”
Custer did not disobey his orders .
Custer Did Not Listen to His Scouts
Even using binoculars from the traditional Plains Indian lookout known as the Crow ’s Nest , Colonel Custer of the 7th Cavalry had trouble seeing the village in the valley some 15 miles away .
His scouts told him a large village was there .
He believed them , but he wanted to wait one more day , until the morning of June 26 , 1876 , to attack .
He told Half Yellow Face , “ I want to wait until it is dark , and then we will march . ”
The Crow scout replied , “ These Sioux …have seen the smoke of our camp , ” and argued that they must attack immediately .
Custer still wanted to wait .
Another Crow , White Man Runs
Him , said , “ That plan is no good , the Sioux have already spotted your soldiers . ”
Red Star , an Arikara , concurred that the Crows were right , and believed that Custer must “ attack at once , that day , and capture the horses of the Dakotas [ Sioux ] . ”
Shortly after , soldiers discovered Indians rummaging through some supplies they had dropped on the back trail .
Custer now knew his scouts were right .
He followed their advice and attacked immediately .
Custer did listen to his scouts .
The Indian Village Was Immense
Traditionally , the village on the Little Bighorn has been depicted as the largest ever seen in the West .
Actually there were at least one dozen villages larger , and geographical and spatial considerations illustrate the impossibility of the exaggerated size estimations .
A village that has been depicted as large as six miles long and one mile wide , in reality was 11⁄2 miles long and one - quarter mile wide .
It contained about 1,200 lodges and perhaps 1,500 warriors .
Custer was not “ crazy ” for attacking .
The Indians told us the village size .
Pretty White Buffalo said that the Cheyenne and Sans Arc camps were at the lower end of the village , across from the Medicine Tail crossing of the river .
Standing Bear said that the mouth of Muskrat Creek ( Medicine Tail ) was north of the Santee camp , which was the northernmost of the circles .
Two Moon said that the village stretched from Sitting Bull ’s Hunkpapa camp at Shoulder Blade Creek , to the Cheyenne camp at Medicine Tail ’s place .
Wooden Leg stated that the Cheyenne camp was just a little upstream and across from Medicine Tail Coulee , and at the other end were the Hunkpapas , just northeast of the present - day Garryowen Station , with all the camps east of the present road .
A soldier named Wolf drew a map depicting the camp conforming to the course of the river with its northernmost limits across from Medicine Tail .
Fears Nothing ’s map showed the entire camp between Medicine Tail in the north , to Shoulder Blade Creek in the south .
Standing Bear and Flying Hawk both produced maps that showed the northernmost limit of the camp to be south of Medicine Tail Creek .
The Indians showed us that the camp conformed to the river and was , at most , 11⁄2 miles long .
It was a large camp , certainly , but it was not several miles long and unconquerable .
Sitting Bull Set Up an Ambush
It is said that the Indians knew Custer and the 7th Cavalry were coming , and set a trap .
They did no such thing .
Pretty White Buffalo said that no one expected an attack ; the young men were not even out watching for the soldiers .
“ I have seen my people prepare for battle many times , ” she said , “ and this I know : that the Sioux that morning had no thought of fighting . ”
Moving Robe was digging wild turnips with other women several miles from camp when she saw a cloud of dust rise beyond the bluffs in the east .
She saw a warrior riding by , shouting that soldiers were only a few miles away , and that the women , children and old men should run for the hills in the other direction .
Antelope Woman ( Kate Bighead ) was bathing in the river with many others .
Scores of naked men , women and children were in the river and not expecting a battle .
Neither were many others playing or fishing along the stream .
Everyone was having a good time , said Antelope , and no one was thinking about any battle .
Low Dog said the sun was about at noon , and he was still asleep in his lodge .
He awoke to the shouts of soldiers , but thought it was a false alarm .
“ I did not think it possible that any white men would attack us , ” he said .
After breakfast , White Bull left his wife ’s lodge and went to tend the horses with no thoughts of any approaching danger .
When he heard a man yelling an alarm , he climbed a hill and could see the soldiers approaching .
He jumped on his best horse and drove the ponies back to camp .
Standing Bear awoke late that morning .
While they ate breakfast , his uncle said , “ After you are through eating you had better go and get the horses , because something might happen all at once , we never can tell . ”
Before they could finish eating , there was a commotion outside , and Standing Bear learned his uncle ’s premonition was correct .
The soldiers were coming .
They had been surprised .
Wooden Leg had been to a dance the night before , and slept late that morning .
He and his brother Yellow Hair went to the river and found many Indians splashing in the water .
The brothers found a shade tree and dozed off .
Suddenly an old man called out : “ Soldiers are here !
Young men , go out and fight them . ”
Red Feather slept late that morning and awoke to the words : “ Go get the horses – buffaloes are stampeding ! ” Indians began dashing into the camp with the ponies .
One , known as Magpie , shouted , “ Get away as fast as you can , do n’t wait for anything , the white men are charging ! ” Red Feather could see soldiers firing into Sitting Bull ’s camp .
Some Hunkpapas and Oglalas , caught up in the early panic , ran away .
Runs the Enemy heard that soldiers were coming , but did not believe it .
He sat back down with the men and continued smoking .
Rain in the Face admitted the soldiers came to the valley without warning .
“ It was a surprise , ” he said .
Sitting Bull , the chief who was said to have masterminded the ambush by the Indians , was caught up in the confusion .
When the soldiers attacked , his young wife , Four Robes , was so frightened that she grabbed only one of her infant twins and ran to the hills .
When asked where the second child was , she realized she had left it behind , and raced back to the lodge to retrieve it .
Later , the one left behind received the name Abandoned One .
This was not the household of a man who supposedly knew soldiers were coming and set a trap for them .
It is apparent from the Indian reactions that Custer had surprised the camp .
There was no ambush .
Custer ’s approach was successful .
In spite of attacking in broad daylight , he did surprise the village .
Custer ’s Tactics Were Faulty
It is said that Custer foolishly divided his force and allowed the regiment to be defeated in detail .
Yet , using part of a force to fix the enemy in front , and sending another portion to envelop the flank is a standard tactic of professional armies .
While Major Marcus Reno attacked the southern end of the village , Custer made a flank march to the north along the river bluffs .
The Indians , snapping out of their initial surprise , counterattacked Reno and chased him across the river to the east bank .
When they climbed the bluffs , they had another surprise : Custer was already beyond them , 11⁄2 miles north and closer to the village than the Indians were .
White Bull went up the bluffs where he saw something of great importance .
“ Where we were standing on the side of the hill we saw another troop moving from the east toward the north where the camp was moving , ” he exclaimed .
One Bull found a vantage point on the hill and saw more troops coming from the south , leading what appeared to be pack mules .
But a bigger problem was the troop force to the north .
Soldiers were already beyond the Indians and were heading toward the other end of the camp .
American Horse was in the valley while Reno ’s survivors climbed the hill .
When he turned to the river , he heard a man ’s voice calling out that more bluecoats were moving to attack the lower village , American Horse ’s own people .
He spun his horse around and quickly headed north .
Fears
Nothing reached the river and heard an Indian on the east bank calling that more soldiers were coming down from behind the ridge .
He rode up the bluffs to see for himself and clambered back down .
Once in the valley , he galloped north toward the mouth of Medicine Tail Creek .
Runs the Enemy noticed two Indians waving blankets on the eastern bluffs .
Crossing over with another Indian , he heard them yell that the soldiers were “ coming , and they were going to get our women and children . ”
He continued to the crest and the sight shocked him .
“ As I looked along the line of the ridge they seemed to fill the whole hill , ” he said .
“ It looked as if there were thousands of them , and I thought we would surely be beaten . ”
Runs
The Enemy raced downhill , across the river and back down the valley .
Wooden Leg had climbed a hill north of Reno ’s hilltop position when another Indian cried out : “ Look !
Yonder are other soldiers ! ”
Peering downriver , Wooden Leg saw them on the distant hills .
The news spread quickly , and the Indians began to ride after them to meet this other threat .
Short Bull was busy driving Reno out of the valley and into the hills .
He never noticed Custer until Crazy Horse rode up with his men .
“ Too late !
You ’ve missed the fight ! ” Short Bull called to him .
“ Sorry to miss this fight ! ” Crazy Horse laughed .
“ But there ’s a good fight coming over the hill . ”
Short Bull looked where Crazy Horse pointed .
For the first time he saw Custer and his men pouring over a hill .
“ I thought there were a million of them , ” he said .
“ That ’s where the big fight is going to be , ” Crazy Horse predicted .
“ We ’ll not miss that one . ”
Many Indians who chased Reno up the bluffs also realized that there were more soldiers already north of them , in a position to interpose themselves between the warriors and the village .
Moving along a ridge above Medicine Tail Coulee , less than two miles away , was Custer ’s Battalion .
It was a shock .
Custer had surprised them not once , but twice .
His tactics were working .
Custer Was Killed at the River
One of the major misconceptions of the Little Bighorn fight is that Custer was shot down in a midstream charge while crossing the river .
The idea stems from two sources : one was the Lakota White Cow Bull , and the other was two Crow scouts who were not there .
Many other Indian eyewitnesses who were there never said anything of the sort .
Two Moon said that Cheyenne guards were already posted on the east bank when Custer rode down .
In addition , many Lakotas had already crossed to the east side .
Warriors were across the river , some going upstream and some downstream , trying to get on each side of the soldiers .
Yellow Nose said he and his companions were already on the east side of the river when the soldiers first fired at them .
From the east bank of the river , White Shield saw that the troops were heading straight for them , and he believed they would break through and get across the river .
When the Gray Horses ( Company E ) got close to the river , they dismounted , and both sides fired at each other .
Bobtail Horse said the soldiers began shooting as they neared the ford leading to the camp .
He said : “ Let us get in line behind this ridge and try to stop or turn them .
If they get in camp they will kill many women . ”
Bobtail Horse said that his “ party had not advanced toward Custer , but were on the bank of the Little Horn on the same side as Custer . ”
The soldiers advanced , but , “ the ten Indians were firing as hard as they could and killed a soldier , ” Bobtail Horse explained .
The man ’s horse ran on ahead , and Bobtail Horse caught it .
The soldiers finally stopped .
This all happened on the east bank .
Red Hawk was fighting Reno ’s men , but went north in time to see a second group of soldiers coming down the ridge in three divisions .
They did not make it to the river , he said .
The first division only got to a point about one - half to three - quarters of a mile from the water .
Lone Bear said the soldiers got near the river , dismounted and began leading their horses , but they never got to the river .
Lone Bear watched as large numbers of warriors , both mounted and on foot , crossed over to the east bank and started after Custer before he reached the stream .
More warriors indicated the confrontation occurred east of the river .
Kill Eagle said , “ The Indians crossed the creek and then the firing commenced . ”
Wooden Leg said that the first three Cheyennes to cross the river were Bobtail Horse , Roan Bear and Buffalo Calf , and they fired on Custer while he was “ far out on the ridge . ”
He Dog said 15 or 20 Indians fought the troopers from the east side of the stream – near the dry creek , but not near the river .
Standing Bear also said that the Indians crossed the river as soon as Custer came in sight .
They took position behind a low ridge and were reinforced rapidly as more warriors crossed over .
“ There was no fighting on the creek , ” Standing Bear said .
Bobtail Horse , who was right there , indicated without hesitation that they were all on the east bank , on the same side as Custer .
Two years after the fight , Hump , Brave Wolf and Ice told 5th Infantry Lieutenant Oscar F. Long that the Indians crossed the river before Custer could possibly have forded .
They had already gained a small hill on the north side of the Little Bighorn and placed themselves between Custer and the river .
It is clear from the explanations of the Indians who were there that Custer ’s soldiers never got across the river , or even into it ; the Indians were already on the east ( north ) bank fighting them .
Where do we get the idea that Custer was killed in the river ?
Mostly from White Cow Bull .
His story has caused more mischief than almost any of the tales that have been circulated about the battle .
It is only White Cow Bull who supposedly said that he and Bobtail Horse shot a buckskin - clad soldier in the river .
Neither Bobtail Horse nor any of the other Indians who were there mention anything of the sort – they do n’t even say White Cow Bull was there .
Yet , White Cow Bull says that he , almost single - handed , stopped a full - scale cavalry charge in midstream .
No other Lakota or Cheyenne saw it .
They were not fighting on the river , but east of it .
White Cow Bull ’s story is just that – bull .
The Crow scouts Goes Ahead and White Man Runs Him reportedly told stories of Custer dying in the river .
Goes Ahead ’s tale comes from his wife , Pretty Shield , who was not there either , but said little other than Custer drank too much and rode into the river and died .
White Man Runs
Him did not see Custer , but heard later that Custer was hit in the chest by a bullet and fell into the water .
From such tales grew the myth that Custer was killed at the river .
It did not happen .
Crazy Horse ’s Ride to the North
One standard tale of the battle involves the legendary ride of Crazy Horse .
The story goes that Crazy Horse , with his tactical genius , judged the situation in a flash , gathered hundreds of his warriors , went north down the valley , crossed the river , swung east and swept down on an unsuspecting Custer from the north , completely surprising and overwhelming the befuddled commander .
Many historians and novelists have followed this scenario : Cyrus Brady , George Hyde , Charles Kuhlman , William Graham , Mari Sandoz , Edgar Stewart , David H. Miller , Stephen Ambrose , Henry and Don Weibert , James Welch , Robert Utley , Evan Connell , Jerry Greene and Doug Scott .
A slight variation on this theme comes from Richard Fox ; he has Crazy Horse approaching from Deep Ravine .
With all those historians concurring at one time or another over the years ( some have since modified their interpretation ) , the story must be true .
It is not .
How did it really happen ?
Again , the warriors who were there told us where Crazy Horse went .
After fighting Reno , Crazy Horse and Flying Hawk went back to the village to drop off some wounded warriors .
They immediately went to Medicine Tail Ford , where Short Bull and Pretty White Buffalo saw Crazy Horse crossing the river .
He was next located in the area of Calhoun Hill by numerous Indians who fought with him that day , including Foolish Elk , Lone Bear , He Dog , Red Feather and Flying Hawk .
White Bull rode from the bluffs where Reno had retreated , directly north on the east side of the river .
He approached Calhoun Hill from up Deep Coulee and worked around the hill where he joined Crazy Horse and his men , already fighting .
Had Crazy
Horse gone on his mythical northern sweep , or done half the deeds ascribed to him , he could not have been fighting near Calhoun Hill in this phase of the battle .
Crazy Horse was very reticent about speaking to white recorders .
His spokesman , Horned Horse , said that the soldiers ’ assault was a surprise .
The Indians had no plan of ambush .
Crazy Horse believed Custer mistook the women and children stampeding in a northerly direction down the valley for the main body of Indians .
The warriors merely divided into two groups , one staying between the noncombatants and Custer and the other circling his rear .
That is all there is to it .
Only after the collapse of the Calhoun - Keogh position did Crazy Horse continue north where he may have , finally , confronted the last of Custer ’s men making their stand on the far knob of the ridge .
Or maybe not .
Flying
Hawk indicated that during the final phase of the battle , Crazy Horse jumped on his pony and chased off after one of the last fleeing troopers .
Crazy Horse likely had nothing at all to do with the final fight on Last Stand Hill .
He did not make a several mile sweep down the valley and hit Custer near Last Stand Hill from the north , and he did not attack from up Deep Ravine .
Much of this incorrect story stemmed from Gall .
Edward Godfrey recorded him as saying , “ Crazy Horse went to the extreme north end of the camp . ”
He turned right and went up a very deep ravine and “ he came very close to the soldiers on their north side . ”
Remember , however , that the northern end of the camp was at Medicine Tail Coulee , not three miles farther , as many white historians believed , and “ north ” to most Indians , is “ east ” to white observers .
Why did we get it so wrong ?
It developed from a number of factors : different terrain perceptions between Indian and white , white exaggeration of the village size , poor critical examination of the accounts and a reluctance to take the time to re-research the primary sources .
An incorrect premise was accepted and perpetuated with each telling , and Crazy Horse ’s ride has drifted out of the realm of history and into the land of fantasy .
There Was No Last Stand
Of late there have been archaeological studies that have shined new light on some of the mysteries of the battle .
One of them , by Richard Fox , has taken the stance that the Custer battle had “ no famous last stand , ” and that the Last Stand is a myth , determined mainly because of artifact clustering patterns and because some men ran toward the river at the end of the fight .
Certainly , there was no Last Stand as in the 1941 movie They Died With Their Boots
On , but there was a stand .
Good Voiced
Elk said , “ No stand was made until the soldiers got to the end of the long ridge … . ”
Flying
By rode Battle Ridge to the north where he saw bodies of the soldiers who had been killed all the way along his path .
As far as he could see there had been only one stand , and it was made in the place where Custer would be killed , down at the end of the long ridge .
Lone Bear said the fight on Custer Hill was at close quarters , and , “ There was a good stand made . ”
Gall neared the end of the ridge where the last soldiers were making a stand , he said , and , “ They were fighting good . ”
Lights said the stand made at Custer Hill was longer than anywhere else on the field .
Two Eagles said the most stubborn stand by the soldiers was made on Custer Hill .
Red Hawk said the bluecoats were “ falling back steadily to Custer Hill where another stand was made , ” and , “ Here the soldiers made a desperate fight . ”
Iron Hawk saw 20 mounted men and about 30 men on foot on Last Stand Hill .
“ The Indians pressed and crowded right in around them on Custer Hill , ” he said .
But the soldiers were not yet ready to die .
Said Iron
Hawk , “ They stood here a long time . ”
He Dog participated in the chase that broke the soldiers ’ line , and helped drive the fleeing troopers along the ridge .
At the far end , Custer ’s men were putting up a good fight .
Red Hawk said that only after making a desperate fight on Custer Hill did the remaining soldiers retreat downhill .
Flying
Hawk said they kept after the fleeing soldiers until they got to where Custer was making a stand on the ridge .
There “ the living remnant of his command were now surrounded . ”
Although impressions of the stand ’s time length and degree of intensity vary among the observers , the fact that it took place cannot be erased .
Soldiers defending the northern portion of Custer ’s field inflicted most of the Indian casualties – the best defense was not made at Calhoun Hill .
The time spent in their fight and the results of their shooting are all the evidence we need to show that they defended their ground tenaciously .
An interpretation claiming that few government cartridges were found on Custer Hill cannot change this .
Although some soldiers ran from Custer ’s Hill , they did hold their ground and fight from their position as long as they could .
The participating warriors called it a Last Stand .
Deal with it .
28 Soldiers Died in Deep Ravine
Recent visitors to the battlefield may have walked down the Deep Ravine Trail to its end and read the interpretive sign .
The sign perpetuates another myth : that about 28 soldiers died within the steep - walled gully .
It has several quotes from Indians and soldiers who said they saw bodies in the ravine .
What are not listed are the statements from eyewitnesses who said that few , if any , bodies were there .
Interpretation should be based on historical and physical evidence whenever possible .
Battle relics and bones have been found virtually on every part of the Little Bighorn Battlefield .
Where they have not been found is in the trench of the Deep Ravine .
When the archaeological record shows no sign of bodies , it ought to be matched with the appropriate historical record – that there were few , if any , bodies in the Deep Ravine .
It is incredible that diametrically opposed historical and archaeological interpretations are presented as facts .
Since there is no physical record of soldier bodies in Deep Ravine , the interpretive sign should contain the appropriate historical commentary .
The Oglala warrior He Dog , said , “ Only a few soldiers who broke away were killed below toward the river . ”
Lone Bear said Custer Hill was “ the first and only place where the soldiers tried to get away , and only a few from there . ”
Waterman said , “ A few soldiers tried to get away and reach the river , but they were all killed . ”
Flying
By said that “ Soldiers were running through [ the ] Indian lines trying to get away … only four soldiers got into the gully by the river . ”
Two Moon explained that Custer ’s men “ stayed right out in the open where it was easy to shoot them down .
Any ordinary bunch of men would have dropped into a watercourse , or a draw . ”
Red Hawk tellingly reported , “ Some of the soldiers broke through the Indians and ran for the river , but all were killed without getting into it . ”
Iron Hawk said that at the fight ’s end , “ We looked up and the soldiers all were running … .
The furthest headstone shows where the second man that I killed lies …probably this was the last of Custer ’s men to be killed …. there was only one soldier sneaking along in the gulch . ”
Probably the clearest white voice that denies bodies in the Deep Ravine came from eyewitness Lieutenant Charles F. Roe , who was there right after the battle , and whose job it was to return to the field in 1881 , rebury the bodies on the ridge and place the stone monument above them .
In a letter to Walter Camp in 1911 , responding to Camp ’s persistent , incorrect questions about bodies in the ravine , Roe finally said : “ I put up the markers near the deep ravine you speak of .
There never was twenty - eight dead men in the ravine , but near the head of said ravine , and only two or three in it . ”
What can we gather from all this ?
There were many participants who saw what happened at the Little Bighorn , and we should not discount their stories in favor of speculation from those who did not see the events – neither those who lived in the 19th century nor those who make their livings by writing stories today .
It is difficult to debunk the old legends , however .
Myths die hard – even when hundreds of eyewitnesses have already told it like it was .
Historian Gregory Michno , who writes from Longmont , Colo. , is a frequent contributor to Wild West .
His much acclaimed books Lakota Noon : The Indian Narrative of Custer ’s Defeat and The Mystery of E Troop : Custer ’s Gray Horse Company at the Little Bighorn are recommended for additional reading , along with Lakota Recollections of the Custer Fight : New Sources of Indian - Military History , by Richard G. Hardorff , and Wooden Leg : A Warrior Who Fought Custer , by Thomas B. Marquis .

According to his twitter account , Dylan Jobe will be submitting a “ milestone ” build to SCEA by Friday .
No game title was specified , but the newly formed Lightbox Interactive headed by Dylan Jobe has been rumored to be working on a “ Warhawk in Space “ .
Shortly after those rumors had surfaced SCEA trademarked the name Starhawk .
E3 starts exactly 4 days after this build is to be submitted to Sony , so it ’s likely that we will see Starhawk , or another Lightbox Interactive title at E3 .
PlayStation LifeStyle will be bringing you all the E3 coverage directly from the expo starting June 2 so stay tuned !

Last year , I had my own brief experiment with smart drugs .
I felt burned out after a series of long foreign assignments , and my brain was rustily chug-chugging along at half - speed .
That 's when I first read about a drug being billed as " Viagra for the brain " – not Ritalin , but Provigil , a brand name for modafinil .
It was originally designed for narcoleptics , but clinical trials stumbled across something odd : if you give it to non-narcoleptics , they become smarter .
Their memory and concentration improves considerably , and so does their IQ .
There were no known side - effects , except – oh , thank you !
– weight loss .
I hunted it down online .
A week later , the little white pills arrived in the post .
Within a few hours of a 200 mg dose , I found myself gliding into a state of long , deep concentration , able to read a book for six or seven hours at a time without looking up .
My mood was n't any different ; I was n't high .
It was like I had opened a window in my brain and all the stuffy air had seeped out , to be replaced by a calm breeze .
On Provigil , I had the most productive month of my life , writing reams of articles .
I did n't notice any side - effects – until the third week .

At any given time , only a small amount of your brainpower is dedicated to the tasks immediately in front of you .
The rest is working on other stuff – processing memories , your subconscious , your creative thoughts .
But Provigil points all your mental guns forward .
It deploys far more of your brainpower on to your direct task .
It 's great at first – but it has a cost .
After a while , you realise that your mental life is oddly depleted .
Creative thoughts do n't come to you any more .
You are running on the imaginative store you built up before Provigil , and whizzing through it efficiently , but you are n't inventing anything new .
That part of your brain is undernourished .
You feel fast and flat .
When I stopped taking them , my brain went back to its slower , scrappier state – but my creative impulses came back .
I was more spontaneous again .
So I have cut a deal with myself .
I keep a pack in the bathroom cabinet for the days when I am really knackered and have to be able to work fast and fluently – but I do n't ever take more than one or two a month .
But if I ever had to do exams again , I would take Provigil .
And here 's the ethical dilemma .
Is this the equivalent of athletes taking steroids ?
Does it create an unfair pressure for other people to take these drugs – which are still pretty expensive – to keep up with other students and co-workers ?
Or would we be unfairly holding the human race back by refusing to smarten up ?
We can't escape these dilemmas now .
Smart drugs are only going to become more subtle and powerful as money flows in .
As Professor Anjan Chatterjee says : " This age of cosmetic neurology is coming , and we need to know it 's coming . "
My little pack of Provigil is a challenge to us all .

More good news comes from the Blue Oval camp today as Ford CEO Alan Mulally has said that the automaker plans to " [ increase ] production to support the desirability of Ford products . "
Despite a downturn in new car sales , Ford – the only member of the Detroit 3 automakers that has not filed for bankruptcy protection in the last two months – has actually managed to gain a few ever - important percentage points of market share from its global rivals , including fellow American automakers General Motors and Chrysler
In related news , Mulally says that Ford is well on its way to returning to profitability in 2011 as planned .
Last year , Ford recorded its worst - ever loss of $ 14.8 billion and expects to continue posting smaller losses through 2009 and 2010 , but Mulally is confident the company has sufficient funds on hand to finance the turnaround plan made possible by the $ 23 billion the automaker raised in 2006 shortly before the global economy hit the panic button .
A major portion of Ford 's turnaround plan is based on " more and more electrification , both hybrids and battery electric vehicles , " said Mulally , which is consistent with stated goals set out by the Obama Administration .
Earlier this week , Ford accepted $ 5.9 billion in U.S. Department of Energy loans to retool factories to build more environmentally friendly cars and trucks .

“ I believe in no religion .
There is absolutely no proof for any of them , and from a philosophical standpoint Christianity is not even the best . ”
That ’s what Jack “ C.S. ” Lewis wrote to one of his friends when he was 17 years old .
Lewis told us , years later , that The Horse and His Boy is the story of the “ calling and conversion of a heathen . ”
He does n’t mean the term “ heathen ” as something offensive , and would of course put his past self in that same category .
He was also — when he was an atheist — sensitive to the arrogance of religious people who talked as though they had found the truth and he had not .
Never one to shy away from strong opinions , he did n’t seem to take it personally when others thought him arrogant in the same way after his conversion .

From The Past To The Future : Tim Sweeney Talks
By Benj Edwards
Gears of War. Unreal Engine .
Journalists commonly use these two phrases to quickly encapsulate the history of Epic Games , a highly successful video game developer based in Cary , North Carolina .
And why not ?
The Gears of War franchise has sold gazillions of copies , and the Unreal Engine commonly powers blockbuster titles like BioShock .
Both successes have made the gaming industry look up and take notice .
But to stop with those platitudes is to ignore a much deeper and richer past .
Epic Games , founded by Tim Sweeney in 1991 , has a much bigger gaming footprint than most people realize .
When I hear " Epic , " I think back to a time in the early 1990s when I was deeply involved in my local computer bulletin board system ( BBS ) scene .
BBSes were early dial - up online services that provided message boards , primitive online games , and numerous free files to download .
At that time , Epic MegaGames -- as Sweeney 's company was then called -- published some of the world 's most popular and successful shareware games .
Games like Jill of the Jungle , Jazz Jackrabbit , Epic Pinball , and others could be found in nearly every BBS file section across the U.S .
And the game that started it all for Sweeney was ZZT .
Released in 1991 , ZZT is a text - based action / adventure / puzzle shareware title with a built - in game editor and scripting language .
Think LittleBigPlanet in text .
Sweeney 's experiences with ZZT led directly to Epic 's success with Unreal Engine , which inseparably integrates game engine and editor much in the same way ZZT did .
Sweeney -- now CEO and technical director of Epic -- is probably a genius , and he 's definitely a geek .
But he 's not a geek in your standard " never leave the basement " sense .
Although soft - spoken , Sweeney is quietly confident , and he possesses a keen business instinct that is rare in an analytical genius of his caliber .
That instinct for business led him ( and Epic ) directly where they are today .
Earlier this year , I met with Sweeney to discuss his personal history over lunch .
With so much press coverage overlooking Epic 's early days , he was happy to oblige .
During our one and a half hour conversation , we talked in earnest about Sweeney 's early programming days , the story behind ZZT , the origins of Epic , the '90s shareware business , and even a bit about the future as well :
The Early Years
Where did you grow up , and where were you born ?
Tim Sweeney : I grew up in Maryland in a little town called Potomac .
It 's where my parents live .
My father started out working for the government .
He worked for the Defense Mapping Agency creating maps from satellite imagery long before that was commonplace .
Do you mind if I ask you when you were born ?
TS : 1970 .
That makes me 38 now .
Scary .
That 's really old .
For a long time -- this shows how old Epic is -- I was a really young guy running a game company .
That was kind of unusual .
The funny thing , though , is you see that happening throughout the whole industry .
People really started getting into game development in a big way in the early - mid 1990s , so the industry 's grown that much older .
Everybody 's growing up together .
TS : Yeah .
Back then , your typical developer was in his twenties ; now , he 's in his thirties .
Most developers have a family -- wife and kids -- so the industry 's really changed a lot .
What was the first computer you ever used ?
TS : I started out with an Apple II .
Which was a good computer to learn with because it had absolutely no hardware accelerated graphics or anything like that .
It was just a little 6502 processor , so you had to do absolutely everything yourself .
Of course , you learned things the hard way , and you basically learned about computer science rather than " how to use a Commodore 64 light - blinking flashing effect . "
Did you program assembly on that , or did you just stick to BASIC ?
TS : I started out with BASIC and then I learned machine language .
I did n't know assemblers existed at that point , so I just learned the hex op codes and typed them into the little debugger manually .
I 'd write some fairly complicated assembly programs , manually assembled .
That was a crazy time .
A lot of game developers actually started out that way .
When I was out at Richard Garriott 's new start - up , which is now NCSoft Austin , he had an Apple II sitting out , so we 're like , " Oh wow ! " I sat down , and I could still type the crazy assembly codes into it .
Yeah .
That was my first computer as well -- an Apple II +.
It was already pretty old when I got it , but I learned how to program BASIC on it .
TS : The great thing about that computer -- I just bought one about a year ago to go back and use it .
The thing that strikes me is the first thing that starts up when you boot it .
You 're in a programming language .
Try to find a programming language in Windows .
Your computer 's a million times faster , but you can't do a damn thing with it .
What was the first video game or computer game you remember playing ?
TS : I used to play the early arcade games .
You know , there 's Pac - Man , Defender ... there 's this one I was addicted to for a while , Space Firebird .
It was this little Galaxian - style game with a bunch of things flying around .
I was never really a serious gamer that way , but I 'd go to the arcades a lot and play them .
I guess when I was about eight or nine , the Atari 2600 came out , and it was a really sucky game machine .
It was obvious even at the time that it was sucky relative to what the arcades could do .
It was disappointing .
After that , I got the Apple II , and I really missed out on all of the game consoles after that .
I missed out on the early Nintendo and Sega Genesis .
I ended up basically being a generation ahead of CliffyB -- you know , the guys who got into computers and did gaming the computer route rather than going into the game consoles .
You end up with a very different perspective that way .
Sounds like it .
So you started programming on the Apple II .
Did you move on from there to a PC ?
TS : I got a PC in 1989 .
The Apple II is a great machine , but the problem was that , by the late 1980s , there was really no market around it anymore .
There were n't games being actively developed , all of the bulletin board systems and developer forums had moved on to IBM - based development .
I moved , kinda begrudgingly , ' cause it was a pretty complicated and messy machine at the time , you know , with DOS and early Windows .
I got that in 1989 ; I started writing random little programs for it .
I 'd written maybe several hundred programs for the Apple , including maybe fifty little games .
Some of them were pretty extensive , but I 'd never released anything until ZZT , which I started in 1990 and then released in early 1991 sometime .
Did you make any games like ZZT for the Apple II ?
TS : Yeah .
So I guess I was 11 .
The first serious game I wrote for the Apple II was -- the Apple II had this low resolution graphics mode , it was like 40 dots by 24 dots .
But you had 16 colors to work with , which was just a huge number of colors .
So I made this game in the style of Atari's Adventure : you are a dot and you move the dot around the screen and you pick up different items and go between rooms , so I learned most of the basic programming techniques back then .
I started out writing one program for each room in the game world .
So I 'd write my own little input loop for each room , and then I realized , " Oh wow , there are subroutines , so I can call a subroutine to do an input . "
And that generalized everything .
Then I realized I could store the game board procedurally rather than writing a program to draw them and then reading the frame buffer to go from there .
So I learned a huge amount of programming techniques that way .
I was probably 12 or so , in probably 1982 or ' 83 when I wrote that .
Did you ever want to show those to the world ?
That would be pretty amazing .
If you ever wanted to release those , I could help you copy the disks into disk images -- if you still have those disks .
TS : Sadly , I do n't .
It just did n't seem important .
Yeah , that 's the tragedy .
I do n't have the ZZT source code either .
I wish I 'd saved it all .
What happened to the source code ?
Did you lose it accidentally or ...
TS : No , I just did n't pay attention to it .
There were so many other things going on at the time .
It was probably lost some time when we were working on five Epic projects -- you know , working with Cliff on Jazz Jackrabbit and James Schmalz on Solar Winds , and all these other games .
There were a few years at Epic where I 'd gone from being a programmer , writing all of the games , to just managing projects -- I was basically a producer for about three years before I started working on Unreal as a programmer again .
And that was crazy -- that was 16 - 18 hours a day straight for years .
The Origins of ZZT & Epic
Did your parents have any experience with starting businesses ?
Is that where you got the idea to start your own company ?
TS : My older brother , Steve Sweeney , who 's 15 years older than me , grew up in Maryland also , but then he moved out to the west coast and got involved in a bunch of start - ups in San Diego .
When I was about eleven , I went out there several times to visit him .
He was my role model for a few years there , because he was still pretty young and he was working for a bunch of cool companies .
I got to see the offices where he was working .
He had all sorts of computers -- he was doing crazy things for minicomputers and mainframe communication at the time , and he'd be designing software and hardware drivers to run it .
And he had a cool car and he had his own little house near the beach .
That was really cool , just to see that in the computer business , you did n't need to have an ordinary job at a company -- just go wear a suit every day .
You could have fun between companies doing different projects .
So that really was a big influence on me in deciding to start a company .
Take me through the process of when you started making ZZT .
TS : The funny secret behind ZZT is it started out while writing a text editor .
I 'd used Turbo Pascal and other languages on the PC , but I did n't like any of the editors that came with them , so I started writing my own .
I got bored with that at some point and decided to make the cursor into the smiley face character , and then make different characters you could type that would block the player or move around in different ways .
See , you 'd use this text editor to draw the game board and then move around it and play the game .
That eventually evolved into the game and the editor ZZT .
It 's funny , because ZZT is one of few things that started out as a tool before it was a game .
And all the gameplay evolved from just thinking of random weird things to do with the characters .
There were some other games along those lines like NetHack and Kroz .
I was going to ask you about Kroz .
When I first saw ZZT , I thought it was a lot like Kingdom of Kroz from Apogee .
Did that inspire you in any particular way ?
TS : I 'd been working on ZZT for several months -- I guess it was three or four months -- before I saw Kroz or NetHack or I realized anybody else had done anything like that .
So I 'd come up with a bunch of ideas on my own , and then I played all of those games and saw that there were a whole lot of other ideas to draw from .
For example , Kroz had these bombs where you have this little thing that looked like a bomb on the screen , and then you touch it , it starts a countdown , explodes , and clears out some blocks .
So I borrowed a bunch of ideas from it at that point .
That 's kind of a common pattern in everything I do .
One minute I 'm completely on my own and I think , " Wow , I 'm a genius , I can't believe this idea nobody else had ! "
And then you look at the references on it , and it turns out that a hundred other people have done the same things in the 1980s .
And then you look , and you get your additional ideas from those .
Between invention and stealing , you come up with a really good combination of ideas .
When you were writing ZZT , where did you live ?
I read that you were going to school .
TS : I was in the University of Maryland at the time .
Gosh , I guess I started in 1989 -- that was crazy .
At that point , I was two years into college , going to school ; I was doing mechanical engineering at University of Maryland .
University of Maryland is a party school unless you 're in engineering , so that was really tough , actually .
I learned a lot of useful math that I would n't have learned on my own .
I basically studied and did school work all day , then programmed all night -- working on ZZT .
On the weekends , I 'd come home , and I had this little shareware business I was growing after I released the game .
I 'd receive a bunch of orders through the mail ( people would send their checks in ) , then I 'd copy disks on the computer and send them out .
At the same time , I was working on Jill of the Jungle , the next game .
Did you live with your parents or did you have your own place ?
TS : I was in a college dorm for four years there , but I was still in the same town with my parents -- I 'd go back there on weekends .
Mostly , I kept my computer there and did most of my work from there .
Did you ever finish your degree in mechanical engineering ?
TS : Not quite .
Epic was growing rapidly , and I was one credit short after four years .
I did n't follow through and get the degree .
Did your college studies in mechanical engineering have any influence on your game engine design ?
Are the two related in any way ?
TS : I 've always enjoyed building things , from go - karts to programs .
And I wanted to avoid undergraduate computer science studies -- the courses were n't challenging because I knew most of it from my programming work .
Mechanical engineering seemed like a good alternative .
But it was somewhat disappointing , as it takes far more effort to build an interesting mechanical contraption than an equally interesting program .
However , the math courses were immensely useful .
There are some things you just do n't know you need to know until you know them .
Where is the University of Maryland ?
TS : College Park .
It 's close to Washington , D.C. My parents lived in Potomac , Maryland .
It 's a rural - looking area along the Potomac River .
So that 's why you called your company " Potomac Computer Systems " first .
TS : Yeah , that 's how I started out .
The name sounds almost scientific .
Why did you change to Epic MegaGames ?
TS : I started Potomac Computer Systems because I wanted to do computer consulting .
I 'd gone through this succession of jobs : I had this job at a hardware store that paid four dollars an hour -- basically minimum wage .
That really sucked .
It was really hard work , and I did n't make much money .
I started mowing lawns after that , and I found out that by getting a tractor and going around and being entrepreneurial , I could make about 20 dollars an hour mowing lawns .
So I was thinking , " What can I do to make more than this ? "
I was going to start a little computer consulting business where you create little custom databases or things for people -- but that took a lot of work , actually , and I did n't get anywhere with it .
So I had all this business letterhead and business cards with " Potomac Computer Systems , " and by the time I finished ZZT , I thought , " Oh , might as well just use this . "
I had n't really thought of it as a game company until after releasing ZZT .
After ZZT came out , I was selling about three or four copies a day , which is a hundred dollars a day .
It was income you could live on , actually .
I decided I was going to try to do that full - time and make a living from it , so I started working on Jill of the Jungle , this 2D side - scrolling game .
That was early 1992 , and at that point , Apogee had released a number of little 2D games , and id Software had released Commander Keen .
It was clear that there was some real money to be made in that business .
I was trying to grow PCS into a real company , so at that point I realized that we needed a serious name , so I came up with " Epic MegaGames " -- kind of a scam to make it look like we were a big company .
Because " Epic " sounds big , is that what it was ?
TS : " Epic ... Mega ... Games " -- yeah .
Of course , it was just one guy working from his parents ' house .
Did you get the name from any specific place ?
Did you think of other possible names first and pick one from that ?
TS : Yeah , I was thinking of a bunch of names .
At that point I was kinda fixated on competing with Apogee software , which later became 3D Realms .
They were , by far , the number one shareware publisher at that point -- very similar to Epic in our business model .
I was trying to think of a name that would stand up well against that name .
I was thinking , " Apogee ... Perigee ... Epic . "
There were a bunch of little ideas I came up with , but Epic seemed interesting for the time .
Of course , once the company became really successful after Unreal , I figured we did n't need to pretend , so we dropped the " Mega " part .
It 's kinda like growing up a little bit , I guess .
Your name seems more serious that way , but strangely enough , I still think of you as " Epic MegaGames . "
TS : That 's funny .
The " Mega " did n't stand the test of time .
Now it seems like a 1980s type of name .
But " Epic " stands out well .
Yeah , " Epic " is a great name .
TS : Of course , now there 's a resurgence in the use of the word " epic " associated with everything , and it 's horribly overused , so that will probably seem a little dumb in a few years .
Does the name ZZT stand for anything ?
TS : No .
At that point , games were mainly distributed on bulletin board systems [ BBSes ] -- basically the precursor to the internet .
I always wanted to run one myself , but I figured if I had done that , I probably would n't have had any time to develop games .
So it was probably a good career move not to .
There was this scam : everybody who released shareware would rearrange their name so they would always be sorted to the top when people listed out the files available for download .
So at that top of all the file lists , there was this huge clutter of junk that you wanted to skip past .
So I did the opposite and named ZZT so it would appear at the bottom of all the lists .
So ZZT was just a scheme for that .
It 's also the cartoon sound effect .
In ZZT itself , there are a couple references to ZZT with a dot after each letter as if it were an acronym .
TS : No , it was n't an abbreviation for anything .
Some people were trying to reinvent what the name actually was .
Somebody came up with " Zoo of Zero Tolerance " -- but no , it was n't really an abbreviation .
I 'd actually thought of the name " ZZT " years before I created that game -- it just seemed like the right name for it then .
How long did it take to program ZZT ?
TS : ZZT was n't a very big project .
It was certainly under a thousand hours .
I think I spent about nine months on it just because I was working on it part time between mowing lawns in the summer and going to class in the school year .
It was a relatively simple project ; I think it was 20,000 lines of Pascal code .
Wow , Pascal .
TS : Yeah , it was a good language .
It was more rigorous than C ++.
When I moved from Pascal to C++ to create Jill of the Jungle , it was a real shock that people would actually be using a programming language that was so bad for large - scale development .
To think that operating systems are built in that sort of language was really terrifying .
So you think Pascal is more ideal to work in than C ?
TS : It forced the programmer to be more structured and to avoid low - level hacking as much .
It 's not the best way to get maximum performance , but I think people tend to write much cleaner code when working in a language like Pascal than in C ++.
It influences your whole way of thinking about systems when you 're writing code in a really structured way like that .
How many copies of ZZT did you sell ?
TS : Several thousand .
I 'd say four or five thousand by now .
I was selling three to five a day for the first several years .
My father still lives at the address where Potomac Computer Systems started up , so he still gets an order every few weeks .
Does he fill them for you ?
TS : Yeah , he 's retired now , so he does n't have much to do .
Every week , he 'll just take a stack of a few orders , put disks in them , and mail them out .
So you can still buy ZZT .
That 's great .
I should buy a copy from him .
There 's a character in ZZT that my friend loves called " Jazz Man , " and he sings a little tune .
Is there any story behind that ?
TS : Yeah , I was in high school jazz band .
I was learning jazz improv -- really badly .
I just drew a bunch of random stuff in ZZT .
That was the great thing about the game : the graphics were so bad that you could do whatever you wanted , and people would be forgiving of it .
There 's just so much bizarre stuff in ZZT that you could never do in a graphical game that had to be realistic and immersive .
I liked that about it too -- there was the talking tree .
TS : [ laughs ]
Yeah .
One of the common themes you hear from artists is that to create great artwork , you have to highly constrain yourself : limit the tools you can use , limit the media you 're working with , and then just do the best thing you can do there .
ZZT is really the ultimate expression of that -- it 's such a weird , constrained environment that there 's a certain set of things you can do , so it 's really flexible and interesting .
Whereas now , you can go license a game engine like Unreal .
You can build absolutely anything , so it 's much , much harder to create something that 's cohesive .
Distracted by Network Protocols
I ran a BBS for about five or six years , from 1992 to 1998 ...
TS : That was an interesting time , because ' 92 was before the internet had come along , so at that point there were a bunch of efforts to create some graphical protocol for communications so you could dial up into a BBS graphically .
Like RIP graphics ?
Stuff like that ?
TS : Yeah , there was that .
There were a bunch of Apple - based efforts , a bunch of IBM - based efforts , and that really seemed like a fertile area .
And , at the time , if you asked me what I was going to do when I became a programmer full time in 1990 or 1989 , I saw that as the key problem to solve .
I saw a hundreds - of - millions type of opportunity in that , if you could be the one to define the standard graphics protocol for communicating with stuff , then you could dominate .
I spent quite a lot of time working on communication programs before I wrote games .
It 's funny , because if I had pursued that , I would have gone the obvious route of just trying to create a graphical protocol for modems and missed the whole point of the internet , which is quite a lot more than that , right ?
You dial up into this system , but then you can communicate with all these different computers , and they 're all connected through fast back end server connections throughout the world : anybody can message anybody else , and so on .
That was an extremely interesting problem at the time .
I came pretty close to starting a business and pursuing that very seriously .
I thought the same thing -- in fact , a lot of people were trying to make some sort of web - based BBS back then , but obviously it did n't matter , because other ways of communicating on the internet took over from the BBS model .
TS : When I saw the web for the first time , in 1994 or so , that was really the most important business realization I 'd had in my life , ' cause I 'd spent thousands of hours working on communication programs , and graphical protocols , and things like that .
I 'd been fixated on the problem -- which did turn out to be the central problem of that decade -- and completely missed the point of the thing , which was that you 're not just trying to create a graphical protocol , but you needed to create a system that connected all the different machines together and then communicated asynchronously , right ?
The big thing about the web is that you download this page and you 're locally navigating through it -- you know , scrolling up and down , and selecting text -- as opposed to it being like a terminal , where you 're sending mouse input and receiving draw commands back .
I remember using the graphical web for the first time and thinking , " Can people watch me doing this ? "
I could watch my users type out stuff on a BBS , so I thought that maybe someone could watch me navigate in my browser real - time .
TS : After that realization about the web , I felt really idiotic .
It forced me to be in the mindset of " Everything I do from now on needs to be thought through carefully . "
With every major technical problem , I did n't just look at " What is the problem I 'm trying to solve ? " , but I took a much bigger perspective : " How can we really change the game and win this ? "
When it came to developing Unreal -- I think we started that in 1994 -- James Schmalz was writing a solo assembly language 3D game with a dragon flying over a terrain , kind of a Magic Carpet knock - off .
And I was tasked with writing the editor for it .
But I really thought that through in a huge amount of depth in advance -- you know , looking at what Quake did and Doom did : they had this little crappy editor with a very advanced game engine behind it .
Completely separate programs .
I thought it through in a whole lot of detail , and I thought that content development was really the essential ingredient in all of that .
It was important to spend even more effort on the editor and tools than the actual game itself , just to empower the artists to make a great game .
So we came up with this editor - centric approach to game development , where you had this integrated editor that used the game engine for real - time display of everything .
Real - time editing of everything , and all of that .
And that came from really methodically thinking through the problem of " What do you really do , and how do I not miss the point in this revolution ? "
ZZT was like that too , right ?
It was an editor and an engine .
Users could create their own content , which was my favorite part about the whole thing .
TS : I really stumbled on that idea , rather than having it in advance .
It just evolved from creating this editor that turned into a game editor that turned into a game .
And throughout the whole thing , I did recognize the importance of development tools , but I really never had a conception of what the game was going to be until it approached completion , whereas with Unreal -- really , ZZT was the road map of what the thing would look like .
It 's a structure that we 've been copying and pasting into ever - more - advanced game engines ever since : you have this editor , you have this game runtime , they use the same display environment , same programming language .
You have a scripting language for defining game events .
There 's really a huge amount of similarity between ZZT and Unreal , if you look at it .
Unreal is a hundred or two - hundred times more complicated with more code , but it 's still very similar in structure .
So you definitely credit ZZT as the base of your Unreal Engine ideas .
If you had n't done ZZT , you probably would n't have thought of Unreal that way , right ?
TS : Yeah .
Otherwise , we could have focused on making just a game , and the editor would have sucked .
We would have built everything in 3D Studio Max .
We would have missed out on many of the most interesting ideas behind it .
And that would have seriously been detrimental with the mod community .
Beyond ZZT
Tell me about Super ZZT .
Were there any improvements in the engine that were substantial over ZZT ?
TS : Super ZZT was the same basic engine , but I extended it to scroll , so now you had these boards that were -- I do n't remember the size -- several thousand by several thousand , so you could go for several boards at a time just scrolling smoothly through the environment .
I thought that was a big improvement .
It was kind of the ideal I was heading for .
I really love the Ultima style of game where you had this expansive , seemingly - limitless landscape that you can go through .
But I never really got to that point with Super ZZT .
I had this idea from the very beginning that it was going to be a streaming game world , where you could have unlimited board sizes -- you know , millions by millions if wanted -- and it would just load parts of it on demand as you go through .
But I was constrained for time .
I wanted to ship something , and be able to release a lot of games , so I did n't put the effort into it .
The other thing I would have really loved to do but just did n't have the time for was make it a BBS - based game , so ideally , you could have a bunch of users dialing in and playing together , each user moving independently .
I always wished for a multi-user ZZT -- like a MUD where you could build stuff in ASCII graphics and just have other people interact through that .
TS : Yeah , even better : keep it live , right ?
You'd be able to build things in the MMO environment while people are playing through it .
While they 're playing , yeah , just like on MUSHes .
I do n't know if you 've ever been on MUDs or variants of them where you can program in a " softcode " -- a language written within the language .
TS : I saw a MUD in the late 1980s at one point , and it was astonishing to me .
I 'd never had any idea that you could create a multiplayer game like that with lots of players playing together -- and this one probably had 10 or 20 playing together at a time .
It was just astonishingly cool .
From that point on , I could kind of envision the whole massively - multiplayer game idea -- it was obvious that you could take those techniques and extend them to graphical games and , wherever gameplay and graphics went , you could bring that whole concept forward .
So I always wanted to do that -- to create a large - scale multiplayer game .
That 's another thing that I 've always wanted to do but have n't ever actually gotten to .
Unreal has multiplayer you can get 20 players into a server and you can get some interesting interaction , but it 's never been a large - scale MMO .
How well did Super ZZT sell compared to ZZT ?
TS : Super ZZT was never successful .
It was ... maybe a copy a day at its peak .
Hard to say why .
I guess that 's the danger of Super ZZT .
It went more in the direction of being a real game with realistic scrolling , graphics , and everything .
Did it have an editor with it ?
I do n't ever remember using the editor in that game .
TS : Yeah , it shipped with one , but there 's some stupid cheat code you had to use to get into the editor .
That was probably your problem , then .
TS : Yeah , there was a business mistake there .
Kroz did the same thing .
With Kroz , Apogee released game for free as shareware -- one episode of it , and you could buy the other episodes .
But the editor you had to pay money to get , so most people never got the editor or never saw it .
So you did n't have this sort of user community developing around the editor .
ZZT included the editor in the shareware version and everybody was able to do it whether or not they sent in money .
That was a huge factor in it being successful , I think .
Just looking at our current stuff , I have to wonder how much more successful -- how much larger the mod community for Unreal or more recent games might have been if we 'd given away the editor tools to everybody without any cost at all .
Without selling the game to them ?
Is that what you 're saying ?
TS : Yeah .
But it 's a different scale .
You can't really make the business comparison , because millions of people bought Unreal , whereas several thousand bought ZZT , so it might be that buyers of a game like Unreal are enough to fully support the community .
Did you ever consider doing a version of ZZT with bitmapped sprites ?
TS : When I created ZZT , it was 80x25 column , 16 color text mode , basically .
I then created Super ZZT , which was lower -- it was 40 - column mode , so characters were square , which was better for the movement speed and everything .
I was thinking at that point of creating a graphical game , sorta like Ultima - level graphics -- still tile based , but with iconic representations of everything .
There were two problems : one , I was such a terrible artist ; I did n't have any collaborators at the time .
The other thing is , a lot of the cool constraints that made ZZT interesting really do n't work when you 're unconstrained graphically .
With ZZT , every character is at a particular grid location in the world , and if you have fractional movement between grid locations , you have a whole different set of obstructions and rules for movement .
Animation becomes more complicated , and then you have to handle collisions between guys which are half - way between cells .
So I ended up concluding that it was n't worth creating a tile - based game with unconstrained movement .
At the same time , I started working on Jill of the Jungle , and there were these 2D platformer games .
That approach seemed to work better .
You still had a tile - based environment , but you had gravity , so the characters were always drawn towards the ground .
You had a really clear method of finding where a platform is that you can stand on and what kind of tiles you can go through -- it just seemed like the better approach for developing a 2D graphical game to introduce gravity and all the constraints that come with it .
Jill of the Jungle was developed similar to ZZT .
It started out as an editor -- I wish I had put more time in the editor along with the game ; it was kind of crappy and did n't have a scripting language .
Most of the deficiencies of that game came from just wanting to ship it really quickly to be able to compete in the serious shareware business , rather than spending a lot of time to develop a good framework for future re-use .
If I had taken a slightly different approach , I think I could have built Jill of the Jungle and the engine more modularly and had an engine that could have been re-used for four or five games .
That could have made a few million bucks at that point .
It would have been a distraction from Unreal , ultimately , but it certainly would have been a more profitable business approach than developing a whole bunch of external games with their own engines .
There 's a game called Xargon .
Did that use Jill of the Jungle 's engine ?
TS : Yeah , that 's the one game that used the Jill engine .
That was built by Allen Pilgrim , who started out as a ZZT level designer .
He 's a really smart guy , but he had absolutely zero programming experience until he started working with ZZT .
And he created a bunch of the winning levels in the Best of ZZT contest .
So I contacted him to make Xargon , and he learned to program from scratch in C++ on that project and shipped the game about a year later -- really impressive work .
But then we went to develop Jazz Jackrabbit where Arjan Brussee -- this brilliant Dutch programmer -- wrote this platform scrolling engine , and Cliff Bleszinski designed the game levels and designed the game itself .
Did Cliff design the Jazz Jackrabbit character ?
TS : Yeah , the whole game design and concept for the game was Cliff's .
It was loosely supposed to be an answer to Sonic the Hedgehog on PC .
Previous games to that had been Mario - style games : slow character movement and cutesy characters .
Jazz Jackrabbit was still a cute game , but it was more bad - ass -- much faster and more wild movement .
Did you create the Jill of the Jungle character yourself ?
Was that your idea ?
TS : Yeah .
I wanted to do a Nintendo - style game and all of the PC shareware games of the time had these heroic male characters , so I wanted to do something to distinguish the game from that .
It could have gone further than that .
We could have developed 3D games along that line , kind of what Eidos did with Lara Croft , but it never became a priority .
Did you ever think of making another Jill of the Jungle ?
TS : At one point , I had a grand scheme to create a second 2D side - scrolling engine -- basically everything that I had wanted to do in Jill of the Jungle but did n't have time for .
To create better smooth scrolling using some of the new VGA scrolling tricks that were available , to create parallax effects .
I was also thinking of doing some sort of real physics in the game .
Not the sort of physics you see in LittleBigPlanet , but something that would have been pretty beefy for the time , like suspension bridges that change shape as you move around , and real dangling vines .
But I never got around to that .
At that point , after I shipped Jill of the Jungle , I went into a few years of just being a producer for all these external projects .
It was a funny time .
I think that by not doing that , I made a really sub - optimal short - term business decision , but the funny thing is at that point we brought in a lot of the key folks that became Epic 's great developers .
And if I had n't done that , it would have been lone wolf -- I would have made a lot more money at that point , but we would n't have the company we have now .
Growing Epic : Programming to Managing and Back Again
In the pre-Unreal days of Epic , what was your main role in the company ?
Were you managing people mostly -- as a producer , like you said -- instead of programming ?
TS : On ZZT and Jill of the Jungle , I was almost exclusively programming .
And from 1993 to late ' 94 , I was kind of cheerleader / producer of all the external projects .
So at that point we had three to five external projects .
We had Cliffy working on Jazz Jackrabbit , James Schmalz working on Solar Winds , this fighting game called One Must Fall was in development , and there were a few other projects like Zone 66 and other work .
So there was a full - time job just to manage people , just to get new builds of the games from them and test them out , give feedback , and do all the marketing and everything .
How big was the company ?
For example , did you have an accountant , or were you handling all the finances yourself ?
TS : Well , at that point , we scaled it from one person to about eight , I think .
I hired several people to take phone orders .
We got a little office in Rockville , so that we would n't have people coming into my parents ' house every day .
My old friend Carolyn Smith that I grew up with did accounting and helped out with things like that .
And then Mark Rein came on in 1992 .
He stayed in Toronto , but he did sales , marketing , and deal - making -- he signed a lot of deals that brought us more money .
Now you 've got Mike Capps as the president .
How did you transition from running the company to having a dedicated management team ?
TS : We were pretty loosely managed through shipping Unreal , until -- gosh -- 2003 or so .
We were basically self - managed .
We had a small team : during that time frame , we never got more than 25 people , so I 'd be the manager of the technical folks and Cliffy was kind of the designer , producer , and manager of the creative and artistic folks .
It was very loose .
The thing is , with a company that small , you do n't really need a lot of management .
If you hire great people , and they 're all self - motivated , then you can get by without a lot of structure .
But as we grew -- I guess 2004 or so , we brought on Mike Capps and started developing two projects simultaneously .
That was a strategic thing : we realized that having one team was too small for a modern game company .
The problem is if you have a single team , then you have a huge team developing a project through to completion .
Then it ships , and now you want to figure out what your next game is .
Well , the ideal way to do that is just to have a small number of people -- like five or six people -- doing pre-production work .
Just experimenting with concepts , trying to figure out what the game should be -- doing that for a year or more before they figure out the game and before you scale out to a large team .
So the ideal team size goes from 30 people at peak to five to six people at the start of a project .
If you have a single large team , you 're pretty much screwed : when you go back into pre-production , suddenly you have 30 people on payroll ; it 's expensive and you are n't able to work productively .
For example , how do you start working on artwork and characters before you know what your game design is and what mechanics really work out ?
So we saw moving to two teams as the solution to that , that way you can always do projects overlapped so that one project 's in pre-production with a smaller team , and another project 's in full production .
As one project completes , the other is ramping up .
That 's a good idea .
Do you still have that model ?
TS : Mmm hmm .
It 's been more complex because , at Epic , we also have the engine team now -- it 's big enough that it 's managed separately , so that 's an 18 person team plus ...
Once you get up to 30 - 40 people , management becomes really important .
And when you 're 100 - plus , if you do n't have good management , your company is quickly destroyed just because there are so many different layers of communication .
With 20 people , everybody knows everybody else and then talks to the people they need to for whatever they 're working on .
With 100 people , now you have the engine team working with the game team , complicated sub - teams , all that ; you have upward communication ; and then you have external companies you need to keep informed .
It 's just impossible to schedule unless you have a serious structure in place with producers on projects taking responsibility for project management , leads in each area , and so on .
In the late 1990s , Epic 's headquarters moved a few times .
What 's the story behind that ?
TS : In 1997 , we had started Unreal .
We were well into the project , and we were n't making the progress we needed because everybody was all over the place -- it was a very complicated project .
So we got everybody together in Waterloo , Canada for a year to finish the game , since some of the guys already lived up there .
It was really nice for about six months , and then it froze over and did n't thaw again for another six months , so we got really annoyed at the cold there .
After that we decided to set up a permanent office and bring everybody together so we could be a more efficient developer .
We looked all over the country , decided on Raleigh , and moved here in 1998 .
It was funny to relocate here because absolutely nobody working with Epic at the time had been born here .
It was just a random place that we chose after looking at the cost of living here , on the west coast , and all over the country .
Do you like it now that you 've been here for a while ?
TS : Yeah .
I 'm really happy with the area .
It 's a good cost of living .
We can hire people from all over the world , they can come here , and with a good game developer 's salary , you can buy a nice house .
Whereas in California , you 'd be stuck with a one bedroom apartment .
Raleigh is a really nice place .
There 's a lot of hiking , good weather , there 's the mountains , there 's the beach .
Lots of good things .
Inside the Shareware Business
Let 's go back to the shareware days .
When did you first learn about the shareware model ?
How did you learn about it -- was it from Apogee ?
TS : Shareware had been around from the beginning .
As soon as I got on BBSes , there were obvious shareware programs , but it seemed like a stupid business model , because you give out a program with all of its features and then ask people to pay you for it ?
It seems backwards , right ?
It was Apogee that made it look like a really attractive , viable business .
They released one episode of a game -- you could play through it in a few hours , and then if you wanted more , you 'd buy it .
And if the games were high enough quality , that was really powerful .
Their games were good enough that I actually bought them , and I had n't done that with any previous shareware .
So it was really the model that Scott Miller defined that made the whole market appear interesting .
Before that , the whole business was so daunting , and that 's why I never released anything prior to ZZT .
See , you put a huge amount of effort into developing a program .
If you have to release it , then that 's basically doubling the effort , because of all the polish and documentation that 's needed .
And unless you 're going to make serious money from that , then it 's not worth it .
Shareware for most companies was n't possible at all at that point , and getting into retail was so daunting : then you have to negotiate a publishing deal with a huge company and it's hard to even find the contacts .
It just seemed so daunting that I did n't even bother with it .
So you went the shareware route because it was easy to distribute your own games through BBSes .
TS : Yeah , and it was a business model that obviously worked , provided you came up with episodes .
How was your relationship with Apogee back then ?
Did you ever talk to Scott Miller ?
Was it a fierce competition between the two of you ?
TS : It was always professional .
I started out talking with Scott Miller before I even released ZZT , just trying to gather some intel on the whole business .
And then after releasing it , Scott Miller was trying to recruit me to publish Jill of the Jungle through Apogee , but I decided to go it on my own .
We 'd compete for shareware developers .
Somebody would create a game of their own and they 'd submit it to Apogee and Epic and we'd both consider them , and we sometimes ended up competing for deals .
It was always professional .
There was n't any animosity .
Epic MegaGames ' Jill of the Jungle
Did you ever talk to him after you got started with the business ?
Did you ever have to call him and say , " Hey , there 's something we need to talk about . "
TS : We talked .
There were two ways : there were the CompuServe forums -- basically that was where all of the people in the shareware industry chatted with each other .
Scott Miller was very active there , so I 'd come into contact with him a huge amount through that .
We 'd send emails back and forth through it and engage in common discussions with other people .
And then there was this annual shareware event , the Association of Shareware Professionals -- this weird industry group -- that would have an event every year .
So I got to meet everybody .
I met Scott and George [ Broussard ] pretty early on -- I guess that was ' 91 or ' 92 -- and much of their authors , and we brought a bunch of our people out to that event , so we had a pretty in - depth relationship with them at that point .
If somebody came to you with a great game you were going to publish or distribute , what would you pay them ?
A lump sum or part of what they sold ?
TS : It was all royalty - based .
We 'd negotiate deals where the developer would come to Epic with their game , and we'd offer to take care of all the marketing , distribution , sales , and all that stuff , and in exchange , pay them royalties .
It was 40 % or 50 % of each sale .
So when a $ 30 game sold , the shareware developer got $ 15 , then $ 5 - 6 went to postage and their labor costs on top of that .
So it was profitable enough that we were able to grow .
That 's a pretty good deal for the developers -- a large percentage .
TS : The royalties we paid out were better than all but the top several game developers can get from publishers nowadays , for example .
And our business was a lot more cost - intensive back then because it was small scale .
The overhead was more significant .
How did it work when you and Apogee were competing over a developer ?
Did you bid on them ?
TS : We never really got into a bidding war about anybody .
Scott Miller tended to get the people he wanted , so most of the people that came to Epic were the result of direct recruiting efforts by me or Mark [ Rein ] .
We 'd go onto the CompuServe forums and Usenet and send messages trying to get people to submit their games for publication .
Then when somebody released something just as freeware or for fun , we'd try to contact them , follow them up , and bring them on board .
Around that point -- I guess it was around 1992 when Cliff had released this little adventure game on his own as shareware .
He had n't done much from it , so he submitted his next game , Dare to Dream , to Epic .
Mark was visiting me for the first time in Maryland .
The day I met Mark Rein , we got this letter from Cliff at my house , and Mark called him up and went ... doing the standard Mark Rein thing : " You should publish this through Epic -- you 'll be a millionaire ! " [ laughs ]
You know , kind of over - selling the whole thing , and Cliff got really interested about that , so we published that game for Cliff .
It was n't a big success , but then we hooked Cliff up with this awesome Dutch programmer , Arjan Brussee , who wrote the engine that powered Jazz Jackrabbit .
And that was Epic 's biggest selling game at the time : Jazz Jackrabbit .
Did they work together over the phone , over computer networks ?
If the guy was Dutch , was he in the Netherlands ...
TS : Yeah , it was phone calls and modems .
Cliff was in California at the time .
That was crazy : everybody had these massive phone bills .
They 'd send the phone bills to me and say , " Give me some money for this . "
Actually , my personal number was an 800 - number , so the authors could call me without incurring phone charges .
' Cause , you know , a lot of them were just -- Cliffy was just in high school at the time , I think ; he was about 15 when he created his first game and released it .
And that was pretty typical at the time .
Nobody had a real career or anything .
Jazz Jackrabbit was your highest selling shareware game at the time ?
What was your highest selling shareware game overall ?
TS : Of all time ?
That was Epic Pinball .
That was a crazy project .
These developers in Finland , Future Crew -- we 'd been trying to recruit them for a long time as shareware developers .
They did a bunch of early 3D demos -- it was incredibly brilliant , impressive stuff .
I thought they were the smartest guys in the world at that time .
So Mark Rein went out to Finland to try to recruit them , but they were n't interested .
I guess they had other projects going on at the time .
But what he did bring back was this pinball game that they 'd been developing .
It was n't finished , but it was a vertically - scrolling pinball game with realistic physics .
We were begging and pleading with them to finish the game so we could release it and put it out as shareware , but they just did n't have the resources to take that on .
So we showed the game to James Schmalz , who 'd done Solar Winds .
He was this guy up in Canada -- that 's why we moved to Canada for a year with Unreal .
This brilliant guy -- he programmed 100 % assembly language and does all art for his projects , so ... brilliant artist , programmer , jack - of - all - trades , which is really uncommon in the industry at that level of competitiveness .
James saw the pinball demo and said , " Oh , yeah , I can build a game like that . "
So from scratch , he built a vertically - scrolling pinball game , designed six pinball tables for it and all that -- he did that while he was in college .
I think he spent nine months on it in total .
Mark Rein and I were basically being cheerleaders , telling him what needed work , what need improvement , and giving him references to other pinball games , pinball rules , and things like that .
So he finished the game , and over the next year , he made more than a million dollars from the shareware royalties .
Epic MegaGames ' Jazz Jackrabbit
That 's great .
Does James Schmalz work at Epic now ?
What 's he doing ?
TS : No . After Epic Pinball , James Schmalz was the first developer on Unreal , and ended up being the co-developer on the project .
Halfway through , he started Digital Extremes .
The first two Unreal games were collaborations between Epic and DE , so he had about five employees at max , and we had 10 or 15 .
We just worked together as an integrated team , building the game .
After we released Unreal Tournament , they went off and developed games on their own while we went off with our own projects .
Did you ever have any contact with the id Software guys back then ?
John Carmack , John Romero -- they were developing Commander Keen , and ...
TS : Not during the development of Commander Keen , but after they came out with Wolfenstein 3D , we met them all on this shareware event .
It was in Indiana of all places .
So it was Mark , me , and a few others -- and who from id was there ?
Romero was there , Jay Wilbur was there .
They were the superstars of the show , and Epic was an up - and - coming game developer .
John Romero was a really outgoing guy .
He was always really friendly and kept up with everything that was happening in the industry .
He knew who we were , he had played Jill of the Jungle , and he was like , " Oh yeah , cool game , man ! "
He invited us out to dinner one night , so we had dinner with the id Software guys .
I do n't think Carmack was there , but it was a really interesting conversation .
Basically Mark and I were in total awe at what the guys had done , and we just talked about what happened in the industry and what we were doing .
They were really aggressive in their business : " Yeah , we 're going to get out of this Apogee thing and go off on our own " -- which they did with Doom .
Very successfully .
Did you think about doing a first - person shooter after their success with Wolfenstein 3D and Doom ?
TS : It was funny how we got to that point .
When I saw Wolfenstein for the first time , that was truly shocking .
I 'd never envisioned that you could do 3D in a computer game ; I do n't know why .
The research had indicated that you could do that for at least 15 years before that , but it was this 3D game with real - time texture mapping ; you know , real - time bitmaps scaled up and displayed in 3D on the screen .
It never occurred to me that you could actually write code to do that .
It was just another lack of foresight there .
But seeing that for the first time , I was like , " Wow , I 'm totally not worthy .
I need to get out of programming now , because I 'm never going to be able to compete with this . "
So they just basically demoralized me into becoming a manager for a few years .
Around 1994 , James Schmalz had written this 3D texture - mapping code , and I was starting to think , " Hmm , maybe that 's not so hard . "
So I started reading up on references there and experimenting with it , and it turns out that , yeah , it 's just another piece of code that you can learn how to create .
Did you ever think about doing a Doom - style first - person shooter with Epic instead of a full - 3D game like Unreal ?
TS : It took about two years to come around to the realization that we could be a competitive game company in that business .
At first , the technical problems seemed so hard that it felt like I was out of my league at that point and that all of the Epic folks were out of our league .
What id had done -- let 's put it that Wolfenstein and Doom were so far ahead of everybody else 's wildest dreams , that it just seemed crazy to try to compete .
But it was around 1994 when I started to see that , yeah , they 're actually beatable .
There were a bunch of shortcomings in the game , and there were a lot of things you could do in addition to go way beyond what they were doing -- there were different stories you could do .
It was really around 1994 that we felt we could actually try to compete in that area .
Even at that point , it was daunting .
We typically developed games with between one and three people -- usually a programmer , an artist , and maybe a musician .
But those games took much larger teams -- up to ten or twenty people .
It was really scary scaling up to the size of the project on Unreal where we went to about 20 people by the time the project shipped .
We had no experience managing projects like that , and developing that game -- the cost of it just required that Epic and Digital Extremes -- we had to spend all of the profits we 'd made on all of our previous games up to that point on that one single game .
We were betting everything on that -- including our credit card balances .
Mark Rein got his American Express card taken away from funding Epic at that point .
We bet everything on it , and it was a success .
It 's great that it worked out that way .
TS : It 's fortunate .
If the game had been delayed by another six months , Epic probably would n't be here now .
I have one last question about the shareware days .
When I was downloading Epic 's games from BBSes back in the day , Epic 's games stood out because they had VGA graphics and Sound Blaster support .
That 's why they were my favorites .
Was that a conscious effort on your part to always have games at a superior level of technical quality from that point on ?
TS : Every project after ZZT -- with ZZT , I was n't even trying to compete .
With Jill of the Jungle , I do n't know -- I was always looking at what other games had and how we could beat that .
Commander Keen was an EGA game with PC speaker sound effects and AdLib music .
So we went one step further and had digitized sound effects and VGA graphics .
But with everything since then , we 've always put a conscious effort into thinking , " How can we beat everybody technically ? "
Because if you beat them technically , it gives you an opportunity to shine in all other areas .
VGA graphics is n't just a technical feature -- it means you can have much better artwork than everybody else .
Even if your artists are only as good as the competition 's , they have more colors to work with , so they can do better work .
And that 's been a big driving force with Unreal .
Even nowadays , to try to stay as far ahead of the competition as possible in technical features .
Present & Future
Does it scare you when you see Crysis ... or , I do n't know .
What 's the biggest competitor in the game engine market ?
Is it id 's stuff , or is it another company ?
TS : Today , it 's Crysis .
Because Crysis is doing some things on high - end PCs that we 're not doing ourselves .
That 's a tricky case though , because we could do vastly more than we 're currently doing if we focused on supporting dual high - end video cards , which have about 10 times the graphics horsepower of a console today .
The thing is , that market is about 2 % the size of the overall next - generation game market -- PS3 , Xbox 360 , and mainstream PC .
So there 's a real hard business decision : if you go the route that Crytek goes , you can beat us in certain areas in graphics , but you 're really sacrificing the larger market .
Because you can't run that engine on the PS3 and that sort of thing .
TS : Yeah .
And some of the things they 're doing are just conceptually incompatible with that level of performance .
Wherever you have an order of magnitude performance difference , you can't really scale .
We can scale down in performance by a factor of three by going to a low resolution , dropping some textures , and things like that .
But to scale by a factor of 10 -- you can't design a game with 10 times the detail and then scale it back to something that looks decent on the consoles .
You 'd end up looking much worse than a console game that was just designed for the console specs .
So they have real scalability difficulties there .
On another note , LittleBigPlanet reminds me of ZZT , because you can build your own levels , and people do emergent techniques with a simple set of tools .
Have you played LittleBigPlanet ?
Do you like it ?
TS : Yeah , it 's brilliant .
If I were creating a game with a really small team so that things like Unreal were ruled out , it 's exactly the kind of game I 'd want to create -- a side - scroller with really cool graphics using 3D and really cool physics -- and design it around the user community building stuff .
It 's a really brilliant project .
I think it 's indicative of the direction in which that kind of game could go -- a sandbox game like The Sims or anything else .
You can really go a long way with the simulation without creating complicated tools .
It 's not like there 's some crazy Python scripting language in there ; it 's all done with really simple graphical stuff .
It 's a great idea .
Looking ahead , how long do you think it will be before real - time computer graphics are 100 % realistic like a movie ?
TS : There are two parts to the graphical problem .
Number one , there are all those problems that are just a matter of brute force computing power : so completely realistic lighting with real - time radiosity , perfectly anti-aliased graphics , and movie - quality static scenes and motion .
We 're only about a factor of a thousand off from achieving all that in real - time without sacrifices .
So we 'll certainly see that happen in our lifetimes ; it 's just a result of Moore 's Law .
Probably 10 - 15 years for that stuff , which is n't far at all .
Which is scary -- we 'll be able to saturate our visual systems with realistic graphics at that point .
But there 's another problem in graphics that 's not as easily solvable .
It 's anything that requires simulating human intelligence or behavior : animation , character movement , interaction with characters , and conversations with characters .
They 're really cheesy in games now .
A state - of - the - art game like the latest Half - Life expansion from Valve , Gears of War , or Bungie 's stuff is extraordinarily unrealistic compared to a human actor in a human movie , just because of the really fine nuances of human behavior .
We simulate character facial animation using tens of bones and facial controls , but in the body , you have thousands .
It turns out we 've evolved to recognize those things with extraordinary detail , so we 're far short of being able to simulate that .
And unfortunately , all of that 's not just a matter of computational power , because if we had infinitely fast computers now , we still would n't be able to solve that , because we just do n't have the algorithms ; we do n't know how the brain works or how to simulate it .
So you 'd have to create a perfectly realistic virtual human first to have perfectly realistic graphics .
TS : Yeah , you 'd have to simulate the brain and nervous system in the computer .
And circulation and everything .
But that 's probably going to be possible some day , do n't you think ?
TS : Some day , yeah .
But there 's no Moore 's Law for that stuff , and progress is very non-linear .
Somebody must have a clear understanding of how a neuron works now and how it transmits to adjacent neurons , but they have no idea how a billion neurons combine together to create a brain and what parts of our brain are basically hard - coded by evolution , and which parts are based on learning , and so on .
And if you could simulate it all , how could you train it to be realistic like a human ?
Those problems are probably decades away from being solved .
Those are things that may not occur in our lifetimes .
Just like perfect computer speech recognition : if you look at speech recognition , it 's only gotten slightly better in the past decade , just by a factor of several hundred increases in computing power .
That shows that those problems are not falling to brute force .
They 're not following Moore 's Law acceleration .
Have you ever read any Ray Kurzweil 's futurism stuff ?
TS : Some of it .
Definitely anything like that is long - term future .
It 's just because we lack the algorithm and knowledge of how to model that , even given unlimited computing power .
Do you think that if the graphics were perfectly realistic that you would create a " final " version of the Unreal Engine ?
As in , you 'd never have to make another one because you got it perfect ?
TS : I do n't think we 'd ever be done .
If you look at special effects or anything like that , even if you have perfect rendering , you might have the inner loop of the renderer which processes sub - pixel triangle primitives and generates perfectly anti-aliased graphics -- that might be completely done , but still , the tools and the functionality that lets the artist create the environment is infinitely improvable .
Currently , our approaches are somewhat primitive if you look at it .
If you want to build a city for a massively multiplayer game , the artists model a single column or wall , then they copy and paste it throughout the world .
You 'd run really large - scale procedural tools for defining road systems and defining buildings , and the structure and architecture of buildings .
You could really do a lot more to improve productivity than any current engine or modeling tool is doing .
So I see decades and decades of work there , just to make ever - better tools .
And special effects as well .
Particle systems are only partly limited by computing power .
The other limitation is the tools that the artists have to control what 's really going to happen , and to do that productively .
If you can make tools more productive so an artist can do more in an hour , then that 's an improvement too .

Leo Tolstoy & The Kingdom of God is Within You
The great Russian author Leo Tolstoy is a monumental figure in the world of literature .
His epic novel War and Peace is unrivaled in its breadth and scope .
But Tolstoy was more than just a fiction writer .
He was a keen observer of the human condition and arguably the most progressive Christian in Russia during the 19th and early 20th century .
His later writings on the Christian faith influenced spiritual progressives in the both the West and the East , including famous figures such as Martin Luther King and Gandhi .
Leo Tolstoy ’s most influential work on Progressive Christian faith is The Kingdom of God is Within You .
The following passage is a one of the book ’s most eloquent statements on modern Christian life , as equally true today as when Tolstoy wrote it :
Everyone today who has assimilated Christian principles involuntarily into their conscience , finds themselves in precisely the position of someone who is asleep , and who dreams that they are obliged to do something which even in their dreams they know they should n’t do .
They know this in the depths of their conscience , and all the same they seem unable to change their position ; they cannot stop and cease doing what they ought not do .
And just as in a dream , their position becoming more and more painful , it at last reaches a pitch of such intensity that they sometimes begin to doubt the reality of what is passing and make a moral effort to shake off the nightmare that is oppressing them .
This is the condition of the average person in our Christian society .
They feel that everything they do themselves and that is done around them is something absurd , hideous , impossible , and opposed to their conscience ; they feel that their position is becoming more and more unendurable and reaching a crisis of intensity .
It is not possible that we modern people , with a Christian sense of human dignity and equality permeating us soul and body , with our need for peaceful association and unity between nations , should really go on living in such a way that every joy , every gratification we have is bought by the sufferings , by the lives of our neighbors , and moreover , that we should be every instant within a hair ’s - breadth of falling on one another , nation against nation , like wild beasts , mercilessly destroying other people ’s lives and labor , only because some benighted politician or ruler says or writes some stupidity to another equally benighted politician or ruler .
It is impossible .
Yet everyone of our day sees that this is so and awaits the calamity .
And the situation becomes more and more insupportable .
And as the person who is dreaming does not believe that what appears to them can be truly the reality and tries to wake up to the actual real world again , so the average person today cannot in the bottom of their heart believe that the awful position in which they are placed and which is growing worse and worse can be the reality , and tries to wake up to a true , real life , as it exists in their conscience .
Just as the dreamer needs only to make a moral effort and ask themselves , “ Is n’t it a dream ? ” and the situation which seemed to them so hopeless will instantly disappear , revealing a peaceful and happy reality , so the men and women of the modern world need only make a moral effort to doubt the reality presented to them by their own hypocrisy and the general hypocrisy around them , and to ask themselves , “ Is n’t it all a delusion ? ” and they will at once , like the dreamer awakened , feel themselves transported from an imaginary and dreadful world to the true , calm , and happy reality .
To do this , we need not need accomplish great feats or exploits .
We need only make a moral effort .

Researchers say children who abuse have often been abused themselves
' It was just normal to me '
Police in Scotland have brought almost 500 rape charges against children and teenagers under the age of 18 in the past five years .
Nineteen of these charges were brought against eight , nine or 10 - year olds .
During the same period , three out of four specialist residential units treating sexually aggressive young people have closed .
The figures were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act as part of a BBC Scotland investigation .
A total of 755 charges were brought against under 18s for indecency or sexual offences last year .
Another case , not included in that total , involved a four - year - old in the Grampian area reported for indecent assault .
Scotland 's eight police forces said that in the past five years , 490 rape charges had been brought .
The figure excludes cases of consensual underage sex .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Directly comparable figures for the rest of the UK were not available , although a Youth Justice Board report paints a similar picture in England and Wales .
In 2007 / 8 police or courts dealt with 2,088 sexual offences by under 18s , including 244 cases involving pre-teenage children .
In Scotland the law of criminal responsibility is currently eight , compared with 10 under English law .
The BBC investigation - The Dark Side of Teenage Sex - looked at the case of teenager Colyn Evans , who murdered 16 - year - old Karen Dewar in Tayport , Fife , in 2005 .
Evans was accused of six sexually - related offences between the ages of 10 and 16 but he was never registered as a sex offender .
Karen Dewar 's father , Frank , tells the programme the system failed both his daughter and her killer .
" Evans was never given any treatment .
he was just gave up on and I suppose there are hundreds of them out there like that , " he said .
If they do n't get help because services have been closed , the behaviours are likely to escalate and worsen
Dr Eileen Vizard
Child psychiatrist BBC Scotland also used Freedom of Information legislation to ask Scotland 's councils what treatment was being provided to sexually aggressive young people .
Most were unable to provide details on how much they spent , but it was clear only a fraction of young offenders were receiving help .
One young man , who was convicted of two counts of attempted rape carried out when he was 11 and 14 , told the programme he had been sent to a specialist school which claimed it offered treatment .
He said : " No help was offered , no help was given .
It was just another place for me to stay . "
A recent Home Office - funded study found seven out of 10 children who carry out serious abuse had been abused themselves .
Consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr Eileen Vizard , who works with the NSPCC , said early intervention was essential .
Colyn Evans had a history of sexual abuse before committing murder " There 's a great deal of evidence to show that the children who are at the highest risk start earlier in childhood - really early - ie under six or seven with worrying behaviours - that if they do n't get help because services have been closed , the behaviours are likely to escalate and worsen , " she said Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill agreed that early intervention was vital , but he said specialist treatment was available in Scotland " We have to deal with this in a variety of ways and it's not just residential secure units , " he told BBC Radio Scotland 's Good Morning Scotland programme .
" We are seeking to work out and analyse what the nature of the problem is and how best to treat it .
That 's why we are working with specialist academics to make sure we can get to the root cause of the problem . "
Mr MacAskill also said he would like to see a change in the law to allow the DNA of young sex offenders to be retained , because of evidence they often go on to commit further crimes .
The Dark Side of Teenage Sex will be shown on BBC One Scotland at 2235 BST on Tuesday .

While everybody else in Los Angeles is basking in the afterglow of a 15th NBA title , Mitch Kupchak is in bed by 10 pm in order to get to the office by 9am .
Its business as usual for the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers .
Luckily , through a source that will remain unnamed , I was able to sneak a peek at his daily diary .
9:07 am – First call of the day is to David Lee ( Trevor Ariza ’s agent ) .
Trevor is due a raise and I ’m not about to be the guy linked with Jerry Krause as the greatest dynasty destroyer ever .
9:19 am – Just got off the horn with Lee .
This is going to be more difficult than I thought .
I forgot that Lee reps Bynum too .
Its really hard to sell a guy on the fact that one of his clients was worth $ 57 million after proving nothing and the other is only worth $ 20 - 30 million after being a major factor in a title run .
Oh boy …
9:34 am – Next call is to Jeff Schwartz ( Lamar Odom ’s agent ) .
This call is going to be even more brutal than the last .
How do you convince a guy to take a 50 % pay cut ?
9:35 am – Is it a bad sign that Schwartz laughed right before I heard the dial tone ?
9:55 am – Just spent the last 20 minutes banging my head on the desk for giving Sasha that contract last year .
9:56 am – Note to self : stop giving phat deals to Eastern Europeans .
Why did n’t I learn from the Radmanovic debacle ?
Thank God Jerry
West left me that post - it note that said , “ No matter what , DON ’T EXTEND SLAVA MEDVEDENKO !!!!! ”
10:17 am – Gotta get Dr. Buss on the line .
I need to know if he ’s going to foot the luxury tax for getting L.O. and Trevor to stay in purple and gold .
10:25 am – I forgot that Dr. Buss was on his way to Italy .
Damn !
Now I ’ve gotta get in even earlier to talk to him .
10:38 am – Time to talk to Phil Jackson for his exit interview , I hope Jeanie is n’t still giving him grief for not removing his “ X ” hat since last Sunday .
10:49 am – Not sure if Phil is coming back or not next year , but that “ X ” hat is starting to stink like Zaza Pachulia ’s sweaty back hair .
11:19 am – Great , Shannon Brown is next …
11:25 am – I could n’t even look Shanwow in the eyes .
It got a little awkward when he asked me how many shots Sasha made in the finals .
I looked around the room for a second , thankfully my phone rang .
Unfortunately it was Schwartz laughing even harder than before .
I just hung up and thanked Shannon for helping me get Radmanovic out of town .
11:38 am – Adam Morrison , Sun Yue and DJ Mbenga all came in together .
Really not much else to say to those guys except , “ Thanks for not hurting Kobe in practice this year . ”
11:53 am – Just spent the last 15 minutes hitting my left hand with a mallet for that contract I gave to Sasha last summer .
Oh great , Sasha is the next interview .
12:09 pm – By far the worst moment of my day .
I did n’t say much , Sasha kept thanking me for helping to pay for his mother ’s laser hair removal .
As he walked out I quoted my favorite line from The Hangover to him , “ Quid pro quo , douche bag ” .
Do n’t think he got it , but it made me feel much better .
12:13 pm – Ca n’t stop laughing thinking about The Hangover .
By far , the funniest movie I ’ve seen since The Happening .
It really is too bad that more people just do n’t get Shyamalan ’s humor .
He truly is a comedic genius .
Lady in the Water raised the bar .
I never thought anybody could out do Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever .
12:33 pm – Lunch time !
I ’m off to Del Taco .
Best chili - cheese fries known to mankind !
How ironic that a taco joint makes one of the best burgers too ?
1:48 pm – Glad that there are no more interviews today .
Tomorrow will be much better .
2:12 pm – Schwartz called again .
He finally stopped laughing then asked me a weird series of questions .
He said , “ Would you pay $ 200,000 for a Ferrari California ? ” I said , “ Yes , of course ” .
He then asked , “ Would you pay $ 200,000 for a Hennessy Viper ? ” I replied , “ Hell no !
Its still a Dodge ” Then he drops , “ But you paid $ 9 million for Kwame Brown , so either you know dick about cars or have no idea of the worth of a dollar ! ”
Then he hung up .
What was that about ?
2:36 pm – I finally got what Schwartz meant , took me a minute becasue the analogy was a little vague .
I really need Dr. Buss to cut his youngest son ’s Vegas budget so we can get Lamar and Trevor back .
Is it really too much to ask the kid not to go to Rain or the Rum Jungle every other week ?
Why ca n’t he just use his dad ’s money right here in L.A. ?
Two less trips on the family G5 and one less round of lap dances at Olympic Garden would equal three more titles .
And people think this job is all about scouting and trades .
If only they knew …
2:48 pm – Gotta get ready for the draft next week .
I ’ll keep it local and will just go with Taj Gibson in round one .
He ’s got some of that Rony Turiaf spirit our fans love and he ’s another Pac - 10 guy from an L.A. school , keeps everybody happy .
As for our first pick in round two , well I ’m loving this 7 foot Ukrainian kid , Vyacheslav Kravstov .
What can I say , I love the Eastern Euros .
Mark my words , had Sabonis come over earlier and Petrovic had a full career , the rest of the NBA would be in the same boat as I am .
Do n’t let Darko and Tskitishvili be the two apples that ruin the bunch !
3:15 pm – Cutting the day short , I ’ve got a flight to catch .
We ’re having a farewell dinner for Kevin McHale .
3:18 pm – Note to self :
Make sure to roast McHale for wasting Kevin Garnett ’s prime on the Joe Smith contract debacle .
Then turn the tables by reminding the room that we both were duped by Eastern European guards , him with Marco Jaric and me with Sasah Vujacic .
Then just point to Rod Thorn and say , “ But at least we did n’t think Zoran Planinic was the next Jason Kidd ! ”
Dad kitteh , put just a drop of scotch on da kibble now has quiet afternoon to nap

( Parenting.com ) --
One Mother 's Day , I bought my wife what she had wanted for years -- a weeping cherry tree -- and I threw in a bird bath , so that when the tree matures , our feathered friends can happily splash and drink under its loving protection .
Oh boy !
Another tie or pair of funny boxer shorts for Dad !
For Father 's Day , my wife gave me some boxer shorts and a tiny reading light , so I can flip through a book in bed without disturbing her .
My wife is the first to admit it :
For her , and for many people , Father 's Day is an afterthought , a holiday just a few steps above the one that celebrates the groundhog and that other one that promotes trees .
If Mom 's Day and Dad's Day were in a prize fight , we all know which holiday would wind up lying in the corner of the ring , knocked - out teeth on the mat , dazed head stuck in a bucket .
I 've been thinking about how our society recognizes parents because Father 's Day is upon us again , but also because , a while ago , my worst nightmare happened :
My wife had to have surgery .
I was an emotional wreck .
For a while , it was truly touch and go .
Life hung in the balance , and everything near and dear to me seemed in doubt .
Why ?
Because while Susan recovered from her toe surgery , I had to take care of the kids .

His way better ?
Sure , for a couple workdays I was able to call in reinforcements ( my mom and mother - in - law ) , but an entire weekend lay ahead in which I was to be the prime caregiver to Lorelei , who was just hitting 6 months , and Isabelle , our 3 - year - old .
Meanwhile , my wife was upstairs in our bed , on painkillers and armed with her cell phone so that I was always just a speed dial away from doing her bidding .
This would be a weekend in which I could n't do only the fun stuff -- like playing blocks and watching cartoons -- with the girls .
I was obviously going to have to feed both of them ( three times a day ! ) , and I would have to tackle Herculean tasks like giving baths , changing all of the diapers , putting them both to bed , and even giving medicine to Lorelei , who had an ear infection .
Over the decades , standards for fathers have risen .
If this were 1897 or even 1974 , I could have coasted through the weekend , serving potato chips and cold cereal to Isabelle , and I would have brought the girls to my wife 's bed for her to do the changing of the diapers .
I could have skipped the baths .
I could have ignored the dishes in the sink and the cat litter without a barrage of criticism .
As long as I managed to avoid the house catching on fire , and the girls did n't come down with malaria , at the end of the weekend , my family and friends would have laughed heartily at my mishaps , like they used to do in the last couple seconds of those 1970s and 1980s one - hour dramas ( you know , after somebody made a joke and the shot went into freeze frame ) .
Then my family and friends would have declared that I had done my best , and nobody would have cared that the bar had been set so low that a chipmunk could have done as well .

His way can be better than yours
But today 's dads are different .
We not only love our children , we 're acutely aware that we have a responsibility to be the best parents we can be .
When it counts , I think most fathers really give it their all -- which explains why the Saturday night of my Mr. Mom weekend , instead of ordering pizza , I served Isabelle a chicken casserole with pineapple as a side dish .
Do n't applaud -- the fruit came from a can , and the rest from a box with four steps .

Still , I have to admit , I felt proud as the weekend wore on .
I grew more confident in my parenting skills and even gave both girls a bath -- at the same time -- not once , but two nights in a row !
Just as I was ready to nominate myself for a Nobel Peace Prize , an Oscar , a Grammy -- surely I deserved some award -- I had an epiphany that brought me back down a few pegs .
Parenting.com : Mommy skills that 'll work on husbands
I was fixing a French dish I like to call poisson et pommes frites ( um , fish sticks and fries ) , when I caught Anderson Cooper on CNN .
He was in Baghdad , surrounded by American soldiers , saying he was exhausted and scared .
Yet he warned the audience not to be too impressed with him .
In a few days , he would fly home .
The soldiers would remain at their posts .
Now , I 'm not comparing our girls to Iraqi insurgents , but I do appreciate more than ever that mothers are usually the soldiers in the parenting battlefield .
Even full - time working moms do more child - rearing than us dads , studies have repeatedly found .
Fathers tend to play the part of the dashing news reporter , swooping into parenting duties just long enough to get our hands dirty .
My wife deserves her weeping cherry tree .
And like most moms , she is worthy of much more .
Yet I think we dads merit at least a little more than boxer shorts , soap - on - a- rope , and neckties .
We do n't get the good stuff because we 're paying for the sins of our fathers , and our fathers ' fathers .
But these days , dads are changing diapers , warming bottles , and taking our kids to the park .
We may not be where you want us yet , but we 've evolved , and we 're involved .
Just as much as the moms , we appreciate the cards , the praise , and being treated special on our day .
So if any of you mothers now feel guilty enough to spring for a slightly nicer Father 's Day gift -- say , a plasma TV with a 50 - inch screen -- make sure it also has built - in speakers with surround - sound .

Recently , 37signals blogged touting their security in dramatic marketing terms .
It 's a pity that the reality does n't match the claims .
Two of the major claims on the security page areand .
And the related details talk about the firewalling and physical security of their data center .
All that 's great .
But there 's a dirty little secret .
37 signals stores passwords in plain text in their database ( or , as commentators have pointed out , they could be storing the password encrypted using a key available to their application server ; either way the password can be recovered by a hacker who gains access to their server ) .
I found this out today when cancelling my Highrise account .
I 'd forgotten the password and so I went through password recovery .
It instantly emailed me my password .
I 'd expected to receive a temporary password and be asked to change it .
But 37 signals stored my password in their database and was happy to email it out .
For me this is n't a disaster because I generate unique passwords for each registration , but for lots of people this is a big problem .
Plenty of people use the same password on many different sites .
That means if one site is compromised hackers can get access to all those user 's other accounts .
And a compromise can come in various forms .
It could be actually hacking into 37signals , or it could be getting access to an old backup of their database .
But there 's a solution to this , it 's easy to implement , it completely eliminates the problem even if their site is hacked , and it 's a security best practice .
There are plenty of good descriptions of how to implement it .
The Unix operating system has been doing this since the 1970s , so why is 37 signals not doing it ?
Hard to tell .
In a posting in 2007 , Jason Fried said that they planned to change this , but now it 's 2009 .
There 's no excuse for this sort of lax security , if 37 signals got hacked they'd have to bow their heads in shame in front of every single one of their customers and admit that their password had been stolen .
Why take the risk ?

Your city 's team has won a major sports championship .
It 's a great achievement , and a reason to celebrate .
You love your team , you love your city , you love a good time .
But how do you celebrate ?
Dance , hug , shout , throw confetti , have some drinks , high five your friends , eat cake , relive the highlights of the game , throw a party at your home ?
Sure , right ?
You want to express your pride , your joy , your happiness on behalf of the team .
But set garbage cans , barricades , trash , and trees on fire ?
Tag private property ?
Break the glass of people 's vehicles and business ?
Steal things ?
Push and shove each other ?
Try to turn over cars ?
Destroy a public transit bus ?
Climb onto the freeway ?
Smash street signs and crosswalk signals with metal bars ?
All on City property that an already strapped - for - cash City will have to pay for ?
Not to mention the cost of the fire and police personnel and resources used to control the ' celebrations ' or the cost to local business owners whose property was destroyed , vandalized , or just taken .
Last night 's media coverage referred to the events on the streets of Downtown Los Angeles as ' celebration . '
Is this how we define ' celebration ' ?

i am 17 years old and looking to buy my first car !
if you have a good , cheap and reliable car for a student please let me know .
thank you !
From Mike Anderson to ***********@*******.org
Hey there !
I saw your ad and have a great car for a young driver such as yourself .
I am selling my beautiful 1992 Toyota Camry .
This car is almost perfect .
148,342 miles on it .
I need to go to Wawa tomorrow , so that mileage might change .
I 'm estimating it will be somewhere around 148,347 miles .
If this is a problem , let me know and I will ride my bike to Wawa .
The car has a few MINOR problems but nothing too bad :
- The ashtray is stuck shut from when I accidentally spilled a beer on it .
I think there is like $ 2 in change in there , so if you can open the ashtray , it 's all yours .
- Due to a bad trip in Philly , I no longer have a radio .
I run an old boom box through the cigarette lighter , however , and it sounds great .
It is a 1986 Sony Cassette player .
I 'll throw in a Raffi cassette tape for an extra $ 10 .
The tape is Raffi in Concert with the Rise & Shine Band , and is an excellent album .
- The glovebox is locked and I lost the key to it , so it wo n't open .
Unfortunately there was a tuna sandwich locked in there , and you can smell it in the car .
It is n't that bad if you light some incense .
I dropped a few sticks of incense between the seats , you can have them if you find em .
- The hood latch is broken and the hood will occasionally fly up and hit the windshield while driving .
The windshield is currently cracked from the last time this happened , but the crack is n't that bad .
In fact , it helps air out the stench of the tuna .
- Needs new front and rear brakes .
The ones on there do n't really stop , but if you give the emergency brake a good tug it should take care of everything .
- There is a hornets nest somewhere under the hood .
I have no idea where .
Occasionally a hornet will blow in through the air conditioning vent , but I will include a fly swatter above the visor .
- There is some blood on the passenger seat and all over the side of the door .
If you are ever pulled over and the police ask about it , just tell them the previous owner hit a deer .
Do n't say who I am though .
- I bought the car from someone who replaced the original horn with a freight train horn .
It is really loud and I do n't recommend using it , I have caused several accidents with it .
Besides these problems , this is a great starter car for any young driver !
I actually call it the " ladies mobile " because the chicks dig it .
I am asking $ 6000 for it , but am willing to negotiate .
Thanks ,
Mike
From joey ******* to Me
hey thanks for the offer !
$ 6000 sounds like a little much for that car .
my dad only gave me a $ 4000 budget , would you be willing to take that ?
From Mike Anderson to joey ********
Son , you obviously have no experience in buying vehicles .
When I said I was willing to negotiate , I meant I was willing to take more money for the car if you wanted to give it to me .
Minimum is $ 6,000 .
Talk to your dad , and he will tell you that this car is a once - in - a - lifetime deal .
He 'll be pissed if he saw that you passed this up .
Mike
From joey ******* to Me
What the hell is wrong with you ?
That car is a piece of shit !
Stop e-mailing my son , you moron .

For more than half a million farmers in rural India the age old fear of crops failing due to bad weather could soon be banished , thanks to an innovative insurance scheme that UN negotiators gathering in Bonn this week are considering as a central component of climate change adaptation measures in Africa , Asia and Latin America .
Following a successful trial last month , MicroEnsure , a company specialising in providing insurance to poor communities , plans to launch a scheme next year for up to 600,000 farmers in India 's Kolhapur province allowing them to insure against their rice crops failing due to drought or heavy rains during the plants ' flowering period .
Chief executive Richard Leftley said micro-insurance policies — so
- called because of their relatively low premiums — will be offered to farmers with loans from the local Kolhapur District Cooperative Bank .
The firm will then pay out to farmers when weather stations show crops are likely to have been damaged by rain or drought , making it possible for smallholders to support their families and continue loan repayments even when crops fail .
The scheme , which is receiving funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , will be promoted using comic books designed to explain visually how insurance works to farmers who have previously had no access to insurance cover .
It will also be supported by finance from the Indian government that will effectively halve the price of premiums to around 2.5 % of the value of the loan .
Leftley is anticipating huge demand from farmers in the region .
" We ran a pilot scheme last month for 5,000 farmers and it sold out in two days , " he said , adding that after similarly successful trials in Malawi , Ethiopia and the Philippines the company was now looking to prove micro-insurance schemes could work on a large scale .
As well as insuring against crop failure , the scheme also helps farmers access larger loans to pay for seeds and equipment , Leftley said , citing previous trials that saw banks lend 15 % to 40 % more to farmers who have insurance .
MicroEnsure 's plans come as delegates at this week 's UN climate change talks in Bonn debate whether rich countries should provide financial support to the fledgling sector .
The official negotiating text [ pdf ] , which forms the basis of an international climate change deal that is expected to be finalised in Copenhagen later this year , includes proposals to support micro-insurance projects .
Dr Koko Warner , an insurance expert at the UN University , said a broad consensus of support was building around the idea ahead of the Bonn meeting with US negotiators showing support for the first time .
" There has been a real shift in the US position , " she said .
" It has got behind micro-insurance as it perceives it as a good way of reducing and spreading climate risk . "
Micro-insurance also presents a cost - effective means of promoting climate change adaptation measures , according to Thomas Loster , chairman of the Munich Re Foundation , a not - for - profit arm of the insurance giant .
He predicted that as weather - based insurance schemes mature and larger insurance firms enter the market they will provide poor communities with education to help better protect themselves against the impact of droughts and weather - related disasters , such as hurricanes and flooding .
" The basic principle of insurance is that you offer lower premiums when risks are lower , " he explained , predicting that micro-insurance providers would want to limit the number of claims they face by helping communities become more resilient to climate change .
Alan Doran , a microfinance expert and consultant to Oxfam , said he expected micro-insurance schemes to become an increasingly important component of development projects .
" These types of schemes allow people in poor communities to cushion themselves against shocks in a way that we take for granted , " he said .
" If the weather stations are put in place and the risks are spread effectively then it has the potential to deliver real benefits . "

RECIFE , Brazil / PARIS ( Reuters ) - Search crews retrieved four more bodies from a crashed Air France jet on Sunday , spotted other corpses and found a large amount of debris from the plane that plunged into the Atlantic ocean .
Six bodies have now been recovered from the plane , following the discovery of two unidentified males on Saturday , five days after the Airbus A330 crashed on its way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris killing all 228 people on board .
Investigators are considering the possibility that the speed sensors on Flight 447 may have iced up , and Air France said late on Saturday it was accelerating the replacement of speed sensors on all its Airbus long - haul planes .
Brazil ’s navy said on Sunday it had retrieved three more bodies and France said a helicopter operating from one of its naval frigates had recovered another body from the world ’s worst air disaster since 2001 .
“ Hundreds of items are being found and being stored until we know where they should go , ” Brazilian Air Force spokesman Henry Munhoz told reporters in the northeastern city of Recife , where the bodies and debris will eventually be brought .
Several other corpses spotted on Sunday by Brazilian Air Force planes are expected to be picked up later in the day , search officials said .
Brazilian network Globo reported on its website that a refrigerated truck used to store corpses was waiting on the islands of Fernando de Noronha , 230 miles off the coast of Brazil .
Twelve Brazilian planes , one equipped with radar equipment that can detect material in the water , two French planes , one French ship and five Brazilian navy ships are searching the area about 680 miles northeast of Brazil ’s coast .
SUBMARINE TO JOIN SEARCH
France has also sent a nuclear - powered submarine that should arrive on Wednesday to search for the black box flight data recorders that will be crucial to understanding why the modern plane fell from the sky as it passed storms on Monday .
The Emeraude is equipped with powerful sonars to help detect the black box ’s beacons that stay active for 30 days .
The plane ’s pilots may have set the aircraft at a dangerous speed because they were relying on faulty speed readings , investigators believe .
Air France said it had begun the switchover of speed sensors five weeks before the crash , but only after disagreeing with Airbus over the planemaker ’s proposal to carry out tests before replacing them .

An Airbus spokesman declined to comment and said it could only discuss the investigation with French air authorities .
The head of France ’s air accident agency BEA said on Saturday it was too soon to say if problems with the speed sensors , known as pitot tubes , were in any way responsible .

LOST DATA
The agency said the A330 had sent out 24 error messages in four minutes including one indicating a discrepancy in speed data .
It said similar problems had happened before .
Air France said it had first noticed in May 2008 that ice in the sensors was causing lost data in planes like the A330 , but that it failed to agree with Airbus on steps to take .
According to Air France , Airbus offered to carry out an in - flight test on new sensors this year but the airline decided to go ahead and started changing them anyway from April 27 .
It did not say whether the crashed plane had the new sensors but its last maintenance hangar visit was on April 16 .
Some of the A330 ’s 50 or so other operators defended the plane ’s safety record at an airlines meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday , saying the crash was an isolated incident .
But Airbus has faced problems with the speed sensors dating back to at least 2001 , forcing changes in equipment as well as the pilot ’s flight manual , according to online filings .
In 2001 , France reported several cases of sudden fluctuation of A330 or A340 airspeed data during severe icing conditions and Airbus was ordered to change the cockpit manual , according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration .
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration says it has tried to avoid words or deeds that could be portrayed as American meddling in Iran ’s presidential election and its tumultuous aftermath .
Yet on Monday afternoon , a 27 - year - old State Department official , Jared Cohen , e-mailed the social - networking site Twitter with an unusual request : delay scheduled maintenance of its global network , which would have cut off service while Iranians were using Twitter to swap information and inform the outside world about the mushrooming protests around Tehran .
The request , made to a Twitter co-founder , Jack Dorsey , is yet another new - media milestone : the recognition by the United States government that an Internet blogging service that did not exist four years ago has the potential to change history in an ancient Islamic country .
“ This was just a call to say : ‘ It appears Twitter is playing an important role at a crucial time in Iran .
Could you keep it going ? ’ ” said P.J. Crowley , the assistant secretary of state for public affairs .
JAPANESE TACTICS IN THE PHILIPPINES
The following comments and lessons on Japanese tactics and equipment have been gathered in interviews with officers who served with Filipino and American troops during the campaign in Luzon .
They do not represent a complete survey of Japanese tactics and equipment , but are rather the 'observations of individual officers on what they saw and what impressed them .
The Japanese soldiers were fairly young , their average age being about 22 to 23 , although the best troops were about 25 , many of whom had had experience in China .
The Japanese have troops trained primarily for beach landing .
Specially built barges drawn by motor boats carry 80 or more men .
Landings were usually made at night ; when possible , during a full moon .
Ordinarily , the landings were made about midnight , with the barges coming as far in on the beach as possible .
Although the Japanese have specially trained landing troops they did not always employ them , particularly when they knew the opposition would not be strong .
Whenever the Japanese did encounter strong resistance in an attempted landing , they simply moved to another location and landed where the enemy was not present .
After landing , they would attempt to push inland and encircle the troops along the shore .
No Japanese parachute troops were employed in the Philippines .
The Japanese did , however , utilize parachutes in dropping bales of propaganda and in dropping food and ammunition to troops who had been isolated from their main forces .
As in every other campaign in the Far East , the principal tactics used by the Japanese centered on their ability to infiltrate .
The actual infiltrations were usually carried out at night .
The Japanese would work their way forward in small parties through gaps , around flanks , and even through the front lines .
They would remain quiet during the following day , and on the next night more troops would infiltrate the American position until there was a sufficiently strong force actually in or behind the American lines to launch a small attack .
In these infiltration tactics the Japanese were capitalizing on the initiative and " fanaticism " of the individual soldier .
American officers seem to agree that this " fanaticism " manifests itself particularly in lack of fear of death .
As one officer puts it , " they will do things that they know will cost them their lives ; for example , throw themselves on wire so that the following troops may pass over their bodies , or destroy tank mines by deliberately walking on them . "
In actual battle they are ferocious fighters .
They very rarely surrender , because they fear what their captors will do to them and because they believe that if they die they go to Heaven and their families are honored .
They also believe that if they surrender and are later retaken by their own troops , their families will be disgraced and they themselves will be punished .
Even when surrounded , individual groups and soldiers will continue to fight on .
One occasion has been reported when U.S. forces surrounded about 2,000 Japanese behind the American lines ; about 200 got away , but the rest fought so savagely , refusing to surrender , that only about 50 were left to be captured .
Many Japanese will even go so far as to commit suicide rather than be taken prisoner .
Another instance of the excellent fighting qualities of the individual Japanese soldier was illustrated in the extensive use of snipers .
Apparently the members of the sniper corps were a picked group , for their marksmanship was extremely good , and they had been provided with special clothing .
The footwear of the sniper was a split - toe , rubber - soled sneaker with a cloth top .
He wore a head net over a steel helmet ; and a loose shirt or smock of green and white replaced the usual uniform .
Green sprigs and leaves were inserted in the head net over his helmet .
Climbing a tree , the sniper would hide in the foliage after tying himself to the tree with vines or rope .
There he would wait patiently for a suitable target .
These snipers apparently had instructions to concentrate on the American officers , for often they would let a whole detachment of Filipino or American enlisted men go by in order to wait for a shot at an officer .
The snipers employed the regular .25 caliber rifle of the ground troops , using powder which gave no flash , no smoke , and " a report not much louder than that of a B - B gun . "
Characteristic of Japanese tactics was the attack at dusk .
Infiltrating and moving around to the flanks , they would take as much territory as possible before actual darkness fell .
During the night , positions would be consolidated so that by dawn they would have their recently occupied ground well organized against possible U.S. counterattacks .
At all times the Japanese kept up a pressure against our lines , constantly seeking gaps and weak spots .
When one was found , a small group would go in as far as possible , to be followed by more unless the first , were immediately wiped out .
The Japanese had a novel method of serving their light machine gun .
One man served as the mount , the second man was gunner .
They would both drop to the ground and as soon as they had finished a clip , they would roll over , crawl away about 10 or more yards and then open up on the same targets .
This had the effect of confusing the American and Filipino troops as to the exact position of the enemy , sometimes leading them to believe that there were two or more machine guns operating against them .
The gun used was not a tommy gun , as many thought , but simply the Nambu light .25 caliber machine gun .
The Japanese artillery employed a fifth gun in many batteries .
While the battery was firing , the fifth gun would range and obtain data for new targets , and after the four guns of the firing battery had accomplished their first mission they could then shift to the new target without delay .
The Japanese handled their artillery well , except that in the beginning of the campaign their disposition of guns and batteries showed that they had not had much experience against an enemy who also used artillery .
For example , initially there was very little attempt to conceal or camouflage the Japanese guns .
After their artillery had been subjected to severe concentrations by the U.S. artillery , however , they learned quickly .
Another mistake made at first was bringing up truck columns under U.S. artillery fire or attempting to occupy towns which were well within our artillery range , but the heavy casualties suffered soon taught them the value of camouflage and dispersion .
The Japanese artillery fire was ordinarily accurate .
They used the 105 - mm . and 150 - mm. guns , both of which were excellent .
The range of the 105 is approximately 20,000 yards , that of the 150 , 27,000 yards .
The few 240 - mm. pieces were not extensively used .
At first Japanese counterbattery fire was not good .
There were probably two reasons for this : first , as already stated , the Japanese had never before been up against an enemy who had much artillery , that is , enough to make real counterbattery worth while ; second , the U.S. counterbattery fire was so excellent that it more or less neutralized the Japanese artillery .
At the end , however , when they were bombarding Corregidor , their counterbattery fire was very good .
Another characteristic of the Japanese was the apparent importance they attached to harassing tactics , with the object of creating confusion and indecision in the minds of their enemy .
In these operations , which they kept up constantly , they utilized individuals and small groups to fire from unexpected positions , conduct sniping operations , and demonstrate in unexpected places .
As reported in the newspapers , they would often use firecrackers to achieve this confusion .
Bunches of firecrackers were set off at different positions in front of the U.S. lines , on their flanks , and even behind the lines .
In so doing , they hoped to confuse U.S. troops as to the actual Japanese position , and also to draw U.S. fire and thus locate machine - gun and rifle groups .
These tactics were effective against raw troops , but their effect decreased soon after soldiers had been exposed to them .
The Japanese had almost complete control of the air , and they utilized it to observe , bomb , and strafe the U.S. and Filipino troops .
Most of the bombing was high - level ; dive bombing was used occasionally but only against front - line troops .
Against rear - area installations high - level attacks were always used .
Ordinarily these high - level attacks were kept up to about 20,000 or 30,000 feet by U.S. antiaircraft .
Reports varied on the effectiveness of the Japanese Fifth Column activity .
Apparently the Japanese attempted to use Fifth Column rather extensive but had only fair results .
Some fires were lit on the beaches and in jungles , and some signals given with flares and flashlights .
Many of the flares were lighted by the Japanese themselves with the object of creating confusion among the U.S. troops .
The Japanese also used propaganda directed against both the Army and the civilians .
How effective it was is not yet known , but the significant thing is that they did seriously try to use it , and may be expected to use it every time they feel there is any chance of obtaining results .
From Japanese activities in the Philippine campaign it is apparent that they will attempt , whenever possible , to tap wires and intercept radio messages .
U.S. officers who fought in the Philippines emphasize that all conversations should be in code .
There should be no reference to numerical designations or to individuals .
The Japanese also attempted to capitalize on the large number of refugees , driving them into the U.S. lines , thus adding to our burden of supply .
It is reported that between 10,000 and 30,000 refugees flooded Bataan .
One officer gives the following comment as the most important generalization to be made on the Japanese soldier : " The Japanese are crafty , shrewd , given to deception .
They are amazingly patient and wait hours , even days , for their chance .
They are tough individual soldiers and work well in small groups of two or three men . "
Another officer gives the following observation : " Do n't underestimate the Jap .
He is patient , an individualist , taught to go by himself .
He does not fear capture when he gets behind your line .
Guard your headquarters .
He works at night .
He is full of trickery ; he knows English , will learn your name , call to you , get you off your guard , and kill you .
He is a past master at using devices to annoy you and work on your morale even though these devices may have little other material effect .
He does n't surrender and in battle is a savage fighter . "
The researchers put experimental street lights on the bats ' " commuting " route
Streetlights may make it easier for humans to travel by road , but they could cause a problem for " commuting " bats , say researchers .
Scientists have found that , as bats travel to feeding grounds , they avoid hedgerows illuminated by streetlights .
Reporting in the journal Current Biology , they say this could cause bats to use longer and less safe routes .
The researchers studied the effect with artificial lights along flight routes used by lesser horseshoe bats .
The endangered lesser horseshoe bat may be " hard - wired to avoid light " Emma Stone , a biologist from Bristol University , UK , who led the study , placed the experimental lights along hedgerow - lined flight - paths used by the bats when they leave their colonies .
These lights mimicked the colour and intensity of ubiquitous sodium streetlights , which are used throughout the world .
" The magnitude of the effect was surprising , " said Professor Gareth Jones , one of the authors of the study .
" With the lights on , there was about a quarter to an eighth of the activity - or number of bats flying along the route - compared to when the lights were off . "
Professor Jones explained that , although the bats have sensitive hearing , which they rely on for navigation , it is not tailored to help them avoid predators .
" Echolocation is of limited value for detecting predators , because the high frequencies they use are directional , and limited in range , " he said .
This means the bats are vulnerable to attack from birds of prey if they fly in lit conditions .
Avoiding predators , Professor Jones said , was probably the main reason why bats were nocturnal .
And relatively slow - flying lesser horseshoe bats , in particular , seem to be " hard - wired " to avoid light .
The researchers suggest this finding could be considered in conservation measures ; light could be deviated away from commuting routes with trees and sheltered areas near colonies .

On May 26 , the UN Human Rights Council issued a report titled “ Promotion and Protection of All Human Rights , Civil , Political , Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , Including the Right to Development – Report of the Special Rapporteur ( Philip Alston ) on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions . ”
Alston was damning in his criticism regarding “ three areas in which significant improvement is necessary if the US Government is to match its actions to its stated commitment to human rights and the rule of law : ”
(1) Its imposition of the death penalty under which innocent people are executed .
Alston was shocked about “ glaring criminal justice system flaws , ” citing Texas and Alabama as examples , but many other states are as derelict .
He criticized politicized judges and recommended that Congress “ should enact legislation permitting federal court habeas review of state and federal death penalty cases on their merits . ”
He condemned the 2006 Military Commissions Act and its provisions that violate international human rights and humanitarian law with regard to due process and fairness .
(2) America needs “ greater transparency into law enforcement , military , and intelligence operations that result in unlawful deaths . ”
Domestically , it provides inadequate information about deaths of immigrants and other detainees , but the worst failures are in international military and intelligence operations .
(3) The government fails to “ provide greater accountability for potentially unlawful deaths in its international operations . ”
It ignores civilian casualties , both their number and conditions under which they occur , and fails to provide ordinary people , including US citizens , with basic information regarding investigations and prosecutions when laws were violated .
It fails to assure safeguards are in place to prevent so - called collateral damage – that is , civilians wrongfully ( and at times willfully ) targeted and killed .
Overall , “ there have been chronic and deplorable accountability failures with respect to policies , practices and conduct that ( cause ) alleged unlawful killings – including possible war crimes – in the United States ’ international operations . ”
Effective investigations have been lacking and guilty parties , throughout the chain of command , have n’t been punished .
Even worse , private contractors and civilian intelligence personnel have been granted “ a zone of impunity ” because of failures to hold them accountable .
Alston recommends a national “ commission of inquiry ” and a special prosecutor to conduct thorough investigations “ independent of the pressure on the political branches of Government . ”
More on this below .
In June 2008 , Alston spent two week in America meeting with federal and state officials , judges and civil society groups , as well as victims and witnesses in five US cities .
As a signatory to international human rights laws , including the four Geneva Conventions , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and Convention against Torture , the US is bound by their provisions and required to hold its civilians and military personnel accountable when they violate them .
Domestic Issues
The federal government , 35 states , and US military impose death penalties , often executing innocent people for failing to assure proper due process and fairness .
Alston addressed the federal death penalty and its application in Texas and Alabama , the former for its largest number of US executions , the latter for having the nation ’s highest per capita rate of them .
Yet since 1973 , 130 death row inmates nationwide were exonerated , and their numbers keep growing .
Since 1977 , 13 in Illinois were also declared innocent and freed , a state where governor George Ryan took unprecedented steps :
— on January 31 , 2000 , he declared a moratorium on further executions after acknowledging a deeply flawed system under which innocent men and women are executed ;
— then in January 2003 , he commuted the sentences of all 156 death row prisoners – an action only matched by the Supreme Court in Furman v. Georgia ( June 29 , 1972 ) when it struck down capital punishment at the state and federal levels , calling existing statutes unconstitutional , “ arbitrary and capricious , ” and commuted the sentences of all 629 inmates on death row – until it reinstated it in Gregg v. Georgia on July 2 , 1976 .
Ever since , well over 1100 executions took place and three times that number await them on death row .
Far too often they ’re innocent victims of injustice , people of color , poor , and unable to effectively deal with a hostile prosecutorial system , at least because :
— inadequate laws and / or practices do n’t protect them “ governing the preservation of evidence ( including DNA ) or because of the passage of time ; ”
— after convictions , some state laws disallow use of DNA evidence ; to countermand this , a federal law should mandate it as standard procedure ;
— in some cases , biological evidence is n’t relevant ; and
— in others , “ evidentiary or procedural issues preclude a just or reliable basis for imposing the death penalty . ”
The result is a deeply flawed criminal justice system affecting victims , their families , and communities when real criminals remain at large .
Yet government officials are often indifferent to the problem , at both state and federal levels .
Alston recommends changes :
— action to address the lack of judicial independence and inadequate right to counsel ;
— a top - to - bottom criminal justice system analysis and overhaul followed by reforms , especially for racial disparities in capital cases ; and
— federal court reviews of all injustice claims when capital punishment is at issue .
Unfortunately , Alston does n’t challenge the death penalty but believes federal and state laws should only impose it for the “ most serious crimes . ”
However , who ’s to decide and on what basis .
He also says foreign nationals denied the right to consular notification were unfairly treated and should be provided review and reconsideration .
Judicial Independence
Texas , Alabama , and other states “ have partisan elections for judges . ”
However , “ as research and practice show , ” this system “ jeopardizes the right of capital defendants to a fair trial and appeal . ”
Also , there ’s a direct correlation between public support for the death penalty and decisions made to impose it .
“ There is no such correlation in non-elective states . ”
State officials told Alston that getting re-elected depends on supporting the death penalty and imposing it from the bench – even at times by overriding jury decisions for life in prison .
Right to Counsel
The right is fundamental but not applied if counsel quality is poor , as so often is the case when court - appointed or low - income defendants can’t afford better representation .
State funding to provide it is inadequate , and one Texas official told Alston that defense counsel competency in the state is “ abysmal . ”
Major reforms are needed to repair a broken system , in Texas and nationwide .
Racial Disparities
Persons of color in America are most vulnerable to receive death sentences in capital cases – especially if victims are white .
Yet federal and state officials are indifferent to the problem or deny one exists .
When confronted with evidence from various studies , they claim they were conducted by anti-death penalty advocates and dismiss the results .
It ’s never been a good time to be poor , black , or Latino in America , especially when confronted by a hostile criminal justice system claiming to be impartial .
Systematic Evaluation of the Criminal Justice System
Far too little is done at the state or federal levels to ensure wrongful death penalties are n’t imposed .
Their frequency demands serious redress – firm measures to halt injustices this grave .
Federal Habeas Corpus Review
Habeas suits can be filed in federal courts to challenge death penalty convictions , but not easily .
The 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act ( AEDPA ) denies them on many grounds , imposes a six - month statute of limitation for filing , and restricts access to federal evidentiary hearings .
Other problems also exist that limit defendants ’ rights even when wrongfully convicted – such as emphasizing “ finality ” over the right of due process and fairness .
Serious reform measures are needed to redress this .
Most Serious Crimes
The definition is vague and applies to an intention to kill resulting in the loss of life as determined by a judge and jury .
However , capital punishment may be imposed for crimes like running large illegal drug operations according to the 1994 Federal Death Penalty Act .
Other crimes as well , including treason , terrorism , rape , kidnapping , and in the military for desertion or mutiny .
Consular Notification
America is party to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations ( VCCR ) .
It grants foreign nationals the right to contact their consulates for help , but too often they ’re prevented from doing it – in Texas , for example , where the state legislature failed to authorize its courts to provide this review .
At the federal level as well by Congress not doing it .
Alston says VCCR is “ a bedrock principle of international law ” affecting not just foreign nationals on death row in US states , but “ equally to any American who travels to another country . ”
It ’s up to Congress to fix this .
Deaths in Immigration Detention
In June 2008 , the federal government acknowledged at least 74 immigrant detention deaths since 2003 .
Newspaper reports suggest far higher numbers .
They result from various causes , including denying medical care , poor quality or delayed care , and “ inappropriate medication . ”
Overall , the treatment of immigrants in detention is deplorable with little attention paid to basic needs along with abusive treatment by authorities .
Killings by Law Enforcement Officials
The Department of Justice ( DOJ ) Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) compiles data covering homicides ( usually by other inmates but also by guards ) , suicides , “ arrest - related killings , ” and other judicially related deaths .
Statistics on resulting prosecutions and convictions are n’t available , but it ’s “ clear that ( their ) number ….is small … . ”
It means serious offenses are committed against numerous people trapped in the criminal justice system that too often affords little of it to the most vulnerable .
International Operations – The Death Penalty Under the Military Commissions Act
From the time of their arrest and internment , Guantanamo detainees were denied any measure of due process and fairness .
Five are charged with capital offenses under the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) , and others also may face the death penalty under this travesty of a law .
Although Obama ordered a stay of Commission proceedings to decide on procedures to follow , he left open the likelihood that prosecutions will proceed under MCA provisions , and if done , they ’ll violate US obligations under international humanitarian law .
MCA “ utterly fail (s ) to meet basic due process standards . ”
Several of its most egregious flaws include :
— Guantanamo detainees were tortured and subjected to cruel and abusive treatment ;
— statements coerced through torture will be used as evidence at trials ;
— whatever America says is classified will be unavailable to defense attorneys ;
— detainees may be convicted by evidence he has never seen or knows anything about ; and
— second and third - hand hearsay evidence will be allowed at trial .
“ The MCA ’s provisions constitute a gross infringement on the right to a fair trial and it would violate international law to execute someone under this statute . ”
Detainee Deaths at Guantanamo
Full knowledge of detainee deaths is n’t known , including their number and causes .
Alston cites five reported , four called suicides , the other attributed to cancer .
Custodial powers are required “ to ensure and respect the right to life . ”
As such , they bear responsibility for detainee deaths and are obligated to investigate and publicly report their findings and whatever evidence supports them .
So far , DOD has stonewalled all efforts to comply , except to release redacted autopsy and other internal investigation reports .
Lack of Transparency Regarding Civilian Casualties
DOD officials told Alston that it does n’t compile data on Afghan or Iraqi civilian casualties because body counts do n’t relate to the effectiveness or legality of military operations .
Yet doing it is important to judge if America is serious about avoiding them altogether and keeping them to a minimum when they happen .
No evidence suggests that ’s so .
Private Contractors
Credible reports indicate that private security and other contractors engage in indiscriminate and otherwise questionable force against civilians , causing numerous casualties that may number in the thousands .
Little of this gets reported and transparency overall is lacking .
“ The most comprehensive study to date found that few firms ever report shooting incidents , that such incidents are often misreported , and that SIRs ( serious incident reports ) that are filed are almost uniformly cursory and uninformative . ”
As a result , private contractors get away with murder because no authority holds them accountable .
Civilian Intelligence Agencies
What ’s true for contractors , applies to the CIA as well with credible reports of at least five custodial deaths from torture or other means .
Claimed investigations were conducted .
CIA involvement was never confirmed or denied .
Its Inspector General told Alston that cases involving possible unlawful killings are classified , and no one so far has been prosecuted nor will they as Obama ruled out the possibility .
Transparency and Accountability for Unlawful Killings and Custodial Deaths
Failure to assure transparency and “ effective investigations into , and meaningful prosecution of , wrongful deaths means the ( US ) Government cannot fulfill its obligation to ensure accountability for violations of the right to life . ”
Military Justice System Failures
In Afghanistan , Alston witnessed a lack of transparency first hand and the Government ’s unwillingness to be held accountable for illegal conduct .
Most often investigations are quashed or inadequately done .
Moreover , they ’re never against senior officers , and light sentences are administered to the few convicted .
America fails in its “ legal obligation to effectively punish violations ( or observe ) the rule of law , ” as vital in war as in peace .
One study “ of almost 100 detainee deaths in US custody between August 2002 and February 2006 found that investigations were fundamentally flawed . ”
They also violated the military ’s own regulations for investigations , and resulted in “ impunity and a lack of transparency into the policies and practices that may have contributed to the deaths . ”
Chief Warrant Officer Lewis E. Welshofer Jr. ’s sentencing is typical of others .
After being convicted of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty for the death of Iraqi Major General Abedd Hamed Mowhoush , he was confined to base for two months , fined $ 6000 , and reprimanded by letter .
Welshofer ’s “ sentence is not an anomaly . ”
Notable in all cases is that “ command responsibility , ” the recognized basis for criminal liability since WW II , is absent from the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) and US War Crimes Act .
It means commanders go unprosecuted and accountability is undermined .
Civilian Justice System Failures
“ For far too long , there has been a zone of de facto impunity for killings by private contractors ( PCs ) and civilian intelligence agents operating in Iraq , Afghanistan , and elsewhere . ”
It ’s not for lack of an applicable legal framework .
It ’s because “ US prosecutors have failed to use the laws on the books to investigate and prosecute PCs and civilian agents for wrongful deaths , ” some of which occur from torture , abuse as well as willful homicides .
The DOJ has prosecutorial authority over PCs , civilian government employees , and former military personnel suspected of war crimes under two of its operations :
— the US Attorney ’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia for detainee abuse cases ; and
— the Domestic Security Section ( DSS ) of DOJ ’s Criminal Division for unlawful shootings committed while protecting convoys .
Both fall way short , and DSS representatives acknowledged the lack of convictions but withheld information on allegations received , investigations undertaken , or their status .
“ The lamentable bottom line is that DOJ has brought a scant few cases against PCs for civilian casualties , achieved a conviction only in one case involving a CIA contractor , and brought no cases against CIA employees …. this vacuum is neither legally nor ethically defensible . ”
Ensuring Transparency and Accountability
It ’s only possible through the “ will to enforce the rule of law , ” yet Alston ’s conclusion is that outcome is highly unlikely .
“ In short , war crimes prosecutions in particular are ‘ politically radioactive ’ ” and wo n’t happen .
However , there are other steps the government can take to increase transparency and accountability :
— create a national “ commission of inquiry ” to conduct independent investigations of policies and practices causing deaths and other abuses ; and
— appoint an independent special prosecutor , free from institutional or political pressures to the greatest degree possible .
In both cases , fundamental requirements require independence , impartiality , competence , and the power to obtain all sought information .
Adequate funding is also essential and the right to publicly report findings and recommendations .
“ The most credible response to the military justice system ’s investigative failure and sentencing distortions would be the creation of a Director of Military Prosecutions ( DMP ) position ” – much like in Australia , Canada , Ireland , New Zealand , and the UK “ to ensure greater separation between the chain of command and the prosecution function . ”
The DOJ should also establish a special office solely to investigate and prosecute cases involving PCs , civilian government employees , and former military personnel .
Reparations for Civilian Casualties
International law mandates that compensation for human rights violations be paid , and in some instances to families it has been .
But it ’s much too little for the families of too few victims .
The Foreign Claims
Act requires payment of legal claims arising from negligent or wrongful deaths caused by military personnel outside of combat .
Other programs also exist , including the Commander ’s Emergency Response Program ( CERP ) for “ condolence payments ” and in Afghanistan authorization of “ solatia payments . ”
However , these are ad hoc efforts , and the “ lack of systematic compensation for civilian casualties caused by private contractors is acute . ”
As their employer , the government bears ultimate responsibility but shuns it .
Targeted Killings : Lack of Transparency Regarding the Legal Framework and Targeting Choices
Credible evidence shows America engages in targeted killings on the territory of other states , and senior officials admit using drones for this purpose .
Yet when queried , answers are evasive , not forthcoming , and disturbing justifications are given that violate the letter and spirit of international law .
Recommendations – For Domestic Issues
— enforce due process and fairness in death penalty cases ;
— reform the system of partisan elected judges ;
— public defenders should be competent , well funded , and oversight of this function should be independent of the executive and judicial branches ;
— commissions should be established to review cases of wrongful convictions – discovered through subsequent exonerations ;
— ways the death penalty is administered and implemented should be evaluated and changed ;
— racial disparities in death penalty impositions need to be addressed and corrected ;
— congressional legislation should let federal courts review death penalty cases on their merits ;
— capital punishment should be used sparingly and only for the most serious crimes of willful killings ; ( ideally , it should be banned entirely as no civil society worthy of the name has the right to claim an eye for an eye ) ;
— foreign nationals should have their executions stayed until proper consular reviews and reconsiderations are conducted ;
— immigration detention deaths should be promptly reported and investigated ; and
— Homeland Security should assure proper medical and other essential care is provided , consistent with international standards .
Guantanamo Detainees
The Military Commissions
Act violates international laws and should n’t be used for capital case prosecutions .
Ones conducted should assure due process according to international human rights and humanitarian law requirements .
International Operations
— civilian casualties should be tracked and publicly disclosed ;
— the DOD should ensure military justice transparency by establishing a central office of “ registry ” to track cases from investigation through final disposition and should include upcoming hearings , investigative findings , rulings , pleadings , testimony transcripts , and other pertinent materials ;
— comprehensive criminal jurisdiction over armed conflict offenses should be ensured and “ command responsibility ” should be codified in the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) and War Crimes Act ;
— federal legislation should be enacted to provide criminal jurisdiction over private contractors and civilian employees , including the CIA and other intelligence branches ;
— an independent commission of inquiry and special prosecutor should be established to investigate practices causing deaths and other abuses ; also a Director of Military Prosecutions to hold everyone throughout the chain of command responsible for their alleged crimes ;
— an office to investigate and prosecute private contractors , civilian government employees , and former military personnel should be created within the DOJ ;
— enhanced reparations programs should be established to provide adequate compensation to families of those wrongfully killed ;
— targeted killings must stop ; reasons for them in lieu of capture should be explained and whether states in which they occur gave consent ; specifically , international laws must be scrupulously enforced ; and
— collaterally killed civilian numbers should be disclosed , by drones or other attacks , and measures should be in place to avoid them or hold them to a minimum .
In summary , Alston called America ’s human rights record “ deplorable , ” and in need of major changes .
In response , the Obama administration charged him with violating his mandate by accusing the US of failing to properly investigate allegations of unlawful US military killings in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Acting deputy at the US mission in Geneva , Larry Richter , said : “ We do not believe that military and intelligence operations during armed conflict fall within the special rapporteur ’s mandate . ”
Much more important is his lack of power to act on the crimes he discovered .
Still he deserves credit for revealing what US authorities try hard to suppress and ignore .

Testing Rails with Rack : : Test
The biggest news in Rails 2.3 is its support for Rack , the WSGI inspired Ruby web server interface .
Of all the Rack goodness that has come along lately , the one that has me the most excited is Bryan Helmkamp 's Rack : : Test library , of which Bryan said " Basically , I extracted Merb ’s request helper code into a small , reusable , framework agnostic library . "
I loved Merb 's request specs .
I suspect that I 'm going to like Rack : : Test too .
Installing Rack : : Test
We 'll start by installing Rack : : Test and loading it into our Rails app .
Append this line to config / environments / test.rb :
config.gem " rack- test " , : lib => " rack / test "
You can now use rake to install it :
$ sudo rake gems : install RAILS_ENV=test
Running tests with " rake test: rack "
We want to be able to run these tests easily with rake , just like our unit or functional tests .
Create a new file called lib / tasks / rack - test.task and paste this code ( courtesy of recipe 53 from the Advanced Rails Recipes book ) into it :
namespace : test do Rake :: TestTask.new ( : rack => " db:test : prepare " ) do |t| t.libs << " test " t.pattern = " test/rack/**/*_test.rb " t.verbose = true end Rake :: Task [ " test: rack " ] . comment = " Run the Rack : : Test tests in test / rack " end task : test do Rake : : Task [ " test: rack " ] .
invoke end
Note that we have also extended the : test task so that our Rack tests will get run after our unit and functional tests .
You should now be able to run rake test : rack , but it wo n't do anything yet .
Let 's test it by dropping this code into a file called test / rack / dummy_test.rb :
require File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__ ) , *%w [.. test_helper ] ) class DummyTest < ActiveSupport :: TestCase include Rack :: Test :: Methods def app lambda { |env| [ 200 , {} , " Coolness " ] } end test " should be hooked up properly " do get " / " assert last_response.body.include ?( " Cool " ) end end
When you run rake test : rack you should get something like this :
$ rake test:rack ( in / Users/ graham/data/effectif/projects /canvas ) /System/Library / Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby - I" lib:test " " / Library / Ruby / Gems/1.8/gems/rake-0.8.7/lib/rake/rake_test_loader.rb " " test/rack/login_test.rb "
Loaded suite / Library / Ruby / Gems/1.8/gems/rake-0.8.7/lib/rake/rake_test_loader
Started .
Finished in 0.008904 seconds .
1 tests , 1 assertions , 0 failures , 0 errors
Testing your Rails app
You 'll have noticed that the app method ( which is supposed to return an instance of the Rack application under test ) does n't actually have anything to do with Rails .
It returns a callable object that needs to be compliant with the Rack API ( apps are invoked via their call method , which is also how you invoke a lambda ) .
Let 's fix that by making the app method return an instance of our Rails application .
For an example of how Rails instantiates a rack app have a look inside commands / server.rb .
Scroll down until you find the call to Rack : : Builder.new .
From there we can see that Rails is using ActionController : : Dispatcher.new .
That should be enough for most purposes ( if not you can see what else you may need to add by poking around in server.rb ) .
That gives us a template test file that looks something like this :
require File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__ ) , *%w [.. test_helper ] ) class MyTest < ActiveSupport :: TestCase include Rack :: Test :: Methods def app ActionController :: Dispatcher.new end test " home page " do get " / " assert last_response.ok ?
end end
If you want to get a bit more fancy and test things that are n't handled by ActionController : : Dispatcher you can put your app together with Rack : : Builder .
As a contrived example , if you wanted to test for the presence of static files ( I said it was contrived ) you could create your app like this :
def app Rack : : Builder.new { map " / " do use Rails : : Rack :: Static run ActionController :: Dispatcher.new end }.to_app end
This article was written using Rails 2.3.2 , Rack 1.0.0 and Rack : : Test 0.3.0 .
Why Bother ?
Shortly after I first posted this article , crispee commented on reddit asking why you 'd bother to use Rack : : Test instead of the functional tests that come with Rails .
It 's a good question , and I completely failed to cover it .
Ooops .
Firstly , Rack : : Test is more similar to the Rails integration tests than to the functional tests .
Functional tests only allow you test the actions and views of a single controller .
Rack :: Test allows you to write tests that visit pages anywhere on your site -- you can simulate the behaviour of a real browser to ensure that your entire app hangs together properly .
Secondly , both the Rails functional and integration tests are closely coupled to Rails .
Imagine for a moment that you 've been running a Rails app for a while now .
You 've invested a lot of effort in your application ; users can log in and do all sorts of clever stuff .
In the meantime you 've been hand crafting the sales pages ( e.g. home page , tour , FAQ , etc. ) have added them to your app .
All these static pages are served by one big controller and your routes file is getting to be a bit of a mess .
It 's high time that you introduced a CMS .
You 've also recently stumbled across a hot new rack compatible web framework ( for the sake of argument , let 's call it Sinatra ) .
You quite fancy using a simple Ruby CMS ( sorry , shameless plug ) while continuing to develop the main part of your application in Rails .
Rack makes this very easy to do in the same Ruby process ( see Rails meets Sinatra for details ) .
Obviously , you wrote a test to demonstrate that a new user can click on the " Buy Now " link on your home page , navigate their way through your signup forms , and end up on the home page .
If you were also astute enough to write that test using Rack : : Test , that test will still work after you move some of those pages into the Sinatra CMS .
If you refer to Pratik 's " Rails meets Sinatra " post that I linked to above , you 'll see that you 'd only have to change the way the rack app is instantiated in your test :
def app Rack :: Builder.new { # URLs starting with / account ( logged in users ) go to Rails map " / account " do run ActionController : : Dispatcher.new end # Everything else goes to your CMS map " / " do run Sinatra.application end }.to_app end

In the early 1990s , U.S. tycoon Ross Perot criticized the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) for threatening to suck U.S. jobs south .
In the 15 years since the trilateral agreement , another giant sucking sound is coming - but from the flow of pesos across the Rio Grande and over the Atlantic into the coffers of foreign banks that are charging millions of Mexicans usurious rates that can top 100 percent .
Jorge Sanchez is feeling the effects .
A modestly paid government employee in his 40s , Sanchez fell into the plastic trap .
Trying to close the gap between a stagnating salary and a desire for a higher standard of living , he took out a bank - issued credit card .
Soon he had a half - dozen of them in his billfold .
Even before the peso went into free - fall last autumn and a wave of lay - offs added economic stress , more than 10 percent of Mexico 's 50 million consumer credit accounts - issued by banks , cell phone companies and department stores - were delinquent , according to a spokesman for Mexico 's Credit Bureau .
Panic over Influenza A( H1N1 ) , or swine flu , will further impact ordinary Mexicans as dollars from tourism and other income sources dry up .
" A moment came when my entire paycheck went to pay off credit cards , " recalls Sanchez .
" There was hardly anything left over to eat with or for the house , which has a mortgage . "
Sanchez took out a $ 5,000 loan from a private savings and loans fund .
As interest and fees accumulated , his nearly $ 1,000 credit card debt with Citigroup - group owned Banamex bank doubled and was turned over to bill collectors .
Sanchez says he faced two separate groups of attorneys with " very aggressive " attitudes and no willingness to negotiate .
Up against the wall , the Aguascalientes resident filed a complaint with the federal government 's National Commission for the Protection and Defense of Financial Services Users ( Condusef ) , an agency that works out agreements between credit card debtors and lending institutions .
Sanchez 's Banamex problem was resolved , but what really saved him was a lump - sum payment owed to him and other workers by the federal government .
Without the extra money , Sanchez muses , his future could be bleak .
" I do n't want to even think about it , " he adds .
" It surely would 've been hell . "
Sanchez is a survivor of the Mexican debt trap .
Many others are not so lucky .
According to the latest press reports , more than 5.1 million credit card accounts in Mexico are now considered bad .
Esteban Sotelo , regional director for Condusef in the southern state of Guerrero , says bad credit card debt in Mexico has reached " unprecedented levels . "
Javier Taja , president of the Guerrero state branch of the El Barzon organization , a national debtors ' advocacy group , estimates that of 200,000 credit card holders in Acapulco alone , some 85,000 people are in arrears .
Taja says he knows people who earn less than $ 800 a month but have credit card balances exceeding $ 23,000 .
" Many young people are landing in the Credit Bureau , and this will cause an economic contraction later on because we are n't going to have consumers , " Taja says .
" All we 're going to have is people in the Credit Bureau . "
Sotelo blames the crisis on free - wheeling lending practices by banks as well as consumers ' poor personal finance management skills .
Last year , Sotelo's Acapulco office handled 7,025 cases of people seeking to resolve a problem with financial institutions , mostly having to do with credit cards .
The case load was nearly a 30 percent increase over the previous year .
" People do n't know how to use credit , " Sotelo insists .
" The problem is that people are n't paying because they have more than one card . "
It used to be very difficult to obtain a credit card in Mexico .
Then , like street hustlers hawking passes to strip shows , young " promoters " working for the banks appeared on the streets virtually handing out credit cards .
From 2001 to 2008 , the number of credit cards circulating in Mexico soared from 6.1 million to 26.1 million , according to Condusef .
Maintaining offices in Los Angeles and New York , Banamex USA even offered a cross - border credit card program aimed at clients with friends or relatives in Mexico .
( In 2008 , Banamex inaugurated a branch in Calexico , California . )
Eligible income levels were dropped to unheard of lows of about $ 300 monthly , only slightly above official definitions of " poverty wages , " and certainly not enough to establish any stability or cushion .
An emblematic story involved a four - year - old girl , Daniela Elizondo , whose father was stunned to learn by mail that his daughter had been approved for a list of " select " credit card clients .
For banks ( and government ) , the Mexican credit card business is highly profitable .
In the United States , complaints soared when credit card interest rates reached the 20 - 35 percent range , but in Mexico , the Total Annual Cost ( CAT ) for bank - issued cards rose from 37 - 103 percent in early 2008 and to 47 - 113 percent by January 2009 , according to Sotelo .
The CAT includes interest rates , assorted fees and the national value - added tax .
A Condusef study found that a cardholder who began with a $ 1,000 debt and made only minimum payments would wind up forking over $ 7,500 in a 15 - year period .
The banking industry disputes Condusef 's definition of the CAT , preferring to define it based on the interest rate alone .
In a presentation at the annual banking convention in Acapulco in March 2009 , Mexican Bank Association ( ABM ) President Enrique Castillo maintained that commissions charged by his members were internationally competitive .
" We are n't the cheapest , we are n't the most expensive , " Castillo said .
While most Mexicans have scrambled to get by in recent years , the banks have enjoyed a golden era .
In good years annual profits hover around 12 to 14 percent , according to the ABM 's own numbers .
Even in gloomy 2008 , Mexico 's banks raked in about $ 5 billion in earnings , according to the National Banking and Securities Commission ( CNBV ) .
Sometimes called " the crown jewel " of Citigroup , Banamex alone earned nearly $ 1 billion in profits , a figure down $ 500 million from the previous year .
Exporting Profits
To call banks in Mexico " Mexican " is almost a misnomer .
Analysts estimate foreign capital controlled 80 to 90 percent of the assets of the 43 banks registered by the CNBV at the end of 2008 .
The largest banks are the U.S. - owned Banamex , the Canadian - run Scotia Bank , the United Kingdom 's HSBC , and Spanish - owned Bancomer ( BBVA ) and Santander .
Bank of America , Prudential , Wal - Mart and J.P. Morgan , among others , have also entered the Mexican financial services market .
The profits from Mexico 's credit card bubble have been flowing north to U.S. financial giants and across the Atlantic to Europe 's money centers .
Banks Across Borders
Bank of America , Banamex , Citigroup , HSBC , BBVA , ING and Santander teamed up late last year to engineer a $ 2.38 billion buy - out of the U.S. operations of Canada - based George Weston Limited by Bimbo , the giant bread , snacks and other foods company founded by conservative Mexican businessman Lorenzo Servitije .
The purchase greatly helped Bimbo consolidate its position as one of the leading baking and food companies in the world .
Recipients of U.S. government bailout money , Citigroup and Bank of America , greased the wheels of the deal after they announced lay - offs of tens of thousands of workers in the United States .
In Mexico , foreign bank bailouts have had their own repercussions .
Under Mexican law , foreign governments are not permitted to own banking assets in Mexico .
When the U.S. government acquired a 36 percent ownership stake in Citigroup , Banamex 's parent company , Mexican opposition politicians said Banamex was now operating in defiance of the law .
Calderon administration officials issued contradictory responses , first insisting that international free trade agreements signed by Mexico rendered the ownership law obsolete .
Treasury Secretary Agustin Carstens later said Banamex had three years to shed itself of foreign government involvement .
" Can you all explain to me ? " wrote a reader of the daily La Jornada website .
" In what law or part of the Constitution can you violate a law for three days , three months or three years , without punishment ? "
Besides Banamex , several other banks in Mexico are in the same legal quandary , including the Dutch ING bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland , both of which have been propped up by their respective governments .
The foreign government ownership controversy could wind up in Mexico 's Supreme Court .
By virtue of its new ownership interest in Citigroup , the Obama administration has , for all intents and purposes , put its stamp of approval on the corporation 's Mexican business practices , including the extremely high interest rates charged to credit card holders .
Calls to the U.S. Treasury Department for comment were not returned .
Based in the northern industrial city of Monterrey , Banorte is the sole remaining big Mexican - owned bank .
Its principal stockholder is Roberto " Tortilla King " Gonzalez Barrera , who also leads Grupo Maseca , the giant corn flour milling and tortilla - making business that dominates the market in North America , Central America , and beyond .
Maseca 's rival in the staple tortilla market is none other than Bimbo .
In the past , Gonzalez has been associated with the family of ex-president Carlos Salinas de Gortari .
Nowadays , Gonzalez and Banorte have their sights set on U.S. expansion .
The Mexican bank recently completed a take - over of the Texas - based Inter National Bank , a lending institution that offers mortgages to U.S. and Canadian citizens for vacation properties in Mexico .
Besides the high interest rates charged for credit cards and other loans , other factors help explain the profitability of Mexican banks .
Government and academic studies recently cited in the Mexican media found that more than half of all bank employees were actually outsourced workers .
In addition to not having to negotiate with pesky unions , banks could avoid paying standard benefits as well as profit - sharing payments and end - of - the - year bonuses stipulated by Mexican law .
Especially in the last ten years , banks have taken their cut of the large sums of money sent home by Mexicans working in the United States .
Then there is the notorious banditry of ATM machines .
This writer got a taste of the scam in Mexico City last year when he attempted to withdraw about $ 120 from an ATM but was flashed a message that cash was temporarily unavailable .
Nonetheless , a $ 120 debit appeared on a subsequent Visa statement .
Despite protests , Visa stood behind the " debt . "
During the last trimester of 2008 , when the world was in the throes of an economic meltdown , Visa 's profits registered a 35 percent increase .
Public anger over the high cost of banking is simmering on the streets and boiling over in cyberspace , with some writers even urging a credit card payment boycott .
In 2009 , teachers , supporters of former presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , and others have organized demonstrations in different cities against foreign - owned banks .
Some banks have responded with a public relations offensive .
A recent full - page newspaper ad taken out by Banamex claimed that during recent years the bank has reinvested all its profits in Mexico .
" We have invested $ 30 billion in Mexico , " read the ad , " More than any other bank or business . "
Banamex has not yet responded to a written request for information or comment .
To calm the public anger , Condusef recently worked out an agreement with the ABM for its members to begin negotiating with credit card debtors to reduce payments .
For its part , Bancomer now offers to periodically reduce interest rates for its clients who pay credit card bills on time .
In April , the Mexican Senate passed legislation to give the national Bank of Mexico power to regulate interest rates , outlaw some commissions , publicize interest rates of banks for consumer credit comparison purposes , and levy light fines on lawbreakers .
The measure , however , fell far short of consumers ' demands to limit interest rates .
" I would like to see lower interest rates , but I do n't recommend measures like capping interest rates on credit cards , " Condusef President Luis Pazos said in a statement , " since this would remove from the bank credit card market people with modest incomes , and could force them to seek credit at higher interest rates in the informal market , like what happened in Colombia and Chile . "
Pazos ' arguments find echo north of the border , where a U.S. effort to cap credit card interest rates at 15 percent was defeated in April .
A measure sponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) was voted down 66 - 32 in the Democrat - dominated Senate .
Similar to the Mexican approach , President Barack Obama supports a new law that would require better disclosure of credit card terms by banks , prohibit double - cycle billing , make it illegal to grant credit cards to minors , and stress greater enforcement of existing laws .
Legislation akin to the president 's preferences overwhelmingly passed the U.S.
House late last month and is now set for a battle in the Senate .
In Mexico and the United States , the prevailing political forces have carefully avoided direct action to curb the banking industry 's high interest rates , which , in the past , would have been widely considered usurious .
And Then the Flu Hit
In response to criticism that bad credit card accounts and other bad debts will precipitate a new financial crisis in Mexico , the banks and their government allies were not publicly worried in the days before the H1N1 ( swine ) flu epidemic hit .
New lines of credit available from the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Federal Reserve totaling $ 77 billion shored up Mexico 's potential foreign reserves to more than $ 150 billion this month , permitting the Calderon administration to announce it will support new economic investments .
Oddly enough , the possible infusion of cash - which could prop up the shaky peso and serve as an emergency , hog - sized piggy bank for the financial institutions - was announced on April Fool 's Day in the United States .
Almost as a sweetener , the Calderon administration plans to subsidize some lagging credit card debts .
Unveiling a new program for federal workers enrolled in the National Social Security Institute ( ISSSTE ) , the government declared it will lend cash - needy workers up to $ 3,000 at an annual " low " interest rate of 14 percent to help pay off credit card debts .
The program will help the banks cleanse their books , but keep credit card holders in debt .
The million - dollar question now , of course , is how much damage a virtual economic shutdown will do to an already stressed economy .
Closely connected is the issue of whether the flu epidemic will cause even more credit card accounts to default .
Mexican Senate President Gustavo Madero has publicly called on banks to modify payment due dates for debtors .
The conservative politician 's proposal could help out - of - work consumers in the short term , but ultimately prolong indebtedness in the long term .
At both the macro and micro-levels , a big consequence of the swine flu is likely to be an even greater pile of debt .
Indeed , as the public health emergency deepened , the Inter - American Development Bank and the World Bank offered Mexico new financial assistance packages totaling nearly $ 300 million .
And the ABM , while assuring the public it would maintain and even expand banking services , urged Mexicans to put ATM machines and credit cards to greater use as alternatives in a time of crisis .
Meanwhile , more and more Mexicans like ISSSTE member and credit card debtor Jesus Morones , another middle - aged federal worker and debtor from Aguascalientes , ask : " Who will protect the people from the banks ? "

If you love 4ss , you should visit Brazil then ; p
By Billy Wharton
June 3 , 2009 -- On April 13 , 2009 , 39 - year - old Adela María Gutiérrez Cruz became the first victim of a new virus that would become known as the swine flu ( H1N1 ) .
By the time Cruz arrived at a local hospital on April 9 , she had already entered acute respiratory distress due to an “ atypical pneumonia ” .
Further investigations led to a town outside of a factory farm , run by a subsidiary of the US meat conglomerate Smithfield Foods , in the neighbouring state of Vera Cruz .
Causalities began to mount .
Yet , nearly two weeks after the first deaths , none of the families of the dead had received anti-viral medications .
(1) Mexican health officials claimed to not have the resources to visit the families .
The swine flu grew from a local event to a global pandemic .
Strategies of isolation and containment proved futile as human carriers circulated through all corners of the globe .
Grounded airlines in Japan , a travel ban in Cuba and masked pedestrians on the streets of New York City did little to stem the tide of this potent disease .
Early medical intervention proved important , as those infected who had immediate access to anti-viral medications , such as Tamiflu , tended to fare better .
The flu was shorter and the possibility of complications thereby reduced .
Some European governments used their public health systems to quickly distribute such medications .
However , the response in Mexico and the US was different .
There , decades of lack of medical access and limited capacity left populations vulnerable to being infected rapidly .
An ominous question began to be raised : Was healthcare in the Americas capable of responding to the swine flu ?
Mexico's healthcare system `overrun and underfunded '
Since 1983 , Mexican officials have followed the World Bank blueprint for healthcare reform .
This plan decentralised control of public facilities from the federal government to impoverished state governments .
The result is a tripartite system as exclusionary as it is underfunded .
Only 1 % or 2 % of Mexicans , the country ’s elite , receive medical care in well - funded private hospitals .
About 50 % of the population , those with either state or formal sector employment , rely on a system of public hospitals .
This leaves half the society , those employed in the vast informal sector of the economy , to a network of uncoordinated and severely underfunded municipal or state - run hospitals .
Though doctors move seamlessly inside this system , taking shifts in all three parts , the quality of care is often determined by the level of funding .
One commentator described municipal / state facilities as “ overrun and underfunded ” , with wait times for care from “ hours to days ” .
(2) This , despite the fact that access to care is a stated right in the Mexican constitution .
People have attempted to adapt to the structural limitations of this separate and unequal system by fostering a culture of self - diagnosis and self - medication .
Pharmacies in Mexico work fast and loose , providing nearly any medication , on demand , to those able to tender hard currency .
However , for one - third of those self - medicating home remedies substitute for expensive trips to the pharmacy .
(3) Easy access to medication , the precarious position of employment in the informal sector and an inaccessible health system , has rendered most Mexicans defenceless in the face of a virus that demands early intervention .
Specific complaints about the slow response of the federal government have also emerged .
John Ackerman , a professor at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México , claims that at least one month of cases went unnoticed because of a lack of systemic coordination .
Only the first death on April 13 elicited a response from the right - wing government of Felipe Calderon .
(4) Even then , the lack of medical technology resulted in a three - day delay in identifying the swine flu as samples needed to be mailed to a lab in Winnipeg , Canada for analysis .
The Calderon government has also been reluctant to reveal the names of the swine flu victims .
Ackerman , as well as other opponents of the president , suspect that most of the deaths are of poorer Mexicans who fall into the lowest rung of the system .
“ Poverty and inequity ” , he argued , “ really explain who dies in this crisis ” .
25 years on , the neoliberal healthcare schemes of the World Bank bear an important responsibility for facilitating the rapid spread of the swine flu in Mexico and throughout the globe .
Separate and unequal access to care left millions of people vulnerable to a virus for which they had no natural immunity .
Exclusion in the land of plenty
Most Americans would shudder to think that the healthcare system in US features some of the same inequities as that of Mexico .
However , the United States ' privately controlled system now excludes 48 million people ( 16 % of the population ) , under - insures another 20 million and leads to the death of more than 20,000 people a year from treatable illnesses .
Even those who are insured have faced a 117 % increase in the costs of healthcare since 1999 as employers shift rising costs onto their workers .
(5) Private control has also translated into long wait times for care .
In Boston , for instance , it is easier to schedule an appointment for cosmetic surgery than for a skin cancer treatment , the average wait time of which is 73 days .
(6 ) Despite utilising the highest levels of medical technology in the world , healthcare in the US is often inaccessible , costly and features long wait times for necessary procedures .
Americans , just as their Mexican counterparts , have adapted to this unjust system by avoiding care .
A recent study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that 6 in 10 of those polled had delayed or skipped medical treatment in the last year .
(7) In this environment of avoidance , chronic conditions can quickly be converted into hazardous public health crises .
Diabetes , hypertension and HIV / AIDS infection all continue to spread at alarming rates within the borders of the US .
(8 ) Yet , access to care continues to be dependent on a person ’s ability to pay .
An airborne virus , such as the swine flu , becomes all the more efficient while filtering through a healthcare system directed by profiteering health insurance companies such as Oxford , CIGNA and Aetna .
Both Americans and Mexicans have been left exposed by inefficient health systems .
Private corporations over public interest
Working Americans and Mexicans are not the only ones who have adapted to their countries exclusionary healthcare systems .
With 85 % of “ critical infrastructure resources ” in private hands , including much of the healthcare system , even US Department of Homeland Security officials avoid discussions regarding roadblocks in accessing care in their “ preparedness strategy ” .
( 9 ) Its December 2006 report , “ Pandemic Influenza : Preparedness , Response and Recovery ” , focuses almost exclusively on isolating and containing any outbreak of influenza .
“ Radically increased demand ” , they argue , “ will overwhelm local public health systems that currently have insufficient surge resources ” .
( 10 ) One study estimates that a significant episode of influenza would create demand for 10 million hospital beds , yet there are only 1 million , two - thirds of which are currently occupied .
( 11 ) Instead of seeking necessary healthcare , employers are directed to send workers home .
The fault lines in the relationship with private industry can be clearly seen in the increasingly fierce debate over a potential H1N1 vaccine .
The “ seed stock ” needed to create a vaccine is currently being produced by the taxpayer - funded Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
Once produced however , the stock is turned over to private pharmaceutical companies , such as GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis , which then concoct a vaccine for the commercial marketplace .
The problem with this arrangement is two - fold .
First , drug companies limit their production capacity to levels that will be profitable in a “ normal ” business environment .
Thus , much like the lack of hospitals , they cannot make a sufficient amount of the vaccine to meet demand for both H1N1 vaccination and the regular flu vaccine .
( 12 ) The same problem holds true for limited supplies of Tamiflu , which is produced primarily by the Swiss drug maker Roche . ( 13 )
The resulting vaccine shortage has spurred intense competition between nations to purchase supplies for their citizens .
After a round of arm - twisting by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) and the United Nations , Roche agreed to allow drug makers in China , India and South Africa to create generic versions of Tamiflu . ( 14 ) No such compromise has been reached regarding the potential vaccine .
First World countries , such as the US , France and Britain , have already secured deals for delivery of the first batch of vaccine while nations in the Global South remain on the outside of this emerging market .
Sangeeta Shashikant of the Third World Network used clear terms to describe the precarious relationship , " There needs to be a better system in place so that WHO does not have to rely on the goodwill and charity of drug makers to get medicines for poor countries . " ( 15 ) Viruses , of course , have little concern for levels of development or drug maker ’s desire to conquer market share .
H1N1 can easily spread into the Third World claiming millions of victims , mutate and return to stalk First World prey , setting off new “ pandemic alerts ” and creating more customers for the next set of privatised anti-virals .
Healthcare for the Americas
A virus that knows no borders or human immunity demands a fundamental re-thinking of what constitutes disaster preparedness .
Open access to healthcare resources for all people in a society is a key for human survival .
As the buzz around Washington now revolves around “ healthcare reform ” , single - payer healthcare , the proposal that most clearly addresses the weaknesses exposed by the swine flue panic , has been yanked off the table .
Activists who demanded consideration of single - payer during recent US Senate finance hearings were silenced by arrest .
In single - payer ’s place is US President Barack Obama ’s plan , which offers a public and private mix and seems to have gained the support of his benefactors in the private health insurance industry .
A single - payer healthcare system , as embodied in House Resolution 676 ( HR 676 ) , would eliminate private health insurance companies , thereby providing universal access to care regardless of the ability to pay .
This would go far toward challenging the culture of avoidance , which has been a feature of an inequitable health system and facilitates the transmission of airborne infections such H1N1 .
A single - payer healthcare system would do more than make healthcare universally accessible .
Removing private interests from health insurance would also clear the ground for the development of a unified system of record keeping .
Under our current privatised system , companies such as Google , Texas Instruments and Microsoft market incompatible records systems to an uncoordinated network of hospitals and practitioners .
“ A unified computerised database ” , wrote single - payer advocate Dr Mary O’Brien prior to the appearance of H1N1 , “ would permit early detection of epidemics like a severe flu season and allow prompt immunisation to better control it ” .
( 16 ) Only a single - payer system administered nationally could allow for such a development .
Winning a single - payer system in the US would only be a first - step toward a rational healthcare system .
As demonstrated above , the role of private drug makers place severe limits on the general ability to respond to outbreaks and reinforces divisions between rich and Third World nations .
This puts millions of people at risk .
Adding private drug makers to a program of publicly administered universal healthcare would greatly enhance the health prospects for all Americans , while providing a platform to build a global response capacity .
Finally , this most recent flu panic should serve to challenge the imaginations of all single - payer system advocates .
Perhaps , in fact , we have been thinking too small .
What may really be needed is a universal healthcare plan for the Americas ambitious enough to encompass a wide geographic area and sensitive enough to provide local controls over some operations .
There is certainly a wealth of knowledge draw on in the region .
From Canada , there are many lessons about maintaining universal access .
Brazilian drug makers have pioneered the production of low - cost generics .
Cuba is a forerunner in the education of doctors and the dispensing of primary care .
From the US , there is another type of lesson .
That private companies should have no role in the dispensing of healthcare or production of pharmaceuticals .
Such things should be located in the realm of human rights .

On his Fox News Channel program on June 18 , 2009 , political commentator Sean Hannity mocked the " Cash for Clunkers " program recently approved by Congress , saying a loophole would allow someone to buy an old heap at a junkyard , have it towed to his or her house , and the government would pay $ 4,500 for it .
The Cash for Clunkers program is actually called the " Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009 . "
Having passed the House and Senate , it now sits on the president 's desk awaiting his signature .
Under the program , people can get $ 3,500 to $ 4,500 if they trade in their old gas - guzzler for a more fuel - efficient new car .
The idea is to boost the ailing auto industry while improving the environment .
There are lots of eligibility rules , and you can read all about them here in a Web site created by the government .
The bill provides $ 1 billion for the program from July through November .
In an interview with Hannity , Sen . John McCain criticized the program as more " out - of - control spending " by the Obama administration .
Hannity then added his claim about how it would be easy to game the system to soak the government .
" Listen , all we 've got to do is you got to go to a local junkyard — all you 've got to do is tow ( the car ) to your house .
And you 're going to get $ 4,500 , " Hannity said .
" I 'm going to go do that . "
Actually , legislators anticipated just such a scheme and included provisions to prevent it .
First , the law requires that the vehicle must be in " drivable condition . "
So if it needs to be towed to your house , no dice .
And second , the trade - in has to have been " continuously insured consistent with the applicable state law and registered to the same owner for a period of not less than one year immediately prior to such trade - in . "
In English :
You have to have owned the car for a year , and you have to be able to prove it .
Those safeguards were written into the bill to safeguard against the very scenario Hannity described , said Rae Tyson , a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Hannity 's statement is " not accurate , " he said .
You could always lie and forge documents .
( Do n't do it , Sean ! )
But that would be fraud .

The two airports involved have been caring for relatives and friends of those aboard the missing plane
An Air France plane carrying 228 people from Brazil to France has vanished over the Atlantic after flying into turbulence , airline officials say .
The Airbus sent an automatic message at 0214 GMT , four hours after leaving Rio de Janeiro , reporting a short circuit .
It may have been damaged by lightning .
It was well over the ocean when it was lost , making Brazilian and French search planes ' task more difficult .
France 's president said the chances of finding survivors were " very small " .

Passenger nationalities revealed Five Britons on lost French plane
In pictures : Waiting for news Mystery of Air France flight " It is a catastrophe the likes of which Air France has never seen , " Nicolas Sarkozy said after meeting relatives and friends of passengers at a crisis centre at Charles de Gaulle airport .
Earlier , Air France chief executive Pierre - Henri Gourgeon told reporters : " We are without a doubt faced with an air disaster . "
He added : " The entire company is thinking of the families and shares their pain . "
Flight AF 447 left Rio at 1900 local time ( 2200 GMT ) on Sunday .
It had 216 passengers and 12 crew on board , including three pilots .
The passengers included one infant , seven children , 82 women and 126 men .
See a map of the plane 's route Air France confirmed that there had been 61 French and 58 Brazilians on board .
Among the other passengers were 26 Germans , nine Chinese , nine Italians , six Swiss , five Britons , five Lebanese , four Hungarians , three Irish , three Norwegians and three Slovaks .
Lightning theory doubts
The Airbus 330-200 had been expected to arrive in Paris at 1110 local time ( 0910 GMT ) .
Tom Symonds , BBC
News transport correspondent
The Airbus A330 airliner is likely to have begun its journey tracking the coast of Brazil northwards before striking out across the Atlantic .
A few hundred miles from the shore , radar coverage peters out - from there on , crews use high frequency radio to report their position .
The Brazilian Air Force says the plane left radar screens near the islands of Fernando de Noronha , 230 miles from the coast .
The firmest clue to its fate comes from the data message sent via a satellite network at 0214 GMT reporting electrical and pressurisation problems .
This suggests whatever happened , happened before the crew could put out a mayday radio call .
It was likely a sudden and catastrophic emergency .
Even a double engine failure at cruising altitude would normally give the crew around half an hour 's gliding time .
Air France says the plane may have been struck by lightning , but this rarely results in tragedy .
More likely lightning damaged electrical systems , possibly leading indirectly to the plane 's ditching .
Although passengers survived a landing on the Hudson River in New York in January - it is rarely successful , especially in the middle of an ocean the size of the Atlantic .
It made its last radio contact with Brazilian air traffic controllers at 0133 GMT ( 2233 Brazilian time ) when it was 565 km ( 360 m ) off Brazil 's north - eastern coast , Brazil 's air force said .
The crew said they were planning to enter Senegalese airspace at 0220 GMT and that the plane was flying normally at an altitude of 10,670 m ( 35,000ft ) .
At about 0200 GMT , the captain reported entering heavy turbulence caused by Atlantic storms , French media report .
At 0220 , when Brazilian air traffic controllers saw the plane had not made its required radio call from Senegalese airspace , air traffic control in the Senegalese capital was contacted .
At 0530 GMT , Brazil 's air force launched a search - and - rescue mission , sending out a coast guard patrol plane and a specialised air force rescue aircraft .
France is despatching three search planes based in Dakar , Senegal , and has asked the US to help with satellite technology .
" The plane might have been struck by lightning - it's a possibility , " Francois Brousse , head of communications at Air France , told reporters in Paris .
David Gleave , from Aviation Safety Investigations , told the BBC that planes were routinely struck by lightning , and the cause of the crash remained a mystery .

" Aeroplanes get hit by lightning on quite a routine basis without generally any problems occurring at all , " he told BBC Radio Five Live .
" Whether it 's related to this electrical storm and the electrical failure on the aeroplane , or whether it 's another reason , we have to find the aeroplane first . "
France 's minister responsible for transportation , Jean - Louis Borloo , ruled out hijacking as a cause of the plane 's loss .
' No information ' Mr Sarkozy said he had met " a mother who lost her son , a fiancee who lost her future husband " .

Timeline of Flight AF 447
Air disasters timeline " I told them the truth , " he said afterwards .
" The prospects of finding survivors are very small . "
Finding the plane would be " very difficult " because the search zone was " immense " , he added .
About 20 relatives of passengers on board the flight arrived at Rio's Jobim international airport on Monday morning seeking information .
Bernardo Souza , who said his brother and sister - in - law were on the flight , complained he had received no details from Air France .
" I had to come to the airport but when I arrived I just found an empty counter , " he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency .
Air France has opened a telephone hotline for friends and relatives of people on the plane - 00 33 157021055 for callers outside France and 0800 800812 for inside France .
This is the first major incident in Brazilian air space since a Tam flight crashed in Sao Paulo in July 2007 killing 199 people .

Updated : Rep. Eric Massa ( D - Corning ) today introduced legislation that would force Internet Service Providers that want to implement usage - based pricing plans to go through several regulatory hurdles , including public hearings , to determine if such pricing is anti-competitive .
Such usage - based plans may involve tiered pricing or caps based on the amount of data downloaded .
Massa is one of the two New York congressmen who spoke out strongly against efforts by Time Warner Cable ( s twc ) to expand its tiered billing trials .
Under its plan , announced March 31 , residential customers in five cities would have paid a different price based on the amount of data downloaded each month .
However , a little more than two weeks after it was proposed , the trials were canceled after the public and members of Congress protested .
AT&T ( s T ) has a similar trial underway in Beaumont , Texas and in Reno , Nev.
We have argued that such caps deter innovation by raising the cost of broadband , and are the result of a lack of real competition in many U.S. broadband markets .
Massa ’s legislation , known as the Broadband Internet Fairness Act ( HR 2902 ) , seeks to get public input and regulatory approval through the Federal Trade Commission before an ISP can implement a usage - based pricing plan .
On a conference call with reporters today , Massa said he chose to funnel the process through the FTC rather than the Federal Communications Commission because the FTC has experience dealing with competitive issues .
Specifically , the bill :
Requires ISPs to submit plans to the FTC , in consultation with the FCC , if they plan to move to a usage - based plan ;
Prohibits volume usage plans if the FTC determines that these plans are imposing rates , terms , and conditions that are unreasonable or discriminatory ;
Sets up public hearings for plans submitted to the FTC for public review and input ;
Only affects Internet providers with 2 million or more subscribers ;
Imposes penalties for broadband ISPs that ignore these rules .
Massa also said that if an ISP wants to charge extra fees on a per - gigabyte basis , they should have to undergo a process similar to that of utilities , which are required to get regulatory approval .
Joining Massa on the call were Ben Scott , policy director at the Free Press , an Internet advocacy group , and Phillip Dampier , founder of the web site StoptheCap , which was founded last summer to protest usage - base pricing .
I ’ve reached out to major ISPs for their perspective on the bill , and will update the story as needed .
So far Comcast ( s cmcsa ) has referred questions to the National Cable and Telecommunications Association , which has declined to comment .
Update :
An AT&T spokesman said via email such a bill , “ advocates for a radical and unprecedented government mandate that will demand that consumers have only one all - you - can - eat pricing model for Internet services . ”
In AT&T ’s view , such a model forces those who do n’t use the Internet often to subsidize heavy users who take up almost half of the capacity on AT&T ’s network .
“ In their zeal to protect high - volume users Free Press is abandoning the vast majority of consumers who use the Internet in a more moderate fashion , ” said AT&T ’s statement .
We ’ve heard this argument before .
IS A nuclear explosion ever good news ?
Well , the test in North Korea this week might just be something to celebrate .
Hard to swallow , perhaps : the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) is tottering , countries all over the world are acquiring nuclear technology , and Iran is enriching uranium .
So North Korea tests a second nuclear bomb , and this is a good thing ?
In a way , yes .
For one thing , it was an unmissable reminder that we need to call off the new nuclear arms race that is developing .
And paradoxically it was also a bang - up demonstration that we have technology that might …

Update : The House on Friday passed the Waxman - Markey bill , 219 to 212 .
The story below was written ahead of that vote , but its focus on how environmental groups hope to improve the bill in the Senate remains timely .
Environmental groups are downplaying hopes that their allies in Congress will be able to strengthen the American Clean Energy and Security Act once the House begins debate on the bill later this week , though some officials from climate action groups remain optimistic that the bill can be strengthened later in the legislative process .
Kate Sheppard / GristThe key concern for the environmental community is the deal worked out this week between the bill ’s authors , Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) and Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) , and Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson ( D - Minn. ) , who had threatened to torpedo the bill if his demands on a range of farm - state issues were n’t met .
Even though concessions made to Peterson drew fire from many green groups , the precarious nature of the Waxman - Markey compromise has most environmental groups wary of trying to overhaul the bill during the House debate .
“ It does n’t feel likely that there will be opportunities to offer amendments on the floor that are going to be the big fixes , ” said Navin Nayak , director of the Global Warming Project at the League of Conservation Voters .
“ At this point , it ’s more about meeting the deadline that they ’ve set for the end of this week . ”
Most of the big environmental organizations , including the League of Conservation Voters , Sierra Club , National Wildlife Federation , and Environmental Defense Fund , are holding to the “ strengthen and pass ” motto .
Sierra Club Energy and Global Warming Program Director David Hamilton told Grist he thinks that the bill will be amended to encourage more government purchasing of renewable energy .
Hamilton said Waxman and Markey asked for suggestions on how to improve it without threatening the fragile compromise with Peterson .
“ They said give us things that wo n’t screw up the deal , but be creative about where you get them , ” he said .
What can be done ?
The biggest flaws environmental organizations have identified in Waxman - Markey include the removal of the EPA ’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act , the grandfathering of old coal - fired power plants in the initial years of the cap - and - trade program , and the delay in considering the climate impacts of indirect land use in biofuel production , among others .
Sierra Club ’s Hamilton , like many others in the environmental community , said he is not expecting there to be too much room for improvement in this week ’s debate .
Amendments can be submitted up until 9:30 a.m. on Thursday , but the Rules Committee — consulting closely with House leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Waxman , and Markey — gets to decide which amendments get a vote .
Due to the tenuous nature of the deal Democrats have forged , it ’s unlikely that the Democratic leadership would permit amendments that could jeopardize the deal .
They will likely , however , permit minor strengthening amendments to please more progressive members and to prevent floor debate from being limited to only Republican amendments .
“ I think there is minimal opportunity for strengthening on the House floor , ” said Hamilton .
LCV ’s Nayak said the Democrats ’ tight hold on how the House debate will unfold means there will be few opportunities for opponents to weaken the legislation .
“ A lot of the deals that have been cut have chipped away at it already , ” said Nayak .
“ So I think there ’s hope that some of the big weakening issues … will be avoided . ”
Both Nayak and Hamilton stressed the importance that passing Waxman - Markey this week will play in creating additional opportunities for improvement .
“ We believe if we ’re going to have a chance to strengthen the bill , you ’ve got to get it through the House , ” said Hamilton .
Hamilton said his group is already in discussions with the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , under the leadership of Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) .
“ We ’re trying to figure out what are the most strategic ways to plug what we see as holes in this thing without completely scotching the deal that Waxman came up with , ” said Hamilton .
Boxer has said that her committee will produce a climate bill by the end of August that would serve as the Senate counterpart to Waxman - Markey .
“ My sense is that they will use the Waxman bill as a guide , but they will not be averse to making some strategic changes where they think they are useful , ” said Hamilton of his conversations with Boxer ’s committee .
Dan Lashof , director of the Climate Center at the Natural Resources Defense Council , echoed similar optimism about the Senate ’s likely approach .
“ The dynamic there is a little different .
because the committee is very friendly to this , ” he said , comparing it to the House ’s Energy and Commerce Committee , which includes more lawmakers from rural and energy - producing districts .
“ We can fix some problems in the House bill in committee . ”
The chief threat to Boxer ’s approach comes from the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , which last week approved a bill that had environmental groups cringing .

A UN agency has published a comprehensive report on the worldwide illicit drugs market , the World Drug Report 2009 .
The graphs and maps below show the extent of the problem and measures to tackle it .
DRUGS AND CRIME
Some argue that strict controls have created a thriving black market that breeds violence and corruption .
In the report 's preface , UNODC Executive Director Antonio Maria Costa calls for greater investment in drug treatment and crime control .
He says legalising drugs would be " an historic mistake " as a free market would spark a drug epidemic .
" Societies should not have to choose between protecting public health or public security : they can and should do both . "
GLOBAL USE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE Cannabis Cocaine 1 . Cannabis 2 . Cocaine Cannabis is still the most widely produced and used drug in the world .
It is also a drug that is increasing in potency , according to the World Drugs Report .
It says that in the last decade , the amount of THC ( the main psychoactive substance in cannabis ) found in plants from North America grown using the latest techniques has almost doubled .
The World Drugs Report shows consumption of both cannabis and cocaine , at least in the western world , remains steady or is in decline .
In the last decade , cocaine use in the USA among 10th and 12th grade high school students fell by 40 % and 30 % .
In Spain , Europe 's largest cocaine market , annual prevalence of cocaine among secondary school students fell from 7.2 % in 2004 to 4.1 % in 2006 .
The picture is less clear in developing countries where data is limited .
Use of amphetamines , methamphetamine and ecstasy has levelled off in developed countries but production and consumption in developing countries may be growing .
TRAFFICKING
Routes shown are general indications of illicit drug routes .
They are not intended to show exact routes .
Most of the world 's supply of cocaine comes from South America ( 1 ) .
Venezuela is one of the main departure points for illicit drug consignments leaving the region .
Drugs are flown or shipped to West Africa in shipping containers , small boats , or private and commercial aircraft .
West Africa has become a major hub for smuggling South American cocaine into Europe ( 2 ) as British and American anti-drug efforts have curtailed the use of traditional smuggling routes .
In West Africa ( 3 ) the drugs are stockpiled and prepared for transport into Europe by South American , European and local drugs gangs .
The drugs are smuggled to Europe ( 4 ) by shipping container , overland , airfreight or on commercial passenger flights using " mules " via West and East Africa .
THE WAR ON DRUGS Police forces around the world continue to crack down on drug trafficking .
Click on the buttons below to see global seizures of different drugs .
Cannabis herb Cannabis resin Heroin Opium 1 . Cannabis herb 2 . Cannabis resin 3 . Heroin 4 . Opium
In 2007 Iran made by far the highest number of seizures of opium - 84 % of the world 's total .
It also tops the list of countries seizing heroin - 28 % of the global total - followed by Pakistan ( 15 % ) , Turkey ( 15 % ) and Afghanistan ( 11 % ) .
Mexico , USA and Bolivia top the list of cannabis herb seizures .
One of the main recommendations made in the World Drugs Report was greater efficiency in law enforcement by focusing more on the small number of high profile , high volume and violent drug traffickers instead of the large numbers of petty offenders .

The XBMC project , which develops a popular open source media center application , announced the release of a major new version last week .
XBMC 9.04 , which is codenamed Babylon , delivers improved codec compatibility , an enhanced theming system , better Linux support , and many other features .
The XBMC project has its roots in the Xbox Media Player , an MPlayer - based media application that was originally designed for the Xbox video game console .
XBMC currently uses its own playback engine that leverages FFMpeg , libdvdcss , and a number of other well - known open source multimedia libraries .
Coded primarily in C++ , it uses SDL and OpenGL for rendering .
XBMC is cross- platform compatible and will run on Linux , Mac OS X , and Windows .
The project is now on a six - month release cycle , which loosely mirrors that of the Ubuntu Linux distribution .
The previous version , which was codenamed Atlantis , was released in November .
XBMC can play an extremely broad assortment of common codecs and media formats .
It also has extensive support for network streaming using a wide range of protocols .
It provides a rich theming system — which got many improvements in the latest version — and a plugin framework that allows third - party developers to customize the application using Python scripts .
I 've been running XBMC 9.04 since the beta release was made available last month .
The new version is highly polished and stable .
I have tested it on a Windows XP desktop system , a Mac Mini with OS X Leopard , and an Ubuntu - powered Neuros LINK .
It performs well and was able to play high - definition video reasonably on all three computers .
I streamed video content from my network storage device and tested several Web - based streaming video services .
XBMC 's plugin manager allows users to add new features to the program by downloading third - party scripts from the Internet .
These scripts can augment the program 's behavior in any number of ways , such as adding support for additional streaming media sources .
For example , one of the plugins allows users to stream fansubs of the popular Bleach anime series .
There are several nifty improvements in XBMC 9.04 for Linux users .
Hardware accelerated video decoding is now supported on Linux systems that have NVidia graphics cards .
The Linux version also gained a D - Bus interface that is compatible with the Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification .
This will enable external scripts and tools to programmatically control XBMC via the D - Bus interprocess communication system .
This version also introduces support for PulseAudio , a modern Linux sound server ( yes , that means you no longer have to kill off the PA process before you run XBMC on Linux ) .
XBMC vs. Boxee
XBMC is increasingly being displaced by Boxee , a popular XBMC derivative .
Boxee offers a simpler and more streamlined user interface , improved support for Web streaming services , integrated social networking features , and a built - in BitTorrent client .
Boxee 's enhancements are compelling , but the new version of XBMC is still relevant for a number of reasons .
XBMC is more robust , especially on the Linux platform .
XBMC 's library manager and network playback features also seem a bit more reliable in some cases .
XBMC and Boxee have subtly different approaches to user interface design .
XBMC's PM3 : HD skin is very slick , appealing , and functional , but navigating around the menus can sometimes feel cumbersome .
It 's cross - style playback control interface feels especially clumsy to me .
Boxee 's user interface offers less aesthetic grace , but it 's more intuitive and consistent with conventional media player UI paradigms .
On Windows , where Boxee is not yet publicly available , XBMC provides a pretty solid alternative to Windows Media Center .
XBMC and Boxee do not , however , have built - in DVR capabilities .
Users who require recording features will likely prefer Windows Media Center or MythTV .
XBMC delivers a top - notch multimedia experience , an impressive level of extensibility , and a lot of nice platform - specific integration features on each of the supported operating systems .
The new release is another step forward for the project and it brings some nice improvements and additional polish .
Too Embarrassing to Disclose ?
President Obama 's approach to government transparency is disturbingly opaque in places , particularly when it comes to disclosing information about the Bush administration 's torture legacy .
To his credit , Obama in mid-April released a handful of Justice Department memos that authorized and itemized extraordinary brutality .
But a month later , he decided to block the release of more photos depicting detainee abuse by the military .
And now , Obama 's CIA director is arguing against the release of details about the torture of Abu Zubaydah in a secret prison -- details that would not only vividly expose precisely what the government did in our name , but could also go a long way to revealing the motives of the torturers , the copious guidance they received from the White House , and how ineffective and counterproductive their methods turned out to be .
In his May 21 national security address , Obama vowed that he would " not protect information merely because it reveals the violation of a law or embarrassment to the government . "
But what 's emerging is an exception to the rule .
The Obama administration apparently wo n't hide things from the public just because they 're embarrassing -- unless they 're really , really embarrassing .
Here 's how the ACLU 's Jameel Jaffer , in an interview with The Washington Post yesterday , described the principle underlying the CIA 's assertion : " [ T ] he greater the abuse , the more important it is that it should remain secret . "
R. Jeffrey Smith writes in The Washington Post :
The Obama administration objected yesterday to the release of certain Bush - era documents that detail the videotaped interrogations of CIA detainees , arguing to a federal judge that doing so would endanger national security and benefit al - Qaeda recruitment .
In a pointed affidavit , CIA Director Leon E. Panetta told a federal judge in New York that records describing the contents of the videotapes , which the CIA said it destroyed in 2005 , and other documents containing what he called " sensitive operational information " about the interrogations , were properly classified .
Their forced disclosure to the American Civil Liberties Union " could be expected to result in exceptionally grave damage to the national security by informing our enemies of what we knew about them , and when , and in some instances , how we obtained the intelligence we possessed , " Panetta argued ....
He said that while the memos discussed harsh interrogation " in the abstract , " the CIA information was " of a qualitatively different nature " because it described the interrogation techniques " as applied in actual operations . " ...
He also submitted a classified statement to the court that he said explains why detainees could use the contents to hide information in the future , even though Obama has promised that the United States will not use the harsh interrogation techniques again .
Here , via blogger Marcy Wheeler , is Panetta 's full declaration .
He explains that the majority of the documents being requested consist of top secret cables sent to and from the CIA secret prison where Zubaydah -- the first detainee tortured by the CIA -- was being held .
These Top Secret communications consist primarily of sensitive intelligence and operational information concerning Abu Zubaydah .
Drafted during the timeframe the interrogations were being conducted , these communications are the most contemporaneous documents the CIA possesses concerning these interrogations .
In addition to these Top Secret communications , there are also a small number of miscellaneous documents , which include the notes of CIA employees who reviewed the 92 videotoapes before they were destroyed , logbooks containing details of the interrogations , and a photograph .
His central argument :
[ D] isclosure of explicit details of specific interrogations where EITs were applied would provide al - Qa'ida with propaganda it could use to recruit and raise funds ...
Information concerning the details of the EITs being applied would provide ready - made ammuntion for al - Qa'ida propaganda .
The resultant damage to the national security would likely be exceptionally grave .
To which I have only one thing to say : the CIA should have thought of all this a long time ago -- ideally , before they embarked on actions whose disclosure alone would be enough to incite our enemies .
And here is Panetta 's credibility - sapping finish :
[ M ]y determinations ... are in no way driven by a desire to prevent embarrassment for the U.S. government or the CIA , or to suppress evidence of any unlawful conduct .
My sole purpose is to prevent the exceptionally grave damage to the national security reasonably likely to occur from public disclosure of any portion of these documents , and to protect intelligence sources and methods .
The cable traffic , the logbooks and the written reports about the destroyed videotapes would give the American public a much better and more definitive view of not just what was going on in these CIA prisons , but where the pressure was really coming from to abandon tried - and - true interogation methods in favor of brutality .
Just a few weeks ago , for instance , NPR's Ari Shapiro reported that on a nearly daily basis in mid-2002 , a CIA contractor would " write a top - secret cable to the CIA 's counterterrorism center " requesting permission for various techniques to be used on Zubaydah .
The CIA , Shapiro reported , " would then forward the request to the White House , where White House counsel Alberto Gonzales would sign off on the technique . "
It was n't until months later , on August 1 , 2002 , that the Justice Department issued its official authorization .
Comparing what was said in the cables to what the Justice Department lawyers presented as fact in their memos would also be telling .
But , as I wrote last month , the president who came into office promising to restore our international reputation and return responsibility to government now seems to be buying into the belief that covering up our sins is better than coming clean .

What it is : Vertical Friction Stir Welder
What it 's used for : Joining pieces of spacecraft with friction instead of blowtorches .
Gas metal arc welding is fine if you just want a truck 's bumper to stay put for a few hundred thousand miles .
But if you 're building an Ares I rocket — the craft that will shuttle astronauts to the moon and beyond starting in 2020 — you 'll need a more sophisticated technique : stir welding .
Ares I will be made from aluminum - lithium 2195 , an ultralight , ultrastrong alloy that 's nearly impossible to weld using traditional fusion methods , because melting can create small pores that weaken the metal .
Stir welding plunges a rapidly rotating pin about the size of a pencil into the joint between two panels with more than 5,000 pounds of force per square inch ; the friction makes the alloy pliable , and the rotation forces grains of metal to mingle behind the pin as it crawls up the joint .
The resulting welds are strong , defect - free , and actually shave material ( and weight ) from the craft rather than leaving a bulky seam .
NASA 's vertical spaceship - fusing welder stands 35 feet high , weighs 60 tons , and typically requires up to six operators .
Luckily , the space agency has a pretty big workshop .

Agnes Guillot dreams of one day seeing a giant 50 - centimetre ( 20 - inch ) - long white rat called Psikharpax scuttling fearlessly around her lab .
If so , it will be time to scream ... but out of joy , rather than fear , for it could be a turning point in the history of robotics .
Psikharpax -- named after a cunning king of the rats , according to a tale attributed to Homer -- is the brainchild of European researchers who believe it may push back a frontier in artificial intelligence .
Scientists have strived for decades to make a robot that can do some more than make repetitive , programmed gestures .
These are fine for making cars or amusing small children , but are of little help in the real world .
One of the biggest obstacles is learning ability .
Without the smarts to figure out dangers and opportunities , a robot is helpless without human intervention .
" The autonomy of robots today is similar to that of an insect , " snorts Guillot , a researcher at France 's Institute for Intelligent Systems and Robotics ( ISIR ) , one of the " Psikharpax " team .
Such failures mean it is time to change tack , argue some roboticist .
Rather than try to replicate human intelligence , in all its furious complexities and higher levels of language and reasoning , it would be better to start at the bottom and figure out simpler abilities that humans share with other animals , they say .
These include navigating , seeking food and avoiding dangers .
And , for this job , there can be no better inspiration than the rat , which has lived cheek - by - whisker with humans since Homo sapiens took his first steps .
" The rat is the animal that scientists know best , and the structure of its brain is similar to that of humans , " says Steve Nguyen , a doctoral student at ISIR , who helped show off Psikharpax at a research and innovation fair in Paris last week .
Rat robots are being built in other labs in Britain , the United States and elsewhere .
Two years ago , for instance , a team at the ITAM technical institute in Mexico City reprogrammed a Sony Aibo dog using rat - simulated sofware .
But the European researchers believe that Psikharpax is unique in its biomimickry , sophistication of sensors and controls and software based on rat neurology .
Their artificial rodent has two cameras for eyes , two microphones for ears and tiny wheels , driven by a battery - powered motor , to provide movement .
A couple of dozen whiskers measuring around a dozen centimetres ( four inches ) stretch out impressively either side of its long , pointed snout .
The patented " vibrissae " seek to replicate a key part of the nervous system in a real - life rat , where whiskers are used to sense obstacles .
Data from these artificial organs goes to Psikharpax 's " brain , " a chip whose software hierarchy mimicks the structures in a rat 's brain that process and analyse what is seen , heard and sensed .
For instance , if Psikharpax 's eyes sense that it is dark , the software gives a greater weight of importance to data from the whiskers , in the same way that a rat , at night , relies on other sensors to compensate for loss of vision .
But one famous rat quality -- the power of smell -- is not incorporated in Psikharpax .
An artificial nose was originally included in the scheme , conceived by roboticist Jean - Arcady Meyer , but proved too complex in practice .
The goal is to get Psikharpax to be able to " survive " in new environments .
It would be able to spot and move around things in its way , detect when it is in danger from collision with a human in its vicinity and spot an opportunity for " feeding " -- recharging its battery at power points placed around the lab .
" We want to make robots that are able to look after themselves and depend on humans as least as possible , " said Guillot .
" If we want to send a robot to Mars , or help someone in a flat that we do n't know , the robot has to have the ability to figure out things out for itself . "

There plenty of people who hang on to their vinyl for dear life .
Trying to capitalize on this trend is “ Linos ” , a portable record player .
The Linos dispenses with the platter entirely , choosing to focus on mobility and size .
You just load the record to the lower element and lock it into place from above .
When you press the power button , it releases the tonearm and starts spinning the record .
The Linos uses a micro ISB connector to hook up to your computer for sound an power , or you can use the included adapter to plug into a regular stereo jack .

I 'm primarily a visual observer , so I usually sketch my observations .
The attached image is a drawing of the comet based on my observation this morning ( Jan 9 , 2009 - 13:00 UT ) .
I drove northeast of Flagstaff to Sunset Crater National Monument and arrived there shortly after 5 am with the moon blazing away and lighting up the snow - covered landscape .
The head of Scorpius was rising , and Antares was flickering with a rusty light just over the tops of the cinder cones .
While the sky was still bright with moonlight , I shot a few photos of the landscape , and then set up my 8 inch Dobsonian .
The comet was a snap to find at low power ( 37.5X ) and readily pierced the moon - washed star field as a round glow with a nicely condensed core .

Thinking about a vacation ?
Be sure to consider Brooksville , Florida ( pop. 8,000 ) .
In addition to everything else Brooksville has to offer — three city parks , a nine - hole golf course , and " an excellent library " —
Brooksville can now assure visitors that each and every one of its city employees will be wearing underwear while on duty .
The city council of Brooksville , located about 45 miles north of Tampa , voted recently to overhaul its personnel policies , and as part of that it approved a new dress code .
After consulting with " a number of sources , " city officials and attorneys came up with a series of guidelines that they hope will improve the government 's " public image . "
Some idea of the government 's current public image might be gleaned from what they felt it necessary to have the new code deal with :
underwear is now required ;
employees must use deodorant ;
no halter tops or Spandex at work ;
no skirts worn " below the waistline " ;
no other clothing that may be " distracting , offensive or revealing " ;
only ears may be visibly pierced ; and , perhaps most disturbingly ,
all cuts or wounds must now be covered .
There 's your new tourism slogan : " Come to Brooksville : We 've Covered Our Wounds ! "
Fighting for the great American tradition of going commando at work was the city mayor , Joe Bernardini , who was the only member of the council to vote against underwear .
He expressed concern over how the new code could be enforced , while also getting a headstart on being charged with harassment : " They said you had to wear undergarments , " the mayor was quoted as saying , " but who 's going to be the judge of that ?
Sometimes when it comes to certain people going bra-less , it 's obvious .
[ Emphasis added . ]
But who 's staring to see if that person does n't have underwear on ? "
Well , probably everybody will be now , Mr. Mayor .
I would advise " certain people " to show up in a burqa for a while .
This is apparently the second time the Brooksville council has tried to establish a dress code .
The first time was in 1996 , after sexual harassment allegations were leveled against the man who was then the city manager .
That code 's sponsor , though , appeared to blame the harassee and her attire for the incident , saying : " Men have it hard enough just to do a day 's work and not be enticed by a woman who is not dressed properly . . . .
If you have to bend over for the bottom file . . . that would entice any man , unless he is not completely a man . "
These truly progressive sentiments were expressed by council member Mary Staib , who was unable to get anyone to second her motion at the time .
Now , at last , the men of Brooksville will have some protection from sexual enticement .
Still , you might want to put those files on the top shelf .
Just to be safe .

Ford appears set to accelerate comeback

Only a few years ago things looked grim for Ford .
Heavily invested in trucks and SUVs , the company got hit hard when gas prices shot up and its sales plummeted .
But after taking huge financial gambles to stay afloat , finding success with cars like the midsize Fusion and unveiling more fuel - efficient technologies , Ford may be back in the game , analysts say .
While in Houston on Thursday , Mark Fields , Ford ’s president of the Americas , said the company is “ by no means waving the victory flag , ” but it has come a long way in little time and in position to do better .
Like other automakers , Ford is going through one of the worst auto market downturns ever , but he said the company has been making the right moves to emerge as a stronger automaker .
Ford is bullish on Houston , Fields said , after speaking at a Houston Forum luncheon .
The Bayou City is the third biggest market for Ford , he noted .
He is well aware that Houston and Texas are truck country .
There is a strong future for Ford trucks and SUVs , he said , but they will be lighter and more fuel efficient .
The F - Series trucks are still profitable for Ford , Fields said .
Noting that the entire industry is moving toward smaller vehicles , he said the midsize Fusion has also been a profit maker , which makes him “ feel like Ford is back in the auto business . ”
He said the company has high hopes for the redesigned 2010 Taurus , which debuts later this summer .
“ Ford is actually in a good spot right now and has an opportunity to grab market share , ” said Rebecca Lindland , director of autos group at IHS Global Insight .
“ It ’s very ironic .
We were very concerned about Ford a few years ago .
They got sick first .
All the blood , sweat and tears Chrysler and GM are going through Ford already did , ” she said .
Ford has already sold off brands it did n’t want , including Land Rover and Jaguar , and it did so at a time when it was more of a seller ’s market , Lindland said .
Like all automakers , Ford is feeling the downturn .
Ford ’s sales are down 39.4 percent this year over last , Lindland said .
General Motors sales are down 44.4 percent and Chrysler , 45.6 percent .
While Chrysler and GM have recently announced plans to cut back their dealerships , Ford has been doing its own downsizing over the past three years , Fields said
The company has downsized by about 15 percent and will continue to “ right - size ” its dealer network , particularly in large urban areas .
“ We do n’t have a magic number ” of reductions , he said .
Asked if either bailout money or bankruptcy protection gives Chrysler and GM cost benefits over Ford , he said his company has been proactive by reducing its debt and negotiating new contracts with the UAW , for example .
“ If we have to go out and do more we will , ” Fields said .

BUENOS AIRES 
The mystery of who revealed Gov. Mark Sanford ’s e-mail messages may finally be solved .
A business associate of Mr. Sanford ’s Argentine mistress said Friday that private messages between the two lovers had been sent anonymously to a South Carolina newspaper last December by an Argentine man the mistress had briefly dated .
The associate , who asked not to be identified , is a Buenos Aires television executive involved in hiring the woman , whom he identified as María Belén Chapur , a producer at the television network America from 2001 to 2002 .
Last December , the executive said , Ms. Chapur was dating a young Argentine a few months after her affair with Mr. Sanford began .
The man happened to see the e-mail messages being exchanged between the governor and Ms. Chapur , said the executive  who said he had direct knowledge of the situation  and hacked into her e-mail account to see the rest .
Infuriated , the man sent the messages to The State , the newspaper in South Carolina ’s capital , Columbia .

Spending on food and non-alcoholic beverages in 2003 resulted in almost 46,000 kilotonnes of greenhouse gases , according to the first comprehensive national estimate of food - related greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions in Canada .
This was equivalent to 6.4 % of total national GHG emissions that year .
This national estimate was the result of integrating the most recent detailed data on the structure of the economy with data on energy use and GHG emissions .
Almost one - quarter ( 23 % ) of these food - related GHG emissions was attributable to the production of fresh and frozen meat , while fish products contributed 2 % .
Beef alone accounted for 15 % of all GHG emissions resulting from household spending on food in 2003 .
Looking at the amount of energy required to produce food shows another dimension of the environmental impact of the food system .
More energy was used in the production of prepared foods than any of the other food groups , reflecting the energy inputs required for processing these foods .
Prepared foods accounted for 19 % of food - related energy use , while dairy and eggs accounted for 18 % , and fresh and frozen meat accounted for 14 % .
Farmers influence energy use through their choice of land management practices .
The proportion of land prepared for seeding using no tillage increased from 6 % of total area in 1991 to 46 % in 2006 .
The share of land under conventional tillage fell from 69 % to 28 % .
In 2006 , spending on fuel per hectare by farmers who used no tillage was about one - third that of spending by farmers who used conventional tillage .
This reduction in fuel use also reduces air pollution and GHG emissions .
People are purchasing more food and beverages than they used to .
Since 1976 , the average number of calories available per person per day has increased 9 % from 3,118 to 3,384 kilocalories .
A lot of this food is not eaten .
Waste occurs from spoilage and other losses in stores , restaurants and in the home .
In 2007 , an estimated 38 % of solid food available for retail sale was wasted , the equivalent of 183 kilograms per person .
A decrease in food waste would reduce negative environmental impacts associated with food production , processing , distribution and services .
Canadians , who represent about 0.5 % of the global population , produce about 1.5 % of the food in the world and consume about 0.6 % of world food production .
According to the Survey of Household Spending , Canadians allocated 15 % of their household income to food in 2005 , a lower proportion than in other countries .
For example , Americans allocated 16 % of their income to food , while people in France allocated 24 % and the Chinese , 41 % .
Note :
This release is based on the feature article " Food in Canada " published today in Human Activity and the Environment : Annual Statistics .
The article assesses the impact of the food system on the environment .
Data used in the section on energy and greenhouse gas emissions involved in the production of food for households were derived from Statistics Canada 's Material and Energy Flow Accounts .
These accounts integrate environmental data with economic data from Canada 's System of National Accounts .
One of the main components of the National Accounts are the input - output accounts , which produce highly detailed production and consumption statistics for 303 industries , 719 goods and services and 170 categories of final demand .

It appears that a U.S. " Cash for Clunkers " program is right around the corner now that President Obama and the U.S. House of Representatives have come to an agreement on how the bill should be structured .
However , it 's not a done - deal yet , as the legislation still needs to get through Congress .
Details remain sketchy for now , but under the proposed legislation , new car buyers trading in an older vehicle that averages 18 miles per gallon or less will qualify for a voucher that 's worth $ 3,500 if the new car gets at least 22 mpg and up to $ 4,500 if the new car manages at least ten mpg higher than the " clunker .
" Trucks would also qualify for a voucher of $ 3,500 if the new vehicle gets at least two mpg better than the old one or $ 4,500 if the new truck manages five mpg better than the trade - in .
Unlike some previous proposals , both foreign and U.S. - made models would qualify for the program .
It 's not yet clear how the bill would be funded , but it would reportedly be available for one full year and up to one million total new vehicles .

Cunning new UK technology will see British troops ' vehicles in Afghanistan protected from armour - piercing rocket warheads - by cloth .
The MoD was pleased yesterday to unveil its new TARIAN " textile based " vehicle protection system , which will see lightweight cloth attached to the sides of military vehicles in Afghan combat .
TARIAN is expected to resist strikes from RPGs * , shoulder - fired antitank rockets in common use among the Taliban .
That might seem to be impossible , as an RPG warhead can blast a hole through thick armour plate .
But in fact TARIAN , already on trial in Afghanistan , apparently works well .
That 's because it 's actually a replacement , not for armour plate , but for so - called " bar " or " slat " RPG protection .
An RPG warhead pierces heavy armour using the shaped - charge effect , in which a hollow cone of explosive - usually lined with copper - is detonated .
The effect is to form the copper into a pencil - thin slug of incredibly hot , high - velocity molten metal which can burn its way through armour which would have shrugged off an ordinary explosive charge .
But a shaped charge only works if it 's detonated at the correct stand - off distance from the surface of the armour .
This is done by having the detonator mounted ahead of the cone ; in the case of an RPG at the tip of the streamlined nose put on the end of the warhead in order to make it fly straight .
Bar armour is basically a heavy wire fence mounted a few inches out from a vehicle 's normal plating .
It 's just strong enough that hitting it makes an RPG warhead go off early .
The copper jet blasts through the flimsy cage with ease , but by the time it reaches the real armour it has spread , cooled and slowed and it can't penetrate .
While bar protection is light compared to the main plates of a fighting vehicle , however , it 's still noticeably cumbersome and reduces the load a vehicle can carry .
That 's where TARIAN comes in , replacing metal bars or slats with super - strong , tough textile .
The TARIAN cloth is stretched taut enough that it can , apparently , trigger an RPG just as well as a bar kit .
Cunning indeed - quite literally a bit of out - of - the - box thinking by Dorset firm AmSafe , TARIAN 's maker .
Provided the RPG - proof cloth is durable and reliable enough for field use - which the Afghan trials would seem to have confirmed - TARIAN should enable our boys and girls ' vehicles to carry more or have more protection elsewhere , without losing any protection . ®

Tony Blair urged Gordon Brown to hold the independent inquiry into the Iraq war in secret because he feared that he would be subjected to a " show trial " if it were opened to the public , the Observer can reveal .
The revelation that the former prime minister - who led Britain to war in March 2003 - had intervened will fuel the anger of MPs , peers , military leaders and former civil servants , who were appalled by Brown 's decision last week to order the investigation to be conducted behind closed doors .
Blair , who resisted pressure for a full public inquiry while he was prime minister , appears to have taken a deliberate decision not to express his view in person to Brown because he feared it might leak out .
Instead , messages on the issue were relayed through others to Sir Gus O'Donnell , the cabinet secretary , who conveyed them to the prime minister in the days leading up to the announcement of the inquiry last week .
A Downing Street spokesman last night said : " We have always been clear that we consulted a number of people before announcing the commencement of the inquiry , including former government figures .
We are not going to get into the nature of those discussions . "
Blair is believed to have been alarmed by the prospect of giving evidence in public and under oath about the use of intelligence and about his numerous private discussions with US President George Bush over plans for war .
A spokesman for the former Labour leader would only say last night : " This was a decision for the current prime minister , not for Tony Blair . "
The Observer reveals today that six weeks before the war , at a meeting in Washington , the two leaders were forced to contemplate alternative scenarios that might trigger a second UN resolution legitimising military action .
Bush told Blair that the US had drawn up a provocative plan " to fly U - 2 reconnaissance aircraft , painted in UN colours , over Iraq with fighter cover " .
Bush said that if Saddam fired at the planes , he would put Iraq in breach of UN resolutions and legitimise military action .
Last night , Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , whose party opposed the war from the outset , said : " If this is true about Blair demanding secrecy , it is outrageous that an inquiry into the biggest foreign policy disaster since Suez is being muzzled to suit the individual needs of the man who took us to war . "
Brown provoked uproar in the Commons on Monday when he announced the inquiry 's scope , membership and remit .
Following protests from military leaders and mandarins , including former cabinet secretary Lord Butler , he announced a partial retreat on Thursday , asking the inquiry chairman , Sir John Chilcot , to consider opening a few sessions to the public .
But the move did not ease pressure for a total climbdown .
Last night , Brown appeared cornered as MPs of all parties prepared for a Commons debate on Wednesday in which they look certain to back calls for the inquiry to hold sessions in public " whenever possible " .
A Tory motion likely to win wide cross-party backing also calls for the committee to include military experts .
The Lib Dems are demanding that it also include constitutional and legal experts to assess the legality of the invasion .
In a sign that the government is preparing to retreat , Chilcot is to meet both Clegg and the Conservative leader , David Cameron , on Tuesday , before the debate .
MPs believe that he may then announce a bigger public element to the inquiry in order to avoid the humiliation for Brown of defeat in the Commons .
Chilcot will come under pressure from both leaders to open up the inquiry .
Clegg wants a guarantee that witnesses such as Blair will give evidence under oath , while Cameron will ask if the committee can issue an interim report early next year , ahead of a likely spring election .
The Tories say that if Brown does not order a U - turn , an incoming Conservative government will " reserve the right " to widen the scope of the inquiry and increase its powers where necessary after an election .
Sir Christopher Meyer , who was the British ambassador in Washington in the run-up to the war and is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry , yesterday backed calls to make it public .
" It should be open , " he said .
" I think it should also have powers of subpoena and people should give evidence on oath .
I would be perfectly comfortable with that . "
He said the case for openness was increased because there had been " a ton of stuff " published in the US , both via official inquiries and in memoirs written by key players , making public what had previously been confidential .
" I would be perfectly happy for the whole embassy archive in Washington [ to be disclosed ] , " he added .
" I have n't got a problem with that being made available .
Things were very sensitive then , but this is 2009 . "
On his blog , Alastair Campbell , Blair 's former spin doctor , says that " on balance " he believes Brown was right to order the inquiry to be held in private .
" I can see the arguments for both sides - openness and transparency favours a public inquiry , but it may well be that the inquiry will do a better job freed from the frenzy of 24 - hour media . "
In a letter to the Observer , a group of current and former Labour MPs , headed by Alan Simpson , the chairman of Labour Against the War , demands a complete rethink .
" Neither the public nor parliament will understand how the prime minister 's ' new era of openness ' can begin with an Iraq inquiry held behind closed doors , " says the letter .

Palestinians have rejected the Israeli prime minister 's conditions for a two - state solution , saying he has " paralysed " the peace process .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , in a major policy speech , accepted the creation of a Palestinian state but only if it was demilitarised .
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas 's spokesman said his comments challenged Palestinian , Arab and US positions .
But the US said Mr Netanyahu 's stance was an " important step forward " .
In a landmark speech , weeks after US President Barack Obama urged him to agree a two - state plan , Mr Netanyahu said the Palestinians must accept Israel as a Jewish state .
He said a Palestinian state must have no army , no control of its air space and no way of smuggling in weapons .
The peace process has been moving at the speed of a tortoise .
Tonight , Netanyahu has flipped it over on its back
Saeb Erekat , Palestinian negotiator
Key excerpts of speech Send us your comments
His speech provoked anger among Palestinian officials .
Mr Abbas 's spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah said : " Netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenges the Palestinian , Arab and American positions , " Reuters news agency reported .
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the speech " closed the door to permanent status negotiations " .
" We ask the world not to be fooled by his use of the term Palestinian state because he qualified it .
" He declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel , said refugees would not be negotiated and that settlements would remain . "
Tim Franks , BBC News , Jerusalem
Benjamin Netanyahu has shifted .
He has used the word " state " , when it comes to Palestinian self - rule .
In another deeper sense , though , there has been no shift .
Mr Netanyahu 's closest aides have been saying for months that they have two over - arching pre-conditions : a public Palestinian acceptance of Israel as the nation - state of the Jewish people , and a complete demilitarisation of any future Palestinian entity .
And Mr Netanyahu tersely dismissed the US call for an end to settlement expansion : these people have to live , he said .
He described them as " pioneers " and " principled " .
This is a speech which will shore up the prime minister 's position within his right - wing coalition .
It is , whatever you think of the rights and wrongs of it , a powerful forehand deep into the back court of the Americans .
It will be fascinating to see when and how the Americans return the ball .
Mr Erekat added : " The peace process has been moving at the speed of a tortoise .
Tonight , Netanyahu has flipped it over on its back . "
In Gaza , Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri described the speech as " racist " and called on Arab nations to " form stronger opposition " towards Israel .
But the White House called the policy outline an " important step forward " , as did French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner .
A White House statement said Mr Obama " believes this solution can and must ensure both Israel 's security and the fulfilment of the Palestinians ' legitimate aspirations for a viable state , and he welcomes Prime Minister Netanyahu 's endorsement of that goal " .
The BBC's Sarah Morris in Washington says Mr Netanyahu 's comments have provided a lot of encouragement to the White House , but it is uncertain whether they will be enough given the Israeli prime minister 's refusal to budge on the issue of Jewish settlements .
The statement made no mention of Mr Netanyahu 's demilitarisation caveat .
A potential stumbling block in any future peace deal - that of settlements - also went unmentioned in the statement , our correspondent adds .
' Collision course '
In his own keynote Middle East speech in Cairo on 4 June , Mr Obama stressed that he wanted all settlement activity to stop .
But Mr Netanyahu said settlers were not " enemies of peace " and did not move from his position of backing " natural growth " in existing settlements .
Former US President Jimmy Carter warned that the US and Israeli governments would be on a " collision course " if Israeli settlement activity continued in the West Bank .
The settlers group Yesha condemned Mr Netanyahu 's speech : " We deplore that the prime minister has agreed to the creation of a demilitarised Palestinian state after he has said for years that such a state , even demilitarised , would be a threat to Israel . "

Did you know that Rockstar Energy Drink is owned by the son of Michael Savage , a hateful and bigoted friend of Fox News who is banned from entering the UK ?
The beverage company , managed by Savage ’s family , removed profiles of Savage and his wife from their web site when they started selling in Mexico .
The company ’s chairman is Savage ’s wife .
Here are just a few examples of some of the disgusting things done or said by Michael Savage :
In March 2006 , Savage drew the fire of the Roman Catholic community when he accused the Roman Catholic Church of breaking federal law by giving assistance to illegal immigrants .
On March 28 , 2006 , Savage encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags to counter a pro-illegal immigration group that had burned American flags .
On his July 5 , 2007 radio broadcast , commenting on students who were fasting in protest of Congress ’ failure to pass immigration reform legislation , Savage declared , “ I would say , let them fast until they starve to death ; then that solves the problem . ”
Savage was quoted as saying Muslims “ need deportation ” , and that adherents of Islam would do well to “ take your religion and shove it up your behind ” because “ I ’m sick of you . ”
On his show and website , Savage has countered that Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) is linked to terrorist organizations , and was an “ unindicted co-conspirator in an anti-terrorist trial ”
In June 2008 , Savage claimed that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of “ a racket ” designed to get disability payments for “ poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government .

LA JOLLA , CA — About 1.25 million neurons in the retina -- each of which views the world only through a small jagged window called a receptive field -- collectively form the seamless picture we rely on to navigate our environment .
Receptive fields fit together like pieces of a puzzle , preventing " blind spots " and excessive overlap that could blur our perception of the world , according to researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies .
In the April 7 issue of the journal Public Library of Science , Biology , the scientists say their findings suggest that the nervous system operates with higher precision than previously appreciated and that apparent irregularities in individual cells may actually be coordinated and finely tuned to make the most of the world around us .
Previously , the observed irregularities of individual receptive fields suggested that the collective visual coverage might be uneven and irregular , potentially posing a problem for high - resolution vision .
" The striking coordination we found when we examined a whole population indicated that neuronal circuits in the retina may sample the visual scene with high precision , perhaps in a manner that approaches the optimum for high - resolution vision , " says senior author E.J. Chichilnisky , Ph.D. , an associate professor in the Systems Neurobiology Laboratories .
All visual information reaching the brain is transmitted by retinal ganglion cells .
Each of the 20 or so distinct ganglion cell types is thought to transmit a complete visual image to the brain , because the receptive fields of each type form a regular lattice covering visual space .
However , within each regular lattice , the individual cells ' receptive fields have irregular and inconsistent shapes , which could potentially result in patchy coverage of the visual field .
To understand how the visual system overcomes this problem , postdoctoral researcher and first author Jeffrey L. Gauthier , Ph.D. , used a microscopic electrode array to record the activity of ganglion cells in isolated patches of retina , the tissue lining the back of the eye .
After monitoring hundreds of ganglion cells over several hours , he distinguished between different cell types based on their light response properties .
" Often people record from many cells simultaneously but they do n't know which cell belongs to which type , " says Gauthier .
Without this information , he says , he would n't have been able to observe that the receptive fields of neighboring cells of a specific type interlock , complementing each others ' irregular shapes .
" The receptive fields of all four cell types we examined were precisely coordinated , " he says , " but we saw no coordination between cells of different types , emphasizing the importance of clearly distinguishing one cell type from another when studying sensory encoding by a population of neurons . "

The Sandwich Business .
If you ’re one who enjoys working with food and interacting with people this may be the small business for you .
The Sandwich Business is about providing superior breakfast , and lunches in a convenient way to employees of all types , whether in an office environment , industrial zone , or construction site .
They all need to eat and enjoy good food .
Cost Supplies to get started
Minimal : 200.00 more or less depending on how you would like to get started .
Food Ingredients ( sandwich makings , snack , drinks , etc )
A Large Ice Chest or Two
A Basket or Cart
Multi colored plastic wrap ( decorative )
Plastic Utensils : Sporks , Forks , & Knives
Single serving condiments , such as mayonnaise , mustard , etc
Napkins
How to get started :
Getting started with this business can be as simple as making up a basket .
A variety of different types of sandwiches , deserts , chips , drinks and other various snacks .
Once you have that done it ’s simply a matter of letting people know that you are in business .
Through the years at different places I ’ve worked this service has been available in one form or another and provided an excellent convenience to myself and the other employees I ’ve worked with .
This services takes on many shapes and sixes .
The simplest being when I worked for Verizon.com a young woman who had a nice basket with a variety of items available would stop in at each department and show us the daily selection .
Without a doubt each and every day she would show up at around 10:00 and was sure to make a sale or two at each stop .
It ’s not difficult to get permission from a business owner to make your product available .
This provides a convenience to his / her employees and keeps the employee on the job site .
Most business owners and managers are more than willing to help out a small businessman .
With the sandwich service you ’ll first want to establish a route , one that will keep you on schedule .
You ’ll want to plan your route in accordance to break times at different offices and work sites .
If you ’re there everyday at about the same time , people will begin to become dependant on your service and will start to count on you being there with their daily breakfast , mid-morning snack or lunch .
It ’s imperative that you be dependable with your service .
Do n’t be afraid to ask your customers their advice about what they enjoy about your offerings and what they would like to have or not have .
This way you can begin to optimizes your offering and increase the amount you sell each day .
Do n’t forget Paula Dean of Food Network fame started her amazing career with the sandwich business .
She would prepare meals and had her sons deliver them to businesses and offices in the area .

Tips & Advice :
Consider choosing specific genres of foods to offer your customers .
In some areas Mexican food might be your biggest seller and in other areas you may consider offering a barbeque selection .
Still other areas may be more traditional .
In southern California you will go far with a slice of avocado and sprouts as an additional topping variety for sandwiches .
Be consistent and be persistant as well .
Even if you go to a office or job site two or three times without an order do n’t stop coming back .
Many customers like to see you there a few times before they will begin to order from you .
Others will order the very first time you show up .
Be fair with your pricing .
You can gain many new customers by simply being competitive with other food services .
If they can get a delicious roast beef sandwich for around the same price they would pay for a meal at some fast food place they are more likely to buy from you because your offering is more wholesome , healthier and probably tastes a lot better .
The sandwich business is an superior business to get started with and can provide years of enjoyment and satisfaction from your work .
You will have the option to grow as large as you like , have satisfied customers , new friends and more .
This business can grow to any level .
As you start to bring in an income and save for the future your sandwich business will grow with you .
Ideas for the future .
If you really enjoy working with food and have satisfied customers you can consider expanding in many ways .
At first you may grow from a simple basket of food to a delivery cart .
From there you may either grow from a cart to a lunch truck or perhaps a catering service .
As you work with customers who enjoy your food , you can let them know that you ’re offering catering services .
Someone is always getting married or having an anniversary or birthday party .
As you grow your customer base you can grow your services as well .
The skies the limit with the sandwich business !
To you success and good luck !

In March , the ever - innovating Linux Foundation announced a new program aimed at bringing the brains behind Linux together with developers - to - be in order to supply the increasing need for Linux talent .
Now the program is going online , with the first two courses set to call roll by mid-month .
The original sessions of the Linux Foundation Training Program , held at the annual Collaboration Summit , took the form of in - person , hands - on training , a method that provides students an unmatched learning opportunity , but limits the number of students the program can reach .
The addition of online courses takes the program to the students , complementing the continued on - site courses offered at Linux Foundation events , local training sessions in select U.S. cities , and by request , specialized training for corporate developers .
The first two courses , drawn from the selection of available on - site offerings , will be Essential Linux Device Driver Development Skills and Linux Kernel Debugging and Performance .
Though information on specific instructors was not immediately available , the program 's faculty includes Foundation CTO Ted Ts'o , LWN founder Jonathan Corbet , UC - Berkley 's Dr. Kevin Dankwardt , LF Technical Advisory Board member Christoph Hellwig , and software engineer Jon Loeliger .
Course outlines for both Essential Linux Device Driver Development Skills and Linux Kernel Debugging and Performance are available on the foundation 's website .
Interested students can register for the courses though the website , or request additional information .
In addition to expanding the LF Training Program , the foundation is also expanding its individual member program , offering a number of incentives , including discounts of up to 30 % on Linux Foundation events , the obligatory weekly newsletter , and one of three foundation t- shirts .
Perhaps the most compelling feature , complementing last month 's re-launch of Linux.com as a geek social networking paradise , is the option for individual members to claim an @linux.com email address — or , at least , forwarding address .
The usual variety of partner discounts are available with the $ 99 membership , including everything from 20 % off OSCON and 50 % off SCALE to $ 10 off every $ 40 spent at ThinkGeek and , obviously the best perk of all , 15 % off subscriptions to our very own Linux Journal .
Interested individual members - to - be can cough up the cash and claim their shiny new email address on the foundation 's individual membership page .
Mr Erdogan said Turkey deserved better treatment in the negotiations
Turkey has urged France and Germany to back its bid to join the EU , rejecting calls for a special partnership rather than full membership .
" We will never give up , " Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters in Brussels .
Turkey 's EU accession talks are going at a glacial pace and risk suspension if Ankara fails to open its ports and airports to Cyprus this year .
France and Germany want to give Turkey a " privileged partnership " with the EU .
But Mr Erdogan insisted " our goal is full membership " .
He also said it was " populist and wrong " to use Turkey 's bid as an election issue .
Some right - wing parties opposed to Turkey 's bid made gains in the recent European Parliament elections .
Slow progress
The BBC's Oana Lungescu says both opposition inside the EU and insufficient democratic reforms in Turkey are hampering its bid .
Next week will see a small step forward , when Turkey is due to start talks on taxation , one of the 35 areas where it is negotiating EU entry terms .
Turkish diplomats argue that their country is of strategic importance to Europe and that its eventual accession would send a positive signal to the whole Muslim world .
So far , Turkey has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 " negotiation chapters " in the accession process , which started in October 2005 .
But eight chapters have been frozen because of Ankara 's refusal to open up its ports and airports to traffic from Cyprus , an EU member .
Turkey says it will not do this until the EU takes steps to end the Turkish Cypriot community 's economic isolation .
First litter of Lynx kittens found since 2006
Spring brought a surprise delivery from the stork : A litter of 10 lynx kittens - the first newborns documented in Colorado since 2006 , gladdening the hearts of biologists leading the charge to restore the mountain feline , as well as drawing waves of squeals from computer monitors everywhere .
( Pics )
Once native to Colorado , the threatened tuft - eared cats were wiped out by the early 1970s by logging , trapping , poisoning , and urban development .
More than 200 lynx from Alaska and Canada have been released in Colorado since 1999 , but because the population of snowshoes hares - the cats ’ main food source - has diminished over time , biologists have found no kittens in the past two years .
A total of 126 lynx kittens are known to have been born in Colorado , according to the Colorado Division of Wildlife : 16 kittens in 2003 ; 39 kittens in 2004 ; 50 kittens in 2005 ; 11 kittens in 2006 ; and now 10 kittens in 2009 .
Still unknown is the exact number of lynx currently dwelling in the state , although we can now conclusively add seven male and three female kittens to the count .
And the cuteness , it burns .

Well , it turns out that politicians have realized that in the Internet age , a good conspiracy theory can work wonders .
So why not just start one ?
You know , like ...
Do you ever wonder why some conspiracy theories , no matter how dumb they sound , seem to never die ?
Where do these things come from , anyway ?
5 Barack Obama 's Citizenship
The Theory :
Barack Obama is n't a natural born citizen of the United States and so legally cannot be president .
He was n't actually born in Hawaii and the Government is concealing this fact by refusing to release his Birth Certificate ( or releasing a forgery ) .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Who 's to Blame :
World Net Daily .
This one started spreading through chain e-mails during the recent Democratic primaries , when office workers the world over were reading about how Barack Obama could n't be president ( in - between learning how to increase the size of their penis for pennies a day ) .
For some strange reason nobody seemed very concerned about his citizenship when he was a mere Senator , but that was probably just an oversight on the part of the rigorous journalists and fact - checkers who create chain e-mails .
What are you pointing to ?
Space ?
Are you secretly from space , Barack Obama ?!?
However , it was n't until the idea escaped the confines of the Internet and forced its way into the mainstream media that it truly emerged as a full blown conspiracy theory .
This was in large part thanks to WorldNetDaily , an ultraconservative news site that was the first major media outlet to report the idea .
After that , WND columnists brought the theory to radio talk shows , and then it spread to FOX News and other TV outlets , snowballing from a series of e-mails into a national talking point .

So , Why do People " Believe " It ?
Despite the overwhelming physical evidence ( the Obama campaign did in fact produce a copy of his birth certificate , and others even dug up the local Hawaiian newspaper from 1961 that has the Obama family birth announcement ) , it was promoted quite heavily by some Conservative commentators right up to Election Day and lives on in places like the Free Republic forums to this very day .
After all , you already had a guy with a foreign - sounding name , so what better way to influence a Presidential election than by suggesting the candidate is about as American as borscht ?
Now that Obama has been elected and the Supreme Court has shot down legal challenges regarding his citizenship multiple times , the vast majority of political commentators quickly let this one die .
A few committed critics of Obama still cling to it , though .

After all , conspiracy theories never really die , they just wait for people to forget the evidence against it and bring it up later ( hell , they 've kept the JFK assassination conspiracy theory alive for 46 years ) .
Right up until the day Obama leaves office , there will be a pocket of those who hold out hope that one day a birth certificate will emerge that shows Obama was born in the mountains of Pakistan from the womb of Satan , and then he 'll be forced to flee the White House , revealed to the world as the gay communist Islamofascist terrorist they 've always known him to be .

The Particular Problem of Libraries
We need to tell developers using the library about the correct way to use the library at runtime .
We need to tell administrators of systems using the library about the status of the library and tasks they may need to perform to keep it functioning well .
( Clear your caches , restart the server , install a security update ... )
We also need to provide administrators with information they can mine for statistics about how the library is performing ; how many requests handled , where its resources are going , etc .
We need to notify users of applications using the library about things that the library is doing which may be relevant to them .
( A new message has arrived , a new printer is available ... obviously this depends heavily on what the library does . )
Type of Information by Type of Audience
Developers , Developers , Developers
warnings
allowed developers to declare somewhere what code they are working on and what code they are just using
recorded relevant warnings to a log file which was optimized , perhaps with an associated tool , for locating and removing the sources of the warnings
allowed end -users to easily communicate their warning data to developers without inundating them with irrelevant noise while using the application
Administrators
preserved structured data in an analysis - friendly format , rather than formatting it in human readable messages .
( For most UNIX admins , I imagine some kind of structured text would be best , so " grep " would still work but more advanced tools could also be brought to bear .
I 'm not sure what the tools in the Windows world look like .
The " Event Viewer " looks like maybe it's a step in the right direction , but its UI is incredibly primitive . )
provided easily - accessible hooks for dispatching different types of events to ad - hoc code to wire up to existing notification systems - without significantly altering the behavior of the system doing the logging , if the logging hooks were broken , as admin - written code tends to be a bit flaky
significantly altering the behavior of the system doing the logging , if the logging hooks were broken , as admin- written code tends to be a bit flaky included an enumerated list of events which administrators could inspect before they happened to run across them in log files
Desktop Users
for desktop applications , a mini-email interface , which records notifications in a scrolling list so that users can inspect notifications that occur while they 're away .
for web applications , a standard API so that multiple applications on a single site ( or even , potentially , on different sites ) can drop notifications into a queue which can be displayed appropriately .
( Since websites tend to have strong preferences to control their own design , an actual standard widget might not be possible , but it would be nice . )
for both of these , a standard protocol which would enable notifications to be easily streamed to different computers or mobile devices without needing to reconfigure
a specific classification of messages at the API level , saying , " I want to tell the end - user about this " .
Messages about crashes , etc , should be displayed as an option to send information to the developer .
In the context of a web application this can be done automatically and silently ; in a desktop app there would need to be some channel set up for sending that information .
Appendix A : Optimization and Dynamic Instrumentation
What Can Do This ?
Alternate Titles : ororSometimes , when writing a program , you feel compelled to make the program emit some output which is peripheral to its operation .
The question is - who wants to know about that information ?
Maybe you 're debugging the program , and you insert a simple ' print ' statement to get some information about it .
Maybe your program is a network server , and you are recording the fact that a message was received and processed .
Maybe you 're maintaining an old library routine , and you want it to emit a message that points to a newer , better version of that routine which is now preferred .
Finally , regardless of what kind of program you 're writing , maybe it has produced an error that a user or administrator will need to deal with , and you would like to show it to them .
This activity is referred to in several different contexts depending on how the messages are delivered , but it is most commonly known as " logging " .
It is critical to the operation of many , many different kinds of programs .
Unfortunately , it is one of the most poorly - understood and poorly - implemented areas of software in general .
Software is a veritable cornucopia of poorly - understood and poorly - implemented ideas , so that 's really saying something .
You can see some of the more hilarious and visible examples of developers getting this wrong in the " Pop - Up Potpourri " series on the Daily WTF .
It might seem odd that I lump together funny dialog boxes with " logging " .
A dialog box is a little square on your screen ; a log message is some text in a file somewhere .
But they are very much the same thing , and they fail in very much the same way .
Log files just do it less visibly .
The point that I hope to communicate here is that for every producer of information , there is a consumer .
When most programmers need to produce a " log message " , however , they are thinking only of getting the information out of their program in some format , format ; not how that information is going to be used later .
When I say " most programmers " , I most definitely include myself .
I 'm probably guiltier than most .
one of the reasons I 'm writing about this in the first place is to work out some better approaches to the problem .
Consider this output from the " tomboy " desktop sticky - notes program on Ubuntu Hardy .
If I start it from the command - line , I see this :
It goes on for several hundred more lines just at startup , and continues to produce messages as the program runs .
These messages are diligently classified into categories : DEBUG and INFO .
I 'm sure they 're useful to someone .
But why am I seeing them ?
I just wanted to start a program to put some sticky notes on my desktop , and none of this information is useful to that task .
I have to imagine that pretty much all of these messages are useful only to Tomboy 's developers .
But , worse than the fact that I see them is the fact that if something really interesting happened — I discovered a critical bug , let 's say — all of that log output which is being splatted onto my screen is going nowhere .
It is a book written on water .
( Well , a book written on video memory , which is pretty much the same thing . )
Meanwhile , thanks to the bug- reporting facilities in Ubuntu , I 'm sure that I could opt to give the Tomboy developers a huge ton of mostly useless information , like the contents of my registers at the time that it crashed .
Consider not just the placement of the messages ( on my screen , where I certainly do n't care about them ) but their formatting .
Who is that elaborate right - justification of labels in the " DEBUG " output for , anyway ?
It is n't for me , I do n't want to see these messages in the first place .
I doubt it helps the developers , either ; rather than just grepping for ' [ DEBUG ] : File ' , now they need to put in a regular expression to collapse whitespace , or count the number of spaces that the justification happens to put in .
Presumably if this output is useful at all , it is useful in a search .
The right - aligned pretty - printing is a beautiful illustration of a very common anti-pattern in logging : trying to convey structured information by messing with a textual format .
A developer wanting to write a message indicating that there is a problem with the program , left with the extremely narrow confines of a logging API which just takes a string , will often do something like this :
Of course , this frantic wording does n't help the output go anywhere but silently into a log file where it will be ignored .
But , perhaps if this is some server software , an administrator will notice this message and set up an alert that makes their blackberry buzz when they notice those particular words show up in the log file so they can ssh in and look for problems .
Then the developer gets chastised by his manager for his un-informative error message , and updates it to be something clearer :
Of course this breaks the administrators ' alerts , so after much discussion between programmers and admins , log levels are added so that adminsget alerts when something " really bad " happens , where " really bad " is an agreed upon flag :
Okay .
Now we 've got a log level so admins can tell when their pagers should go off .
Except , different developers have different ideas about what " serious " means .
Clearly this is an abuse of the new " severity " flag that was added , but the cat - engineering team thinks that loss of a cat is pretty serious , so we add a new thing , a log " system " .
Most logging systems stop in this general vicinity , but we still have n't solved the problem , which is that the log message has no structure and you can't tell what 's going on without groveling around in a bunch of text files with regular expressions or manually reading each message .
Which cat was lost ?
Which phase inducer was depolarized ?
How do we get from a log message or alert to this information ?
The ' log levels ' solution to this problem is clearly untenable :
More importantly , if you 're writing a library , you have a bunch of other problems .
This diagnostic information needs to be logged somewhere , but what if this library is being used on a user 's desktop machine ?
Some of these messages are relevant to them as well .
How do you tell the user who is using a GUI that a cat has been lost ?
How do you show them the picture of Mittens so they will recognize her if they see her ?
Everyone agrees that log messages need some " small amount " of information associated with them , but very few people can agree on what that information should be .
Even at the simplest layer , the idea of a " level " , there are lots of open questions .
Is the " debug " level for a programmer trying to debug something on their test rig , or is it for administrators trying to debug something in production ?
Should there be a difference between those two things ?
How serious does a problem have to be before warranting a " critical " classification ?
Once you 're using logging code written by more than one programmer , or worse yet , more than one team , you 're going to be facing this problem .
This is , of course , my main interest , since this is where the rubber meets the road for Twisted .
Libraries need to communicate to several different audiences : Libraries , especially event - driven engines such as Twisted , libevent , and glib , have a particularly difficult time because they have to deal with all of these audiences simultaneously .
However , I think that any application or server which needs to do some kind of logging or user notification needs a subset of these features , so if any logging system could solve this problem , it could solve pretty much all logging problems .
Many languages do n't have a solution to developer communication at all .
Python has one — themodule — but it is in many ways inadequate .
The warnings module does n't easily let you selectively seelibraries you want to see warnings for .
If I 'm developing an application A using libraries M , N , and O , which themselves have dependencies on X , Y , and Z respectively , I do n't want to see warnings that M caused in X or that O caused in Z ; those are problems for the maintainers of M and O.I am maintaining only A , so I want to see warnings caused byapplication in M , N , and O .
I can try to filter specifically by module , but unfortunately theonly way of determining which library caused which issue is by directlyexamining stack depth , which is unreliable at best and misleading atworst .
Even if I could filter very accurately , it 's hard to get a stand - alone report of warnings and deal with them as they 're supposed to be .
Warnings show up to end - users as well , and to administrators looking at applications in production .
It 's worth putting up with that to have at least some solution for communication with developers , but it would certainly be better if it did n't happen .
Finally , it 's easy to generate a huge amount of warning noise ( and , especially as of Python 2.6 , many libraries do ) .
With that much noise and no reporting functionality it's hard to the warnings you care about .
A better solution for communicating for developers would be one which :
To communicate with administrators there is a huge variety of options , but many of them depend on a lot of ad - hoc hackery by the admins themselves , which means they are inconsistent and therefore there is little reusable technology or standardized APIs available .
Right now the gold standard for talking to admins seems to be just writing strings into a text file and hoping they have some facility to read it .
A better solution for communicating with administrators would be one which :
Although it 's a crappy format in many ways , the Common Log Format for HTTP might serve as a good example .
Unfortunately it 's too purpose - specific to extend to do more than what it already does , but lots of tools have been written to produce lots of interesting data from even that very simple standard .
There are two popluar cases for communicating with end -users .
One case is that you 're actually running a program on their desktop and you want to tell them something .
Another is that you 've got some code running in a web application which wants to tell them something " out of bounds " .
On the desktop , there are fairly standard " notification " APIs for popping up little bubbles .
On the web , there are emerging conventions for these notifications , like a bar that descends from the top of the page to mimic the firefox ' do you want to remember this password ? '
UI element .
A good example of this is Stack Overflow 's notification banner .
Unfortunately both of these have a problem with scale and with timing .
If your application suddenly encounters a large number of errors , it will flood the user 's screen .
If the user is n't present when a notification occurs ( or navigates away ) , the bubbles or banners may disappear .
A better way to talk to end - users would be :
Let 's not forget that administrators are users too .
Everything that happens in a server 's notification APIs should be able to be trivially filtered and redirected to administrator 's desktop machine ( or their phone ) so they can immediately notice when something has gone wrong .
This does n't fit into the " figure out what you need to say and who you need to say it to " theme of the rest of the requirements here , but it is nevertheless important .
If you make heavy use of a logging system , especially one where you have lots of messages that are logged " just in case " and rarely displayed , you will quickly discover that it 's consuming a lot of resources .
The work to calculate what goes into a log message should n't be done unless the message is actually going to be emitted .
Similarly , it should be easy to dynamically add and remove log events from particular methods or particular objects without modifying their code .
The best way to do this is to keep the logging entirely separate and add it at the level of methods and functions , rather than ad - hoc in the middle of application code .
Sometimes , of course , you want to emit log messages at a very particular point , but in general it should be easy to add instrumentation to a method without modifying its code , to avoid cluttering up application logic with lots of " just in case " debug messages .
I 'm not aware of any logging system that can already do these things .
We 'd have to write a new one .
This essay was largely composed due to my desire to understand what I thought a " good " logging system would do .
It might be too ambitious .
There are a few fundamental units which are missing from most logging systems .
While lots of logging systems have various ways to indicate subtle and nuanced levels of urgency , few have a way to indicatea message might be relevant to .
Logging systems also generally do n't have a good way to associate structured information along with a log message .
Twisted 's logging mechanism does have a free - form dictionary associated with each message , but that 's not much help unless you impose your own structure on it , which means you have to build all this infrastructure anyway .
It is , at least , possible to treat the Twisted system as a kernel which this could be based upon .
In order to produce an enumeration of events before the events are actually logged , this API will require pre-declaration of log messages .
This might be too much of a burden , since sometimes you want to just stick a log message into the middle of some code so that you can see if it happens .
So , in practice , it 's more likely that pre-declaration will need to be optional and you 'll need to be able to associate ad - hoc data and have it still be persisted along with your message .
There will need to be some way for communicating both the structured data of an event and the human - readable text associated with that event — preferably in a way which can be internationalized .
There 's also a bunch of UI , web , and protocol standardization work that would need to be done .
Luckly , that 's independent of the actual log machinery ; if it already existed it would be a trivial matter to hook it up .
In the meanwhile , something that did all of this but just used existing facilities , like the desktop notification spec , status icons and email , would still be immensely useful .
It was just a matter of time before the feeble minds of hate lost it .
Gay rights , abortion rights , and now a black President appears to be more than they can take .
Home Land Secetary hit it right on the nose .
All that 's left to wonder is what the right wing will have to say now .
Enough is enough , there is no leg to stand on here for the Republicans .
Now you have many people that are dead and we 're still not calling THESE guys terrorists .
Why not ?
Because they worship the same gods as the Republican party ?
A quick news - flash , terrorists do n't always worship the Koran , they sometimes worship the bible also .
This is the kind of stuff that happens when you have a political party who does n't operate based on facts and reality .
And on top of the fatal shooting , we have the DHS Secretary caving in and apologizing for DOING HER JOB .
Janet Napolitano deserves more than an apology .
Janet was right on the money here , and yet she is the one apologizing and taking the fall .
Pathetic .
Republican Conservatives who called for the resignation of Janet Napolitano should apologize to her right now !
It 's important to remember that DHS was one of the things Republicans opposed after 9/11 ; they KNEW their supporters were well - armed and unbalanced .
This is not just about anti-Semitism , this is about anti-whatever .
To incite and create hate by crying out anti-whatever slogans of any kind is potentially dangerous .
Just like the Dr. Tiller abortion case , this mindless attempted killing must be condemned no matter its justification .
This is the real war on terror , a war against psychological brainwashing of people as pawns to commit violence against any group of people .
The people behind this incitement and manipulation must be exposed for what they are , murderers .
Now the far right fringe is starting do physical violence on people they do not like and I wonder why they waited until B. Obama was President .
Nothing has changed except him and so now they want the country to evolve into violence which is insane to say the least .
We are all American Citizens who wants the best for ourselves through hard work and worship .
Our political system causes us to do a random walk to the end point and hopefully we all will be happy at the end of the day .
And what is Fox going to say about this one ?
The same thing they have been saying since
11/4/08 , " It 's all Obama 's fault . "
These are the kind of people that Fox News and the GOP appeal to .
The 22 million that want to make life a nightmare for the rest of the normal people .
1st the abortion doctor is a killer !
They applauded him .
Now this !
Well Fox & GOP what do you have for us next ?
The people of this country voted for change and we have gotten nothing but antagonizing input from the Republicans .
They have bashed President Obama since and before his swearing in as the 44th President .
I was n't a Bush fan and I know and remember vividly that I wanted him to succeed in his job because ithe quality of his performance was to affect my well being as a citizens .
This is nothing more than a Republican National Christians Conservative Crusade against America .
Republicans are reactive instead of proactive .
First they ignore the report on attacks on 911 , after it happened they promote the War on Terror .
Now they ignore the report on domestic terrorism and IT , too happened .
See a pattern .?
Being reactive will ALWAYS puts one in the defensive .
Meaning being attacked over and over and over again .
Who 's it hurting ?
The people ; more specifically those that work hard and just want a peaceful life .
They are already trying to blame the shooting on President Obama .
They are saying it was in reaction to his Cairo speech .
What we think and what we know is that the people in this country are in more danger from right wing terrorists than they are of any foreign terrorist .
I fear much more of this to come .
The Holocaust did n't happen overnight .
It was a result of fear of fear - mongering and manipulation over a period of years , and we are failing to learn the lessons of the past .
Not only are Jews in danger , but Muslims , immigrants , and others as well ; anyone who does n't fit into the box that a small group of sickos deem " American . "
Dissent is American , and that 's what makes us great , but when people express their dissent with guns instead of activism and the ballot box , we are all in trouble .
We all , from politicians to journalists to the American people must return to civil debate and the desire to solve the many problems we face .
Just remember , they do n't dislike you because you do n't do your job well enough .
Not because you do n't try to support your family well enough .
Not even because you have your own opinion .
Their problem is that your opinion is not THEIR opinion .
And maybe not even that , deep down under all of the politics , the mastermind behind all of this is Religion .
They dislike you because you are not religious .
Or maybe not that you 're not religious , but you are n't ' their ' religious .
When it comes right down to it , what has happened here is simple : Extremist Christian terrorists hit the US again .
Religion is the single greatest evil in the world today .
All faiths attack again .
We should do what we can to push faith out of our social conscious .
If this were done that would be one less thing around to make us different from our fellow countrymen .
It is definitely time for the U.S. to face its sordid past , it 's time to have that long awaited truth commission , time to discuss the fact that terrorism is prevelent in the nation , although we do n't have car bombs and suicide bombers yet , we need to face our problems and route out these types before we do .
Capitalism in an the effort to pit different groups against each other while those in power divide and conquer and continue to rule needs to take a hard look at itself before it 's too late .
What is up with America ?
Why is there another senseless killing ?
When will it stop .
The other day was just about the abortion doctor murder .
Now it 's hatred killing .
First the wingers criticized the DHS report , and now they have set out to prove it was 100 % correct .
Wingers are just beyond comprehension .
How many people have to die before they acknowledge that it is something much more systematic than a few looneys ?
Just about every site I ’ve designed has made use of this code block .
It utilizes a combination of JavaScript , CSS and some HTML DOM knowledge to get the job done .
Most often I use this to make dynamic menus however the uses are endless .
For this example I will use it for something more simple .

Proin dapibus mauris in dolor sagittis ut elementum purus mattis .
< br />< a href= " javascript : ; " on Click =" hideLayer ( ' more_content ' ) " >
Hide </a> </p>
At this point your page will render both paragraph blocks .
In order to hide the second by default we have to add some CSS styling .
I could have done this inline for the example however since I consider that to be bad coding practice I will create a style block for that .
p#more_content { display : none ; }
Now your second paragraph will be hidden by default and the user will have to hit the Show link in order to expand the content .
In order to make that functional you will need to add the following JavaScript code .
function hideLayer ( whichLayer ) { var menuGroup ; if ( document.getElementById ) { //
Standard method for modern browsers menuGroup = document.getElementById( whichLayer ).style ; } else if ( document.all ) { // For Old IE versions menuGroup = document.all[whichLayer ].style ; } else if ( document.layers ) { // For Netscape Navigator 4 menuGroup = document.layers[whichLayer ].style ; } menuGroup.display = " none " ; } function showLayer ( whichLayer ) { var menuGroup ; if ( document.getElementById ) { //
Standard method for modern browsers menuGroup = document.getElementById( whichLayer ).style ; } else if ( document.all ) { // For Old IE versions menuGroup = document.all[whichLayer ].style ; } else if ( document.layers ) { // For Netscape Navigator 4 menuGroup = document.layers[whichLayer ].style ; } menuGroup.display = " block " ; }
This code block could be simplified considerably by using only the getElementById ( ) method , however that will remove it ’s backwards compatibility with older browsers .
Though the percentage of users visiting with Netscape Navigator 4 or Internet Explorer 4 are extremely low , it could happen , so I have always left those extra lines in just to make sure .
You can also build on this a bit and make it one function that alternates between showing and hiding the div by changing the last line of code to menuGroup.display = menuGroup.display ? “ ” :” block ” ; .

Will Wright believes that successful games depend on a feedback cycle where designers create games and incorporate the feedback and content generated by users .
As such , the best games evolve after they ship and game companies should do a lot more to reap benefits from game usage data .
A game designer at Electronic Arts , Wright has created some of the best selling games of all time , including The Sims franchise , which has sold more than 100 million copies .
He shared some of his secrets about the process — and how to incorporate users into game design — at the Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco today in conversation with Federated Media chief executive John Battelle .
Wright acknowledged that his latest game , Spore , was n’t the blockbuster it was expected to be .
Spore is a mult - dimensional game where you could start life as a single - cell animal , evolve into a creature , grow into a tribe and planet - wide civilization , and then take over the universe .
Many people expected Spore to be one of the best - selling games of all time , given Wright ’s track record , huge publicity that included a cover story on Wired magazine , and Wright ’s seven - year journey to complete the game .
( See our interview with Wright ) .
But the game has sold in the low millions and it is n’t clear whether it will have any of the traction that The Sims did .
( A new version , The Sims 3 , will launch in June , more than nine years after the first game debuted . )
Wright said that hardcore gamers were disappointed with the lack of depth .
But Wright said EA had designed the game to be akin to a toy , which is very accessible to a broader market of consumers but is really only appealing if it taps into as the player ’s own imagination .
The game includes sophisticated tools for creating characters , so much so that the fun part of the game is playing God .
On that front , Wright believes the game was successful .
Spore players have created more than 100 million creatures , objects , and vehicles which they share with the universe of Spore players .
“ The game turns into a tool of self - expression , ” Wright said .
Spore lets you upload a video of your creature to YouTube , and it takes the uploaded creatures and uses them to populate the worlds of single - player games .
In that sense , the user - generated content makes every Spore game into a unique toy galaxy , Wright said .
To keep Spore interest high , EA is taking the assets and plans to build new Spore experiences .
Lucy Bradshaw , who heads the Maxis studio that made Spore within EA , said that the community feedback changed the company ’s plans for sequels to Spore .
EA has several Spore spin - offs coming and it is releasing an applications programming interface to access the user - generated Spore content so that others can build applications around the database .
“ Spore the game is one instance of that data set , ” Wright said .
“ The data set is the valuable part .
I do n’t want to be all - controlling on this data set .
I want it to be the nexus of the community . ”
In that sense , Battelle noted , Wright ’s beliefs about game design are consistent with the idea of Web 2.0 , where users drive the content .
Wright also acknowledged that EA was forced to listen to the community regarding its “ corporate decision ” to include digital rights management ( DRM ) on Spore , which limited how many times a user could install the game on computers .
He said EA was surprised by the outcry from angry users ( who faced problems such as unsuccessful installs that used up their installation limits ) .
EA has since rescinded the DRM by issuing a patch that essentially removes it .
“ That goes in the category of corporate learning , ” Wright said .
“ People are playing a lot of money for a game .
You do n’t want to treat them as criminals because of the piracy issue . ”
Wright says that game designers have to recognize such corporate restraints as they design their games .
They should be imaginative enough to create something innovative , but also recognize there are political hurdles to overcome in lining up corporate support , such as a marketing budget .
As for the future , Wright said that users will drive the roadmap for future versions of Spore and the Sims .
Wright said that social games are coming into their own , particularly with the launch of the Nintendo Wii , where watching your friends make fools of themselves in front of the TV with the Wii motion - sensing controller is half the fun .
That ’s a shift , he said , since designers usually focus on immersive games , where you are completely immersed in the fictional world of a game .
By contrast , the Wii has reminded everyone of the fun to be had with non-immersive games , where you are fully aware of who you ’re playing a game with .
Wright noted that user - generated worlds such as Second Life are more like platforms , not games .
And that the fun of the worlds depends on what the users do with them .
The problem that limits worlds such as Second Life is that the creation tools are so hard to use that relatively few people bother with them .
At the same time , Wright said that it would be cool to allow users to generate not only objects , but behaviors ( such as dancing characters ) , using tools that do n’t require a programmer ’s expertise .
Again , this fits with Wright ’s belief that a game designer ’s role is to spark creativity in users .
“ We ’ve been thinking about how to do that for 15 years , ” he said .
It ’s a hard problem because it requires programming knowledge .
But if one percent of the people can program and 99 percent can enjoy it , that could be a win-win . ”
The future will involve finding ways to let people get more personally and emotionally attached to games .
Wright said that people like to enhance and share their own identities through their wardrobes or cars , and that games should allow the same thing .
Wright said he is very interested in games that can intersect with the real world , such as “ augmented reality games ” that let you play games in certain locations via a mobile phone .
In such games , virtual reality combines with the real world .
Wright noted the huge appetite for alternative business models in Asia , where players can play a game for free but pay for virtual objects they collect in games .
There is a kind of “ Cambrian explosion ” of startups trying to tap such models now .
Wright says such games wo n’t kill off $ 40 retail games , but they will become part of a wide array of game types and business models that users are likely to embrace .
Not surprisingly , Wright ’s view of game design spills over into other areas .
He said said that games show a lot of promise as a way to better educate children .
Since kids love to explore game worlds , they can learn while playing them via trial and error .
Playing games thus lets children learn the scientific method that will serve them in the real world .
While games are often viewed as a waste of time , Wright said they are great at sparking imaginative fire in kids and so they can inspire children to want to learn about a subject .
“ Once you get a kid motivated , you get out of their way and they learn on their own , ” he said .

Push Back , Mr. President
Give them an inch , they 'll take a mile .
Now that President Obama has shown that he can be rolled when it comes to his commitment to transparency , the defenders of torture are shamelessly pressuring him to keep their secrets even when court rulings and common sense say otherwise .
The latest attempt -- which finds complicit CIA officials pushing Obama to renege on his administration 's pledge to release a highly critical 2004 CIA inspector general 's report -- is so blatantly self - serving that even some former CIA officials are condemning it as unjustifiable .
Stop letting them play you for a sucker , Mr. President .
Return to your principles .
Let the sunshine disinfect this wound .
The CIA inspector general 's report questioned the legality and the effectiveness of the CIA 's interrogation program and set off a massive administration review -- and , ironically , reauthorization -- of torture techniques .
Thus far , only a massively blacked - out version has been released to the public , in response to an ACLU lawsuit .
After the ACLU appealed , however , the Justice Department promised a federal judge in May that it would review the report and produce by Friday any additional material that could be released .
R. Jeffrey Smith and Joby Warrick write in The Washington Post :
The CIA is pushing the Obama administration to maintain the secrecy of significant portions of a comprehensive internal account of the agency 's interrogation program , according to two intelligence officials .
The officials say the CIA is urging the suppression of passages describing in graphic detail how the agency handled its detainees , arguing that the material could damage ongoing counterterrorism operations by laying bare sensitive intelligence procedures and methods .
So are they actually saying we do n't want our torture secrets revealed -- because we might want to do it again ?
It 's an amazing show of gall .
And , in fact , too much even for some CIA veterans to take quietly .

SALT LAKE CITY --
A state - funded study was n't able to find a link between meth exposure and officer illness , but that did n't stop the Utah Legislature from funding treatment .
Senate Republicans allotted $ 100,000 toward a Scientology - based program .
The money should be enough to put 20 police officers through the treatment which includes exercise , sauna time and antioxidants .
The Salt Lake Tribune reports the money is meant to help officers who say investigating meth labs permanently damaged their health .

WEST BROMWICH , England , July 20 ( UPI ) --
The mother of a 14 - year - old British boy who overdosed on nicotine gum blames school officials who allowed it to be handed out without parental consent .
The boy , identified as Aiden Williams of West Bromwich , England , fell ill and collapsed after chewing 105 pieces of Nicorette gum in 25 minutes , ingesting quantities of nicotine equivalent to smoking 180 Marlboro Light cigarettes , The Daily Mail reported Monday .

Aiden told authorities he had been given the gum by another student , who in turn had received it from drug counselors visiting Menzies High School Science College .
They had been in the school that morning giving out hundreds of boxes of Nicorette to pupils who smoke .
Mother Caroline Williams told The Daily Mail : " The doctors said that he could have died and he had to be kept in for 24 hours for observation .

MAY 18 -- Meet Danica Wallace and Jeremy Welch .
The Ohio couple was arrested Friday after cops spotted them having sex in a car while Wallace 's two small children were in the vehicle 's back seat .
According to a Springfield Police Department report , a copy of which you 'll find here , Wallace , 24 , was driving a Ford Taurus when she and Welch , 29 , ' pulled off the roadway to have sex . '
When police approached the vehicle , they discovered Wallace , naked from the waist down , astride a similarly pantsless Welch , who was seated in the front passenger seat .
Welch , who was ' extremely intoxicated , ' offered cops a simple explanation for the pair 's conduct : ' We got horny and just wanted to fuck !!'
Wallace , who failed a series of field sobriety tests , claimed to have only consumed a 22 - ounce bottle of Budweiser .
' I 'm not completely drunk , ' she assured police .
Wallace was charged with drunk driving , child endangerment , and possession of drug paraphernalia .
Welch was charged with public indecency .
Wallace 's children , ages four and 22 months , were turned over to a friend of hers .
Wallace and Welch are pictured here in mug shots taken at the Clark County Jail .

Sending a clear signal that it wanted to close hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries , a City Council committee Monday recommended denying requests from 28 dispensaries for exemptions from a moratorium .
The hearing left dispensary owners and their lawyers furious .
They complained that notices arrived over the weekend or not at all , speakers had just minutes to make their case , and council members spent no time weighing the testimony .
" I thought the hearings were a farce and a sham , " said Graham Berry , an attorney who spoke for 10 dispensaries .
Councilmen Ed Reyes , the chairman of the Planning Committee , and Jose Huizar sought to defuse several tense moments by explaining the process .
They pointed out it was a hearing , not a debate , noted that state law requires only 72 hours ' notice to put items on an agenda and said they had carefully reviewed the hardship exemption applications .
" What you see here today is the conclusion of a long process , " said Reyes , who had to repeatedly ask speakers to stay within their allotted time .
" The assertion that this is a sham is false . "

Advertisement New research has given credence to the idea that laughter evolved in a common ancestor of the great apes and humans .
Researchers tickled 22 young apes and three humans and acoustically analysed the laughing sounds that resulted .
Though the vocalisations varied , the team found that the patterns of changes fit with evolutionary splits in the human and ape family tree .
The research in Current Biology also suggests that gorillas and bonobos have some control over their breathing .
Primate researchers have long guessed that many of the social behaviours that are seen in humans have a basis in our primate lineage .
Studies have noted that vocalisations that some apes make while being tickled are similar to those made when they are playing , and acoustically they share some characteristics with human laughter .
" We have various findings showing that human laughter is deeply rooted in human biology , because , for example , it 's present in various cultures , in deaf and blind children , " explained Marina Davila - Ross of the University of Portsmouth , the lead author of the study .
" So there have been many claims that these vocalisations have a pre-human basis . "
Another happy experimental subject
To put the idea on a firmer footing , Dr Davila - Ross made more than 800 recordings of the tickle - induced laughter of the apes and infants .
Many of the characteristics of the actual frequencies in the recordings - such as the central and peak frequencies , and the variability of the frequencies within each laugh - were similar across all the subjects .
The differences among the subjects , however , showed how they may indicate a common ancestor .
Chimpanzees and bonobos - our closest relatives of the group tended , like the humans , to have longer series of laughs , each made up of shorter calls .
Another component is in the role that the voice plays in the sound of a laugh .
" When humans laugh , they voice stable sounds : that means the vocal folds are moving in a very regular synchronised way , " Dr Davila - Ross explained .
" We found these acoustic properties also in bonobos . "
Orangutans , by comparison , had fewer " vibration regimes " - meaning they could get fewer tones from their vocal cords .
Because the sounds of the most closely related apes matched most closely in the analysis of the laughter , the researchers believe the work is proof of laughter 's shared evolutionary origin , followed by adaptation to its form in the species we see today .
" There 's a lot of research that has been going on , but this is the first study that has conducted the phylogenetic approach to measure these acoustics and relate them to one another , " Dr Davila - Ross .

One surprising finding was that gorillas and bonobos had bouts of laughter that lasted as much as three times the length of their breathing cycle - suggesting that they exerted some control over their breathing in the process .
Robert Barton , an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Durham , called the research " fun , but not all that surprising " .
He said that there have long been suspicions of a shared evolutionary basis for laughter , in a concept researchers call homology .
" It 's widely accepted that these emotional expressions are homologous - people have looked at laughter in social contexts in terms of play faces and vocalisations , but no - one has worked specifically on tickle - induced laughter before .
" It 's certainly less surprising than the alternative , which would be that it evolved separately and independently in each group , " he told BBC News .
" What I think is the interesting question is the function of the behaviour in the different species , and whether it 's functionally the same - that would be fascinating , " he said .
Dr Davila - Ross said that the answer to that question interested her group as well , and that she is conducting further experiments to address the question .

Most people who hunted down a Palm Pre on Saturday want to actually use the thing , but Rapid Repair and iFixit immediately took the new smartphone apart to find out what 's inside .
The first component i Fixit dove into was the battery , which pops off easily in case it needs to be replaced .
Its 1150 mAh capacity is about the same as an iPhone , but iFixit reckons charge time will be slightly less because of the Pre 's background process capability .
There was only a partial charge out of the box .
The iFixit teardown artist then ran into two antennas .
Three - dimensional design makes for superior signal quality .
Getting to the keyboard , iFixit found the weight to be 32 grams , or 25 percent of the phone 's total weight .
Still , we had no complaints about the heaviness , and it's impressive that Palm packed this feature into such a compact device .
Reaching the screen , Rapid Repair noted that the LCD and capacitive touch screen are glued together .
It does n't look like there 's a way to separate them , so they 'll both need replacement if either is damaged .
Finally , we get to the real meat of the smartphone .
A water damage sensor protects Texas Instruments ' OMAP3 platform .
The logic board is markedly smaller than that of the iPhone , which partly explains how Palm was able to fit everything into a 2.3 - by - 3.9 - by - 0.67 - inch casing .
All told , Rapid Repair estimates that the Palm Pre 's components cost $ 170 .
This is about the same as the iPhone , at least compared to a July 2008 estimate from iSuppli .
Of course , the estimates do n't account for design and manufacturing costs , or the fact that someone 's got to profit from these high - end gadgets when the day is done .

" Americans think that it ’s healthcare that produces health , when there really is very little evidence for that .
What turns out to be really important is the nature of caring and sharing in society … .
Where societies are more equal --- and economic equality is the thing that is most important in this --- people look after each other …and pretty well everyone does better .
There ’s almost nothing that is better in a society that tolerates the extreme levels of inequality in the United States .
And so , we end up dying younger than people in all the other rich countries , despite spending half the world ’s healthcare bill . "
- Dr. Stephen Bezruchka , March 30 , 2009
" Who are we ?
Is this what we have become --- a nation that dumps people off like garbage who can't pay their hospital bills ? " - Michael Moore , following a segment in which a confused elderly woman in a flimsy hospital gown is dumped curbside near a Skid Row rescue mission , in his documentary Sicko !*
In Failed States ( 2006 ) , Prof. Noam Chomsky , a preeminent linguist and one of this nation ’s most prolific political writers , concludes that the U.S. suffers from a “ democracy deficit ” --- the significant gap between the policy positions of the electorate and their elected representatives --- which he attributes to the manner in which “ elections are skillfully managed to avoid issues and marginalize the underlying population … freeing the elected leadership to serve the substantial people . ”
The deficit is especially acute in what Chomsky describes as “ the most dysfunctional healthcare system in the industrial world . ”
Chomsky notes that a single - payer system --- that is a system in which all medical providers would be paid by a government entity as now occurs with Medicare --- has long been overwhelmingly favored by “ a considerable majority ” of the American people , but routinely dismissed by both the corporate media and the leaders of both political parties as “ lacking political support ” and not being “ politically possible . ”
The issue touches on the core contradictions which arise because we have allowed private authoritarian entities , corporations , to subvert democracy by controlling our economy , our mass media and the manner in which we conduct elections .
This piece will focus on the irrationality of a privatized health care system which values the wealth of a handful of CEOs of the parasitic and entirely unnecessary middle - men --- for - profit carriers and HMOs --- over the health and very lives of our people .
It will explain what corporate America and their bought - and - paid - for politicians do not want you to hear ...
Still ' Sicko ' in the U.S.A .
The importance of Michael Moore 's Sicko lies in its ability to transcend the abstraction of statistics .
Moore recites the all too familiar numbers --- 47 million Americans have no health insurance ; 18,000 die each year ( according to the National Academy of Science 's Institute of Medicine ) simply because they cannot afford to pay for health care insurance .
Sicko begins with an uninsured man who is sewing up a gash in his leg ; another who was forced to choose which of two lopped off fingers to save .
Moore then tells us that Sicko is not about them .
It 's about the 250 million who are insured , like Larry Smith , a former machinist , and his wife Donna , a former newspaper editor ---
Americans who'd worked hard all their lives only to be forced to move into their daughter 's tiny storage room after the co-pays for Larry 's multiple heart attacks and Donna 's cancer ate up their life savings and cost them their home .
It 's about the 9/11 rescue workers who travel to Cuba , receiving , free - of - charge , medical care their own ungrateful nation failed to provide at a price they could afford .
Physicians for a National Health Program ( PNHP ) reports " medical bills contribute to half of all personal bankruptcies .
Three - fourths of those bankrupted had health insurance at the time they got sick or injured . "
Sicko exposes the fundamental conflict that arises when for - profit carriers and HMOs resort to utilization review ( UR ) ( a system in which insurance industry physicians who never see the patients are paid to second - guess the judgment of the physicians who directly provide health care ) and a myriad of other devices to avoid authorizing or paying for necessary procedures --- a point underscored by the tearful Congressional testimony of former UR physician , Linda Pino , M.D. , who noted that the UR physicians with the highest number of denials receive the largest bonuses and that she was promoted because she denied " an essential procedure " which " cost a man his life . "
Sicko reveals that a woman , rendered unconscious in an auto accident , was billed by her carrier for an ambulance ride to the hospital because it was not " pre-approved . "
" When was I supposed to get approval , " she asked , " after I gained consciousness ; while I was in the hospital ? "
The film portrayed the grief of a young widow whose husband died of cancer after their HMO repeatedly denied procedures as " unnecessary " or " experimental , " including a bone marrow transplant from his younger brother .
In Sicko , we see a distraught young mother whose toddler died because her HMO refused to permit a local hospital to provide vital emergency care .
How can we mourn the loss of 3,000 on 9/11 , yet tolerate a dysfunctional health care system that kills 18,000 uninsured each year plus countless others who were denied needed care simply to protect the obscene wealth of a few CEOs ?
As the above - cited PNHP article reveals , the irrationality and waste of the deadly US health care system is underscored by the statistics .
In the US 31 % of all health care costs goes to the parasitic middle men --- for profit carriers and HMOs .
Canada , a single - payer country , devotes just 1.3 % to administrative costs .
Daniel Wirt , MD reports that the 31 % translates to " more than $ 350 billion per year , provides no health care : it is consumed by enormous administrative costs , profits for investors and shareholders , and large salaries for managers of these for - profit insurance companies . "
Americans pay nearly double what people pay for health care in single - payer countries , yet the World Health Organization ranks the US as 37th in the delivery of health care services .
Where opponents of single - payer rail against paying taxes toward a single - payer system , the PNHP reports that our taxes already pay for 60 % of health care costs in the US .
" Americans pay the highest health care taxes in the world .
We pay for national health insurance , but do n’t get it . "
People in single - payer countries are healthier and live longer than we do .
As revealed by Sicko , especially in the segment in which Moore interviews American exiles in Paris , with the stress and weight of America 's health care burden removed , they also appear a whole lot happier --- a point which underscores the title of an article written by autoworker Phillip Bannowsky , “ Capitalism produces rich bankers , but Socialism produces happiness . "
The ' Universal Coverage ' Scam
Regardless of variances in their application , " universal coverage " schemes share two essential features : ( 1 ) they do not address the core problem which is not a lack of coverage but the presence of parasites --- for - profit carriers and HMOs --- which are sucking up billions of health care dollars ; ( 2 ) they provide the illusion of reform while reinforcing the corruption of the current dysfunctional system by providing subsidies that will find their way into the coffers of the unnecessary parasites .
The basic area of difference entails whether to adopt a hybrid system advocated by Sen.
Edward Kennedy ( D - MA ) that would permit individuals to choose between private and public insurance and subsidy plans offered by Senator Max Baucus ( D - MT ) , Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , that would minimize the public option out of fear that the corrupt private health insurance carriers could not compete with an efficient public system .
The Baucus plan would further burden those who have employer - funded health care insurance by taxing the insurance payments provided by their employers .
Kennedy and Baucus issued a joint statement on May 30 , 2009 that they intended to offer “ similar and complementary legislation that can be quickly merged into one bill for consideration on the Senate floor before the August recess . ”
Dr. David Himmelstein of PNHP explained the deficiency of the " public option plan " :
The proposed plan would realize only a small fraction – at most 16 % – of the administrative cost savings that could be achieved through single - payer .
That ’s because insurance overhead – which might well be lower in a public option plan – accounts for a small part of the overall administrative costs of the current system .
The need for hospitals and physicians to continue to bill dozens of different insurance plans would mean that their internal cost accounting and billing apparatus that causes most of the excess paperwork at present would continue .
... Absent massive savings on administration , the expansion of coverage would be very costly , and costs would continue to rise in future years since the proposed plan has no means to achieve real health planning or use global budgets to set enforceable limits on cost growth .
[ The public option ] plan would also do little or nothing for the tens of millions who are currently under - insured – they have coverage but still ca n’t afford care .
Dr. Quinton Young , Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr.'s personal physician and a long - time confidante of Barack Obama states :
We ’ve seen such hybrids repeatedly fail in state - based experiments over the past 20 years in Oregon , Minnesota , Washington and several other states , including Massachusetts , whose second go - round at incremental reform is already faltering .
Dr. Wirt supported this assessment , noting that whereas the number of uninsured adults in Massachusetts fell from 13 % in 2006 to 7.1 % in 2007 , public spending skyrocketed from " $ 629.8 million in fiscal year 2007 " to " $ 1089.2 million in fiscal year 2008 and $ 1317.7 million in fiscal year 2009 ... Most of the " reduction in the number of uninsured was realized by " expanding Medicaid and subsidizing the purchase of private insurance . "
' Barack has been dishonest '
In 2003 , as an Illinois State Senator , Barack Obama supported a single - payer system .
But when he set his sights on the Presidency , US Senator Barack Obama changed his tune .
Single - payer would be ideal if we were " designing a system from scratch . "
But " people have become accustomed to getting their health insurance through their employer ... a lot of people work for insurance companies ...[ and ] for HMOs . "
We need to " build off the system that we ’ve got . "
When asked by Amy Goodman what he thought of that remark , Dr. Young said [ emphasis added ] :
Well , it ’s one of the few times when Barack has been dishonest .
He knows and all America knows that our experience with employment - based insurance and these other Mickey Mouse things have been increasingly a total disaster .
You have a $ 2.5 trillion industry with vested interests — the private hospitals that are for profit , the HMOs , the health insurance industry — making billions upon billions , and things getting worse ...
...
Under the weight of this private insurance system , doctors have finished training with huge debts , $ 150,000 on average , and the specialties , as it ’s worked out under a private system , are paying on average two to three times what primary care doctors get .
Primary care is very simple .
It ’s family practitioners , pediatricians and general internists .
You need about 60 percent of your doctors in that category to have a balanced system .
Well , that ’s been slipping away , and now we ’re well under 50 percent of primary care doctors .
And that has to be reversed , or no system will work .
And increasingly , there ’s large areas in this country where people cannot find a primary care doctor .
And in almost every , certainly metropolitan area , there ’s an excess of specialists .
Unacceptable to Corporate America , Corporate Media
Both Democratic front - runners , Obama and Hillary Clinton , supported variations of the " universal coverage " scam .
The only Democratic candidate who openly supported a single - payer system was Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , a co-sponsor with Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) of HR 676 ( " Medicare for All " ) .
If you looked only at the election results , you might assume that the vast majority of Democrats favored the Obama and Clinton policy positions ; that the Kucinich policy positions had only nominal support .
And you would be wrong .
In August 2007 , some 67,000 voters took part in an internet " blind poll " survey which set forth the policy positions of Democratic candidates for President but did not include their names .
Obama , the charismatic “ change ” candidate whose soaring rhetoric is second to none , received a meager 3 % ; Clinton , 3.6 % .
Kucinich was the choice of “ a phenomenal 53 % . ”
The explanation for this gap goes beyond Chomsky 's accurate analysis of the deception employed by the PR industry .
The problem also entails a corporate - owned media which has a vested financial interest in evading substantive issues , thereby forcing candidates to purchase expensive 30 - second deceitful ads --- a major source of media revenue .
Where European democracies conduct elections over a span of weeks , the US has devolved into the permanent electoral cycle as newly elected “ leaders ” must begin trolling for financial support for the next election even before they take office .
While Obama knew full well that one cannot build on a health care system whose foundations are mired in corruption , he also knew that he would never have a realistic shot at the Presidency if he adopted the only logical solution ( single - payer ) because that solution was unacceptable to corporate America .
Candidates who stray beyond the corporate range of discourse are shunned .
Case in point : America's " paper of record , " The New York Times , which mentioned Kucinich only four times between an April 26 , 2007 MSNBC debate --- in which Kucinich and former Senator Mike Gravel were relegated to the far ends of the debate stage and mostly ignored --- and prior to January 25 , 2008 when the paper announced that Kucinich had withdrawn from the race .
During that same period , the name Hillary Clinton appeared in more than 1,300 articles , columns , op - ed pieces and letters to the editor in The New York Times .
While much was made of the large number of small donations Obama 's Internet campaign garnered , as revealed by Amy Goodman during an Oct. 23 , 2008 segment of Democracy Now " only a quarter of this vast number of donors fall into the ' small ' category ( under $ 200 ) ... "
The cost of Presidential campaigns soared from $ 171 million in 1976 to more than $ 2 billion in 2008 .
" The $ 2 - billion presidential race ... guarantees vast profits for the broadcasters , the national networks and the local television stations .
Hundreds of television stations are using the public airwaves , imposing themselves between the candidates and the public , " Goodman noted .
Of course , the $ 2 billion for the Presidential race does not include the vast sums spent on Congressional and state races , including ballot propositions in states like California .
( It is meaningless to talk about campaign finance reform without recognizing the need to divest corporate control over 95 % of what we see , hear and read . )
Earlier , on July 22 , 2008 , Goodman reported that less than two weeks after Congress , with the aid of then Senator Obama 's reversal , granted retroactive immunity to telecoms involved in the Bush spy program , " it ’s been learned AT&T will be emblazoned on every delegate ’s bag at the Democratic National Convention .
Like Comcast , Motorola , Coca - Cola , Google and a host of other corporate sponsors , the telecom giant has donated over a million dollars to the DNC in return for prominent display space and access to elected officials . "
On Jan. 20 , 2009 , Goodman reported that despite Obama 's ban on corporate and lobbyist funding , 80 % of the $ 27.6 million raised to fund the inauguration came " from 211 wealthy individuals who have bundled anywhere up to $ 300,000 each . "
As investigative reporter Greg Palast observed in the title of his book , it 's The Best Democracy Money Can Buy .
Shut Out of the Debate
A March 6 , 2009 Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) study showed that , despite a January 2009 New York Times / CBS poll reflecting that nearly 2/3 of all Americans favored single - payer , during the week leading to Obama 's March 5 , 2009 health care summit , single - payer was greeted in the corporate media with deafening silence ; mostly mentioned only in articles that attacked it .
Per the FAIR study , single - payer " advocates ... were almost entirely shut out " of the President 's summit .
FAIR reported :
Over the past week , hundreds of stories in major newspapers and on NBC News , ABC News , CBS News , Fox News , CNN , MSNBC , NPR and PBS 's NewsHour With Jim Lehrer mentioned healthcare reform , according to a search of the Nexis database ( 2/25/09-3/4/09 ) .
Yet all but 18 of these stories made no mention of ' single - payer ' ( or synonyms commonly used by its proponents , such as ' Medicare for all , ' or the proposed single - payer bill , H.R. 676 ) , and only five included the views of advocates of single - payer --- none of which appeared on television .
The pattern continues .
On June 3 , 2009
The New York Times managed to cover the health care issue without so much as mentioning single - payer , let alone the fact that its own polling demonstrated that single - payer is favored by a 2 to 1 margin by the American people .
It failed to mention HR 676 or the similar single - payer bill [ PDF ] , S 703 , introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) .
But it is n't just the corporate media .
A 2009 AFL / CIO Health Care for America Survey , for example , set forth eight different options , none of which included single - payer .
The so - called Divided We Fail coalition whose four major members include AARP , Business Roundtable , SEIU , and the National Federation of Independent Business sent out an email to members stating “ we need to have everyone at the table if we ’re going to pass meaningful reform , ” yet the statement it submitted into the record at the Senate Finance Committee hearings made no mention of single - payer .
A curious exception is MSNBC , which mentions single - payer multiple times on its web site in linking to May and June 2009 pieces , but the linked articles fail to discuss single - payer , except one which merely mentions that “ liberals ” shouted “ single - payer ” in protest .
The effort to paint single - payer as a “ liberal ” position ignores the fact that it is supported by 2/3 of the American people --- a fact that either suggests a much broader range of support across the political spectrum or suggests that the American people are far more “ liberal ” than either their elected leaders or the corporate media .
Senator Baucus , a major recipient of health care insurer monies , insists that this is not the time to consider single - payer .
He has not only excluded single - payer advocates from panels appearing before his Committee , but had the single - payer advocates who verbally protested arrested .
One of those arrested , Russell Mokhiber of Single Payer Action , greeted Amy Goodman " from corporate - occupied territory , Washington , DC , where the drug companies and the health insurance companies control every nook and cranny . "
Mokhiber 's greeting pretty much sums up single - payer and the " democracy deficit . "
While Baucus agreed to meet privately with single - payer advocates on June 3 , 2009 , he continues to refuse them a seat at the table during public hearings .
The Kennedy / Baucus joint statement that they hope to pass their respective bills before the August recess , moreover , suggests that Baucus agreed to a private meeting with single - payer advocates only after the fix was in .
Indeed , if activist David Swanson 's description is anywhere near accurate , Baucus ' willingness to privately meet with single - payer advocates was itself a scam .
Baucus said it was a " mistake " not to include single - payer but that the legislative process was now too far along to correct the omission .
But this was no sin of omission .
Baucus ' earlier remarks make it clear that he intended to keep single - payer off - the - table all along .
Indeed , the very title of the Baucus hearings , [ emphasis added ] the Senate Finance Committee Roundtable on Expanding Coverage on Health Care Reform , by definition excludes a single - payer solution .
The refusal by a bought - and - paid - for politician to permit 2/3 of the American people so much as a voice at public hearings is nothing short of scandalous , yet the scandal goes unreported in the all - too - complicit corporate media .
The Democracy Solution Deficit
Towards the end of Sicko Michael Moore asked former British MP Tony Benn how the UK developed its national health care system in 1947 .
Benn 's short answer was " democracy . "
Before we had the vote , all power was in the hands of rich people … .
What democracy did was give the poor the vote , and it moved power from the market place to the polling station ; from the wallet to the ballot , and what the people said was very simple … .
They said in the 1930s we had mass unemployment but we do n’t have any unemployment during the war … .
If you can find money to kill people , you can find money to help people .
Later , Benn added :
I think democracy is the most revolutionary thing in the world ; more revolutionary than socialist ideas … .
Because ... you have the power to use it to meet the needs of your community … .
If the poor in the US and Britain turned out to vote for people who represent their interests it would be a real democratic revolution …
The " democracy deficit " is not an impenetrable gap .
James Madison taught us that " knowledge will forever govern ignorance " and that " a people who mean to be their own Governors must arm themselves with the power knowledge can bring . "
Single - payer health care and the bridging of the democracy deficit can occur if we take the time to smash through the corporate media cone of silence , something which this article , in some small measure , aspires to achieve .
Those who wish to send their Senators an email demanding that single - payer advocates have a seat at the table during public hearings can do so right here .

UPDATE 6/6/09 : Describing its author , Senator Edward M. Kennedy ( D - MA ) as the " longtime champion of health care for all , " Robert Pear of The New York Times tauted Kennedy 's hybrid " universal coverage " bill as a " sweeping health plan . "
While the bill includes the so - called public option , its principle features include subsidized " premiums for people with incomes up to 500 percent of the poverty level ( $ 110,000 for a family of four ) " and financial penalties on those who do not obtain " coverage , " subject to an exemption for " exceptional financial hardship . "
" The bill , " Pear conceded , " gives no indication of how Mr. Kennedy would pay for his proposals , other than by requiring contributions from individuals and employers , " and will likely be merged with the bill being written by Sen.
Baucus .
This is " reform " in reverse .
Bad enough the parasites --- for profit carriers and HMOs --- are sucking up 31 % of health care dollars under the current system .
Kennedy would now place the burden upon the 47 million uninsured to prove " exceptional financial hardship " or face penalties , wasting tax dollars to further subsidize the parasites .
UPDATE 6/7/09 : During the first quarter of 2009 , five health insurance carriers , United Health Group , WellPoint , Aetna , Cigna & Humana , together with the trade group American Insurance Plans , spent $ 6.4 million lobbying on health care legislation .
Additionally , " MetLife Inc. spent nearly $ 1.2 million lobbying in the first quarter on legislation related to health insurance , overhauling the health care system , home mortgages , financial regulations and other issues ... "
In its Sunday , June 07 , 2009 paper , The New York Times gave front page coverage to President Obama ’s desire to have a direct impact on the health care debate .
That and a separate article entitled “ State Coverage Model No Help for Uneasy Insurance Industry ” took up an entire page of the printed edition .
" Single - payer " was never mentioned .
UPDATE 6/10/09 : Kevin Zeese reported on OpEdNews that single - payer advocates will now be permitted to appear as witnesses before both Senate and House committees conducting hearings that will address health care reform .

Backers of legal pot eye ballot MARIJUANA

With polls showing the legalization of marijuana gaining public support , and a state budget crisis fueling an ever - more - desperate search for revenue , backers of the first major statewide initiative to legalize marijuana for personal use - and allow counties to tax and regulate the drug - say they 're preparing to get the matter on the November 2010 ballot .
" We think the tides have turned , " said Richard Lee , the executive director of Oaksterdam University , a major medical marijuana dispensary and advocacy group in Oakland , and a founder of TaxCannabis2010.org , sponsor of the initiative .
He said polls showing voters ' support for legalization and taxation of the drug , combined with the financial strains of a recession , mean that " this will be a landmark opportunity that will generate interest and funds nationwide . "
If successful , Lee said , the initiative will be viewed as a watershed - " a first step in changing federal law . "
The initiative that Lee 's group is preparing to circulate calls for legalization of small amounts of marijuana for personal possession by adults 21 and older , and allows cities and counties the option of regulating sales and cultivation .
The legal amount would be 1 ounce for personal possession , with cultivation allowed in a space no larger than 5 feet by 5 feet .
The move comes as other legislative efforts to legalize marijuana are beginning to gain traction , including a special July election in Oakland to create a category for cannabis taxes , and hearings this fall on a bill by state Assemblyman Tom Ammiano to decriminalize the substance .
With California counties and cities facing huge cuts in critical programs because of the state 's $ 24.3 billion budget deficit - supporters of efforts to legalize and tax marijuana have seized on a new and potentially potent financial argument to take a new look at the issue .
Billions for California
Lee 's group argues that legalization could generate billions of dollars in annual sales tax revenues for California , " so we can finally start funding what matters most : jobs , health care , education , " while putting dwindling law enforcement dollars to work on high - priority violent crime and anti-gang offensives .
TaxCannabis2010.org , which also will have a political action committee arm to raise money , plans to submit the initiative to Attorney General Jerry Brown next month for the summary and title oversight required by law .
Lee said the group plans to begin gathering signatures in August and fully expects to get the required 650,000 signatures by January to qualify for the November 2010 ballot .
Already , he said , the group has ambitious plans to hire paid signature gatherers , and to use Internet organizing and fundraising - lessons he said learned from the Obama presidential campaign - as well as its PAC to seize on what appears to be a recent shift in public opinion on legalization .
Even if the initiative is successful in California , marijuana would still be illegal under federal law , although backers hope a change here would lead to a change in federal law .
The move to go before voters underscores how the state 's budget crisis could help drive what political observers say is an increasingly sophisticated , Internet - savvy and business - oriented approach to the effort to legalize pot .
" It 's not the complete answer to the state budget crisis - but it's a piece of the puzzle that could be put into place relatively easily , " said Bruce Mirken of the Marijuana Policy Project , which studies legalization issues .
" That said , there 's an ongoing discussion about how to get that done as quickly as possible - and whether a ballot initiative is the way to go . "
Oakland ballot measure
Other marijuana - related legislation is making its way before state voters .
Oakland voters will in weeks begin voting on a July special election mail - in ballot that includes Measure F , which would make their city the first in the nation to establish a new tax rate for " cannabis businesses . "
If the measure is approved , Oakland medical marijuana businesses , which generate an estimated $ 20 million annually in sales - and are now charged at the general tax rate of $ 1.20 per $ 1,000 gross receipts - would see that rate raised to $ 18 per $ 1,000 , a 15 - fold increase .
The measure was supported enthusiastically by Lee and overseers of other city medical marijuana dispensaries as one that could contribute more than $ 400,000 a year to city coffers while also giving the medical marijuana businesses an increasingly mainstream profile in a major city .
Their efforts have won the support of Councilwoman Rebecca Kaplan , who sponsored Oakland 's Measure D , which mandates that arrests for personal possession of marijuana be given the lowest priority in law enforcement matters .
While an increasing number of public officials , including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , have urged study of legalization , there remains deep opposition among groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving , which argues it would multiply problems related to substance use and come with heavy health concerns .
Opposition and progress
Even proponents of decriminalization warn that taking an initiative before state voters probably will face huge and expensive opposition .
Quintin Mecke , communications director for state Sen .
Tom Ammiano , D - San Francisco , said the legislator 's bill , AB390 , calling for decriminalization of marijuana and taxation and regulation of the drug , is expected to be up for hearings later this year .
" The general consensus is that we 're making a lot of progress , " he said .
But a ballot initiative has the potential to be more polarizing , because it will " limit the ability to craft ( a measure ) through legislative process " and does n't allow for as much flexibility , he said .
Sharing a bed with your furry friend has taken on a whole new meaning for Riana Van Nieuwenhuizen .
The sanctuary worker shares her South African home with not one but FOUR orphaned cheetahs , five lions and two tigers .
Forty - six - year - old Riana said : ' I love them all .
But they 're a handful .'
Two of Riana Van Nieuwenhuizen big cats fight to be top dog in her South African home
Riana bought her first cheetah , Fiela in 2006 , after realising the big cats were in trouble and heading for extinction with only 1000 left in Africa .
She left her full time job working for the department of justice - a position she had held for 22 years - and found temporary employment on a game ranch where she could raise her beloved big cat .
But Riana 's real dream was fully realised after she set up the not - for - profit Fiela Funds Cheetah Breeding Project in South Africa to ensure the long - term survival of the cheetah and their ecosystem .
Cat burglar ?
The cheeky cheetah muscles in for a snatch of sarnie
No cheetah - ing : One big cat offers some furry advice
Happy families : Riana with three of her five white lion cubs Vanilla , Snowball and Snowflake and two tigers
The project spreads over a hectare of land and visitors can meet Fiela and the other cats and even have their pictures taken .
And if you want to outdo your friends in the wedding photo stakes the project also offers newly weds the chance to be snapped cuddling up to a big cat .
The cats in Riana 's own home are truly part of the family and are allowed to roam freely .
Fight like cat and dog ?
Riana 's two dogs snuggle up with one big cat
Say cheeeeetah :
For the ultimate wedding snap couples can have their picture taken with a cat at the project
They make it known when they are hungry , even jumping up onto work surfaces in an attempt to snatch a bite of whatever 's going .
Luckily Riana 's two dogs are n't on the menu but instead romp with the cats and even snuggle down with them for a snooze .
RAMALLAH — Money , wrote the English philosopher Francis Bacon , is like manure : of very little use unless it is spread .
Since an international aid conference in March promised $ 5.2 billion to rebuild Gaza , the stink of un - spread money has been strong in the nostrils .
That ’s particularly unpleasant for the people of Gaza , who also have to deal with a largely destroyed sewage system , thus giving them a double - helping of manure .
International diplomats , Israeli officials and leaders of the Palestinian Authority have n’t been able to figure out how to rebuild Gaza while keeping the cash out of the hands of Hamas , which runs the narrow strip of land .
Food aid can get in , but substantial reconstruction has n’t begun .
“ The Sharm conference was just a big public relations stunt , ” says a diplomat who works in the development arm of a European government .
“ The money promised for Gaza is just not there . ”
Gaza ’s 1.5 million people have been in desperate straits since the war there at the turn of the year .
Israeli ground and air forces attacked Hamas to halt the Islamic group ’s missile strikes on towns in southern Israel .
About 1,300 people died .
At least 14,000 homes throughout the Gaza Strip were destroyed or badly damaged , according to the UN Development Program .
Infrastructure , such as roads , water , sewage and electricity supply , were severely affected .
In early March , a wide range of international donors converged on the swanky Red Sea resort of Sharm el - Sheikh .
Responding to public concern about the plight of ordinary Gazans , the donors dug deep .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised $ 900 million from the United States .
Saudi Arabia pledged $ 1 billion .
The total was put at $ 5.2 billion , though $ 700 million of that was made up of old pledges that had n’t ever been fulfilled ( a perverse international aid equivalent of re-gifting ) .
New pledges amounted to $ 4.4 billion .
That 's more than Germany received , in real terms , under the Marshall Plan after World War II .
It ought to have been enough to rebuild a place as small as Gaza where , it 's fair to say , the residents have low expectations for the luxuriousness of their habitat .
Yet the people of Gaza quivered in their wintry tent encampments , waiting for the manure to be spread .
They ’re still in the tents .
Sweltering now with the onset of the long heat that runs from April until November in Gaza .
What happened to the cash ?
After all , when the money was promised , diplomats claimed it would be easy enough to figure out a way to give the aid money without letting Hamas get its hands on it .
That was important because the U.S. would n’t give a cent if it might end up paying for more missiles aimed at Israel .
Last week a Florida congresswoman told Clinton the aid money was “ a bailout for Hamas . ”
Most Arab states were keen to back the Palestinian Authority , which is still engaged in a civil war with Hamas .
No problem , diplomats said at the time , we can set up mechanisms to get around Hamas .
European diplomats and Jerusalem - based aid agencies tell GlobalPost that these claims turned out to be hot air .
Basic humanitarian aid , such as food , gets through no problem .
But the rest of the cash remains unused .
Diplomats are concerned that even if the aid does n’t go directly to Hamas , the Islamic party which took over absolute control of Gaza two years ago might tax or divert the money — or simply steal it , as its militiamen did when they raided a U.N. food warehouse after the end of the fighting .
The donors thought the situation would become clearer after the formation of a new Israeli government and with progress in Egyptian - sponsored reconciliation talks between Hamas and their West Bank rivals , Fatah .
No luck .
Hamas and Fatah seem to be drifting further apart , maneuvering behind the scenes as they prepare for a new round of talks .
Fatah , which controls the Palestinian Authority from Ramallah , lacks urgency due to the fact that it ’s still receiving the money it has been promised by the United States .
Hamas has n’t been doing much to kiss and make up , either .
A Human Rights
Watch report released last week said Hamas killed at least 32 political rivals during the Israeli assault and in the three months since .
It also shot 49 Palestinians in the legs and broke the legs or arms of another 73 , according to the rights group .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a review of the policy of barring construction materials from Gaza , after he took office a month ago .
But the review is n’t due to be completed for another three weeks , according to officials in Netanyahu ’s office .
“ Keeping the money out of the hands of Hamas is a challenge , ” says one Israeli official .
“ Whether the money is dollars , Euros or shekels , no one has easy answers . ”
It turns out blame is easier to spread than money .

Audra Shay , who became the subject of a national controversy after The Daily Beast uncovered racist comments she wrote on Facebook and other social - networking sites , won the race to become head of the Young Republicans by approximately 50 votes ( out of about 950 voting delegates ) at their national convention this afternoon in Indianapolis .
Shay faced calls to remove herself from the election after appearing to laugh at a racial slur about President Barack Obama , The Daily Beast ’s John Avlon exclusively reported .
The comments , in which Shay responded to a comment calling blacks “ coons , ” were quickly deleted , but prompted fellow Young Republicans to urge her to take her hat out of the ring for the national election .
And though Shay issued a statement that neither she , nor her Young Republicans slate , “ condones the use of racial slurs on my wall , ” Avlon reports that Shay has a history of racial comments , encouraging extremism and partisan hate online .
Before the election , Meghan McCain urged the group not to choose hate by electing Shay : “ What exactly do the Young Republicans expect to achieve by electing a 38 - year - old woman who thinks racial epithets are acceptable ? ”
Young Republicans insiders had expected the vote to be " very , very close " and said that many delegates were urging unity no matter who the winner turned out to be .
Shay defeated Rachel Hoff , who serves as the Young Republicans ’ Director of Media Relations .
She ran on a five - point platform that emphasized education , technology , and community outreach .
According to George P. Bush , son of Jeb Bush , “ Rachel ’s professionalism , hard work , and leadership will well - represent the GOP . ”
Sarah Huckabee , daughter of Mike Huckabee , said , “ Rachel Hoff ’s approach to politics and life seems to be : ‘ Stand Up and Lead . ’ ”
Shay is a 38 - year - old Army veteran and mother from Louisiana , who works as an event planner and serves as vice chairman at large for the Young Republicans .
She ran on the platform of “ Restore , Revitalize , Reinforce , ” which emphasized rebranding the Young Republicans as more hip through Facebook and Twitter , and spreading " our message of lower taxes and less government to these corners and let people know that we ’re here and we ’ll hold the Democrats ’ feet to the fire . ”
She was endorsed in the election by her governor , Bobby Jindal .
Shay came under fire for a Facebook exchange , in which she posted that “ WalMart just signed a death warrant ” by “ endorsing Obama ’s health care plan . ”
A friend named Eric S. Piker weighed in : “ It ’s the government making us commies … ca n’t even smoke in my damn car … whats next they going to issue toilet paper once a month .. tell us how to wipe our asses … ”
Two minutes later , Piker posted again : “ Obama Bin Lauden [ sic ] is the new terrorist …
Muslim is on there side [ sic ] … need to take this country back from all of these mad coons … and illegals . ”
Immediately after his post , Shay responded : “ You tell em Eric ! Lol . ”
While Shay defended her comment as responding only to Piker ’s first post , others on her Facebook page noticed the remarks .
“ Someone please help a naïve Seattle girl out , is Eric ’s comment a racist slur ? ” asked Cassie Wallender , a national committeewoman from the Washington Young Republican Federation .
A minute later , she answered her own question : “ Okay , why is this okay ?
I just looked it up .
‘ It comes from a term baracoons ( a cage ) where they used to place Africans who were waiting to be sent to America to be slaves . ’
THIS IS NOT OKAY AND IT’S NOT FUNNY . ”
Shay responded that the allegations against her were “ political attacks ” which “ proves that my opponents will stoop to the lowest levels to steal this election from the jaws of victory . ”
An ex-FBI agent that interrogated terrorists told a Senate panel that no actionable intelligence was gained from “ enhanced interrogations ” such as waterboarding .
“ I strongly believe that it is a mistake to use what has become know as enhanced interrogation techniques , ” said Ali Soufan who worked for the FBI from 1997 to 2005 .
“ These techniques , from an operational perspective , are slow , ineffective , unreliable , and harmed our efforts to defeat al Qaeda . ”

Soufan said that intelligent interrogation techniques used by the FBI were “ in sharp contrast to the enhanced interrogation method that instead tries to subjugate the detainee into submission through humiliation and cruelty .
The idea behind it is to force the detainee to see the interrogator as the master who controls his pain .
It ’s merely an exercise in trying to force compliance rather than elicit cooperation . ”
“ I major problem is that it is ineffective .
Al Qaeda are trained to resist torture , ” he said .
“ In contrast , when we interrogated using intelligent interrogation methods [ on Abu Zubaydah ] within the first hour we gained important actionable intelligence . ”

Otto Heino , the Ojai - based master potter , educator and symbol of the midcentury California studio crafts movement who along with his late wife , Vivika , reformulated a lost - to - the - ages Chinese glaze that made him a multimillionaire , has died .
He was 94 .
Heino died Thursday of acute renal failure at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura , said George Gemmingen , a friend .
The Finnish American Heino , who worked in collaboration with his wife until her death in 1995 , earned an international reputation for robust yet beautiful wheel - thrown stoneware with artistically applied glazes that included glossy cobalt blues , silky reds and raspy earth tones .
In the mid-1990s , he became celebrated in Asia for a buttery yellow glaze that he and his wife had labored on for more than a decade .
He claimed to have been offered millions for the formula but never sold it .
“ Otto ’s work is a wonderful blending of Scandinavian modernism and Japanese folk pottery , ” said Jo Lauria , a coauthor of the ceramics book “ Color and Fire ” ( 2000 ) .
“ He had a macho relationship with clay , and it was a badge of honor to be able to throw huge pieces , but they were always functional , emphasizing the sensuality of the glaze , the way in which it catches the light and invites you to touch it . ”
Heino ’s handmade vessels , which retain the ridges his fingers formed when shaping the clay , exhibit a style that was wholly his own .
Gerard O’Brien , owner of the Reform Gallery in Los Angeles , which sells the Heinos ’ pieces , called the potter ’s work “ hearty and gutsy ” and “ ruggedly American . ”
Still actively producing work for museums , international collectors and his home gallery until his death , Heino could throw 100 - pound mounds of clay into 24 - inch - wide platters .
Without assistants or apprentices , he fired kilns of his own design , producing thousands of pieces a year .
Those with the prized yellow glaze , popular during the Chin dynasty ( AD 265 to 420 ) , sold for $ 25,000 and up .
“ I am the oldest , richest potter in the world , ” Heino told The Times in a 2008 interview .
Though he indulged a passion for cars , purchasing a Rolls - Royce and a Bentley , Heino was also a philanthropist , donating his work and funds to ceramic institutions and the Ventura County Museum of History and Art , which staged exhibitions of his work in 1995 and 2005 .
He was even more generous with his time , teaching , demonstrating and mentoring generations of potters from around the world .
Christy Johnson , director and curator of the American Museum of Ceramic Art in Pomona , said the Heinos “ represented a time when the artist ’s character was considered to be part of the beauty of their pieces .
Their devotion to the work , to each other , and to teaching contributed to the fine quality of the work . ”
Don Pilcher , a potter who studied under the Heinos at Chouinard Art Institute , said they were devoted to their craft and to passing along their knowledge as a legacy .
“ They treated me , and others , like a son , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
“ Watching Otto fire a kiln was a master class in care , precision and patience , I never saw anybody more reluctant to turn off a kiln .
It was as if he were having an affair with the fire . ”
Otto Heino was born April 20 , 1915 , in East Hampton , Conn. , the fifth of 12 children of Finnish immigrants August and Lena Heino .
He was raised on a New Hampshire farm where every child played a musical instrument ;
Otto ’s was trombone .
The large family survived the Great Depression raising dairy cattle and delivering milk .
By the start of World War II , Heino had established a successful trucking business .
For five years , he served in the Army Air Forces as a fighter plane crew chief and a B - 17 gunner .
During this time , he changed his Finnish first name , Aho , to Otto , which , along with his blond hair and blue eyes , helped him survive when he was twice shot down over Germany .
On a furlough in England , the war - weary hero visited the pottery studio of Bernard Leach , who had introduced Japanese techniques to British ceramics .
After observing the master at work , Gemmingen recalls , “ Otto said , ‘ If I live through this war I am going to dedicate myself to this . ’ ”
After the war , Heino attended the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts on the GI Bill .
He married his pottery instructor , Vivika Timeriasieff , in 1950 .
Two years later , they moved to Los Angeles when she succeeded glazing master Glen Lukens in a teaching post at USC .
Heino ’s mechanical skills and education in ceramics helped him land a job with NASA working on rockets and space capsules .
In the mid-1950s , the couple lived and worked in a Victorian house on Hoover Street in Los Angeles .
“ They opened a shop that sold only handmade pots and people told them they were crazy , ” said O’Brien , “ but they were successful and inspired other people to do crafts as a way of life . ”
After a stint on the East Coast in the 1960s , the Heinos returned to California and purchased the Ojai home of a former student , acclaimed ceramist Beatrice Wood , and in 1973 established a gallery , The Pottery .
Heino earned the 1978 gold medal at the Sixth Biennial International de Ceramique in Vallauris , France , for a pot with two birds perched on the rim .
He and Vivika showed their work at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D.C. , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , and the American Craft Museum in New York , now called the Museum of Arts & Design .
Even after having a pacemaker installed in 2008 , Heino remained indefatigable , telling The Times , “ Never hurry , never worry .
If you ’re negative , you ’ll never make it . ”
The Pottery , which had been open to the public , has been closed .
Heino ’s ashes are stored in one of the artist ’s lidded jars decorated with one of his familiar birds and his renowned yellow glaze .
The Heinos had no children .
Otto Heino is survived by his youngest sister , Olga Rogowski , of Canoga Park .
Memorial services are pending .

The most powerful camera that has ever been used to survey another planet is capturing spectacular pictures of the surface of Mars to reveal a rich tapestry of geological features .
Located on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , a Nasa probe launched in 2005 , the HiRise camera has already taken detailed images of the outlines of ancient extra-terrestrial seas and rivers – the first unambiguous evidence that shorelines once existed on the Red Planet .
The camera has also witnessed in high - resolution detail the moment when the warmth of the Martian spring forced puffs of dust through the thin polar caps of dry ice – solid carbon dioxide – to form weird " starburst " patterns on the surface of the planet .
" Spring on Mars is quite different from spring on Earth because Mars has not just permanent ice caps , but also seasonal polar caps of carbon dioxide , " said Candice Hansen - Koharcheck , of Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" What happens on Mars , we think , is that as the seasonal ice cap thins from the bottom , gas underneath the cap builds up pressure .
And where gas under the ice finds a weak spot or a crack , it will flow out of the opening , often carrying a little dust from the surface below . "
In addition to operating in the visible light spectrum , the HiRise camera can " see " in near - infrared regions enabling it to gather information on the mineral content of the rocks and dust that form the Martian landscape .
Its telescopic lens gives it an unprecedented resolution for a space - probe camera , enabling it to distinguish surface features as little as four feet wide .
Such high - resolution images have enabled the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to build up an impressive library of landscape views showing richly layered materials , gullies and eroded channels , some perhaps formed in very recent times by running water .
Nasa scientists believe the information will be invaluable if they ever have to choose a landing site for a possible manned mission to Mars later this century .
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was designed to make a detailed survey of the Martian surface , as well as its immediate subsurface and its atmosphere .
The mission goals of the probe are to determine whether life ever arose on Mars , to characterise the planet 's climate and geology , and to prepare for possible human exploration by locating , for instance , existing pockets of water that future astronauts could exploit for their life - support systems .
But the biggest of all questions was whether liquid water was ever around long enough to provide a basis for extra-terrestrial life to have originated and evolved .
Although it is clear that water did once exist on Mars , and may still exist under its frozen surface , the question of life itself is still unresolved .
" While other Mars missions have shown that water flowed across the surface in Mars 's history , it remains a mystery whether water was ever around long enough to provide a habitat for life .
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will study the history of water on Mars , " said a Nasa spokesman .
It took the orbiter seven months to cruise to Mars followed by a further six months of careful " aerobraking " to get the spacecraft into precisely the right orbit to make its scientific observations .
Following on from the previous Nasa orbiter , the Mars Global Surveyor , which finally died in April 2007 after battery failure , the Orbiter will make the most detailed geological survey of the Red Planet to date .

Che Chou of Turn 10 Studios , developers of the Forza Motorsport series for Xbox 360 , made a pretty underhanded criticism that certainly wo n’t hold over well with fans of the Gran Turismo series .
While it ’s standard for developers to try out each other ’s games and swap information at trade shows , Turn 10 seemed particularly sensitive about Polyphony Digital showing up to the Forza booth at E3 2009 .
“ The reason I say I was personally surprised was because [ Polyphony Digital ] are n’t generally known as a studio to acknowledge that there are racing games that exist beyond their own .
Which could explain why the GT franchise has been so stagnant in the racing genre since GT3 . ”
Unfortunately , Chou fails to explain himself , which leaves us to wonder whether he was referring to GT ’s sales ( Gran Turismo 5 : Prologue alone sold nearly 3.7 million units ) or the fact that the series is still regarded by professional drivers as the most realistic driving simulator on the market .
Chou had one final thing to say on the matter .
“ I know for a fact that Turn 10 will never stop pushing racing games to the next level . ”
And , sadly , neither will Polyphony Digital .
If you see a competitor taking notes , do the same .
It ’s more constructive to learn from them rather than fall into an arrogant mindset .

An adult C. mulmeinensis alongside decoy prey pellets ( L ) and decoy egg sacs ( R ) There is a species of spider that builds models of itself , which it uses as decoys to distract predators .
The spider may be the first example of an animal building a life - size replica of its own body .
So believe the scientists who made the discovery , which is published in the journal Animal Behaviour .
The arachnid 's behaviour also offers one explanation for why many spiders like to decorate their webs with strange - looking ornaments .
Many animals try to divert the attentions of predators by becoming masters of disguise .
Some try to avoid being seen altogether by using camouflage to blend in against a background , such as the peppered moth evolving motley wings that blend into tree bark , or stick insects that look like sticks .
Others evolve more conspicuous ornaments designed to distract a predator , such as butterflies that grow large eyespots or lizards that quickly move colourful tails , which they detach from their bodies if grabbed .
This latter strategy has puzzled biologists , because attracting predators in the first place is usually a bad idea .
One hypothesis is that animals which grow conspicuous ornaments benefit overall , because directing a predator to attack an expendable part of the body , such as the lizard 's tail , outweighs the costs of attracting the attention of the predator in the first place .
Under attack
But animals do not tend to actually build life - like replica models of themselves to act as decoys .
However , that is exactly what a species of orb spider called Cyclosa mulmeinensis does , biologists Ling Tseng and I - Min Tso of Tunghai University in Taichung , Taiwan , have discovered .
This and other related spiders in the same genus decorate their webs with material such as detritus , plant parts , prey remains or egg sacs .
Because such detritus is often of a similar colour to the spider , researchers suspected it might help camouflage the arachnid .
Our study seems to be the first to empirically demonstrate the function of animal - made decoys
Spider specialist I - Min Tso Initially Tseng and Tso decided to test the idea by videoing another related species called Cyclosa confusa living in the wild .
They measured how often predatory wasps attacked the spiders in webs decorated with detritus compared with those in undecorated webs .
" We predicted that spiders with prey carcass decorations on webs should receive fewer wasp attacks because spiders should be well camouflaged by such objects , " says Tso .
" To our surprise , spiders on decorated webs received far more attacks than those on undecorated webs . "
That confirmed that the decorations attracted predators rather than acting as camouflage .
However , Tseng and Tso suspected that these decorations might also redirect enough attacks to make them worthwhile .
Life - like decoys
So they tested the idea on another species Cyclosa mulmeinensis living on Orchid Island off the southeast coast of Taiwan .
This species decorates its web with both the remains of dead insect prey and egg sacs .
Intriguingly , the spiders made prey pellets and egg sacs that were the same size as its own body .
The researchers also found that these decorations appeared to wasps to be the same colour , and reflect light in the same way , as the spider 's body .
In short , the spider made decorations that were of the same size , shape and appearance as itself .
" Our results show that this vulnerable spider protects itself from predator attacks by constructing decoys that increase the conspicuousness of the web , and resemble its own appearance in size and colour , " the researchers write in Animal Behaviour .
A female C. mulmeinensis
" When both spiders and web decorations are present on the same web , they look like a string of nearly identical oval objects to the predators . "
" I do n't know of any animal that actively builds a decoy of itself .
Our study seems to be the first to empirically demonstrate the function of animal - made decoys , " says Tso .
The decoys worked , too .
More often than not , a wasp would attack a decoy rather than the spider , thinking it to be a tasty meal .
But all wasp strikes on spiders living on undecorated webs were directed straight at the spider .
" Decorations built by Cyclosa spiders function as a conspicuous anti-predator device instead of a camouflaging device .
The benefit of successful escape from predator attack seems to outweigh the cost of increased detection , " says Tso .
Web decorations Scientists have been trying to answer the question of why many species decorate their webs for more than 100 years .
Tso suspects that there is no single answer .
" I think that the functions of web decorations might be very diverse and differ from taxa to taxa .
Different spiders seem to decorate their webs for different reasons , " he says .
For example , spiders often decorate their webs with silk ornaments , which might strengthen the web , act as a warning signal to predators , to deter large animals from accidentally walking into the web , destroying it , or to act as a visual signal to attract prey .
Others , including Cyclosa species , may use non-silk decorations primarily as anti-predator devices .

Some day -- maybe even soon -- China will turn pessimistic on the U.S. dollar .
That means lethal troubles for the future U.S. economy .
When a disorderly run against the dollar occurs , I believe a truly global financial panic is to be feared .
China , Japan and Korea now hold dollars not because they think dollars will stay safe .
Why then ?.....
The given in this equation is that the amounts of Treasuries coming on to the market in the years ahead is enormous .
Growing supply , and the likelihood that U. S. Treasury debt will get downgraded , means that the risk premium for owning longer dated treasuries is likely to rise and rise sharply .
These are sobering words from renowned economist Paul Samuelson .
The threat that China and others countries might divest the dollar is starting to cause jitters in the Treasury market .
If the countries Samuelson mentioned held on to their dollar assets -- but cut back on their purchases of U.S. Treasuries -- interest rates higher immediately .
Regarding Bill O’Reilly ’s campaign against George Dr. Tiller , as reported by Gabriel Winant at Salon , a recent precedent exists for a civil lawsuit against O’Reilly .
If you have read the book A Hundred Little Hitlers : The Death of a Black Man , the Trial of a White Racist , and the Rise of the Neo - Nazi Movement in America by Elinor Langer , you ’ll no doubt agree with her ( though no white power advocate , she ) that the godfather of American white power , Tom Metzger , was railroaded .
But this Wikipedia passage accurately explains in brief how he was convicted :
The group was eventually bankrupted as the result of a civil lawsuit centered on its involvement in the 1988 murder of Mulugeta Seraw , an Ethiopian man who came to the United States to attend college .
In 1988 , white power skinheads affiliated to WAR [ White Aryan Resistance ] were convicted of killing Seraw and sent to prison .
Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a civil suit against him , arguing that WAR influenced Seraw ’s killers by encouraging their group East Side White Pride to commit violence .
At the trial , WAR national vice president Dave Mazzella testified on how the Metzgers instructed WAR members to commit violence against minorities .
Tom and John Metzger were found civilly liable under the doctrine of vicarious liability , in which one can be liable for a tort committed by a subordinate or by another person who is taking instructions .
The jury returned the largest civil verdict in Oregon history at the time — $ 12.5 million — against Metzger and WAR .
The Metzgers ’ house was seized , and most of WAR ’s profits go to paying off the judgment .

At any time between 1750 and 1930 , if you had asked an educated person to describe the goal of poetry , art , or music , “ beauty ” would have been the answer .
And if you had asked what the point of that was , you would have learned that beauty is a value , as important in its way as truth and goodness , and indeed hardly distinguishable from them .
Philosophers of the Enlightenment saw beauty as a way in which lasting moral and spiritual values acquire sensuous form .
And no Romantic painter , musician , or writer would have denied that beauty was the final purpose of his art .
At some time during the aftermath of modernism , beauty ceased to receive those tributes .
Art increasingly aimed to disturb , subvert , or transgress moral certainties , and it was not beauty but originality — however achieved and at whatever moral cost — that won the prizes .
Indeed , there arose a widespread suspicion of beauty as next in line to kitsch — something too sweet and inoffensive for the serious modern artist to pursue .
In a seminal essay — “ Avant - Garde and Kitsch , ” published in Partisan Review in 1939 — critic Clement Greenberg starkly contrasted the avant - garde of his day with the figurative painting that competed with it , dismissing the latter ( not just Norman Rockwell , but greats like Edward Hopper ) as derivative and without lasting significance .
The avant - garde , for Greenberg , promoted the disturbing and the provocative over the soothing and the decorative , and that was why we should admire it .
The value of abstract art , Greenberg claimed , lay not in beauty but in expression .
This emphasis on expression was a legacy of the Romantic movement ; but now it was joined by the conviction that the artist is outside bourgeois society , defined in opposition to it , so that artistic self - expression is at the same time a transgression of ordinary moral norms .
We find this posture overtly adopted in the art of Austria and Germany between the wars — for example , in the paintings and drawings of Georg Grosz , in Alban Berg ’s opera Lulu ( a loving portrait of a woman whose only discernible goal is moral chaos ) , and in the seedy novels of Heinrich Mann .
And the cult of transgression is a leading theme of the postwar literature of France — from the writings of Georges Bataille , Jean Genet , and Jean - Paul Sartre to the bleak emptiness of the nouveau roman .
Of course , there were great artists who tried to rescue beauty from the perceived disruption of modern society — as T. S. Eliot tried to recompose , in Four Quartets , the fragments he had grieved over in The Waste Land .
And there were others , particularly in America , who refused to see the sordid and the transgressive as the truth of the modern world .
For artists like Hopper , Samuel Barber , and Wallace Stevens , ostentatious transgression was mere sentimentality , a cheap way to stimulate an audience , and a betrayal of the sacred task of art , which is to magnify life as it is and to reveal its beauty — as Stevens reveals the beauty of “ An Ordinary Evening in New Haven ” and Barber that of Knoxville : Summer of 1915 .
But somehow those great life - affirmers lost their position at the forefront of modern culture .
So far as the critics and the wider culture were concerned , the pursuit of beauty was at the margins of the artistic enterprise .
Qualities like disruptiveness and immorality , which previously signified aesthetic failure , became marks of success ; while the pursuit of beauty became a retreat from the real task of artistic creation .
This process has been so normalized as to become a critical orthodoxy , prompting the philosopher Arthur Danto to argue recently that beauty is both deceptive as a goal and in some way antipathetic to the mission of modern art .
Art has acquired another status and another social role .
The great proof of this change is in the productions of opera , which give the denizens of postmodern culture an unparalleled opportunity to take revenge on the art of the past and to hide its beauty behind an obscene and sordid mask .
We all assume that this will happen with Wagner , who “ asked for it ” by believing too strongly in the redemptive role of art .
But it now regularly happens to the innocent purveyors of beauty , just as soon as a postmodernist producer gets his hands on one of their works .
An example that particularly struck me was a 2004 production of Mozart ’s Die Entführung aus dem Serail at the Komische Oper Berlin ( see “ The Abduction of Opera , ” Summer 2007 ) .
Die Entführung tells the story of Konstanze — shipwrecked , separated from her fiancé Belmonte , and taken to serve in the harem of the Pasha Selim .
After various intrigues , Belmonte rescues her , helped by the clemency of the Pasha — who , respecting Konstanze ’s chastity and the couple ’s faithful love , declines to take her by force .
This implausible plot permits Mozart to express his Enlightenment conviction that charity is a universal virtue , as real in the Muslim empire of the Turks as in the Christian empire of the enlightened Joseph II .
Even if Mozart ’s innocent vision is without much historical basis , his belief in the reality of disinterested love is everywhere expressed and endorsed by the music .
Die Entführung advances a moral idea , and its melodies share the beauty of that idea and persuasively present it to the listener .
In his production of Die Entführung , the Catalan stage director Calixto Bieito set the opera in a Berlin brothel , with Selim as pimp and Konstanze one of the prostitutes .
Even during the most tender music , copulating couples littered the stage , and every opportunity for violence , with or without a sexual climax , was taken .
At one point , a prostitute is gratuitously tortured , and her nipples bloodily and realistically severed before she is killed .
The words and the music speak of love and compassion , but their message is drowned out by the scenes of desecration , murder , and narcissistic sex .
That is an example of something familiar in every aspect of our contemporary culture .
It is not merely that artists , directors , musicians , and others connected with the arts are in flight from beauty .
Wherever beauty lies in wait for us , there arises a desire to preempt its appeal , to smother it with scenes of destruction .
Hence the many works of contemporary art that rely on shocks administered to our failing faith in human nature — such as the crucifix pickled in urine by Andres Serrano .
Hence the scenes of cannibalism , dismemberment , and meaningless pain with which contemporary cinema abounds , with directors like Quentin Tarantino having little else in their emotional repertories .
Hence the invasion of pop music by rap , whose words and rhythms speak of unremitting violence , and which rejects melody , harmony , and every other device that might make a bridge to the old world of song .
And hence the music video , which has become an art form in itself and is often devoted to concentrating into the time span of a pop song some startling new account of moral chaos .
Those phenomena record a habit of desecration in which life is not celebrated by art but targeted by it .
Artists can now make their reputations by constructing an original frame in which to display the human face and throw dung at it .
What do we make of this , and how do we find our way back to the thing so many people long for , which is the vision of beauty ?
It may sound a little sentimental to speak of a “ vision of beauty . ”
But what I mean is not some saccharine , Christmas - card image of human life but rather the elementary ways in which ideals and decencies enter our ordinary world and make themselves known , as love and charity make themselves known in Mozart ’s music .
There is a great hunger for beauty in our world , a hunger that our popular art fails to recognize and our serious art often defies .
I used the word “ desecration ” to describe the attitude conveyed by Bieito ’s production of Die Entführung and by Serrano ’s lame efforts at meaning something .
What exactly does this word imply ?
It is connected , etymologically and semantically , with sacrilege , and therefore with the ideas of sanctity and the sacred .
To desecrate is to spoil what might otherwise be set apart in the sphere of sacred things .
We can desecrate a church , a graveyard , a tomb ; and also a holy image , a holy book , or a holy ceremony .
We can desecrate a corpse , a cherished image , even a living human being — insofar as these things contain ( as they do ) a portent of some original sanctity .
The fear of desecration is a vital element in all religions .
Indeed , that is what the word religio originally meant : a cult or ceremony designed to protect some sacred place from sacrilege .

In the eighteenth century , when organized religion and ceremonial kingship were losing their authority , when the democratic spirit was questioning inherited institutions , and when the idea was abroad that it was not God but man who made laws for the human world , the idea of the sacred suffered an eclipse .
To the thinkers of the Enlightenment , it seemed little more than a superstition to believe that artifacts , buildings , places , and ceremonies could possess a sacred character , when all these things were the products of human design .
The idea that the divine reveals itself in our world , and seeks our worship , seemed both implausible in itself and incompatible with science .
At the same time , philosophers like Shaftesbury , Burke , Adam Smith , and Kant recognized that we do not look on the world only with the eyes of science .
Another attitude exists — one not of scientific inquiry but of disinterested contemplation — that we direct toward our world in search of its meaning .
When we take this attitude , we set our interests aside ; we are no longer occupied with the goals and projects that propel us through time ; we are no longer engaged in explaining things or enhancing our power .
We are letting the world present itself and taking comfort in its presentation .
This is the origin of the experience of beauty .
There may be no way of accounting for that experience as part of our ordinary search for power and knowledge .
It may be impossible to assimilate it to the day - to - day uses of our faculties .
But it is an experience that self - evidently exists , and it is of the greatest value to those who receive it .
When does this experience occur , and what does it mean ?
Here is an example : suppose you are walking home in the rain , your thoughts occupied with your work .
The streets and the houses pass by unnoticed ; the people , too , pass you by ; nothing invades your thinking save your interests and anxieties .
Then suddenly the sun emerges from the clouds , and a ray of sunlight alights on an old stone wall beside the road and trembles there .
You glance up at the sky where the clouds are parting , and a bird bursts into song in a garden behind the wall .
Your heart fills with joy , and your selfish thoughts are scattered .
The world stands before you , and you are content simply to look at it and let it be .
Maybe such experiences are rarer now than they were in the eighteenth century , when the poets and philosophers lighted upon them as a new avenue to religion .
The haste and disorder of modern life , the alienating forms of modern architecture , the noise and spoliation of modern industry — these things have made the pure encounter with beauty a rarer , more fragile , and more unpredictable thing for us .
Still , we all know what it is to find ourselves suddenly transported , by the things we see , from the ordinary world of our appetites to the illuminated sphere of contemplation .
It happens often during childhood , though it is seldom interpreted then .
It happens during adolescence , when it lends itself to our erotic longings .
And it happens in a subdued way in adult life , secretly shaping our life projects , holding out to us an image of harmony that we pursue through holidays , through home - building , and through our private dreams .
Here is another example : it is a special occasion , when the family unites for a ceremonial dinner .
You set the table with a clean embroidered cloth , arranging plates , glasses , bread in a basket , and some carafes of water and wine .
You do this lovingly , delighting in the appearance , striving for an effect of cleanliness , simplicity , symmetry , and warmth .
The table has become a symbol of homecoming , of the extended arms of the universal mother , inviting her children in .
And all this abundance of meaning and good cheer is somehow contained in the appearance of the table .
This , too , is an experience of beauty , one that we encounter , in some version or other , every day .
We are needy creatures , and our greatest need is for home — the place where we are , where we find protection and love .
We achieve this home through representations of our own belonging , not alone but in conjunction with others .
All our attempts to make our surroundings look right — through decorating , arranging , creating — are attempts to extend a welcome to ourselves and to those whom we love .
This second example suggests that our human need for beauty is not simply a redundant addition to the list of human appetites .
It is not something that we could lack and still be fulfilled as people .
It is a need arising from our metaphysical condition as free individuals , seeking our place in an objective world .
We can wander through this world , alienated , resentful , full of suspicion and distrust .
Or we can find our home here , coming to rest in harmony with others and with ourselves .
The experience of beauty guides us along this second path : it tells us that we are at home in the world , that the world is already ordered in our perceptions as a place fit for the lives of beings like us .
Look at any picture by one of the great landscape painters — Poussin , Guardi , Turner , Corot , Cézanne — and you will see that idea of beauty celebrated and fixed in images .
The art of landscape painting , as it arose in the seventeenth century and endured into our time , is devoted to moralizing nature and showing the place of human freedom in the scheme of things .
It is not that landscape painters turn a blind eye to suffering , or to the vastness and threateningness of the universe of which we occupy so small a corner .
Far from it .
Landscape painters show us death and decay in the very heart of things : the light on their hills is a fading light ; the stucco walls of Guardi ’s houses are patched and crumbling .
But their images point to the joy that lies incipient in decay and to the eternal implied in the transient .
They are images of home .
Not surprisingly , the idea of beauty has puzzled philosophers .
The experience of beauty is so vivid , so immediate , so personal , that it seems hardly to belong to the natural order as science observes it .
Yet beauty shines on us from ordinary things .
Is it a feature of the world , or a figment of the imagination ?
Is it telling us something real and true that requires just this experience to be recognized ?
Or is it merely a heightened moment of sensation , of no significance beyond the delight of the person who experiences it ?
These questions are of great urgency for us , since we live at a time when beauty is in eclipse : a dark shadow of mockery and alienation has crept across the once - shining surface of our world , like the shadow of the Earth across the moon .
Where we look for beauty , we too often find darkness and desecration .
The current habit of desecrating beauty suggests that people are as aware as they ever were of the presence of sacred things .
Desecration is a kind of defense against the sacred , an attempt to destroy its claims .
In the presence of sacred things , our lives are judged , and to escape that judgment , we destroy the thing that seems to accuse us .
Christians have inherited from Saint Augustine and from Plato the vision of this transient world as an icon of another and changeless order .
They understand the sacred as a revelation in the here and now of the eternal sense of our being .
But the experience of the sacred is not confined to Christians .
It is , according to many philosophers and anthropologists , a human universal .
For the most part , transitory purposes organize our lives : the day - to - day concerns of economic reasoning , the small - scale pursuit of power and comfort , the need for leisure and pleasure .
Little of this is memorable or moving to us .
Every now and then , however , we are jolted out of our complacency and feel ourselves to be in the presence of something vastly more significant than our present interests and desires .
We sense the reality of something precious and mysterious , which reaches out to us with a claim that is , in some way , not of this world .
This happens in the presence of death , especially the death of someone loved .
We look with awe on the human body from which the life has fled .
This is no longer a person but the “ mortal remains ” of a person .
And this thought fills us with a sense of the uncanny .
We are reluctant to touch the dead body ; we see it as , in some way , not properly a part of our world , almost a visitor from some other sphere .
This experience , a paradigm of our encounter with the sacred , demands from us a kind of ceremonial recognition .
The dead body is the object of rituals and acts of purification , designed not just to send its former occupant happily into the hereafter — for these practices are engaged in even by those who have no belief in the hereafter — but in order to overcome the eeriness , the supernatural quality , of the dead human form .
The body is being reclaimed for this world by the rituals that acknowledge that it also stands apart from it .
The rituals , to put it another way , consecrate the body , and so purify it of its miasma .
By the same token , the body can be desecrated — and this is surely one of the primary acts of desecration , one to which people have been given from time immemorial , as when Achilles dragged Hector ’s body in triumph around the walls of Troy .
The presence of a transcendental claim startles us out of our day - to - day preoccupations on other occasions , too .
In particular , there is the experience of falling in love .
This , too , is a human universal , and it is an experience of the strangest kind .
The face and body of the beloved are imbued with the intensest life .
But in one crucial respect , they are like the body of someone dead : they seem not to belong in the empirical world .
The beloved looks on the lover as Beatrice looked on Dante , from a point outside the flow of temporal things .
The beloved object demands that we cherish it , that we approach it with almost ritualistic reverence .
And there radiates from those eyes and limbs and words a kind of fullness of spirit that makes everything anew .
Poets have expended thousands of words on this experience , which no words seem entirely to capture .
It has fueled the sense of the sacred down the ages , reminding people as diverse as Plato and Calvino , Virgil and Baudelaire , that sexual desire is not the simple appetite that we witness in animals but the raw material of a longing that has no easy or worldly satisfaction , demanding of us nothing less than a change of life .
Many of the uglinesses cultivated in our world today refer back to the two experiences that I have singled out .
The body in the throes of death ; the body in the throes of sex — these things easily fascinate us .
They fascinate us by desecrating the human form , by showing the human body as a mere object among objects , the human spirit as eclipsed and ineffectual , and the human being as overcome by external forces , rather than as a free subject bound by the moral law .
And it is on these things that the art of our time seems to concentrate , offering us not only sexual pornography but a pornography of violence that reduces the human being to a lump of suffering flesh made pitiful , helpless , and disgusting .
All of us have a desire to flee from the demands of responsible existence , in which we treat one another as worthy of reverence and respect .
All of us are tempted by the idea of flesh and by the desire to remake the human being as pure flesh — an automaton , obedient to mechanical desires .
To yield to this temptation , however , we must first remove the chief obstacle to it : the consecrated nature of the human form .
We must sully the experiences — such as death and sex — that otherwise call us away from temptations , toward the higher life of sacrifice .
This willful desecration is also a denial of love — an attempt to remake the world as though love were no longer a part of it .
And that , surely , is the most important characteristic of the postmodern culture : it is a loveless culture , determined to portray the human world as unlovable .
The modern stage director who ransacks the works of Mozart is trying to tear the love from the heart of them , so as to confirm his own vision of the world as a place where only pleasure and pain are real .
That suggests a simple remedy , which is to resist temptation .
Instead of desecrating the human form , we should learn again to revere it .
For there is absolutely nothing to gain from the insults hurled at beauty by those — like Calixto Bieito — who cannot bear to look it in the face .
Yes , we can neutralize the high ideals of Mozart by pushing his music into the background so that it becomes the mere accompaniment to an inhuman carnival of sex and death .
But what do we learn from this ?
What do we gain , in terms of emotional , spiritual , intellectual , or moral development ?
Nothing , save anxiety .
We should take a lesson from this kind of desecration : in attempting to show us that our human ideals are worthless , it shows itself to be worthless .
And when something shows itself to be worthless , it is time to throw it away .
It is therefore plain that the culture of transgression achieves nothing save the loss that it revels in : the loss of beauty as a value and a goal .
But why is beauty a value ?
It is an ancient view that truth , goodness , and beauty cannot , in the end , conflict .
Maybe the degeneration of beauty into kitsch comes precisely from the postmodern loss of truthfulness , and with it the loss of moral direction .
That is the message of such early modernists as Eliot , Barber , and Stevens , and it is a message that we need to listen to .
To mount a full riposte to the habit of desecration , we need to rediscover the affirmation and the truth to life without which artistic beauty cannot be realized .
This is no easy task .
If we look at the true apostles of beauty in our time — I think of composers like Henri Dutilleux and Olivier Messiaen , of poets like Derek Walcott and Charles Tomlinson , of prose writers like Italo Calvino and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn — we are immediately struck by the immense hard work , the studious isolation , and the attention to detail that characterizes their craft .
In art , beauty has to be won , but the work becomes harder as the sheer noise of desecration — amplified now by the Internet — drowns out the quiet voices murmuring in the heart of things .
One response is to look for beauty in its other and more everyday forms — the beauty of settled streets and cheerful faces , of natural objects and genial landscapes .
It is possible to throw dirt on these things , too , and it is the mark of a second - rate artist to take such a path to our attention — the via negativa of desecration .
But it is also possible to return to ordinary things in the spirit of Wallace Stevens and Samuel Barber — to show that we are at home with them and that they magnify and vindicate our life .
Such is the overgrown path that the early modernists once cleared for us — the via positiva of beauty .
There is no reason yet to think that we must abandon it .

Last week the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California issued a press release demanding the Department of Defense stop teaching employees that dissent is a form of low - level terrorism .
“ Teaching employees that dissent on issues of public concern is something to be feared , rather than encouraged , is a dangerously counterproductive use of scarce security resources , making us less safe as a democracy , ” Northern California ACLU Staff Attorney Ann Brick and ACLU Washington National Security Policy Council Michael German wrote in a letter to Gail McGinn , Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness .
In the 1970s , the Pentagon , the CIA and the FBI , the National Guard , and various state and local police agencies worked in unison to snoop on and subvert the antiwar and civil rights movements .
A multiple choice question included on a Level 1 Antiterrorism Awareness training course required for all DoD personnel asks the following question : “ Which of the following is an example of low - level terrorist activity ? ”
The correct answer is “ protests . ”
The ACLU wants the question removed .
“ For the DoD to instruct its employees that lawful protest activities should be treated as ‘ low - level terrorism ’ is deeply disturbing in and of itself , ” write Brick and German of the ACLU in the letter to Gail McGinn .
“ It is an even more egregious insult to constitutional values , however , when viewed in the context of a long - term pattern of domestic security initiatives that have attempted to equate lawful dissent with terrorism . ”
Brick and German underscore documented military snooping on hundreds of legal anti-war and military protests , the FBI ’s surveillance of protests at the RNC , and state police and sheriff departments covert surveillance of peace groups .
“ Policing ideas , rather than criminal activities , runs counter to our nation ’s core principles , undermining the very foundations of the free society that the Department of Defense is dedicated to preserving . ”
In fact , the Department of Defense is dedicated to preserving the criminal activity of the banksters and undermining the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
“ I spent 33 years in the Marines .
Most of my time being a high - class muscle man for Big Business , for Wall Street and the bankers .
In short , I was a racketeer for capitalism , ” wrote the most decorated Marine in U.S. history , Smedley Butler , in his 1935 book , War Is a Racket .
“ Looking back on it , I might have given Al Capone a few hints . ”
Since Butler ’s days , the Pentagon has vastly upgraded its Mafia techniques and has expanded its war to include the American people .
As Episcopal priest and activist Frank Morales notes , the Pentagon has declared war on America :
The “ domestic war on terrorism ” hinges upon the Pentagon ’s doctrine of homeland defense .
Mountains of repressive legislation are being enacted in the name of internal security .
So called “ homeland security ” , originally set within the Pentagon ’s “ operations other than war ” , is actually a case in which the Pentagon has declared war on America .
Shaping up as the new battleground , this proliferating military “ doctrine ” seeks to justify new roles and missions for the Pentagon within America .
Vast “ legal ” authority and funds to spy on the dissenting public , reconfigured as terrorist threats , is being lavished upon the defense , intelligence and law enforcement “ community . ”
“ Here in America , all distinction between the military and police functions is about to be forever expunged with the looming repeal of the Posse Comitatus Act , ” continues Morales .
It is a “ New World Law and Order ” based on the repeal of the Posse Comitatus Act that requires a system of domestic and global counterinsurgency led by the Pentagon .
“ The objective is to centralize all intelligence gathering under one roof , the Department of Homeland Security and to widely cast the net over all of us , making certain that we all fall in line with the Pentagon Inc. agenda . ”
In the 1970s , the Pentagon , the CIA and the FBI , the National Guard , and various state and local police agencies worked in unison to snoop on and subvert the antiwar and civil rights movements .
“ Back in the late 1960s and early ’ 70s the FBI , the military , local police and campus police had their own bailiwicks and limited powers ” says Christopher Pyle , a former investigator for Senator Frank Church ’s Select Committee on Intelligence in the 1970s .
“ But operating today through the JTTFs and the combined intelligence and fusion centers , which join military analysts with law enforcement specialists , they are all part of one big club , effectively destroying the Fourth Amendment against unlimited search and seizure . ”
The “ Big Club ” and “ Pentagon Inc ” has sharpened its treasonous tools immeasurably since the day in 1969 when it opened a new war room in the basement of the Pentagon and created the headquarters of the Directorate for Civil Disturbance Planning and Operations .
“ In the fall of 1968 , there were more Army Counter - lntelligence Analysis Branch personnel assigned to monitor domestic citizen protests than were assigned to any other counter - intelligence operation in the world , including Southeast Asia and the Vietnam War , ” write Morton Halperin , Jerry Berman , Robert Borosage , Christine Marwick in their study on the crimes of U.S. intelligence agencies .
With the exception of the FBI , the military intelligence services collected more information on American politics in the sixties than any other federal agency .
The army conducted a full - scale Pentagon operation within the United States , and the figures and attitudes reflect this approach .
Where a civilian agency might have opened a hundred files , the military created a thousand ; the army established CONUS and CONARC intelligence commands , and then reorganized and reinitiated them as USAINTC , the Directorate of Civil Disturbance Planning , and the Division of Military Support .
They ran operations with such code names as GARDEN PLOT , ROSE BUSH , PUNCH BLOCK , STEEP HILL , LANTERN SPIKE , QUIET TOWN , GRAM METRIC , and CABLE SPLICER ; and they developed intelligence “ compendiums , ” a “ mug book , ” daily , weekly and monthly intelligence summaries , special reports , “ city packets , ” contingency and alternative contingency plans , computerized filing systems , and crossover index files to information .
All were based on agent spot reports , radio intercepts , incident and personality files , newspaper clippings and data from numerous civilian sources .
Each level of the military hierarchy tried to placate its superiors by collecting as much or more information than the task required , whether it was of any importance or not .
The attitude pervading these army operations was best stated by Robert E. Jordan III , general counsel to the army : “ the people on the other side were essentially the enemy .
The army conducted a de facto war against all citizen protest , legitimate and illegitimate , violent and peaceful , white and black .
Jordan ’s remark is as pertinent today as it was 30 some odd years ago — the American people are the enemy and the de facto war is to be waged against all citizen protest .
Index files have been replaced by quasi - supercomputing and DARPA ’s Total Information Awareness , now deemed Terrorist Information Awareness .

In the 1960s and early 70s , the enemy was largely the anti-war movement .
The government did a smashing job of subverting and hobbling that movement — thanks to multifarious Pentagon operations and the FBI ’s COINTELPRO — and the so - called anti-war movement is today a pale reflection of its former self .
In fact , much of that movement today is financed and controlled by globalist foundations , thus rendered absurdly ineffective , a fact revealed by Bush ’s comment that the splintered and factional movement opposed to the Iraq invasion and occupation was nothing more than a “ focus group . ”
For the Pentagon and its globalist overlords , today ’s enemy consists of the so - called patriot movement , recently characterized as purveyors of “ rightwing extremism ” by the Department of Homeland Security .
It is no mistake the Fox News disinfo operative Glenn Beck has sidled up to constitutionalists and libertarians while characterizing 9/11 activists as a dire threat to the homeland in league with the CIA contrivance al - Qaeda .
It is no mistake the corporate media and scribes working for George Soros have put in overtime to malign Alex Jones — largely considered the leader of the 9/11 movement — and attach him to a demented cop killer and a white supremacist who killed a security guard at a Holocaust museum .
It should come as no surprise a DoD Antiterrorism Awareness training course characterizes dissidents as “ low level ” terrorists .
Such indoctrination and brainwashing will make it easier for soldiers and DHS paramilitaries — including “ public - private partnership ” ( fascist ) shock troops such as InfraGard and soon enough Obama ’s “ public service ” Jugendbewegung — to not only round - up and intern dissidents but shoot them down in numbers as they were shot down in their millions by Stalin and Mao in the blood - soaked 20th century .

It ’s funny the way random little factoids stick in my head , even after many years .
When I was in eighth grade , I did a report for my science class on Pascal ’s Law , a description of the way fluids behave in a closed system ( and the basis of all hydraulics , among other things ) .
In the course of researching that project I came across a tiny piece of information that blew my 13 - year - old mind : the word fluid is not a synonym of liquid ; a fluid can be a liquid or a gas .
Really ?
I ’ve been breathing a fluid all my life ?
I just could n’t get over it .
Neither could my friends — I thought my endless recitations of trivia made me look smarter , but they found it annoying .
Years later , I read a Star Trek novel in which the crew of the Enterprise encountered a race of humanoid beings who breathed a liquid ; the book went to great lengths to describe what that experience was like for one of the humans who had to interact with them .
Although this fictional liquid was compatible with human lungs , the psychological shock of breathing a liquid was pretty intense .
Later still , the very same concept showed up in the 1989 film The Abyss , as well as in Dan Brown ’s 2009 novel The Lost Symbol , among other places .
But hey , that ’s all just science fiction , right ?
Amazingly enough , humans can indeed breathe certain very special liquids .
Fluid Thinking
In order for any fluid to work for human respiration , it has to perform two main functions extremely well : delivering oxygen to the lungs and removing carbon dioxide .
Air obviously does both ; so do some other combinations of gases ( such as those used in diving ) .
But it ’s reasonable to think some liquids may be able to do the same thing .
The first experiments involving respiration of a liquid took place in the 1960s .
Mice were made to breathe a saline solution with a high concentration of dissolved oxygen .
The mice survived for a little while , but although the solution delivered enough oxygen , it was ineffective at removing carbon dioxide ; over time , it also caused damage to the lungs .
A few years later , researchers began experimenting with perfluorocarbons , or perfluorinated hydrocarbons — liquids similar to freon that ( despite being unfriendly to the ozone layer when they evaporate ) are able to dissolve both oxygen and carbon dioxide readily .
Initial results were much better than with the oxygenated saline solutions , and mice were able to return to normal gas breathing afterward .
Over the next several decades , the formulas for breathable perfluorocarbons ( PFCs ) were refined further .
The best - known liquid of this kind is called perflubron , also known by the brand name LiquiVent .
Perflubron is a clear , oily liquid with twice the density of water .
It has the capability to carry more than twice as much oxygen per unit of volume as air .
And it ’s inert , so it ’s unlikely to damage lung tissues .
Because it has a very low boiling point , it can be cleared from the lungs quickly and easily by evaporation .
You may be thinking : it ’s great that humans can breathe a liquid , but why would anyone want to ?
Divers Uses
The primary application of liquid breathing is the medical treatment of certain lung problems .
For example , babies born prematurely often have underdeveloped lungs .
Because perflubron can carry more oxygen than air , it can help relieve respiratory distress until the lungs are able to function with regular air .
But it has also been used for adults with acute respiratory failure , whether due to disease , trauma , burns , or the inhalation of smoke , water , or other toxins .
The liquid encourages collapsed alveoli to open , washes out contaminants , and provides better exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide for lungs that are not fully functional .
In clinical use , the lungs are usually not filled completely with the liquid ; instead , liquid ventilation is usually used in conjunction with conventional gas ventilation .
Another potential use for liquid breathing is in diving .
Ordinarily , divers must breathe heavily pressurized gases to prevent their lungs from collapsing deep underwater , but this requires decompression on the way up and carries the risk of nitrogen narcosis and numerous other problems .
If the lungs were filled with a liquid instead , most of those problems would simply disappear .
This would , in theory , enable divers to reach greater depths , ascend more quickly , and experience somewhat lower risks .
Despite what we see in the movies , this technique is not yet ready for prime time , but with advances in equipment , fluid formulas , and training , liquid breathing could someday change the nature of diving dramatically .
It could also have an application in helping to protect against high G forces during space travel .
For all these amazing benefits , liquid breathing still involves one major difficulty : it ’s much harder for human lungs to move liquid in and out than it is to breathe air .
Even though perflubron is so much better than air at carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide , that advantage can be lost if you do n’t circulate it rapidly enough .
Without the use of a mechanical ventilator , this is going to be especially problematic for someone who ’s ill , and even a diver in top condition could become exhausted from such laborious breathing during a deep and strenuous dive .
So I wo n’t be making plans to live at the bottom of a PFC - filled swimming pool , but it certainly is intriguing to think that a lung full of liquid could prevent me from drowning .

The images were captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) sensors on NASA ’s Terra and Aqua satellites .
The brown ash plumes stand out sharply compared to clouds .
Each time one of the satellites passed overhead , the location of the plume had shifted dramatically .
Between the two overpasses on June 14 , the ash spread north and west from the volcano .
On June 15 , a compact plume of ash towered over the volcano during Terra ’s view of the area .
By the time Aqua observed the volcano , the ash had spread out to the east and west .
On June 15 , the U.S. Air Force Weather Agency ( AFWA ) reported that the ash from Sarychev Peak had been detected up to 1,300 nautical miles ( about 2,407 kilometers ) east - southeast of the volcano and 500 nautical miles ( 926 kilometers ) west - northwest .
Volcanic ash is not like the soft , fluffy ash produced by burning vegetation .
It is tiny , abrasive particles of glass and rock that pose serious hazards to aircraft engines .
Satellite observations of ash play a crucial role in helping meteorologists and air traffic controllers steer airplanes clear of dangerous volcanic emissions .

“ No one has ever put up a plan to compete that exploited the bargaining leverage that you have with Medicare , ” said John F. Sheils , a senior vice president at Lewin , which is owned by UnitedHealth Group , a major insurer .
“ It ’s never been done , and if it ’s never been done there ’s not much you can conclude from looking at these state plans . ”
Mr. Sheils estimated that only 12 million people with private coverage would migrate to a public plan if Congress provided protections for insurers , along principles suggested by Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York .
Seeking to broker a deal that might attract Republican support , Mr. Schumer is promoting many of Mr. Nichols ’s proposals , including that a public plan be subject to the same regulations as private plans and that it pay providers at higher levels than Medicare .
The question , at a time of deep concern over health costs , is whether that proposal would compromise away the full potential of a public plan to suppress provider payments and control the growth of premiums .
And it 's rather interesting how a lobbyist for UnitedHealth , one of the WORST insurers , thinks that the Schumer so - called " public option " compromise would be okay .
This is why I always specify what kind of a public option to fight for -- a strong , robust Medicare - like public option , NOT the Schumer so - called compromise .
This is what I wrote about what I viewed as the dangerous parts of the so - called Schumer " public option " compromise :
I do n't think the public plan should be self - sustaining , because if it 's wholly reliant on money raised from premiums and co-payments , that means that the premiums and co-payments will be higher than those of the premiums and co-payments offered by private health plans .
And yes , the government should compel doctors and hospitals to participate in a public plan , otherwise the doctors and hospitals will refuse to take the patients in the public plan just like they refuse to take on any new Medicare patients .
In order for the public plan to work , it has to have widespread participation by medical professionals which translate to universal access for Americans .
In any city , town , or state , they should be able to go to a doctor who can't refuse to take them on .
In a small town , a doctor might be enticed by private plan insurers to refuse patients from the public option .
That 's why I 'm against the second bullet point in Senator Schumer 's cockamamie proposal .
And there should be NO private officials to manage a public plan .
It MUST be managed by the government to promote efficiency and to reduce administrative overhead in the public plan .
There can be NO appointment of officials from the private health insurance industry to manage the public plan .
This sort of " middle ground " is unacceptable for me .
We NEED have a strong , robust Medicare - like public option with NO " 7 - year triggers " or " conditions " designed to weaken it in favor of private health insurance companies .
On Friday , the Congressional Progressive Caucus , which numbers over 80 Democrats in the House stood up for a strong , robust Medicare - like public option in their principles below :
The Congressional Progressive Caucus calls for a robust public option that must be : • Unconditional .
Enact concurrently with other significant expansions of coverage and must not be conditioned on private industry actions .
• Actually Public .
Consist of one entity , operated by the federal government , which sets policies and bears the risk for paying medical claims to keep administrative costs low and provide a higher standard of care .
• Available to All .
Be available to all individuals and employers across the nation without limitation
• Choice of Doctors .
Allow patients to have access to their choice of doctors and other providers that meet defined participation standards , similar to the traditional Medicare model , promote the medical home model , and eliminate lifetime caps on benefits .
• Paid for Wellness , not Sickness .
Have the ability to structure the provider rates to promote quality care , primary care , prevention , chronic care management , and good public health .
• Built on Proven Model of Medicare .
Utilize the existing infrastructure of successful public programs like Medicare in order to maintain transparency and consumer protections for administering processes including payment systems , claims and appeals .
• Can negotiate payments .
Establish or negotiate rates with pharmaceutical companies , durable medical equipment providers , and other providers to achieve the lowest prices for consumers .
• Equally Supported .
Receive a level of subsidy and support that is no less than that received by private plans .
• Real Competition .
Ensure premiums must be priced at the lowest levels possible , not tied to the rates of private insurance plans .
Now , what is this " 7 - year trigger " for the public option in health care reform , you ask ?
Basically , they 'll insert a strong Medicare - like public option in the final bill but have it as a " trigger " only to set in SEVEN YEARS FROM NOW if private insurance fails to make health insurance affordable for Americans .
Robert Reich , as I posted before , has said that this is being floated as an attractive compromise to attract Republican votes in order to give this health care reform bill the sheen of " bipartisanship " that is craved by politicians .
All this will be decided within days or weeks .
And once those who want to kill the public option without their fingerprints on the murder weapon begin to agree on a proposal -- Snowe 's " trigger " or any other -- the public option will be very hard to revive .
The White House must now insist on a genuine public option .
And you , dear reader , must insist as well .
This is it , folks .
The concrete is being mixed and about to be poured .
And after it 's poured and hardens , universal health care will be with us for years to come in whatever form it now takes .
Let your representative and senators know you want a public option without conditions or triggers -- one that gives the public insurer bargaining leverage over drug companies , and pushes insurers to do what they 've promised to do .
Do n't wait until the concrete hardens and we 've lost this battle .
Which is why WHENEVER we refer to the public option , we ALWAYS should refer to it as a " strong , robust Medicare - like public option " in our phone calls , e-mails , and letters to the White House , the House of Representatives , and the Senate .
Here 's the talking points that you can and should use when calling in favor of a strong , robust Medicare - like public option , and remember , the " trigger " may happen if we do n't let up in our opposition to it in our phone calls :
Tell Senator [ Name ] that you DO NOT want the 7 - year trigger for the public option and take it off the table , and that you want him to support an affordable strong , robust Medicare - like public option .
We NEED a strong , robust Medicare - like public option NOW OPEN TO ALL AMERICANS AND AFFORDABLE , not more of the SAME broken system that 's given us unaffordable premiums , little private insurance coverage , and rising co-pays .
Also , DON'T TAX OUR EMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFITS .
Instead , follow the proposal by President Obama to tax the wealthy above $ 250,000 , eliminate the overpayments in Medicare Advantage , and put tax capital gains to help fund health care reform .
TELL YOUR SENATOR NO ON THE SCHUMER COMPROMISE .
CALL the White House at : 202-456-1111 and E - MAIL them as well !
Please CALL Senator Max Baucus at ( 202 ) 224-2651 Please CALL Senator Olympia Snowe at ( 202 ) 224-5344
Please CALL Senator Charles Schumer at 202-224-6542 Please CALL Senator Edward Kennedy at ( 202 ) 224-4543 Please CALL Senator John Rockefeller at ( 202 ) 224-6472 Please CALL Senator Ron Wyden at ( 202 ) 224-5244 Please CALL Senator Kent Conrad at ( 202 ) 224-2043 Please CALL Senator Jeff Bingaman at ( 202 ) 224-5521 Please CALL Senator John Kerry at ( 202 ) 224-2742 Please CALL Senator Blanche Lincoln at 202-224-4843 Please CALL Senator Debbie Stabenow at ( 202 ) 224-4822 Please CALL Senator Maria Cantwell at 202-224-3441 Please CALL Senator Bill Nelson at 202-224-5274 Please CALL Senator Robert Menendez at 202-224-4744 Please CALL Senator Thomas Carper at ( 202 ) 224-2441
It 's really important that we CALL these Senators on the Senate Finance Committee because some of them are still SERIOUSLY considering the 7 - year trigger for the public option in case private insurance fails .
Well , here 's a frickin ' news alert -- private insurance ALREADY has failed us .
We have to get them to stop considering the public option as a " fall - back trigger " seven years from now , because we NEED a Medicare - like public option NOW that is affordable and OPEN TO ALL Americans .
Also , can you please CALL these THREE chairmen in the House of Representatives , especially Rep. Waxman who 's leading the charge on health care reform below ?
And remember , do n't trust whatever Senator Baucus says about a public option in health care reform and we should always verify until we trust .
So , PLEASE CALL and let them KNOW that you want a Medicare - like public option in health care reform !
Ask them not to pass a bill out of the House that does NOT include a strong , robust Medicare - like public option that is AFFORDABLE AND OPEN TO ALL AMERICANS .
A Medicare - like public option is the line in the sand for me .
Is it the line in the sand for you as well ?
If so , then CALL , and please help keep this on the rec list so others can see the phone numbers , call today , and help fight against the swiftboating of a strong , robust Medicare - like public option in health care reform .
I 've also started my own blog called " The Line In The Sand " where I 'll be posting more than once a day about health care reform , the latest news with disability legislation , and other political subjects that you might be interested in as well .
Scotland Yard and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have revealed that they have successfully smashed a criminal network that used iTunes and Amazon to launder thousands of dollars obtained through credit card fraud .
It is alleged that the complicated fraud , which operated between September 2008 and January 2009 , involved selling songs to iTunes and Amazon and then purchasing the songs with stolen credit card numbers .
In doing so , the gang accrued royalties on all of the songs sold and were paid with “ clean ” money from both iTunes and Amazon .
Scotland Yard and the FBI claim that the gang bought their own songs through iTunes and Amazon thousands of times , spending about $ 750,000 using some 1,500 credit card numbers .
The royalties for their “ music ” totaled nearly $ 300,000 and did not arouse the suspicion of either company .
Detective Chief Inspector Terry Wilson , of Scotland Yard ’s e-crime unit :
This has been a complex investigation to establish what we believe to be an international conspiracy to defraud Apple and Amazon .
It shows the success that can be achieved through our close working relationship with the FBI .
We are now making it more risky for criminals who seek to exploit the internet and commit e-crime across national borders .
We are working hard through partnership with industry and law enforcement to combat e-crime and are committed to pursuing those responsible .
The joint investigation has concluded with the arrests of seven men and three women , who are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering .

By Giles Ji Ungpakorn , Turn Left Thailand
April 13 , 2009 --
For the fourth time in forty years , troops have opened fire on pro-democracy demonstrators in Bangkok .
Each time , the aim has been the same : to protect the interests of the conservative elites who have run Thailand for the past 70 years .
For those watching the cold - blooded murder by soldiers on the streets of Bangkok , it may be tempting just to assume that the present chaos is merely about different coloured T - shirts and supporters of different political parties , as though they were mirror images of each other .
This is not the case .
What we have been seeing in Thailand since late 2005 is a growing class war between the poor majority and the old elites .
It is of course not a pure class war .
Due to a vacuum on the left in the past , millionaire and populist politicians like Thaksin Shinawatra have managed to provide leadership to the poor .
The urban and rural poor , who form the majority of the electorate , are the ``Red Shirts ' ' .
They want the right to choose their own democratically elected government .
They started out as passive supporters of Thaksin 's Thai Rak Thai government .
But they have now formed a brand new citizens ’ movement , for what they call “ real democracy ” .
For them , “ real democracy ” means an end to the long - accepted “ quiet dictatorship ” of the army generals and the royal palace .
This situation allowed the generals , the king 's advisors in the Privy Council and the conservative elites to act as though they were above the constitution .
Les majeste ( which outlaw ``insulting ' ' -- criticism of -- the monarchy ) laws and intermittent repression have been used to silence opposition .
Ever since 2006 , these elites have blatantly acted against election results by staging a military coup , using the courts to twice dissolve Taksin 's party and by backing mob violence by the anti-democratic royalist ``Yellow Shirts ' ' .
The present misnamed Democrat Party government led by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva was manoeuvred into place by the army .
Most of those in the Red Shirt movement support Taksin for good reasons .
His government put in place many pro-poor policies , including Thailand 's first ever universal health - care system .
Yet the Red Shirts are not merely Taksin puppets .
There is a dialectical relationship between Taksin and the Red Shirts .
His leadership provides encouragement and confidence to fight .
Yet the Red Shirts are self - organised in community groups and some are showing frustration with Taksin 's lack of progressive leadership , especially over his insistence that they continue to be “ loyal ” to the crown .
Over the past few days , the Red Shirts have shown signs of self - leadership to such an extent that the old Red Shirt politicians are running to keep up .
A republican movement is growing .
Many left - leaning
Thais like myself are not Taksin supporters .
We opposed his human rights abuses .
But we are the left wing of the citizens ' movement for real democracy .
The Yellow Shirts are conservative royalists .
Some have fascist tendencies .
Their guards carry and use firearms .
They supported the 2006 coup , wrecked Government House and blocked the international airport last year .
Behind them were the Thai army .
That is why troops never shot at the Yellow Shirts .
That is why the present , Oxford - and Eton- educated Thai Prime Minister has done nothing to punish the Yellow Shirts .
After all , he appointed some to his cabinet .
The aims of the Yellow Shirts are to reduce the voting power of the electorate in order to protect the conservative elites and the “ bad old ways ” of running Thailand .
They see increased citizen empowerment as a threat and propose a “ New Order ” dictatorship , where people are allowed to vote , but most MPs and public positions are not up for election .
They are supported by the mainstream Thai media , most middle - class academics and even NGO leaders .
The NGOs have disgraced themselves over the last few years by siding with the Yellows or remaining silent in the face of the general attack on democracy .
Despite being well meaning , their lack of politics has let them down and they have been increasingly drawn to the right .
When we talk about the “ palace ” we have to make a distinction between the king and all those who surround him .
The king has always been weak and lacking in any democratic principles .
The palace has been used to legitimise past and present dictatorships .
As a “ stabilising force ” , the monarchy has only helped to stabilise the interests of the elite .
The immensely wealthy king is also opposed to any wealth redistribution .
The queen is an extreme reactionary .
However the real people with power among the Thai elites are the army and high - ranking state officials .
If one is to understand and judge the violent acts which have been taking place in Thailand , we need a sense of history and perspective .
Perspective is needed to distinguish between damaging property and injuring or killing people .
With this perspective , it is clear that the Yellow Shirts and the army are the violent ones .
A sense of history helps to explain why Red Shirt citizens are now exploding in anger .
They have had to endure the military jackboot , the repeated theft of their democratic rights , continued acts of violence against them and general abuse from the mainstream media and academia .
If they continue to resist , cracks may appear in the army .
During the past four years
Thai citizens have become highly politicised .
Ordinary soldiers , recruited from poor families , support the Red Shirts .
The stakes are very high .
Any compromise has the risk of instability because it will satisfy almost no one .
The old elites might want to do a deal with Taksin to stop the Red Shirts from becoming totally republican .
But whatever happens , Thai society cannot go back to the old days .
The Red Shirts represent millions of Thais who are sick and tired of military and palace intervention in politics .
At the very least they will want a non-political constitutional monarchy .
It is hoped that the Red Shirts will continue to move to the left during this round of struggle .
Looking at Thailand ’s crisis : some basics
By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
April 13 , 2008 --
When watching and commenting on the recent events in Thailand , observers need to hold on to some basic principles .
These are :
1 . No government anywhere in the world has the right to use troops to gun down protesters in the streets , especially when they are not carrying firearms .
The Abhisit government 's use of the army to kill people in cold blood is an outrage .
It is not “ restraint ” nor “ the application of the Rule of Law ” .
It puts the Thai government on the same level as the Burmese junta and its aims are the same too ... to hang on to illegitimate power and protect the interests of the privileged .
2 . If observers want to pontificate about the “ Rule of Law ” , then they must first denounce the illegal military coup of 2006 , the lack of partiality and accountability among the judiciary in dissolving the elected parties of government , the illegal seizure of Government House and the airports by the misnamed royalist Peoples ' Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , the use of firearms and bombs by the PAD , the illegal bribes and threats to manoeuvre the Democrat Party into power , the illegal government - backed Blue Shirt gangs , who carried firearms and the illegal and extra-constitutional role of the palace and the king 's advisors in frustrating the functioning of democracy .
None of the above cases have been punished .
3 . There is a clear line between democracy and dictatorship .
“ Thai - style democracy ” is an elite myth .
The Yellow Shirts have repeatedly failed to respect the democratic wishes of the majority of the population .
They want more appointed public positions and less power to the electorate .
They want a “ New Order ” .
They want censorship .
They back the draconian lese majeste law which stifle the basic right to freedom of speech .
The Red Shirts may not be angels , but they want a genuine democratic process without interference from the military , the king 's advisors or the palace .
They would prefer to use the more democratic constitution of 1997 , rather than the present one drafted by the military .
4 . The anger of the Red Shirts over the past few days did not come out of nowhere .
Since 2006 the majority of Thais have continually been abused politically by the elite Yellow Shirts , the mainstream media and middle - class academics .
When pictures of Red Shirts smashing the PM's car are shown , it is dishonest and bad journalism not to explain this .
5 . The majority of Red Shirts support Taksin , not because they like to “ hero worship ” , but because his government brought in a universal health - care system and other pro-poor measures .
The Democrat Party and the Yellow Shirts opposed these policies all along and knew that they could n't win popular elections as a result .
This is why they wanted a coup .
6 . Most of the Thai elite are corrupt , especially army generals and politicians .
Why single out just Taksin ?
We need to punish them all or none at all .
7 . The entire Thai elite support the use of state violence , whether it be in the [ mainly Muslim ] south of Thailand , in the ``war on drugs ' ' or against unarmed protesters .
Taksin has to take responsibility for gross human rights abuses while he was prime minister .
So does the rest of the elite , including Abhisit and the generals .
There is a long history of Thai state crimes and we need to challenge this .
We can start with denouncing the cold - blooded murder by troops on the streets of Bangkok this April .

Red Shirts shut down the ASEAN summit
April 10 , 2009 --
In Pattaya , demonstrators -- members of the National United Front of Democracy against Dictatorship ( UDD ) , aka Red Shirts -- broke the police cordon around the hotel where the ASEAN ( Association of South - East Asian Nations ) summit was to be held , demanding the resignation of the illegitimate government .
The Thai government responded by declaring a state of emergency in Pattaya .
The summit was cancelled .
Elizabeth Warren has another study out showing that medical expenses contribute to more than half of all bankruptcies -- indeed , this time , it 's 70 % , up from the 50 % she found in 2001 .
Now , it is possible that this is true .
The fact that it seems to disagree with every other study I 've ever read that is not authored by Elizabeth Warren , and also , the self - reports of the people in her study ( only about a third of whom attribute their bankruptcy to a health problem ) could just be a fluke .
It does n't necessarily mean that it 's wrong .
Yet upon closer examination , it turns out that it is not just wrong , but actively , aggressively wrong .
Warren and her co-authors have obscured important and obvious facts that call the integrity of the work into serious question .
The text itself raises a huge red flags .
It 's hard to believe that more than half of people who have been pushed into bankruptcy by a medical issue do n't understand this fact .
Perhaps they are not the brightest bulbs on the Christmas tree , but could it really be true that most people catapaulted into a financial crisis by their medical bills do n't even notice that health care expenses are their main problem ?
My radar is further engaged by the fact that they 're implying a really astonishing surge in medical - bill - driven bankruptcies , in a healthcare environment that just did n't change all that massively .
Their study opens :
As recently as 1981 , only 8 % of families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem .
By contrast , our 2001 study in 5 states found that illness or medical bills contributed to about half of bankruptcies .
Since then , the number of un - and underinsured Americans have grown , health costs have increased , and Congress tightened the bankruptcy laws .
In those six years , the percentage of uninsured families ground upward , and health care cost continued to rise at about twice the rate of inflation .
But a 2.5 % real annual increase in the cost of a budget item that accounts for something like 5 % of annual household expenditures should n't make the bankruptcy stats jump that much .

Ed Schultz responded to Rush Limbaugh ’s attack on him today by challenging the right wing talk show host to come on his MSNBC show and debate him about anything .
Schultz said , “ Your audience hates me .
They would love to see you stick it to me , but you wo n’t do it , because you ’re a coward Rush . ”
Here is the video :

Schultz said , “ Rush , I ’ve got a challenge for you , you know why do n’t you just come on this program your audience would love it radio or TV and debate me about anything .
Let ’s how good you are Rush one on one , let ’s go buddy , you know be safe as can be heck , MSNBC , we got HD .
We got the widescreen .
You ’ll fit in there fine . ”
He went on to call Limbaugh a coward , “ Your audience would love it .
Your audience hates me .
They would love to see you stick it to me , but you wo n’t do it , because you ’re a coward Rush .
I ’ve always thought that .
I ’ve always thought that . ”
Schultz then mentioned that Rush got fired from ESPN , and he challenged Limbaugh in football , golf , waterskiing , hunting , or fishing .
Plus two for Schultz for managing to work in both a weight joke , and the Donovan McNabb incident from the ESPN NFL pregame show .
Schultz would love to see this develop into a running feud .
Nothing could boost his ratings more than a public spat with Rush Limbaugh .
I still do n’t know what possessed Limbaugh to go after Ed Schultz .
Unless it because Schultz can cut it on television , and Rush can’t .
There is absolutely zero chance of Limbaugh tangling with Schultz .
Rush does n’t debate anyone , because he knows that he would have nothing to gain and everything to lose .
Limbaugh knows that his strength rests in sitting his studio , and ruling his kingdom .
He rarely leaves his bubble because with 20 million listeners a week , he does n’t have to .
Schultz was correct .
He was dreaming when he challenged Limbaugh , but this back and forth between the two has been fun to listen to .
Ed Schultz wins on this one no matter what , because every time Limbaugh talks about him , it helps both Schultz and his MSNBC show .

America ’s health care is the costliest in the world , yet quality is patchy and millions are uninsured .
Incentives for both patients and suppliers need urgent treatment
Illustration by Otto Steininger
NO ONE will be astonished to hear that health care costs more in Indiana than in India .
However , a few might be surprised to learn that Americans spend more than twice as much per person on health care as Swedes do .
And many may be shocked to be told that in Miami people pay twice as much as in Minnesota , even for far worse care .
The American health - care system , which gobbles up about 16 % of the country 's economic output , is by far the most expensive in the world ( see chart 1 ) .
The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimates that on current trends spending on Medicare and Medicaid , the government schemes for the old and the poor , will rise from 4 % of GDP in 2007 to 12 % in 2050 .
The prospect of long - term fiscal disaster is the main reason why efforts to reform health care are gaining momentum in Washington , DC .
As Peter Orszag , the director of Barack Obama 's Office of Management and Budget , puts it , “ that ‘ long term ' keeps getting closer and closer . ”
The system has its defenders .
They point out that countries should expect to spend more on health care as people age .
Americans are wealthy enough to choose extra health care over other things .
Their free - spending approach calls forth the invention and speedy adoption of valuable new drugs , devices and procedures , whereas Europe 's stodgy and stingy ( not to mention socialist ) health - care systems deny coverage and ration care , to the detriment of their people 's health .
A poll carried out for The Economist by YouGov highlights Americans ' beliefs about the state of their system .
Although 68 % of them rate the care they receive as “ excellent ” or “ good ” , 52 % are dissatisfied with the quality in the country as a whole .
Only 25 % think the system works pretty well and requires only minor changes ; 40 % think fundamental change is needed and 29 % think it should be completely rebuilt .
Some results are shown in chart 2 .
A fuller version is available at www.economist.com/yougovpoll.
The doubters have a better case than the defenders .
Granted , medical inventions are readily embraced by American doctors and patients .
In specific instances — technology to save babies born prematurely and statin drugs to reduce cholesterol , to take two — the benefits of spending greatly outweigh the costs .
But if the system in general were providing value for money , America 's vast expenditure would at least be reflected in a healthier population than in more frugal countries .
Alas , it is not .
Comparisons with other rich countries and within the United States show that America 's health - care system is not only growing at an unsustainable pace , but also provides questionable value for money and dubious medical care .
Three troubling symptoms stand out : uneven quality of care , inadequate coverage and soaring costs .
Start with quality .
Evidence is mounting that spending more does not necessarily buy better health .
On the contrary , it appears that many Americans are getting mixed or even downright dreadful health care .
In a recent study economists at the OECD found that America does indeed do well on some measures , such as breast - cancer survival rates and cervical - cancer screening , compared with other rich countries .
However , it does worse in other areas .
American infant mortality was 6.7 per 1,000 births in 2007 , against an OECD average ( excluding Mexico and Turkey ) of 4.0 .
The death rate after haemorrhagic strokes was 25.5 % in American hospitals but only 19.8 % in OECD countries as a group .
Jonathan Skinner , an economist at Dartmouth College , cautions that factors other than health - care systems — attitudes to teenage pregnancy , say , or smoking — may influence the numbers .
Even so , he thinks the system is wasteful .
In a paper in the Journal of Economic Perspectives last year he and Alan Garber , of Stanford University , argued that America 's health system was “ uniquely inefficient ” , producing too little per unit of input and consuming far too much of the country 's resources .
Mr Skinner is involved with another worrying line of research .
The Dartmouth Atlas project has scrutinised variations in health outcomes and spending involving Medicare .
It has found wide differences in costs across the country — less than $ 5,000 per person in Salem , Oregon , in 2006 ; a bit more than $ 8,000 in San Francisco , in line with the national average ; more than $ 16,000 , and rising fast , in Miami — but no connection between higher spending and better outcomes .
In fact , the evidence points in the other direction : outcomes tend to be better where costs are lower .
Mr Orszag points to the Dartmouth work to argue that up to 30 % of America 's health - care spending is sheer waste .
The second symptom is coverage .
Uniquely among rich countries , America 's system of health insurance is not universal .
Around 49 m people have no health insurance .
On current trends , within a decade 60 m will be without cover .
Studies have shown that not all these people are indigent : a quarter or more can afford insurance , but choose not to buy it .
They know they are unlikely to be left to die in the streets .
With the truly poor , the free - riders turn up at emergency rooms .
This is hugely inefficient , because pricey late interventions and operations could very often have been avoided with a much smaller investment in preventive care .
Insured people and taxpayers are forced to cross-subsidise such “ uncompensated ” and wasteful treatments to the tune of tens of billions of dollars per year .
Other rich countries cover almost all their citizens in one of two ways .
Some , such as Britain , Canada and Sweden , have “ single payer ” systems , in which taxes support a public service .
Others , notably the Netherlands and Switzerland , oblige individuals to buy insurance .
France has a mixed public - private system .
After decades of failed attempts at reform , a consensus appears to be emerging in America around the principles needed for universal coverage .
One likely change means a restructuring of America 's failed health - insurance markets .
Firms are today allowed to pick the safest patients and reject the sickest .
In future they will have to take all comers .
Because this imposes unfair burdens on firms that attract lots of older or sicker people , reform is likely to include government - funded mechanisms for risk pooling or reinsurance .
The Netherlands , in particular , uses such an approach .
American health insurers , having long opposed this idea , have performed a startling U - turn in recent weeks .
America 's Health Insurance Plans , their chief lobbying group , now says it is willing to accept such heavy - handed reforms — if they are accompanied by a requirement that all Americans purchase coverage .
This may seem a cynical ploy to expand their business , but some compulsion is needed to get around the selection problem .
Any legislation is likely to include subsidies to help the poorest pay for cover .
If done properly , this will in time move America towards the Swiss and Dutch models of universal private insurance .
These are not perfect , to be sure .
Regina Herzlinger of Harvard Business School observes that the Dutch reforms have led to rapid consolidation of insurers and hospitals , fuelling resented price increases .
She favours the decentralised Swiss model , which preserves individual choice and competition .
Others note that Swiss health - care costs are high by European standards .
But they are a third less , as a share of GDP , than America's , and the country 's excellent health outcomes should be the envy of American reformers .
Our poll suggests that an individual mandate would be unpopular , with only 21 % in favour and 53 % opposed .
Respondents did favour having the option to buy from the government , by 56 % to 23 % .
Such reforms would expand coverage , but could exacerbate the third symptom , cost , as the experience of Massachusetts , a trailblazing state that has already implemented a plan for universal coverage , suggests .
The state faces possible bankruptcy unless it finds a way to rein in costs .
Your money or your life
Indeed , tackling inflation in American health care remains the most important and difficult part of the treatment .
According to our poll , cost is a tender nerve : 61 % thought the high cost of care and insurance was a bigger problem than the number of uninsured , against 31 % who believed the reverse .
Only 21 % would be willing to support a reform plan if they had to pay more in insurance or tax ; 62 % would not .
Some common diagnoses are wide of the mark .
One is price gouging by drug companies .
In fact , pills account for barely a tenth of health - care spending in America and similarly small shares elsewhere .
But are n't costs lower in Europe because of price controls ?
Europe does indeed spend less on new branded drugs , but also uses fewer generic drugs and pays much more for them .
And Switzerland actually has higher drug prices than America ( as does Canada ) .
Greedy drugmakers are not the main cause of America 's runaway costs .
Nor are baby - boomers , though they are often blamed for health - care inflation because there are a lot of them and they are getting old .
Ageing will clearly push up costs in time ( see our special report in this issue ) , but it is not the main culprit yet .
The CBO estimates that ageing accounts for only a quarter of the health - care inflation to come in the next few decades , and the share in other rich countries is similar .
Doctors ' generous pay is another popular culprit .
But doctors in several European countries are well paid too .
The OECD estimates that general practitioners in America earn 3.7 times the average wage .
Their British counterparts earn 4.2 times their national average .
American specialists earn 5.6 times the average wage , against 7.6 times for their Dutch colleagues .
Yet health - care costs in Britain and the Netherlands remain lower than America's .
The real problem is not how much American doctors are paid , but how .
The system of medical reimbursement warps incentives for doctors , insurers and patients that lead Americans to consume more and more medical services .
There is strong evidence that Americans use pills , procedures , scans and other expensive forms of health care more often than do patients in other rich countries , and not always to good effect .
America 's insurance system encourages overuse in several ways .
One is the tax break that favours health insurance provided by employers , which leads to excessively generous coverage and hence over - consumption .
Another is the fact that American health insurers earn a lot of revenue from administering the health plans provided to employees by big corporations which , in effect , insure themselves .
This leaves insurers with no incentive to curb costs , because more spending means fatter management fees .
The incentives facing doctors are even more perverse .
Most doctors are not paid a fixed salary , still less rewarded for better health outcomes .
Integrated American systems such as Kaiser Permanente and the Mayo Clinic are exceptions to this rule , and Britain 's National Health Service ( NHS ) is trying to adopt a similar approach .
But most doctors and hospitals are paid more if they provide more services , regardless of the results .
Predictably , this leads to far higher rates of doctors ' visits , specialist referrals , scans and so on .
For instance , the OECD countries have an average of 11 magnetic - resonance imaging machines per 1 m people .
America has 25.9 .
America uses them more often , too : 91.2 times per 1,000 people per year , compared with the OECD average of 39.1 .
Similar tales can be told about other pricey kit .
This incentive problem even extends to patients .
If patients pay very little out of their own pockets they have little desire to curb consumption .
Though this is a problem in many OECD countries , in America the proportion of out - of - pocket spending has declined sharply in the past few decades .
And a new report by McKinsey , a firm of management consultants , identifies a more subtle problem .
Having examined insurance and out - of - pocket spending for several health risks , it concludes that Americans are generally “ over - insured and under - saved ” .
It is prudent for individuals to have comprehensive health insurance against catastrophic health risks such as heart attacks or cancer .
But McKinsey finds that Americans with private health insurance often have generous coverage for non-essential and even medically unjustified care ( see chart 3 ) .
This encourages over - consumption .
The power of sunshine
A second big factor pushing up health costs is the lack of competition among operators of American hospitals .
Thanks to a wave of consolidation in recent years , argues Harvard 's Ms Herzlinger , “ most parts of the United States are dominated by oligopolistic hospital systems . ”
George Halvorson , who heads Kaiser Permanente , insists that “ there is an almost total lack of price competition among providers . ”
Nimble upstarts and innovators are challenging the incumbents in some areas .
Such efforts range from specialist heart hospitals , which get better outcomes at more reasonable prices than local general hospitals , to retail clinics at Wal - Mart stores .
Remote medicine , in the form of technology for tele - care or medical tourism to Thailand and Costa Rica , also poses a threat .
But medical lobbies are using political influence and outdated regulations to thwart competition where they can ( for example , through rules preventing a doctor from treating a patient in another state ) .
To counter this , reforms could allow federal regulators to overrule state - level obstacles to entrants such as clinics staffed by inexpensive nurse - practitioners .
More transparency would help too , by empowering patients to choose hospitals and doctors providing good value and better results .
Electronic medical records would make shopping around easier .
Another useful way to promote transparency and value would be to evaluate the cost - effectiveness of new drugs , devices and treatments .
This may be common sense , but it is rarely done in America .
Britain 's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) pioneered this approach , and other European countries have followed it .
Andrew Dillon , the agency 's chief executive , accepts that “ the NICE model is not transportable in precise form ” but he still insists that “ one can dissect and apply what is relevant to other countries . ”
Illustration by Otto Steininger
In America , the drugs and devices lobbies are violently opposed to a NICE - style agency that could issue mandatory rulings .
They paint a scary picture of Americans being denied access to life - saving new drugs by faceless bureaucrats .
In Britain NICE has come under fire for rulings that limited access to expensive drugs for Alzheimer 's and cancer on the NHS .
America could get around this problem by requiring and perhaps even funding studies , but leaving insurers and individuals to decide whether to pay for treatments .
More competition and transparency would help , but the main goal of any reform plan must be to address the perverse incentives that encourage overconsumption and drive up costs .
Medicare has been tinkering with “ pay for performance ” , a promising experiment .
Mr Halvorson insists that by rejigging incentives other health providers can also create their own “ virtual Kaisers ” .
If American reformers doubt the power of incentives , they should visit Sweden .
Like other relatively cheap OECD systems , Sweden 's single - payer model has been plagued by long waiting - lists — a sign , to American conservatives , of the rationing that goes with socialised medicine .
Swedish health officials tried and failed to cut queues by increasing direct funding for hospitals and even issued an edict requiring hospitals to cut queues for elective operations to three months .
Then , last year , the health ministry said it would create a fund into which it would pay SKr1 billion ( $ 128 m ) a year for local authorities that managed to reduce waiting times to that threshold .
Nine months ago virtually none of the counties passed , but this month the health minister revealed that nearly all had cut their queues to three months or less .
Anders Knape , the head of the organisation representing county governments , ascribes this to “ a dramatic change in incentives ” .
In the past , he explains , hospital bosses believed waiting lists were a sign of being overloaded , so they tolerated them in the hope of winning more funding .
With the new scheme , however , “ no queues means more resources ” .
If getting incentives right can mobilise even a state - run health system like Sweden 's , surely there is scope for such reforms to fix America 's mess too .
If the United States couples its efforts to expand coverage with such a radical restructuring of the underlying drivers of cost inflation , there is every reason to think its health system can become the best in the world — and not merely the priciest .

We all have those days where we are just completely under the weather .
We cannot wait for the day to end – but why should we ?
What is stopping us from ending this downward spiral right now .
What is there holding us in a negative stronghold but ourselves ?
How can we set ourselves free ?
Not tomorrow , not next week – but right now ?
The quick answer : we need to dissociate from our unpleasantness .
We can only dissociate by replacing ourselves into a new associative role , one of pleasantness , not against it .
So wait – how do we stop being depressed ?
Be happy ?
Is n’t that the goal , not the solution ?
Well , it is actually both !
It only takes an instant or a moment to change one ’s mental state .
We can do this without the help of any external factors ; all we need is our mind .
This morning I became very aggravated very quickly .
I could n’t find the book I was planning on reading later , I burnt my breakfast , I got a call from my Mom wanting me to run a line of errands , its absolutely pouring outside , and I realized I am extremely low on cash .
I was pissed off .
I was one more straw away from going to the nearest wall and planting my fist on the other side .
Then I paused .
I ’ve taught myself throughout the years that when things are bad sometimes all it takes is a quick step backwards to put it all back into perspective .
This is dissociating from the present moment .
It is useful , especially during times when you are busy and running in auto - pilot mode .
But then you ca n’t stay dissociated forever , you need to eventually step back into yourself and continue your day .
But when you do step back into yourself , make sure you associate with the pleasant and happy side of yourself , not the negative and aggravated one .
When you associate into your happy self – what should your happy self be doing ?
Smiling , of course .
But what else can you add ?
For a moment , try thinking of yourself as a customizable video game character .
What are all the cool things you can add to your happy self ?
What type of behaviors would he or she do ?
How would they walk throughout their day ?
Add a little pop to your walk .
Erect your posture .
Do a little dance .
These are all free ways to get a quick high out of life .
Ca n’t sing ?
Do it anyway .
No , really – it is an order .
I ca n’t sing for the life of me , but I get the greatest , most selfish , and pleasant joy out of it .
When I went downstairs to get myself a snack today , I was in a much different state then when I was this morning .
I danced around the table .
Made goofy sounds with my mouth : beat - boxing , whistling , singing , and whatever else my lips , tongue and vocal chords are capable of .
I gave a couple of punches into the air as if I were Rocky .
It ’s all - good .
Make life a celebration .
Sure , my dogs gave me a couple weird looks and then stared at each other in disbelief , but that is just another part of the joy .
The idea here is to enrich your personal life in the most easy and effortless ways as possible .
When you are by yourself and in the comfort of your own home you have no excuse to hold back your potential for glee .
Make the most of it : be creative , be simple , be happy .

The Daily Mail and General Trust ( DMGT ) is to cut 1,000 jobs as the advertising slump continues to hurt newspapers .
The job cuts at its regional arm Northcliffe Media are more than double what it estimated last November , the media company said .
Northcliffe Media publishes 113 papers in England and Wales , selling 4.1 million copies a week .
It said it had a " difficult quarter " so far and expects a " substantial fall " in profits in the first half of 2009 .
The " vast majority " of the job cuts have already taken place or are currently under consultation , said a company spokesman .
See how national newspaper sales have fallen Northcliffe Media 's newspapers include the Leicester Mercury , Hull Daily Mail and the Bristol Evening Post .
Newspapers battered
The company said in its trading update that further costs were being cut in all departments at its newspaper division , which includes the Daily Mail and free newssheet the Metro .
The DMGT said the job cuts would result in exceptional operating costs of about £ 20 m in the group 's half year results to 29 March , to be announced in May .
The company said it expected advertising revenue at its newspapers during the three months to March to drop by an underlying 24 % , and to fall at Northcliffe Media as a whole by 37 % .
Shares in DMGT rose 2 % to 238.5 pence .
DMGT sold the London Evening Standard newspaper in January to Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev for the sum of £ 1 .
The recession has hit advertisers and newspapers hard , with local publishers being especially affected .
National impact Local newspaper group Archant , which owns the Eastern Daily Press and Evening News , said this month it is planning to cut 34 jobs in Norfolk .
REGIONAL NEWS SUFFERS
Norfolk 's Archant , which owns the Eastern Daily Press and Evening News , plans to cut 34 jobs The Daily Record and Sunday Mail in Scotland merged , resulting in the loss of 70 jobs Glasgow Herald owner Newsquest asks staff to take unpaid leave Manchester Evening News owner axed 150 jobs and closed eight offices Reading Evening Post has become bi-weekly as owner GMG Regional Media had an 85 % drop in profits Liverpool Daily Post and Echo sacked 40 journalists and reduced editions Observer Standard Newspapers enters administration
And up to a quarter of 276 editorial staff at the Glasgow - based Daily Record and Sunday Mail newspapers are to lose their jobs under plans to merge their newsrooms .
Observer Standard Newspapers in Worcestershire , with a staff of 150 , went into administration earlier this month .
The government has said that preserving the future of local news was a priority .
Culture minister Barbara Follett said the government would " work tirelessly to secure news for local communities " .
National newspapers have also been hurt badly , with the Independent cutting back on staff and moving its staff to the Daily Mail 's offices in Kensington , west London .
The Financial Times last week told staff that it planned to streamline its editing staff and cut back from three editions per day to two , and the Daily Express and Sunday Express plan to cut staff as well this year .
The phenomenon is not restricted to the UK .
US papers
There is much talk of a crisis in the US newspaper industry as many cities see their households titles in trouble .
The 146 - year - old Seattle Post - Intelligencer this month became the first US paper to stop a print edition and go online only , with an editorial team of 20 as compared to 150 previously .
Last month the San Francisco Chronicle said the paper could be sold or closed down if it could not meet cost - cutting targets .
The Tribune Company , which owns the Chicago Tribune , the Los Angeles Times , the Baltimore Sun and many other titles , filed for bankruptcy in December .

Philip Cafaro , associate professor of philosophy at Colorado State University , is author of Thoreau ’s Living Ethics ( University of Georgia Press , 2004 ) .
He is currently completing a book on the ethics of immigration , with the working title Bleeding Hearts and Empty Promises : A Liberal Rethinks Immigration .

His master ’s thesis in environmental philosophy is titled “ For a Species Moral Right to Exist : The Imperative of an Adequate Environmental Ethics ” ( Colorado State University , 2009 ) .
This Backgrounder is adapted from a forthcoming article in Environmental Ethics .
This Backgrounder argues that a serious commitment to environmentalism entails ending America ’s population growth by implementing a more restrictive immigration policy .
The need to limit immigration necessar­ily follows when we combine a clear statement of our main environmental goals — living sustainably and sharing the landscape generously with other species — with uncontro­versial accounts of our current demographic trajectory and of the negative environmental effects of U.S. population growth , nationally and globally .
At the current level of 1.5 million immigrants per year , America ’s population of 306 million is set to increase to over 700 million people by 2100 .
Recent “ reform ” proposals would actually increase immigration to over two million annually , which has the potential to nearly triple our population to over 850 million by the end of the century .
Conversely , scaling back immigration to 200,000 per year would greatly reduce America ’s population growth , according to studies by the U.S. Census Bureau .
Given the many issues that environmentalists must deal with and the contentious nature of immigration debates , it is understandable that many of us would prefer to avoid them .
But the reality is that across the country , environmentalists are losing the battle to create a sustainable society and protect wild nature .
Sprawl development destroys 2.2 million acres of wild lands and agricultural lands each year ; over 1300 plant and animal species remain on the endangered species list , with more added each year ; water shortages in the west and southeast are being used to justify new river - killing dams and reservoirs ; and U.S. carbon emissions continue to rise .
Obviously , we have n’t figured out how to create a sustainable society with 300 million inhabitants .
It ’s not plausible to think we will be able to do so with two or three times as many people .
Still , there are arguments against reducing U.S. immigration that deserve consideration .
In what follows , we analyze the main moral , environmental , and economic arguments for the mass immigration status quo , or for even more expansive immigration policies .
In the end , we find them unconvincing .
We conclude that Americans must choose between allowing continued high levels of immigration and creating a sustainable society .
Introduction
The environmental argument for reducing immigration to the United States is relatively straightforward and is based on the following five premises :
Immigration levels are at a historic high and immigration is now the main driver of U.S. population growth .
Population growth contributes significantly to a host of environmental problems within our borders .
A growing population increases America ’s large environmental footprint beyond our borders and our disproportionate role in stressing global environmental systems .
In order to seriously address environmental problems at home and become good global environmental citizens , we must stop U.S. population growth .
We are morally obligated to address our environmental problems and become good global environmental citizens .
Therefore , we should limit immigration to the United States to the extent needed to stop U.S. population growth .
This conclusion rests on a straightforward commitment to mainstream environmentalism , easily confirmed empirical premises , and logic .
Despite this , it is not the consensus position among American environmentalists .
Some environmentalists support continued high levels of immigration , while most are uncomfortable with the topic and avoid discussing it .
So strong is this aversion that groups such as the Sierra Club , which during the 1970s prominently featured strong commitments to U.S. population stabilization , have dropped domestic population growth as an issue .
1
Several years ago , the group Zero Population Growth went so far as to change its name to Population Connection ( “ PC ” for short ) .
In 2006 , the United States passed the 300 million mark in population — that ’s 95 million more people than were here for the first Earth Day in 1970 — with little comment from environmentalists .
In 2007 , as Congress debated the first major overhaul of immigration policy in nearly 20 years , leaders from the principal environmental organizations remained silent about proposals that could have added hundreds of millions more Americans during the 21st century .
Like immigration policy for the past 50 years , immigration policy for the next 50 looks likely to be set with no regard for its environmental consequences .
We believe this is a bad thing .
As committed environmentalists , we would like to see our government set immigration policy ( and all government policy ) within the context of a commitment to sustainability .
We do n’t believe that the goals we share with our fellow environmentalists and with a large majority of our fellow citizens — clean air and clean water ; livable , uncrowded cities ; sharing the land with the full complement of its native flora and fauna — are compatible with continued population growth .
It is time to rein in this growth — or forthrightly renounce the hope of living sustainably here in the United States .
Defending the Argument
Our claim , then , is that “ the environmental argument ” is sound and that America should scale back immigration .
Some readers will disagree .
So let ’s look at the argument in more detail .
Immigration levels are at a historic high and immigration is now the main driver of U.S. population growth .
Consider some demographic history .
Between 1900 and 2000 , the U.S. population almost quadrupled , from 76 million to 281 million people .
The largest decadal population increase was also the most recent : a 32.7 million increase between 1990 and 2000.2
This population growth resulted from a mixture of natural increase and immigration , which , as Figure 1 shows , has varied widely over the past century .
From 1880 to the mid-1920s , America experienced an immigration boom , “ the Great Wave , ” during which immigration averaged 600,000 annually .
U.S. population numbers grew rapidly in these years , due to a combination of high birth rates and high levels of immigration .
For the next 40 years , from 1925 to 1965 , the United States had a relatively restrictive immigration policy , which allowed 200,000 people into the country annually , on average .
The U.S. population grew substantially during this time , too , from 115 million to 194 million , primarily due to high rates of natural increase .
During the 1950s , for example , American women had an average of 3.5 children each , far above the 2.1 total fertility rate ( TFR ) necessary to maintain the population of a nation with modern health care and sanitation .
By the 1970s , American women were averaging fewer babies — in 1975 the TFR stood at a lowest - ever 1.7 — and the United States was well - positioned to transition from a growing to a stable population .
One study found that without post -1970 immigration , the U.S. population would have leveled off below 250 million in the first few decades of this century .
3
It did n’t happen , however , because in 1965 and several times thereafter , Congress greatly increased immigration levels .
Between 1965 and 1990 , immigration averaged one million people annually — five times the average in the previous four decades .
Since 1990 , immigration has increased even more , to approximately 1.5 million annually ( one million legal and half a million illegal ) — the highest rate in history .
For these reasons , the United States population has continued to grow , resulting in a missed opportunity to get one key aspect of sustainability — human numbers — under control .
Currently our population stands at over 306 million people , and it continues to grow rapidly .
Such is our demographic past ; what of our demographic future ?
The Grand Council of the Iroquois famously looked “ seven generations ” out concerning the impacts of their decisions .
Looking four generations into the future , in 2000 the U.S. Census Bureau released the population projections in Table 1 .
Each of the three projections or “ series ” holds fertility rates steady , while varying immigration levels , so annual immigration rates make the main difference between them .
Under the zero immigration projection , the U.S. population continues to grow throughout the 21st century , adding over 100 million people by 2100 .
Under the middle projection , with immigration a little less than one million annually , we instead add nearly 300 million people and almost double our population by 2100 .
And under the highest scenario , with over two million immigrants annually , our population nearly triples by 2100 , adding almost 600 million more people by the end of the century .
Obviously , according to the Census Bureau , immigration makes a huge difference to future U.S. population numbers .
4
So our first premise is true .
Population growth contributes significantly to a host of environmental problems within our borders .
For example in the past two decades sprawl , defined as new development on the fringes of existing urban and suburban areas , has come to be recognized as an important environmental problem in the United States .
Between 1982 and 2001 , the United States converted 34 million acres of forest , cropland , and pasture to developed uses , an area the size of Illinois .
The average annual rate of land conversion increased from 1.4 million acres to 2.2 million acres over this time , and continues on an upward trend .
5
Sprawl is an environmental problem for lots of reasons , including increased energy consumption , water consumption , air pollution , and habitat loss for wildlife .
Habitat loss is by far the number one cause of species endangerment in the United States ; 6 unsurprisingly , some of the worst sprawl centers ( such as southern Florida and the Los Angeles basin ) also contain large numbers of endangered species .
What causes sprawl ?
Transportation policies that favor building roads over mass transit appear to be important sprawl generators .
So are zoning laws that encourage “ leapfrog ” developments far out into the country , and tax policies that allow builders to pass many of the costs of new development on to current taxpayers rather than new home buyers .
Between 1970 and 1990 , these and other factors caused Americans ’ per capita land use in the hundred largest metropolitan areas to increase 22.6 percent .
In these same areas during this same period , however , the amount of developed land increased 51.5 percent .
7
What accounts for this discrepancy ?
The number one cause of sprawl , by far : population growth .
New houses , new shopping centers , and new roads are being built for new residents .
As Figure 2 illustrates , in recent decades , cities and states with the highest population growth rates have also shown the most sprawl .
The most comprehensive study to date on the causes of sprawl in the United States analyzed several dozen possible factors .
Grouping together all those factors that can increase per capita land use and comparing these with the single factor of more “ capitas , ” it found that in America between 1982 and 1997 , 52 percent of sprawl was attributable to population increase , while 48 percent was attributable to misguided policies that increased land use per person .
8
Some “ smart growth ” advocates resist the conclusion that population growth is an important sprawl factor , partly because they do n’t want to obscure the need for good planning and land use policies .
They point out that several metropolitan areas that lost population in recent decades exhibited significant sprawl , including St. Louis , Detroit , and Pittsburgh .
Of America ’s 100 largest metropolitan areas , 11 lost population between 1970 and 1990 , yet they sprawled an average of 26 percent ( see figure 2a ) .
This shows that poor land use planning and bad transportation , zoning , and tax policies are indeed important in generating sprawl .
On the other hand , cities with growing populations sprawled even more .
Several states that managed to decrease their per capita land use during this period also sprawled , due to high rates of population growth .
From 1982 to 1995 , Nevada decreased its per capita land use 26 percent while sprawling 37 percent , due to a whopping 90 percent population increase .
Arizona decreased per capita land use 13 percent while its population increased 58 percent , generating 40 percent sprawl.9
This shows that population growth also causes sprawl .
The bottom line is that if we want to stop sprawl we must change the transportation , tax , zoning , and population policies that encourage it .
We will not stop sprawl if we simply accept as inevitable that factor — population increase — which the best research shows accounts for over half of the problem .
Nor will we solve our other major domestic environmental problems .
That is because our second premise also is true .
A growing population increases America ’s large environmental footprint beyond our borders and our disproportionate role in stressing global environmental systems .
Consider global warming .
Nothing mortifies American environmentalists more than our country ’s failure to show leadership in dealing with this , the most important environmental challenge facing the world in the 21st century .
As the world ’s largest economy and historically largest greenhouse gas emitter , the United States has a moral obligation to lead the world in meeting this challenge .
A good start would be striving to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels ( the Kyoto protocol , rejected by the United States , calls for an initial reduction of 5 percent below 1990 levels ) .
Meeting even this modest objective will prove difficult , however , if our population continues to grow .
Look at the numbers .
The United States ’ CO2 emissions increased 20.4 percent between 1990 and 2005 , from 4,991 to 6,009 million metric tons.10
That means we would have to decrease our emissions by 20.4 percent per person to get back to 1990 levels , at our current population .
But if we double our population , as we are on track to do in six or seven decades , we will have to decrease per capita emissions 58.5 percent in order to reduce CO2 emissions to 1990 levels — almost three times as great a per capita reduction .
Such reductions will be much more expensive and demand greater sacrifice from Americans .
They are thus less likely to happen .
“ Hold on a minute , ” critics may respond .
“ We can and should cut our carbon emissions 60 percent or even more .
The technologies exist and America is wealthy enough to meet our moral obligation to address global warming .
The problem , above all , is Americans ’ hoggish overconsumption . ”
We agree .11 Limiting consumption must play an important role in addressing global warming .
American environmentalists should work to enact policies that reduce our fossil fuel consumption as much as possible .
Such policies should include increased taxes on fossil fuels , redirecting transportation funding from highway construction to mass transit , heavy subsidies for wind and solar power , large increases in auto fuel standards , improved building codes that reduce the energy needed for heating and cooling , and more .
However , re-engineering the world ’s largest economy and changing the consumption patterns of hundreds of millions of people are immense undertakings that will be difficult , expensive and ( we may assume ) only partly successful .
Al Gore has stated that global warming is “ the moral challenge of our time ; ” many of us agree with him .
But if Americans are serious about doing our part to limit global warming , the “ multiplier effect ” of population growth is too important to ignore .
Again , look at the numbers .
Between 1990 and 2003 , U.S. per capita CO2 emissions increased 3.2 percent , while total U.S. CO2 emissions increased 20.2 percent .
12
Why the discrepancy ?
During that same period , America ’s population increased 16.1 percent .13
More people drove more cars , built more houses , etc. Population growth greatly increased total emissions , and it is total emissions , not per capita emissions , that quantify our full contribution to global warming .
Before we go on , please note : we do not claim that by itself , halting U.S. population growth will solve sprawl , or meet our global warming responsibilities .
On the contrary , Americans must reduce our per capita consumption of land and energy in order to meet these challenges .
On the other hand , the evidence clearly shows that recent population growth has increased Americans ’ total land and energy consumption and made these problems even worse .
Americans must address both overconsumption and overpopulation if we hope to create a sustainable society and contribute to a sustainable world .
14
Clearly premises two and three are true : U.S. population growth contributes seriously to both domestic and global environmental problems .
Can we go further , and state that reining in population growth is essential to environmental success ?
Yes , we can .
In order to seriously address environmental problems at home and become good global environmental citizens , we must stop U.S. population growth .
It is of course possible to spin out scenarios in which America ’s population doubles , triples , or quadruples , and yet we still manage , through miracles of technological creativity or ethical self - sacrifice , to become ecologically sustainable .
Perhaps , as techie magazines like Discover and Wired periodically suggest , we may begin building farms in high rises and let the rest of the landscape return to nature .
Perhaps Americans will start taking seriously Jesus ’ sayings about the unimportance of wealth and material possessions , and focus instead on what is really important in life ( “ for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . ” )
Meanwhile , back in the real world , such scenarios are implausible .
They are therefore morally suspect as a basis for action ( or inaction ) .
Given the difficulties of getting 300 million Americans to curb their consumption , there is no reason to think we will be able to achieve sustainability with two or three times as many Americans .
( Indeed , there are good reasons to think that 300 million Americans is already much too high .
For example , scientists David and Marcia Pimentel suggest a U.S. population of 40 to 100 million might be truly sustainable , given the right environmental policies and consumption levels .
15 )
Environmentalists sometimes assume an infinite elasticity in our ability to reduce environmentally harmful consumption .
This might have made sense 30 years ago , when our paradigm for such consumption was burning leaded gasoline or spraying deodorants that contained ozone - depleting CFCs .
We could spend some money , remove lead or CFCs from those particular products , and continue happily consuming , minus the negative environmental effects .
Today , as human beings cook the earth and cause the sixth great extinction episode in our planet ’s history , we measure environmentally harmful consumption in terms of our carbon footprints and the hectares of land necessary to sustain our consumption choices ( land which is then not available as habitat for other species ) .
Such personal impacts can and should be reduced .
But because carbon emissions and basic resource use are implicated in almost all our consumption acts , they can not be reduced to zero .
As the cost of greener substitutes increases , the general public and then environmentalists themselves refuse to pay them .
As we move beyond changing consumption patterns in ways that perhaps more efficiently provide the benefits people want , and instead ask them to reduce consumption of goods and services that they desire or enjoy , sustainability becomes a much harder sell .
American environmentalists need to remember that future consumption levels will be set both by government policies and by many billions of individual consumption decisions .
These policies and decisions will be made not just by environmentalists , but also by people who are relatively unmoved by environmental considerations .
Any reasonable scenario for creating a sustainable society must take this into account .
Furthermore , even environmentalists tend to fade to a lighter shade of green when consuming less would seriously harm what we consider our quality of life .
Take us , for example .
Your authors are serious environmentalists .
One of us bicycles to work every day and recently spent tens of thousands of dollars to retrofit his house with a state - of - the - art heating system .
The other lives in a small apartment with few extraneous possessions and has spent much of the last few decades working to protect endangered wildlife .
Still , we drive our cars , when that is necessary or convenient .
We eat fairly conventional diets .
We occasionally fly on airplanes to visit relatives or attend scholarly conferences .
We might be willing to do without some of these amenities , in order to help create a sustainable society .
Still , there are limits . . . and we suspect that long before we reach ours , our fellow citizens will have reached theirs .
In other words , we can imagine Americans living and consuming at the levels of western European or Japanese citizens .
We see this as a goal worth striving for politically .
We cannot imagine Americans ( or western Europeans or Japanese , for that matter ) voluntarily living and consuming at the levels of the average Mexican citizen , much less the level of the average citizen of Nigeria or Bangladesh .
Barring universal enlightenment or dire catastrophe , these are n’t live political options ( regardless of whether a few thousand or even a few million hard - core environmentalists succeed in creating ultra- low consumption lifestyles in the midst of our high consumption culture ) .
Nevertheless , it is urgent that the United States move toward creating a sustainable society .
Such considerations suggest that while we cannot prove that our fourth premise is true , it is highly probable :
We must stop U.S. population growth in order to meet our environmental responsibilities .
Of course , population stabilization would not guarantee sustainability , but it would make it possible .
In philosophical terms , stabilizing our population is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for creating a sustainable society .
If we are good environmentalists , that should be good enough .
That we are good environmentalists can be stated as follows .
We are morally obligated to address our environmental problems and become good global environmental citizens .
We will not argue for this premise here , or provide a detailed statement of what it amounts to in practice .
Environmentalism means many things to many people .
Still , there are two general goals to which most environmentalists subscribe : ( 1 ) creating societies that leave sufficient natural resources for future human generations to live good lives ; and ( 2 ) sharing the landscape generously with nonhuman beings .
Let ’s call this “ generous sustainability , ” to differentiate it from more selfish , economically - defined conceptions of sustainability .
16
We believe a moral commitment to “ generous sustainability ” captures the core of environmentalism .
Numerous surveys in recent decades have shown that a large majority of Americans , from across the political spectrum , support these environmental goals .
A commitment to generous sustainability is also explicitly endorsed by almost all philosophers writing about environmental ethics today .
However , trying to convince skeptics of the truth of our fifth premise would require an article in itself ( or perhaps a whole book ! ) .
17
Here , then , we take this moral commitment as a given , for the purpose of our argument .
To sum up , we claim that premises 1 through 5 of “ the environmental argument for reducing immigration ” are true — or at least that any serious environmentalist needs to treat them as true .
But our conclusion necessarily follows from them .
Therefore , our conclusion is also true : we should limit immigration into the United States to the extent needed to stop U.S. population growth .
Our Proposal — and the Alternatives
We propose , then , that the United States reduce immigration by taking the following measures :
Cut legal immigration from one million to 200,000 per year ( the level allowed during the middle of the last century ) .
Reduce illegal immigration by strictly enforcing sanctions against employers who hire illegal workers ( it is fruitless to try to lower legal immigration levels while ignoring or condoning illegal immigration ) .
Rework trade agreements , and increase and better target development aid , to help people live better lives in their own countries .
Such a policy would allow some of the benefits of immigration to continue ( providing asylum for political refugees , allowing small influxes of workers with special skills , etc. ) while helping the United States move toward population stabilization .
Because our current TFR of 2.05 is right around “ replacement rate ” ( 2.1 ) and because reducing immigration would likely help drive our TFR even lower , such stabilization is no wild eco-fantasy .
The United States is nearly there , if we are willing to limit immigration ( this also holds true for other developed nations , whose TFRs tend to be even lower than the United States ’ ) .
This proposal is solidly within the mainstream of the best thinking on sustainability .
As the President ’s Council on Sustainable Development put it in 1996 : “ Managing population growth , resources , and wastes is essential to ensuring that the total impact of these factors is within the bounds of sustainability .
Stabilizing the population without changing consumption and waste production patterns would not be enough , but it would make an immensely challenging task more manageable .
In the United States , each is necessary ; neither alone is sufficient . ”
One of the Council ’s 10 major suggestions for creating a sustainable society was : “ Move toward stabilization of U.S. population .
”
18
Many readers will instinctively recoil from our proposal .
But we contend that paeans to sustainability , or talk of nonhuman beings having an intrinsic value that we need to respect , or reminders that God calls us to be good stewards of His creation , or earnest expressions of our strong environmental feelings , are all mere cant , when coupled with a blithe acceptance of the doubling or tripling of America ’s human population .
In the second half of this paper , we address some of the main objections that might be raised against our proposal .
But at a minimum , we insist that readers unwilling to reduce immigration into the United States own the demographic and environmental implications of their positions .
If you support the immigration status quo of 1.5 million immigrants annually , then you also support increasing America ’s population to over 700 million people by 2100 .
If you support an immigration policy along the lines of the Bush / Kennedy / McCain bill of 2007 , which might have increased immigration to 2 and ¼ million people annually , then you also support nearly tripling America ’s population to over 850 million people by 2100 .
If you support these scenarios or anything like them , then you do n’t just support drastically increasing America ’s human population .
You also support more cars , more houses , more malls , more power lines , more concrete and asphalt .
You support less habitat and resources for wildlife ; fewer forests , prairies and wetlands ; fewer wild fewer birds and wild mammals ( except perhaps for house sparrows , rats and a few other human commensals ) .
You support replacing these other species with human beings and our economic support systems .
In other words : if you support these scenarios or anything like them , then you reject generous sustainability .
Given the grave dangers flagged in the I.P.C.C. climate change reports and the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment , if you support anything like these scenarios , you cannot even plausibly claim to support a narrow , anthropocentric sustainability .
We turn now to the question of whether despite this conflict with sustainability , justice demands a permissive immigration policy .
Objections
Moral Arguments : Rights .
Perhaps the most important objections raised against restrictive immigration policies are that they are unjust , because they are unfair to potential immigrants .
One concise way of stating this is to say that would - be immigrants have a right to live and work in the United States .
While some immigrants ’ rights proponents argue for abolishing national borders altogether , most assert a general human right to freely move and settle without regard to national borders , subject to reasonable state restrictions to keep out criminals and prevent gross harms to receiving societies .
Clearly this right does not exist in American law .
The Constitution names no right to immigrate , and the Supreme Court has consistently upheld the federal government ’s right to regulate immigration into the country .
Neither does such a right exist in international law .
The U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not assert a general human right to immigrate into the country of one ’s choice , nor do other major framework international rights treaties .
19 Proponents , then , claim first the existence of a moral right to immigrate freely across borders , and second that national laws should be amended accordingly .
What arguments do they provide for creating this new and important legal right ?
Political theorist Chandran Kukathas gives the following “ liberal egalitarian ” argument for open borders .
From a proper universalistic moral point of view , he maintains , citizens of rich countries have no special claims to the resources and opportunities into which they have been born .
“ Egalitarianism demands that the Earth ’s resources be distributed as equally as possible , ” he writes , “ and one particularly effective mechanism for facilitating this is freedom of movement . ”
Egalitarians want to equalize not just resources , but opportunities .
Allowing people to migrate from poor , overcrowded countries with high unemployment and little chance for economic advancement to wealthier , less crowded countries equalizes opportunities .
“ Our starting point , ” Kukathas suggests , “ should be a recognition of our common humanity and the idea that both the resources of the Earth and the cooperation of our fellows are things to which no one has any privileged entitlement . ”
For these reasons , “ the movement of peoples should be free . ”
20
This is a powerful argument , since it rests on egalitarian values that many people share .
It also relies on the common thought : “ what right do I have to ‘ shut the door ’ on people who are just as good as I am and who , through no fault of their own , have been born into less happy circumstances ? ”
Kukathas ’ argument may speak particularly strongly to people who feel some sympathy with egalitarianism , but not enough to do anything about it personally .
For it says to wealthy Americans : “ You do n’t have to give up anything yourself to help poor people overseas live better lives .
You can fulfill any moral obligations you may have toward them by allowing them to come here and cut your grass , cook your food , and diaper your children . ”
Nevertheless , despite these strengths , there are good reasons to reject the liberal egalitarian argument for open borders .
Any rights claim must be tested against its effects on all interested parties — not just the parties pressing the claim .
Even widely accepted , fundamental human rights must be balanced against other rights and other important interests .
As we have seen , current high levels of immigration into the United States are leading to a larger population , which makes it much harder to share the landscape generously with nonhuman beings .
Allowing a general right to immigrate into the United States would greatly accelerate this process .
With “ open borders , ” the interests of nonhuman nature would be sacrificed completely to the interests of people .
The economic interests of would - be immigrants would trump the very existence of many nonhuman organisms , endangered species , and wild places in the United States .
Kukathas ( and most immigrants ’ rights advocates ) can accept this trade - off .
As the previous quotes illustrate , Kukathas sees nature essentially as “ the Earth ’s resources ; ” the only question to ask about them is how people may divide them up fairly and efficiently .
In seeking to make sense of Australian environmentalists ’ arguments for limiting immigration , he reduces these to worries that “ parks and sewerage services ” will be “ degraded ” — a revealingly soulless way of speaking .
21
But those of us who reject this anthropocentric perspective must consider the interests of the nonhuman beings that would be displaced by an ever - increasing human presence .
We ourselves believe that the human appropriation of natural landscapes has progressed so far in America that any further appropriation is unjust .
Some readers might not be willing to go that far ( although if that is the case , we wonder what you are waiting for ) .
But it is important to realize that accepting a general right to immigrate leaves no room to take nature ’s interests seriously , in the United States or elsewhere , since it undermines any possibility of limiting the human appropriation of nature .
For this reason alone , it must be rejected by anyone committed to generous sustainability .
A general right to immigrate also would conflict with American citizens ’ right to self - government .
Immigration can change the character of a society , for better or worse ; large - scale immigration can change a society quickly , radically , and irrevocably ( just ask the Tibetans ) .
Since self - government is a fundamental and well - established human right , the citizens of particular nations arguably should retain , through their elected officials , significant control over immigration policies .
As Michael Walzer puts it , in an influential discussion of immigration :
“ Admission and exclusion are at the core of communal independence .
They suggest the deepest meaning of self - determination .
Without them , there could not be communities of [ a specific ] character , historically stable , ongoing associations of men and women with some special commitment to one another and some special sense of their common life . ” 22
The citizens of a nation may work hard to create particular kinds of societies : societies that are sustainable , for example , or that limit inequalities of wealth , or that treat women and men as equals .
They typically develop feelings of affiliation and social commitments that have great value in themselves and that enable communal projects that create further value .
It seems wrong to suggest that these achievements , which may provide meaning , secure justice , and contribute substantially to people ’s quality of life , must be compromised because people in other countries are having too many children , or have failed to create decent societies themselves .
Such a situation does not call for the creation of a new right that undermines the self - government of others .
Instead it suggests that would - be immigrants need to take up responsibilities for self - government that they and their leaders have neglected in their own countries .
23
Environmentalists also worry that increasing human numbers will rob future generations of their right to enjoy a healthy environment with its full complement of native species .
As your authors watch increasing numbers of people displace wildlife along Colorado ’s Front Range , we recall a rueful passage from Henry Thoreau ’s journal , as he reflected on his own Concord landscape :
When I consider that the nobler animals have been exterminated here , I cannot but feel as if I lived in a tamed , and , as it were , emasculated country . . .
I take infinite pains to know the phenomena of the spring , thinking that I have here the entire poem , and then , to my chagrin , I hear that it is but an imperfect copy that I possess and have read , that my ancestors have torn out many of the first leaves and grandest passages , and mutilated it in many places .
24
We believe that like Thoreau , our descendants will “ wish to know an entire heaven and an entire Earth . ”
Since a growing population undermines the right of future Americans to enjoy a safe , clean environment and to know and explore wild nature , we must reject a general right to freely immigrate into the United States .
For American environmentalists , the interests of nonhuman nature , the right and responsibility of self - government , and our concern for future generations , all come together in our efforts to create a sustainable society .
Because we take this responsibility seriously and because it cannot be achieved without stopping America ’s population growth , we must reject a general right to immigrate into the United States .
Please note : this discussion does not deny the importance of human rights .
It presupposes them .
Rights allow us to protect important human interests and create egalitarian societies that maximize opportunities for people to flourish .
We believe rights are justified ultimately because they contribute to such human flourishing .
But when rights are pressed so far as to undermine human or nonhuman flourishing , they should be rejected .
25
Moral Arguments : Welfare .
Even if no general right to immigrate exists , however , there might still be good moral reasons for upholding the permissive immigration status quo .
Consider the following welfare - based
argument .
Approximately one and a half million people immigrate into the United States each year , and clearly the majority believe they will improve their own or their families ’ welfare by doing so .
Otherwise they would n’t come .
Immigrants may find educational , vocational , or other personal opportunities in the United States that they would otherwise be denied .
Immigrants coming from some countries may significantly improve their own or their families ’ health and longevity .
All else being equal , the potential improvements in would - be immigrants ’ welfare seem to make a powerful argument for continuing to allow mass immigration .
Of course , all else is not equal , as we have already shown .
Whatever may once have been the case , today continued mass immigration into the United States threatens the very existence of many nonhuman beings and species .
It compromises future generations ’ right to a decent environment , both here and abroad .
It makes it easier for common citizens and wealthy elites in other countries to ignore the conditions that are driving so many people to emigrate in the first place .
In addition , economists have shown that mass immigration drives down the wages of working - class Americans and increases economic inequality in the United States .
26
For all these reasons , the “ welfare ” argument does not make a convincing case for continuing high levels of immigration .
Indeed , we believe current high immigration levels are so harmful to the welfare of nonhuman beings and poor Americans , that our immigration policy is unjust toward those two groups .
27
Still , immigration ’s benefits to new immigrants remain substantial , and welfare arguments of the sort just canvassed cannot be ignored .
They point to a responsibility , not to immigrants per se , but to people around the globe who live in poverty , insecurity , and injustice .
Even the most generous immigration policies will not help most of them , since only a small percentage can conceivably emigrate from their home countries , and the worst off rarely have the resources to do so .
The wealthy people of the world — including not just citizens of “ the West , ” but hundreds of millions of people in the developing world — owe the world ’s poor people something .
Not the lucky few millions who manage to immigrate to the West , but the billions who will have to sink or swim where they are .
Just what do we owe them ?
We ’re not sure .
In One World : the Ethics of Globalization , Peter Singer argues that wealthy individuals and nations can and should increase and better target charity and foreign aid , to improve conditions for poor people overseas .
28 We find Singer ’s arguments convincing , although his account mostly ignores the responsibilities third - world elites have to create economically just societies and poor third - world citizens have to fight for them .
Views about the scope of our “ global ” obligations and the best ways to fulfill them are likely to vary widely .
However , we hope most of you will agree that wealthy people — West and East — have a prima facie duty to share some of our wealth and help the world ’s poor people live better lives .
Rather than try to justify this duty , we ’ll finish with three brief comments on its proper scope and pursuit .
First , mass immigration is neither a sufficient nor an efficient means of meeting it .
Inviting the world ’s poor to America to become our servants is a poor substitute for helping them create safe , just , flourishing societies where they live .
Even taking the most positive view possible of its effects on immigrants , mass immigration does nothing for the vast majority of the world ’s poor .29
Second , serious environmentalists will not allow efforts to help poor people , run roughshod over their environmental commitments .
Serious and immediate human needs may sometimes overrule our prima facie duties to protect wild nature and preserve a healthy environment .
But committed environmentalists cannot interpret our social duties in ways that make our environmental duties impossible to fulfill .
Third , fortunately , our prima facie duty to help the world ’s poor may be pursued in ways that do not undermine efforts to meet our prima facie environmental duties .
The United States government should be much more generous and intelligent with development aid to poor countries ( America ranks near the bottom among western democracies in per capita foreign aid , and much of this comes as military aid that actually harms poor people ) .
It should fully fund international family planning efforts , which help both nature and the poor .
It should set trade policies to benefit poor workers and protect nature , rather than to maximize trade .
The United States should pressure foreign governments to respect their citizens ’ rights , as mandated by international law .
Individual Americans should support charities with effective international aid programs , such as Oxfam and the United Nations Children ’s Fund .
We should cultivate personal and professional friendships across borders , in an effort to understand and appreciate our fellow human beings .
All these efforts , and more , may be taken up , without embracing mass immigration .
Mass immigration is no substitute for such efforts .
Most important , endless population growth is incompatible with creating just , sustainable , flourishing societies here in the United States and abroad .
Far from undermining our policy proposal to reduce immigration into the United States , considerations of justice in fact support that proposal .
It is an interesting question that should take precedence when justice and sustainability conflict .
Here we need not hazard an answer to this question , since both justice and sustainability point us toward a more restrictive U.S. immigration policy .
Environmental Arguments .
Environmentalists sometimes give specifically environmental reasons for supporting — or at least tolerating — high levels of immigration .
One common argument says that we should focus on consumption , not population as the root cause of our environmental problems .
“ Do n’t buy big suburban houses ; do n’t buy gas guzzlers ; do n’t put air conditioners in those houses and cars .
Americans ’ high level of consumption is the problem — not our population . ”
This argument is appealing because it seems to put the responsibility for change where it belongs : not on poor immigrants but on average Americans , who do consume too much and who could consume less without harming their quality of life .
But as we have seen , it is Americans ’ overall consumption that determines our environment impact .
Overall consumption equals per capita consumption multiplied by population .
So if high consumption is a problem , population growth must be , too .
In a variation on this theme , immigrant advocates sometimes assert that immigrants ( or perhaps “ recent immigrants , ” or “ most recent immigrants ” ) consume less than the average American .
One problem with this argument is that there are apparently no good figures comparing immigrants ’ and native - born Americans ’ consumption patterns .
But the main problem is that it focuses on a moment in time , rather than thinking through the long - term effects of population growth .
Immigrants ’ lower consumption levels , if they exist , are presumably a function of their relative poverty .
However immigrants are not coming to America to live in poverty , but to achieve “ the American dream ” and pass greater opportunities on to their children and grandchildren .
Two million more immigrants this year may mean 10 million more Americans 100 years from now — and if history is any guide , those 10 million Americans will live pretty much like other Americans .
The descendants of last century ’s Jewish and Italian immigrants do not seem to consume less than the average American today ; there is no reason to think that the descendants of today ’s Mexican and Chinese immigrants will consume less than the average American 100 years from now .
Bottom line :
If American consumption levels are too high , the problem is only made worse by population growth .
Another argument made by many American environmentalists is that overpopulation is important , but that it is a global , not national issue that can only be solved through international action .
The world ’s population increased by 76 million people in 2006 and 95 percent of that increase occurred in the developing world .
Rather than cutting immigration to keep our own population from growing , they argue , we should fund family planning overseas .
We should provide more foreign aid , and redirect trade and other government policies to help the poor , so fewer of them will feel compelled to leave their countries in order to live decent lives .
If we do these things , we will act humanely and help both poor people and the environment .
Before analyzing this argument , we should pause for a moment to appreciate its oddity .
No one argues : “ Deforestation is a global problem , therefore we should n’t worry about deforestation in our own country , or on the local landscape . ”
Or : “ Species loss is a global problem , therefore we should fund species protection efforts elsewhere , to the exclusion of efforts where we live . ”
Those who care about deforestation or species extinction often work especially hard to prevent them in the places they know best , and are applauded for doing so .
Besides , “ global ” efforts to halt deforestation and species loss are largely a summing up of local and national efforts focused on particular forests and species .
This is how environmentalism works , when it works .
Advocates for an exclusively global approach to overpopulation owe us explanations for why this one issue should play out differently and how it could play out differently , while still leading to environmentally acceptable results .
But no such arguments are forthcoming , and none seem remotely plausible .
Comforting as it is , the “ globalist ” argument fails , partly because it mischaracterizes overpopulation , which in fact can occur at various scales .
It makes sense to say : “ The world is overpopulated ; we do not know whether essential global ecosystem services can be sustained at these numbers over the long haul . ”
But it also makes sense to say : “ Tokyo is overpopulated ; its sidewalks , streets and trains are so crowded that there is no room to move . ”
Or : “ Nigeria is overpopulated ; its population is so large and is growing so fast that it has trouble providing jobs for its young adults , or building sufficient water and sewer facilities for its cities . ”
And just as Tokyo ’s citizens may try to alleviate local air pollution and Nigeria ’s citizens may try to protect their remnant forests , so they may try to address local or national overpopulation .
After all , they will have to live directly with their failure to do so and they cannot wait for the world to solve all its problems before they act to solve their own .
Returning to the United States , a strong case can be made that we are overpopulated right now .
Signs of stressed ecosystems and lost biodiversity abound .
Certainly we have not yet found a way to bring air and water pollution within limits acceptable to human health , nor have we stemmed the loss of productive farmlands and wildlife habitat , nor have we recovered more than a handful of the hundreds of species we have endangered .
And as we have seen when considering global warming , a large and growing population also makes it much harder for Americans to live up to our environmental responsibilities as global citizens .
Let us be clear : Advocates for international action are correct that wealthy countries should help poor countries stabilize their populations .
However , “ think globally , do n’t act locally ” is terrible advice .
It is possible and necessary to work on multiple levels at once .
We can make more generous contributions to the United Nations Population Fund and cut back on national immigration levels and limit local building permits .
Efforts at one level and in one place can only strengthen efforts at other levels and in other places .
Meanwhile , population growth is a problem in America right now .
If you live in the United States , the chances are good that your community is threatened by environmentally damaging development that is being caused ( or justified , in the planning stages ) by population growth .
But why should this matter ?
For finally , some environmentalists argue that immigration just moves people around , so it is ( or may be ) environmentally neutral , or even benign .
As one reader of an earlier version of this paper commented : “ Efforts to reduce overpopulation in New York or the United States do not help alleviate overpopulation worldwide , because people who are n’t let in have to go someplace else . ”
Added another reader : “ Ecological damage may be worse if people remain in their home countries rather than immigrating to the United States .
Immigration restrictions seem to privilege the U.S. ’s wild places over other , perhaps more biodiverse , places around the world . ”
Although one of us has spent time overseas working to protect endangered species , we plead guilty to a special concern for America ’s wildlife and wild lands .
But we do n’t apologize for it .
Environmentalism necessarily involves love , connection , and efforts to protect particular places .
Environmentalists should think long and hard before advocating anything that weakens this “ local focus , ” because a passionate connection to places that are “ near and dear ” to us is how environmentalism works , in Boston or Beijing .
This does n’t involve believing American ( or Chinese ) landscapes are more valuable than others .
It involves acting as if they are the most important landscapes in the world and using our most accessible political levers to protect them .
Although questions about the justice of moral particularism are vexed , we believe that a large degree of “ environmental particularism ” is justified , on both ethical and pragmatic grounds .
30
At a time when Americans move on average once every six years , arguing that we should further downplay our ties to particular places and communities is a bad idea .
That some environmentalists would even consider it shows how attempts to avoid population issues tend to warp our judgment .
However , cosmopolitan ethical universalists who reject our parochial concern for protecting America ’s native species and unique landscapes , should still support our proposal to reduce immigration into the United States , since doing so would also benefit the rest of the world .
This is because moving people to America , far from being environmentally benign or neutral , increases overall global resource consumption and pollution .
This in turn threatens to weaken the already - stressed global ecosystem services that we all depend upon — with the world ’s poorest people facing the greatest danger from possible ecological failures .
Consider Table 2 , which compares the average Americans ’ “ ecological footprint ” with averages from our 10 largest immigration “ source ” countries .
On average , immigrating from nine of these 10 countries greatly increases an individual ’s ecological footprint — and the ecological footprints of his or her descendants — by 100 percent to 1,000 percent or more .
In the case of Mexico , which accounts for nearly a third of all immigration to America , immigration increases individuals ’ consumption and pollution approximately 350 percent .
31
There probably are cases where immigrants consume more but do less ecological damage than they would have had they remained in their countries of origin ( slash - and - burn agriculturalists inhabiting biologically - rich forests ? ) , but clearly these are the exceptions .
More Americans is bad news for America ’s native flora and fauna .
But given global warming , it is also bad news for poor people living in the Sahel or in the Bhramaputra Delta .
Now , if emigration helped America ’s source countries get their own demographic houses in order , or opened up an ecological space that they used to create more sustainable or just societies , a case might be made for continuing to allow mass immigration into the United States .
Instead , America ’s permissive immigration policies appear to enable demographic and ecological irresponsibility and continuing social injustice .
As an example , consider Guatemala , where currently about 10 percent of the adult population lives and works in the United States .
and a recent poll showed that most young Guatemalans hope to do so in the future .
Guatemalan women ’s TFR averaged 4.6 children in 2005 , for an annual growth rate of 2.4 percent per year .
32 The Guatemalan government outlaws abortion ( except when a mother ’s life is at risk ) and does little to encourage contraception .
Guatemala has high deforestation rates and an unjust , highly inequitable distribution of wealth .
But there is little effort to change any of this , perhaps because the negative effects of local overpopulation are lessened through immigration and counterbalanced , for many individuals , by the positive incentives of having more remittances from family members in the United States .
Americans should do what we can to help other countries move toward sustainability , whether that means increasing funds for green development projects , or shutting off the “ safety valve ” that allows political elites to postpone necessary reforms .
But we believe that our primary responsibility is to create a sustainable society in the United States .
Not just because our local environmental duties are important .
Not just because this is the main way we may further our responsibilities as global citizens .
Perhaps most significant would be the powerful example of the world ’s wealthiest nation — the land of “ The Apprentice ” and “ Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? ” — rejecting the path of endless growth and embracing sustainability .
Limiting immigration into the United States and stabilizing our population would send a powerful message around the world that the time to create just , sustainable societies is now .
Economic Arguments .
This brings us to a final class of objections to our proposal : economic objections .
Many pro-business proponents praise mass immigration above all for increasing economic growth .
Immigration brings in poor unskilled workers willing to work physically demanding jobs for less money than native - born Americans , and highly trained professionals with the specialized skills needed by high - tech companies .
It thus helps businesses meet their needs and grow .
Immigration creates more domestic consumers ; as Tamar Jacoby puts it : “ Foreign workers emerging at the end of the day from the meatpacking plant or the carpet factory buy groceries and shoes for their children ; on Saturday , they buy washing machines and then hire plumbers to install them . ”
Immigration also reduces the cost of many goods and services , and this too increases overall consumption .
In all these ways , immigration results in “ a bigger , more productive economy . ” 33 That is why the Wall Street Journal , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , and other important business organs strongly support mass immigration ( and in the case of the Journal , “ open borders ” ) .
On the other hand , focusing on whether mass immigration is “ good for the economy ” ignores the fact that any immigration policy creates economic winners and losers .
According to Harvard economist George Borjas , “ immigration induces a substantial redistribution of wealth , away from workers who compete with immigrants and toward employers and other users of immigrant services . ” 34 This is because , compared to other industrialized nations , the United States imports a much higher percentage of less - educated , lower - skilled workers .
Borjas notes that “ between 1980 and 1995 , immigration increased the number of high school dropouts by 21 percent and the number of high school graduates by only 4 percent . ”
During this same period , the wage disparity between these two groups increased 11 percent , with perhaps half of that disparity a result of mass immigration .
35 Borjas calculates that between 1980 and 2000 , immigration reduced the average annual earnings of high school dropouts by 7.4 percent , or $ 1,800 on an average salary of $ 25,000.36
For these workers , who could least afford it , real wages actually declined during this period .
While the economic effects of immigration are complex and the details are open to debate , it appears that over the past few decades high immigration levels have contributed to increased economic growth , lower wages for the poorest Americans , and an increase in economic inequality in the United States .
Continued high levels of immigration will likely further these trends .
Far from strengthening the case for continued mass immigration , these effects provide three additional reasons to oppose it .
First , an immigration policy that benefits rich citizens ( who hire immigrants ) at the expense of poor citizens ( who compete with them ) seems prima facie unjust .
37 If Americans want to help poor foreigners , we should not do so on the backs of our own poor citizens .
( Liberal proponents of mass immigration are as loath to accept its effects on workers ’ wages as they are to accept its demographic and environmental effects .
But this is willed ignorance .
After all , trade groups representing landscapers and restaurant owners lobby for increased immigration precisely because it allows their members to hire workers for less money . )
Second , accepting greater economic inequality in exchange for greater overall wealth seems a foolish trade - off for Americans today .
We are already wealthy enough to provide for our real needs and reasonable desires .
Further wealth when combined with greater inequality is a recipe for frustration , envy , and social
tension .
Third , mass immigration ’s contribution to economic growth , far from being a net good , gives environmentalists their most important reason to oppose it .
Human economic activity is the primary driver of ecological degradation .
Future generations are going to have to reject the paradigm of an ever - growing economy and instead develop a sustainable economy that respects ecological limits .
38
The sooner we get cracking on this , the better .
Here in the United States , economic and demographic “ growthism ” are intimately intertwined — yet another reason why American environmentalists cannot ignore domestic population issues .
We contend , then , that economic considerations also support our immigration policy proposal — on a proper understanding of “ economy . ”
Eighty - five years ago , in a talk to the Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce ( which he once headed ) , Aldo Leopold asked : “ What , concretely , is our ambition as a city ?
‘ 100,000 by 1930 ’ — we have blazoned it forth like an army with banners … .
Can anyone deny that the vast fund of time , brains , and money now devoted to making our city big would actually make it better if diverted to betterment instead of bigness ? ”
Civic - mindedness may be a force for good , Leopold added , but went on to ask his “ boosters , ” somewhat plaintively : “ Is it too much to hope that this force , harnessed to a finer ideal , may some day accomplish good as well as big things ?
That our future standard of civic values may even exclude quantity , obtained at the expense of quality , as not worth while ?
”
39
No , this is not too much to hope .
Without such a society - wide “ revaluation of economic values , ” environmentalism will not succeed .
We must redefine “ the good life ” in less materialistic terms and create economies designed to sustain a finite number of such good lives — not to grow indefinitely .
These are daunting tasks , but they are not optional for serious environmentalists .
In America , where we habitually mistake bigness for goodness and quantity for quality , these tasks are even more urgent .
And as Leopold understood , population growth is an important part of the overall picture .
Conclusion
We have presented our reasons for limiting immigration into the United States and responded to the most common and consequential objections to our proposal .
In the end , we return to our primary argument .
Immigration is now the main driver of American population growth .
Continued American population growth is incompatible with sustainability , nationally or globally .
Therefore environmentalists committed to sustainability should support reducing current high levels of U.S. immigration .
Not just on pain of contradiction , but on pain of failure .
Americans must choose between sustainability and continued population growth .
We can not have both .

4 In fact , immigrants tend to have more children than native - born citizens , thus raising America ’s overall TFR .
Since these projections hold TFR steady under all three scenarios , they almost certainly understate immigration ’s contribution to population growth .
We think they also obscure the ability of the United States to transition to a stable population , if we are willing to drastically reduce immigration .

Here the right of movement and residence is clearly limited to a citizen ’s home country .
Article 14 asserts : “ Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution . ”
But this is a right to temporary refuge , not permanent settlement or full citizenship .
Most immigrants to the United States are not fleeing persecution but trying to better their lives ; hence the right of asylum does not come close to justifying their right to immigrate into the United States .
And since our immigration proposal accommodates legitimate asylum claims , it does not run afoul of article 14 .

Current attempts to increase immigration into the United Stats run afoul of the right to self - government more directly .
Polls consistently show Americans want less immigration , not more .
Surely in a democracy , their desires should be taken into account .
23 In researching a book on the ethics of immigration , the lead author has asked numerous immigrants from Mexico and Central America why they came to the United States .
Invariably , they spoke of “ corruption ” and the fact that a poor man or woman cannot make a good life in their countries .
What is the proper response to this ?
Surely not : “ Well then , let Mexico go to the dogs !
Come to America , and bring all your relatives ! ”
Better : “ Mexico needs to reform itself .
You need to get to work ; what can Americans do to help ? ”
Respondents usually just sighed at the suggestion that their countries might be reformed — but we think their fatalism is part of the problem .

29 One caveat is that particularly for some Latin American countries , remittances from workers in the United States are an important source of income for immigrants ’ families .
But these economic benefits must be weighed against the dispersal and break up of families , an important social cost .
They must be weighed against the cost of enabling these countries ’ continued failure to create just and sustainable societies .
30 Moral particularism is the position that we are justified in valuing those with whom we have family , neighborhood , or citizenship ties more highly than people in general .
It can be contrasted with ethical universalism or cosmopolitanism : the position that a true morality values all people equally .
While commonsense morality exhibits a high degree of moral particularism , moral philosophers tend to be moral universalists ( although there are numerous exceptions ) .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE : OCTOBER 30 , 1997
SPEAKER'S STATEMENT ON VISIT OF PRESIDENT JIANG
Washington , D.C. -- House Speaker Newt Gingrich released the following statement today following his meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin .
" I was pleased to have the opportunity to meet with President Jiang in the United States and to take part in a candid and direct dialogue about U.S. - Chinese relations .
" On every issue of concern to our two nations -- from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to the integration of Hong Kong , the status of Taiwan , and the growing inter- dependence of our two economies -- we spoke forcefully , honestly , and without reserve .
" Most importantly , Republican leaders made explicitly clear our unwavering commitment to human rights and individual liberty .
I believe it was vitally important that we used this opportunity to address the basic lack of freedom -- speech , liberty , assembly , the press -- in China .
Had we not done so , we would not only have betrayed our own tradition , we also would have failed to meet our obligations as a friend of China .
" As I said in China this spring , there is no place for abuse in what must be considered the family of man .
There is no place for torture and arbitrary detention .
There is no place for forced confessions .
There is no place for intolerance of dissent . "
" While we walked through the Rotunda .
I explained to President Jiang how the roots of American rule of law go back more than 700 years , to the signing of the Magna Carta .
The foundation of American values , therefore , is not a passing priority or a temporary trend .
We believe in religious liberty and personal freedom because the people who settled our country left the lands of their birth , accepting great danger and uncertainty , to secure those basic rights .
" I reminded our Chinese guests that you cannot have economic freedom without political freedom , and you cannot have political freedom without religious freedom .
You cannot have a system that is half totalitarian and half free .
It will not survive .
" I -- and the rest of the Republican leadership -- will continue to take whatever action we , can to help move China down the path of freedom , democracy , and liberty .
As Americans , as political leaders , as free individuals , it is our obligation to do what we can to extend these basic human rights and religious liberties to the rest of the world . "
-- House Speaker Newt Gingrich

Pre Sells 50,000 Units In First Weekend
There were all sorts of doubts surrounding Palm ’s Pre Launch .
Whether it was a shortage of hardware , a lackluster phone , or the short - term Sprint exclusivity , plenty folks had their reasons for thinking the phone would flop .
According to early reports out of the Wall Street Journal , the Pre was a bigger hit than many expected .
According to the WSJ , the Pre sold 50,000 units over the weekend , marking the launch a success , at least for now .
By comparison , the iPhone sold 146,000 units at launch , but as we know , the Pre is n’t the iPhone , and 50,000 units is nothing to scoff at .
Still , I have to wonder , will today ’s WWDC Keynote have an effect on upcoming sales ?
And what of inventory ?
Many stores report being sold out of the phone .
Some go so far as to claim the device is sold out nationwide .
If a new iPhone announcement does n’t kill the Pre , how long will consumers have to wait for the next shipment ?
A JP Morgan analyst says they ’re coming this week .
I hope so , for Palm ’s sake .

A drug currently FDA - approved for use in diabetes shows some protective effects in the brains of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis , researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine report in a study currently available online in the Journal of Neuroimmunology .
In a small , double - blinded clinical trial , patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis were assigned to take pioglitazone ( a drug commercially known as Actos used to treat type - 2 diabetes ) or a placebo .
Patients continued their normal course of therapy during the trial .
Standard neurological tests were done initially , as were MRI scans to provide baseline values for lesions typically seen in MS patients .
The patients were evaluated every two months , and blood samples were taken .
Repeat MRI scans were done after five months and again after one year .
Patients taking pioglitazone showed significantly less loss of gray matter over the course of the one - year trial than patients taking placebo .
Of the 21 patients who finished the study , patients taking pioglitazone had no adverse reactions and , further , found taking pioglitazone , which is administered in an oral tablet , easy .
" This is very encouraging , " said Douglas Feinstein , research professor of anesthesiology at UIC .
" Gray matter in the brain is the part that is rich in neurons .
These preliminary results suggest that the drug has important effects on neuronal survival . "
Feinstein's lab has been interested in the class of drugs called thiazolidinediones , or TZDs .
Several TZDs have been approved for use in the treatment of type - 2 diabetes because of the drugs ' effect on the body 's response to insulin .
The researchers focused on pioglitazone because of its known anti-inflammatory effects , Feinstein said .
They used primary cultures of brain cells to show that pioglitazone reduced the production of toxic chemicals called cytokines and reactive oxygen species .
These molecules are believed to be important in the development of symptoms in MS .
Feinstein's lab proceeded to test pioglitazone in an animal model of MS .
They and others showed that pioglitazone and other TZDs " can significantly reduce the clinical signs in mice with an MS - type disease , " said Feinstein .
" More importantly , when mice who are already ill are treated with pioglitazone , the clinical signs of the disease go away , " he said .
" We were able to induce almost complete remissions in a number of mice . "
" We are now working to determine the mechanisms to explain the protective effect on neurons that we see in our studies , " said Feinstein .
" We hope to expand into a larger trial to confirm these preliminary results . "
Claudia C. Kaiser , who was a post - doctoral student at UIC , is first author on the paper .
Other authors are Dinesh Shukla and Demetrios Shias of UIC ; Glen Stebbins , Dusan Stefoski and George Katsamakis of Rush University Medical Center ; and Douglas Jeffrey of Wake Forest University School of Medicine .
Takeda Pharmaceuticals funded the study and provided the drug but had no other involvement in the study .

MISSOURI SCRAPS M.I.A.C. REPORT
By Chuck Baldwin
March 27 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
Well , there is still hope for liberty after all !
After multiple thousands of phone calls , emails , faxes , and other communications from outraged citizens , the State of Missouri has rescinded its controversial " militia " report .
This proves the point I made in this column recently that the most effective way to fight an ever - encroaching federal leviathan is to focus on our individual states .
Let me review the events of the last few weeks so as to help readers familiarize themselves with this historic -- and I do mean historic -- episode .
On February 20 , 2009 , the State of Missouri , via its Department of Public Safety , issued what was called " MIAC Strategic Report : The Modern Militia Movement . "
In this report , people who supported Presidential candidates Ron Paul , Bob Barr , and yours truly were referenced as being connected to potentially dangerous " militia members . "
But the inference did not stop there .
People of conservative ideology were also identified in the State Police report as being potentially dangerous .
People who held political opinions opposing abortion , illegal immigration , the New World Order , the North American Union , the Income Tax , the U.N. , etc. , were profiled in the MIAC report .
Interestingly enough , no left - leaning political ideologies were identified .
No Islamic extremists .
No environmental extremists .
Only people holding " conservative " or " right - wing " philosophies were identified in the MIAC report .
The MIAC report was categorized as " Unclassified / Law Enforcement Sensitive , " meaning the report was intended for law enforcement personnel only .
Fortunately , an unidentified ( for obvious reasons ) Missouri law enforcement officer , who was extremely disturbed by this report , sent a copy to nationally syndicated radio talk show host Alex Jones .
Of course , Jones immediately " blew the whistle " on the story .
This was on March 11 .
On March 14 , the Columbia ( Missouri ) Daily Tribune ran a story on the subject , and on March 17 , I wrote my first column about it .
From that point , the story went viral .
Internet sites , radio talk show hosts , and bloggers all over America picked up the story , and thousands of outraged citizens began bombarding the appropriate officials in Missouri with protests .
Even Fox News Channel talk show host Glenn Beck ran a feature on the story on Friday , March 20 , and again on Monday , March 23 .
The Constitution Party issued a " Travel Advisory " for the State of Missouri , warning tourists and residents about the possibility of being profiled by State Police for such things as having bumper stickers with political statements on their vehicles , etc .
All of this commotion was not lost on several Missouri State legislators and executive officers , either .
Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder called on Governor Jay Nixon ( who had previously stood by and defended the MIAC report ) to place Department of Public Safety Director John Britt on administrative leave pending an investigation into the report .
In addition , several Missouri State legislators said they would introduce an amendment to the Department of Public Safety 's budget barring the agency from using " state or federal funds for political profiling . "
On March 23 , DPS Director John Britt sent an apology letter to Ron Paul , Bob Barr , and me stating , " I have ordered that the offending report be edited so as to excise all reference to Ron Paul , Bob Barr or Chuck Baldwin and to any third - party political organizations . "
While Ron , Bob , and I appreciated the apology and retraction from Mr. Britt , the overriding offense of the report still lingered : namely , the report , with a very broad brush , linked people holding conservative political opinions to dangerous and violence - prone " militias , " which Missouri law enforcement personnel were instructed to be on guard against .
Therefore , public outcry against the MIAC report continued , Mr. Britt 's apology notwithstanding .
Then , on Wednesday , March 25 , the head of the Missouri State Highway Patrol , Col. James F. Keathley , ordered the Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) to " permanently cease distribution " of this abysmal report .
Keathley said that neither he nor Britt had read the report before it was distributed .
Keathley also noted that the report was filled with numerous spelling and grammatical errors and did not cite any sources for its broad statements about " right - wing " militias .
He further said that his department would now review how the MIAC distributes intelligence reports to police officers .
He said the process " needs improvement . "

Dear readers , please take a bow !
Because of tens of thousands of patriotic , freedom - loving Americans -- including thousands of courageous Missourians -- the long arm of totalitarianism was shortened just a bit .
This sordid story is truly an embarrassment to the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and the State of Missouri .
Governor Nixon , especially , is left with egg on his face for foolishly and stupidly standing behind the report , when he had either never read it , or , if he had , was just as guilty of political profiling as the ones who wrote the report .
Why DHS , you ask ?
Because the MIAC report is similar to several other reports currently circulating around various State police agencies courtesy of DHS - sponsored " Fusion Centers . "
There is another side of this story that is even more sinister , however .
If we can continue to probe the details of the MIAC report , I am absolutely convinced we will find that this report actually originates with Morris Dees and his ultra-liberal Southern Poverty Law Center .
And if my hunch ( a very educated hunch , I might add ) is correct , it means that the DHS and various State police agencies around the country are allowing a left - wing special interest group to use them to harass , intimidate , and profile people with conservative political opinions .
I would further proffer that those of us who are outraged by this event should not stop with the MIAC report being removed .
While this is very good news , the fear and intimidation associated with those referenced in this report has already taken place .
Are people opposed to abortion , illegal immigration , the Income Tax , the U.N. , etc. , now afraid to express their opinions publicly ( especially in Missouri ) ?
If so , this seems to me to be the basis for legal action , based on the abridgment of the First Amendment freedom of speech by a State ( and perhaps federal ) law enforcement agency .
There is yet another chilling question that must be answered : by saying Missouri State Police will " review " how MIAC distributes intelligence reports to police officers , does Col .
Keathley mean that the State of Missouri 's law enforcement agencies will continue to promote similar reports , but simply make them " Classified " ?
In other words , will they ( and other State police agencies around the country ) simply employ greater secrecy when issuing such reports , but do nothing to change the content of future reports ?
Hopefully not , but we shall see .
With that said , here are the lessons all of us need to take to heart :
* Every police officer , deputy sheriff , and law enforcement officer in America who believes in constitutional government , individual liberty , and the Bill of Rights needs to be alert for any report that smacks of the MIAC report , and be willing to quickly " blow the whistle " on any such report they see .
* Lovers of freedom should be much encouraged to see what can happen when they are willing to stand up to their State governing officials as they see abridgements to their liberties taking place .
I say again , the best way to fight these mushrooming despotic tendencies of government we seem to see everywhere is to focus on our State governments .
Do you now see why I say that ?
Even if DHS was behind the MIAC report , it was the State of Missouri that had to implement it ; and it was the State of Missouri that ( under pressure ) killed it .
See my column on this important subject here .
* Notice , too , that we did not need the major media to achieve this victory .
We cut off this one branch of the tyranny tree without the help of ABC , CBS , NBC , CNN , FOX NEWS ( with the exception of Glenn Beck ) , or even the Drudge Report .
Victory was achieved with the weapons of talk radio , syndicated Internet columns , Internet blogging , and word of mouth .
You see , folks , we can achieve victory without the major media .
But we must stay focused and actively involved in our respective State governments .
" We the people " are still the power of this country .
And do n't let anyone deceive you into believing anything else .
Therefore , take heart in knowing that your diligence convinced the State of Missouri to rescind its atrocious MIAC report .
Now , do n't let it stop there .
Let 's faithfully cut off the tentacles of tyranny wherever we find them .
Amen ?

Hard - hitting report describes how America will be affected region by region if no action is taken on climate change
Manhattan floods , Chicago heatwaves and withering Californian vines : how scientists see the US in 75 years
The Obama administration 's long - awaited scientific report on the sweeping and life - altering consequences of a failure to act on global warming – Global climate change impacts in the United States – is released today .
It provides the most detailed picture to date of the impacts on the US in the worst case scenarios , when no action is taken to cut emissions .
Examples include : floods in lower Manhattan ; a quadrupling of heatwave deaths in Chicago ; withering on the vineyards of California ; the disappearance of wildflowers from the slopes of the Rockies ; the extinction of Alaska 's wild polar bears in the next 75 years .
What lies ahead by region
North - east
The winter snow season could be cut in half in southern New York , Vermont , New Hampshire and Maine — maybe as short as a week or two , under the higher emissions scenario .
This would destroy winter traditions like skiing and skating and outdoor ponds .
Native cranberries and blueberries would disappear ; dairy herds , the biggest agricultural industry , would decline under the higher emissions scenario .
South - east
Summer temperatures in Florida could rise by 4.1C ( 10.5 F ) , with the heat effect multipled by decreased rainfall under the higher emissions scenario .
There would be increased hurricane intensity and rising sea levels leads to loss of wetlands and coastal areas .
It would lead to a severe decline in quality of life .
Mid-west
Frequent , severe and longer lasting heatwaves in cities – as many as three a year in Chicago under the higher emissions scenario .
Water levels in the Great Lakes could fall by up to two feet by the end of the century under the higher emissions scenario .
South - west
Continued strong warming will threaten flow of Colorado river .
Alaska
Has been warming at twice the rate of the rest of the US over last 50 years .

So far we have been processing images by looking at the grey level at each point in the image .
These methods are known as spatial methods .
However , there are many ways of transforming image data into alternative representations that are more amenable for certain types of analysis .
The most common image transform takes spatial data and transforms it into frequency data .
This is done using the Fourier transform .
The Fourier transform is simply a method of expressing a function ( which is a point in some infinite dimensional vector space of functions ) in terms of the sum of its projections onto a set of basis functions .
Since an image is only defined on a closed and bounded domain ( the image window ) , we can assume that the image is defined as being zero outside this window .
In other words , we can assume that the image function is integrable over the real line .
To see how the Fourier transform works , we will begin with a one - dimensional signal and consider a simple step function .
This is equivalent to taking a horizontal slice through an image that is black on its left half and white on its right half , as shown in figure 1 .
Now , a step function ( or a square wave form ) can be represented as a sum of sine waves of frequency , where is the frequency of the square wave , and we recall that frequency = 1 / wavelength .
Normally , frequency refers to the rate of repetitions per unit time , that is , the number of cycles per second ( Hertz ) .
In images we are concerned with spatial frequency , that is , the rate at which brightness in the image varies across the image , or varies with viewing angle .
Figure 2 shows the sum of the first few terms in a sine wave decomposition of a square wave .
This sum converges to the square wave as the number of terms tends to infinity .
Figure 1 : A step function as a slice through an image .
Figure 2 : A step function is the sum of an infinite number of sine waves .
From the decomposition of the signal into varying sinusoidal components we can construct a diagram displaying the amplitudes of all the sinusoids for all the frequencies .
A graph of such a diagram is given in figure 3 below for the square wave .
Note that we have to consider negative frequencies ( whatever that might actually mean ) so the sinusoidal component of frequency f and amplitude A 1 has to be split into two components of amplitude A 1 / 2 at the frequencies +f and - f .
A graph of the amplitude of the Fourier components is known as the spectrum of the wave form .
Figure 3 : The amplitude of the sine waves at each frequency for a square wave .
For example , a vector v in 3 - space is described in terms of 3 orthogonal unit vectors i , j and k , and we can write v as the sum of its projections onto these 3 basis vectors :
A similar process is used to calculate the Fourier transform of a function .
The function is just , conceptually , a point in some vector space ( although now the vector space is infinitely dimensional ) .
Given our orthogonal basis functions , we calculate the component of our given function in each of the basis functions by calculating the inner product between the two .
The standard basis functions used for Fourier transform are or , equivalently .
It is the frequency that varies over the set of all real numbers to give us an infinite collection of basis functions .
Since
We can show that any two basis functions of different frequencies are orthogonal by calculating their inner product and showing that it is 0 .
For example , for the real case and considering only the cosine terms ,
Thus , we project our given function f onto our basis functions to get the Fourier amplitudes for each frequency :
We often express F in polar form though :
Figure 4 : The amplitude and phase angle of a sine wave at a particular frequency .
The norm of the amplitude , is called the Fourier spectrum of f , and the exponent is called the phase angle .
The square of the amplitude is just and is called the power spectrum of f .
In many applications only the amplitude information is needed and the phase information is discarded .
However , despite this common practice , phase information should not be ignored .
In images , as in sound signals , phase carries considerable information [ 3 ] .
Oppenheim and Lim have shown that if we construct synthetic images made from the amplitude information of one image and the phase information of another , it is the image corresponding to the phase data that we perceive , if somewhat degraded .
Figure 5 : The amplitude data are taken from the vdu image and the phase data are taken from the face image .
Figure 6 : The phase data dominates our perception .
Example Consider again the square wave form shown in the figure below .
Figure 7 : A square wave form and its Fourier spectrum .
This is a complex - values quantity , and the Fourier spectrum is given by its modulus , .
Suppose we are given two functions f and g , with Fourier transforms F and G , and suppose that a and b are constants .
Then
The Fourier transform is linear , that is ,
Changing spatial scale inversely affects frequency and amplitude , that is ,
Shifting the function only changes the phase of the spectrum , that is ,
if f ( x ) is real , then
( ) is real , then if f ( x ) is imaginary , then
( ) is imaginary , then if f ( x ) is even , then
( ) is even , then if f(x ) is odd , then .
The Convolution Theorem tells us that convolution in the spatial domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain , and vice versa .
That is ,
Now an image is thought of as a two dimensional function and so the Fourier transform of an image is a two dimensional object .
Thus , if f is an image , then

Mass Tourism on Roof of the World ' If You Want a Mountain Adventure , Don't Climb Everest '
In May , journalist Billi Bierling became the first German woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest from Nepal .
She was shocked at the naivete of many mountaineers and astounded that , these days , Everest base camps offer hot showers , Internet access , TVs and fresh strawberries .
Despite the fact that many in power are reluctant to investigate the Bush Administration decisions about " harsh interrogation " it is clear now that the CIA acted outside the legal guidelines established by the Department of Justice OLC memos written by John Yoo and Jay Bybee in 2002 .
In particular , the CIA use of waterboarding appears to have crossed the line into what would " shock the conscience " of most people - torture .
Nonetheless , many remain opposed to exploring these potential crimes .
President Obama has said on several occasions that he did not favor investigations or prosecutions for EIT , but preferred to " look forward " :
Asked for the first time to respond to the likelihood that Spanish prosecutors will target officials in the Bush administration for sanctioning torture at Guantanamo Bay , Barack Obama stressed , once again , that he prefers to look forward , not backward .
With an opportunity like this to slink off under a rock and be forgotten , one might expect John Yoo , Dick Cheney and the torture captains of the CIA to keep a low profile and let the furor from the left die down .
But this is the opposite of what is happening .
Dick Cheney and the torture architects are full - throttle unrepentant , clearly angling for a public showdown .
And most tellingly , they are engaged in a simultaneous , aggressive campaign to implicate leading Democrats in the program :
Present or former members of the CIA have been engaged in a " leak war " aimed at Democrats who were briefed or otherwise associated with the Bush Administration EIT program .
Porter Goss or his devotees went after Jane Harman .
CIA leakers went to Pete Hoekstra and ABC news to release misleading logs of congressional briefings of EIT that implicated Nancy Pelosi and Jay Rockefeller in decision making .
What is Going on ?
I argue that Cheney and the torture program architects believe that investigations of some sort are inevitable .
I think this is their reasoning :
A true belief that Torture is Necessary .
A true belief that Americans will agree that Torture is Necessary .
An understanding that with more and more leaked documents , calls for investigation and prosecution will never stop .
An understanding that the Obama Administration now controls access to all of the documents and can declassify them in a sequence or pattern that damages any claims of " necessity " .
Specifically , it is now clear that Obama will declassify the CIA Office of Inspector General Report that found that EITs were not effective .
An understanding that Republicans do not control any congressional committees .
Democrats own subpoena power for any congressional torture inquiries .
In short , they are playing a big game of chicken with Congressional Democrats to bring forward INDEPENDENT investigations .
They are implicating / sullying leading Democrats ( Pelosi , Harman , Rockefeller ) to try to make a case that any investigations and subpoenas should not be from the " deeply complicit " congress .
I think they believe that the inevitable investigations would be fairer to them if run by an independent prosecutor .
Dick Cheney is evil , but he is not stupid .
He is taunting Congressional Democrats to establish investigations .
Will Democrats lose the game of chicken and drive the investigations into a ditch ?
If Congressional Democrats blink and decide to " look forward " , Cheney 's reckless bravado will go unchallenged and Congressional Democrats will , by inaction , admit their guilt in the Torture Regime .
The precedent for State - sanctioned torture by the US Government will stand .

Back in the day when J. David Donahue was commissioner at the Indiana Department of Correction ( IDOC ) , a 16 - foot table came to life that will be remembered and used on many occasions .
I am speaking of the conference table for the Governor ’s Office , which Donahue , being the head of the organization that made it , was quick to praise :
A true work of art .
This table will be enjoyed by State and National leaders for years to come .
The DOC is honored to have been responsible for its creation .
While it is not false that the IDOC is responsible for this masterpiece , everyone at the correctional facility agreed that the parquet table deserved a more detailed history , hence the short write - up entitled Indiana Offenders and Westville Correctional Facility Staff Collaborate on Conference Table for Governor ’s Office :
The 16 - foot long structure was designed by a small group of offenders and staff from the Westville Correctional Facility and is made of wood from trees grown on the facility grounds .
Several years ago the trees , which include cherry , tulip , poplar , black walnut and white pine were cut down to improve visibility and security .
Much of the wood was turned in to mulch .
However , the best pieces were milled , dried and preserved in speculation that a project worthy of their use would arise someday .
The elaborate parquet top is fashioned with puzzle like intricacy and displays the Seal of Indiana , the State Flag and the State of Indiana with each county carved out of a separate piece of wood .
Eight offenders and Alex McEathron , a long - time employee of the Westville Carpentry shop and the wizard behind this laborious miracle , took 2,000 man-hours over the course of six months to bring this 900 lb , $ 625 structure with its 92 jagged counties to completion .
It replaced the old conference table for the Governor ’s Office , which ex-commissioner Donahue described as , “ rickety and in need of major repairs . ”

MELBOURNE , Fla . 
The government ’s urgent push into cyberwarfare has set off a rush among the biggest military companies for billions of dollars in new defense contracts .
The exotic nature of the work , coupled with the deep recession , is enabling the companies to attract top young talent that once would have gone to Silicon Valley .
And the race to develop weapons that defend against , or initiate , computer attacks has given rise to thousands of “ hacker soldiers ” within the Pentagon who can blend the new capabilities into the nation ’s war planning .
Nearly all of the largest military companies  including Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics , Lockheed Martin and Raytheon  have major cyber contracts with the military and intelligence agencies .
The companies have been moving quickly to lock up the relatively small number of experts with the training and creativity to block the attacks and design countermeasures .
They have been buying smaller firms , financing academic research and running advertisements for “ cyberninjas ” at a time when other industries are shedding workers .
In Fall 2008 , I had the pleasure of TAing Database Systems with Sam Madden , Mike Stonebraker , and Evan Jones .
I figured that I could take notes to help students follow the lectures while clarifying any confusing points that were raised during discussion .
It would also help me avoid the embarrassment of forgetting something mentioned during a lecture and having students explain it to me during office hours : ) .
I decided to take notes in plain text , mostly out of laziness .
This turned out to be a challenge for drawing things like query plans , but forced me to distill explanations into a conversational tone that provided an alternative to traditional diagrams .
Some students in the class told me that they benefited from and enjoyed the notes , and so I decided to open them up for reuse by the rest of the web community .
The topics are as follows :
Feel free to take a read through the notes , and shoot me an email with requests , corrections , or just to let me know you read something .

Was he one of the boys I met on Monday afternoon ?
A process of verification has to take place to make sure that there is an Ibrahim in the centre and that he is her son .
It is explained to us that the due diligence involved in reuniting a family is lengthy – it ca n’t just happen .
There are questions to be answered on Ibrahim ’s state of mind ; what will he do if he does return to his family ?
Will he find a vocational skill ?
The light is fading and we have to go .
I ask Fatiha if I can take her picture .
She is shy but says yes if we show it to her son .
I take a photograph of each family member and show it to them on the back of my camera .
We drive back to the Unicef base , I watch the movement of people in the evening light .
Mr. Joseph Benson ( .pdf ) is from Houston , Texas .
When I met him for the first time last Wednesday he was wearing cowboy gear including the hat , which covered his long braided hair .
He had a huge smile on his face and is a magnetic speaker ; here is the story he told us :
He was the first in his family to go to and complete college .
After his BA , he went on and got professional chef 's training , and worked his way up in that industry , working in various restaurants and becoming a head chef .
He saved money , moved back to Houston to help care of his parents and start his own family .
He built up a custom catering business , and was now the boss , employing 25 other people .
He had a wife and two children , and was putting money away for their college funds .
He had health insurance and auto insurance and his own home .
Surely this was the living embodiment of the " Only in America " all - American dream .
However , one night , on the way home from a catering job , he had an automobile accident , running head on into a commercial flatbed truck .
The other truck was parked and loading scrap from a junk yard , and was jutting out into the road without it lights or blinkers on .
He survived but was in the hospital for almost a year .
Did I mention that when I met him , in addition to the cowboy outfit and smile , he was in a wheelchair with no legs , both amputated high above the knee ?
The medical bills quickly blew past what his insurance would cover .
The owner and driver of the other truck did not have insurance , like 10 - 20 % of vehicle owners despite the mandate to buy auto insurance , so Mr. Benson and his insurance company were unable to go after that source .
He lost his business .
His employees lost their jobs ( and presumably their families suffered ) .
He and his family lost their house .
He and his family lost the kids college fund .
He lost his family .
When he was finally discharged from the hospital , it was to the street .
I 'd probably would have just killed myself .
He survived but started drinking .
A lot .
And cocaine .
Note that in this instance it was the homelessness first , that then led to the drinking and drugs ; not the other way around .
Eventually , he wound up in a shelter , and eventually he was able to put his professional chef skills to work in the " soup kitchen . "
From that he has worked his way back to sobriety , fulltime employment and housing .
Medical Bankruptcy :
Need I point out this is but an extreme ( or not so extreme ) example of the phenomenon of medical bankruptcy , despite having both a job and health insurance when he was injured .
Will our health care reform end the " Only in America " phenomenon of medical bankruptcy ?
In America :
Illness and medical bills were linked to at least 62.1 % of all personal bankruptcies in 2007 .
Based on the current bankruptcy filing rate , medical bankruptcies will total 866,000 and involve 2.346 million Americans this year – about one person every 15 seconds .
Most medically bankrupt families were middle class before they suffered financial setbacks .
60.3 % of them had attended college and 66.4 % had owned a home ; 20 % of families included a military veteran or active - duty soldier .
78 % of the individuals whose illness led to bankruptcy had health insurance at the onset of the bankrupting illness ; 60 % had private insurance .
69 % of debtor families had coverage at the time of their bankruptcy filing ; 60 % of families had continuous coverage .
Surprise , medical bankruptcy is also linked to losing your home , and to homelessness .
Duh .
Homelessness in America :
Many factors put people and families at risk of homelessness .
Systemic issues of unemployment , low wages , expensive housing , lack of health insurance and racial discrimination combine with common personal issues such as domestic violence , abuse of alcohol and other drugs , and serious mental and physical illnesses to create this persistent social problem .
But two trends are largely responsible for the rise in homelessness over the past 25 years : a growing shortage of affordable rental housing and a simultaneous increase in poverty .
Homelessness in America is bigger and broader than many realize :
Number of Homeless Persons in U.S. Annually : 3.5 million .
Number of Homeless Persons in U.S. Nightly : 842,000 .
About 15 million of us experience homelessness at least once in our lifetime .
39 % of the homeless are under the age 18 : 1.35 million children per year and 200,000 on any given night .
23 % of all homeless people were members of families with children
400,000 veterans are homeless per year , 200,000 on any given night .
The role of mental illness and substance use is less than you may assume : Approximately 16 % of the single adult homeless population suffers from some form of severe and persistent mental illness ; 30 % currently addicted to alcohol or drugs .
The cliché is that the closing of mental hospitals turned out many crazy people onto the streets .
That is in fact a smaller and often over - emphasized part of the problem .
The bigger part of the problem is stagnant income and less affordable housing .
The main cure for homelessness is affordable homes .
9 million low - income renter households nationwide pay more than half of their income for housing .
In no community in the U.S. today can someone who gets a fulltime job at the minimum wage reasonably expect to find a modest rental unit he or she can afford .
And of course our current foreclosure crisis is also linked to increased homelessness .
The National Health Care for the Homeless Council endorses single payer and HR - 676 for a reason .
They are on the frontlines of how our health care " system " really works .
Single payer -- with automatic enrollment , everybody - in and nobody - out , and elimination of premiums , copayments and deductibles -- assures that there is no more medical bankruptcy and that everybody regardless of circumstance really is covered .
And single payer controls total costs to the country and for individuals .
Will the health reform we get in 2009 do that ?
How do we get from here to there ?
I like to live life dangerously .
Wild stuff like living by myself , being single and staying in watching Ealing comedies on DVD .
If I keep up this kind of behaviour into my 50s , it will double my risk of heart disease , the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health reported last week .
I already knew not getting married was more dangerous than smoking , while Richard Layard has been reminding me in his book Happiness that not marrying is likely to make me more miserable than those who wed ( but do n't divorce ) .
If all that was n't bad enough , I 'm also a social problem .
Having a whole flat to myself means I take up too much room in our overcrowded island and my atomised existence is indirectly responsible for social breakdown and crime , as I 'm contributing to the weakening of community cohesion .
Pleasing yourself ( not like that ) has never been so socially and morally unacceptable .
The only trouble is that none of this evidence shows that being single is bad for you .
People who live alone simply tend to expose themselves to more health risks than those who do not .
Single people are more likely to eat badly and smoke , and that is what kills them .
That is why comparing solo living with smoking as a risk factor just does not make sense .
Smoking damages your body directly ; living alone is in itself harmless .
In general , it is true that people are happier if they have strong family and social networks .
But this does not depend on how many people you share your home with .
Miserable couples who just stay in and watch TV are less socially connected than live - alones who go out every night .
Furthermore , there are many who actually prefer relative solitude , so it is not inevitable that being a loner will make you less happy and healthy .
As for our environmental impact , a two - car couple in a large house use up more resources than I do , especially if they have kids they refuse to keep in tree houses and rear as semi-feral hunter - gatherers .
As long as I eat well , exercise , am not wasteful and get as much social contact as I need , being single is not only perfectly safe , it is better for me than growing fat and old with a wife , social circle and family who all drive me up the wall .
And if anyone has studied the effects of being a bitter cynic on life expectancy , they can sod off too .
