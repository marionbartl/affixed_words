One of the commonly accepted beliefs in the software world is that talented programmers are more productive .
Since we CannotMeasureProductivity this is a belief that cannot be proven , but it seems reasonable .
After all just about every human endeavor shows some people better than others , often markedly so .
It 's also commonly observed by programmers themselves , although it always seems to be remarked on by those who consider themselves to be in the better talented category .
Naturally better programmers cost more , either as full - time hires or in contracting .
But the interesting question is , despite this , are more expensive programmers actually cheaper ?
On the face of it , this seems a silly question .
How can a more expensive resource end up being cheaper ?
The trick , as it is so often , is to think about the broader picture of cost and value .
Although the technorati generally agree that talented programmers are more productive than the average , the impossibility of measurement means they cannot come up with an actual figure .
So let 's invent one for argument sake : 2 . If you can find a factor - 2 talented programmer for less than twice of the salary of an average programmer - then that programmer ends up being cheaper .
To state this more generally :
If the cost premium for a more productive developer is less than the higher productivity of that developer , then it 's cheaper to hire the more expensive developer .
The cheaper talent hypothesis is that the cost premium is indeed less , and thus it 's cheaper to hire more productive developers even if they are more expensive .
In case anyone has n't noticed this hypothesis is a key part of our philosophy at ThoughtWorks and is one of the main reasons why I ended up switching from an independent consultant to join .
We believe we actually end up cheaper for our clients , even though our rates were higher .
Of course , we do have difficulty persuading many clients that this is true - that lack of objective productivity measures strikes again .
I still remember a meeting with one prospective client complaining about how our rates were higher than a company who had made a previous , failed , attempt at the system we were bidding on .
We had to politely point out that paying less rates for a project that delivered no value was hardly a financially prudent strategy .
There are some notable consequences to the the cheaper talent hypothesis .
Most notably is one that it actually follows a positive scaling effect - the bigger the team the bigger the benefits of cheaper talent .
Let 's assume we actually have put together a team of ten talented developers to run a project in some alternative universe where we have actually measures that they are twice as productive as the average - and thus do cost exactly twice as much to hire .
In this case you might naturally assume that a rival team of average programmers would be a team of twenty .
The trouble is that that assumption assumes productivity scales linearly with team size , which again observation indicates is n't the case .
Software development depends very much on communication between team members .
The biggest issue on software teams is making sure everyone understands what everyone else is doing .
As a result productivity scales a good bit less than linearly with team size .
As usual we have no clear measure , but I 'm inclined to guess at it being closer to the square root .
If we use my evidence - free guess as the basis then to get double the productivity we need to quadruple the team size .
So our average talent team needs to have forty people to match our ten talented people - at which point it costs twice as much .
Another factor that plays a role here is time - to - market .
Let 's assume two teams of four people , one talented and one average .
To stack the deck of our argument against our talented team , discount the previous paragraphs , and assume the talented team is only twice as productive as the average team .
If the talented team charges twice as much then can we assume that it does n't matter financially which team we pick ?
I 'm afraid the talented team wins again .
They 'll complete the project in half of the time of the average team , which means that the customer will start yielding value from the delivered software earlier .
This earlier value , compounded by the time value of money , represents a financial gain for picking the talented team , even thought their cost per output is the same .
Agile development further accelerates this effect .
A talented team has a faster cycle time than an average team .
This allows the full team to explore options faster : building , evaluating , optimizing .
This accelerates producing better software , thus generating higher value .
This compounds the time - to - market effect .
( And it 's natural to assume that a talented team is more likely to produce better software in any case . )
Faster cycle time leads to a better external product , but perhaps the greatest contribution a talented team can make is to produce software with greater internal quality .
It strikes to me that the productivity difference between a talented programmer and an average programmer is probably less than the productivity difference between a good code - base and an average code - base .
Since talented programmer tend to produce good code - bases , this implies that the productivity advantages compound over time due to internal quality too .
All this sounds , at least to me , like a highly compelling argument .
It 's also one that 's widely accepted ( at least by programmers who consider themselves talented ) .
But it 's far off being accepted by the software industry as a whole .
We can tell this because the premium for talented developers ( in terms of salary / contracting fees ) is less than the productivity difference .
Probably the major reason for this the inability to objectively measure productivity .
A hirer cannot have objective proof that a more expensive programmer is actually more productive .
Only the higher cost is objective .
As a result a hirer has to match a subjective judgment of higher value against an objective higher cost .
Many hirers , even if they believe the talented programmer is worthwhile personally , is n't prepared to justify the full higher cost to managers , HR , and purchasing .
This effect is compounded by the difficulty in making even a subjective assessment .
At ThoughtWorks we rely on peer assessment - developers abilities are assessed by fellow team members .
The result is hardly pinpoint precision , but it 's the best anyone can do .
Which all points out that hiring and retaining talented programmers is hard work .
Hiring and assessment is hard work .
You have to deal with people with very individual desires , which are even more important to track as they are effectively underpaid .
So a hirer is faced with certain extra work and higher costs versus only a judgment call for higher productivity .
So I understand the situation but do n't accept it .
I believe that if the software industry is to fulfill its potential it needs to recognize the cheaper talent hypothesis and close the gap between high productivity and higher compensation .

Story Highlights • 5 - 4 ruling could open door to revisiting Roe v. Wade
• Justice Kennedy : Law does not violate constitutional right to abortion
• New justices Alito , Roberts provided solid conservative majority to uphold ban
• Federal law has never gone into effect pending court rulings
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a law that banned a type of late - term abortion , a ruling that could portend enormous social , legal and political implications for the divisive issue .
The sharply divided 5 - 4 ruling could prove historic .
It sends a possible signal of the court 's willingness , under Chief Justice John Roberts , to someday revisit the basic right to abortion guaranteed in the 1973 Roe v. Wade case .
President Bush , who signed the law in 2003 and appointed two of the justices who upheld it , said the prohibition " represents a commitment to building a culture of life in America . "
" Today 's decision affirms that the Constitution does not stand in the way of the people 's representatives enacting laws reflecting the compassion and humanity of America , " he said in a statement released by the White House .
At issue is the constitutionality of a federal law banning a rarely performed type of abortion carried out in the middle - to - late second trimester .
( Watch how the decision might affect Roe vs. Wade )
The legal sticking point was that the law lacked a " health exception " for a woman who might suffer serious medical complications , something the justices have said in the past is necessary when considering abortion restrictions .
In the majority opinion , Justice Anthony Kennedy , the key swing vote in these divided appeals , said the federal law " does not have the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden on the abortion right . "
He was joined by his fellow conservatives , Justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas , Samuel Alito and Roberts .
Sole woman on bench reads bitter dissent
In a bitter dissent read from the bench , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the only woman on the high court , said the majority 's opinion " cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away a right declared again and again by this court , and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women 's lives . "
She called the ruling " alarming " and noted the conservative majority " tolerates , indeed applauds , federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases " by doctor 's groups , including gyncecologists .
The Justice Department and abortion rights groups have offered differing views of the legislation 's impact on women 's overall second trimester access to the procedure , and whether the procedure is ever medically necessary .
This was the first time the high court had heard a major abortion case in six years , and since then , its makeup has changed , with Roberts and Alito now on board .
Their presence on the bench provided the solid conservative majority needed to allow the federal ban to go into effect , with Kennedy providing the key fifth vote for a majority .
Alito replaced Sandra Day O'Connor , a key abortion rights supporter over her quarter century on the bench .
" A lot of us wish that Alito were n't there and O'Connor were there , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , who opposed Alito 's nomination , said .
Doctors call this type of late - term abortion an " intact dilation and evacuation . "
Abortion foes term it a " partial - birth abortion . "
Three federal appeals courts had ruled against the government , saying the federal Partial - Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 is unconstitutional because it does not provide a " health exception " for pregnant women facing a medical emergency .
The outcome of this latest challenge before the court 's new ideological makeup could turn on the legal weight given past rulings on the health exception .
In states where such exceptions are allowed , the lists of possible health risks include severe blood loss , damage to vital organs and loss of fertility .
Court briefs noted pregnant women having the procedure most often have their health threatened by cancer , heart disease , high blood pressure or risk of stroke .
Doctors are given the discretion to recommend when the late - term procedure should be performed .
The federal law has never gone into effect , pending the outcome of nearly three years of legal appeals .
Specifically , the ban encompasses what doctors call " intact dilation and evacuation " ( also known as IDX ) , which Congress in its legislation termed inhumane .
It is a rarely used second - trimester procedure , designed to reduce complications to the woman .
More common is " dilation and evacuation " ( D&E ) , used in 95 percent of pre-viability second - trimester abortions , according to Planned Parenthood .
Both are generally performed after the 21st week of pregnancy .
A major part of the legal dispute was whether the federal ban also includes the relatively more common " standard D&E abortions . "
The government contends the law does not , and is sufficiently narrow not to place an " undue burden " on a woman 's reproductive choices .
Raw numbers were also at the heart of the debate , because the two sides disagreed on how often the procedure is performed .
Solicitor General Paul Clement , the Justice Department 's top lawyer before the court , suggested it is rarely performed , and that other medical options are available , so banning it would therefore not be a real barrier to women .
Abortions rights supporters say " intact " abortions are a medically accepted pre-viability , second - trimester procedure .
Since the Roe v.
Wade decision legalizing abortion , some states have tried to place restrictions and exceptions on access to the procedure , prompting a string of high court " clarifications " on the issue over the years .

A few decades ago , upwards of one - third of the American workforce was unionized .
Now the figure is down around 10 percent .
And news media are central to the downward spiral .
As unions wither , the journalistic establishment has a rationale for giving them less ink and air time .
As the media coverage diminishes , fewer Americans find much reason to believe that unions are relevant to their working lives .
But the media problem for labor goes far beyond the fading of unions from newsprint , television and radio .
Media outlets are n't just giving short shrift to organized labor .
The avoidance extends to unorganized labor , too .
So often , when issues of workplaces and livelihoods appear in the news , they 're framed in terms of employer plights .
The frequent emphasis is on the prospects and perils of companies that must compete .
Well , sure , firms need to compete .
And working people need to feed and clothe and house themselves and their families .
And workers hope to provide adequate medical care .
The issue of health insurance is a political talking - point for many candidates these days .
But meanwhile , unionized workers are finding themselves in a weakened position when they try to retain whatever medical coverage they may have .
And non-unionized workers often have little or none .
With all the media discussion of corporate bottom - line difficulties , the human element routinely gets lost in the shuffle .
In day - to - day business news and in general reporting , the lives of people on the line are apt to be rendered as abstractions .
Or they simply go unmentioned .
The topic of war in Iraq is huge in the media .
I can't say much for the quality of that coverage , but at least it keeps reporting that a military war is happening overseas .
But what about the economic war that 's happening at home ?
Phrases like " class war " have been discredited in American news media -- tarred as too blunt , too combative , too rhetorical .
But , call it what you will , the clash of economic interests is with us always .
Waged from the top down , class war is a triumphant activity -- and part of the success involves the framing and avoidance of certain unpleasant realities via corporate - owned media outlets .
You do n't need to be a rocket scientist or a social scientist to grasp that multibillion - dollar companies are not going to own , or advertise with , media firms that challenge the power of multibillion - dollar companies .
One of the dominant yet little - remarked - upon shifts in the media landscape over the past couple of decades has been the enormous upsurge in business news as general news .
A result is that tens of millions of low - income people are seeing constant news stories about challenges and opportunities for well - to - do investors .
The reverse , of course , is not the case .
The very affluent of our society do n't often pick up a newspaper or tune in the evening news and encounter waves of stories and commentaries about the dire straits of America 's poor people and what it 's like to be one of them .
And it 's even more rare to see coverage of ways that a few people grow obscenely wealthy as a direct result of the further impoverishment of the many .
" Class war " ?
The nation 's most powerful editors cringe at the phrase .
But every day , millions of Americans are painfully aware that -- by any other name -- class warfare is going on , and they 're losing .

Is the United States headed for double bubble trouble ?
Richard Baldwin
As the dollar has started to slide , the question is : how far , how fast ?
This column , which is based on Paul Krugman ’s recent Economic Policy article suggests the answers are : pretty far and pretty fast .
In the minds of most mainstream international economists , there is never much doubt that the dollar must eventually decline significantly .
1
A trade deficit this big cannot persist indefinitely .
Many analysts hope that the necessary real depreciation of the dollar might be gradual .
After all , is n’t the avoidance of such jumps one of the reasons we abandoned the Bretton Woods fixed - exchange system for a floating regime ?
So why are there modern fears of a sudden discrete drop in the dollar ?
Here is the basic idea underlying dollar ‘ plunge scenarios . ’
Foreign investors have long demonstrated an increased appetite for US assets , moving a greater share of their portfolios into dollars and thus generating large capital flow into the US .
But the capital flows needed to maintain an increased dollar share are much smaller than those needed to achieve it .
Thus , when investors reach their desired holdings , there will be a drop off in capital flows into the United States , leading to an abrupt decline in both the current account deficit and the value of the dollar .
Standard asset - price logic , however , argues against this sort of anticipated sudden depreciation .
Investors should see it coming , and this will dampen their shift into dollars .
Under the ‘ gradual scenario’ , the adjustment process is smoothed as dollar assets become more attractive while the greenback drops towards its sustainable level .
The asset - pricing logic is impeccable .
The only reason to predict a sudden dollar plunge is if we believe today 's capital flows are driven by investor myopia .
That the markets are due for what Krugman calls a ' Wile E. Coyote ' moment – a reference to the Warner Brothers ’ cartoon where a greedy , shortsighted coyote chases a roadrunner off a cliff but does n’t start falling until he looks down and realizes he ’s left solid ground .
Up until this ' Wile E. Coyote ' moment , his belief that he ’s on solid ground prevents him from falling .
For investors in dollars , the ' Wile E. Coyote ' moment comes when they realise that their expectations are inconsistent with any feasible adjustment path .
2
What constitutes a feasible adjustment path ?
The key criterion is that the dollar must fall quickly enough to avoid US external debt reaching an unsustainable level .
A simple model of the relationship between the path of the exchange rate and the path of external debt can assist in assessing the likelihood that investors are naively chasing the Road Runner off the cliff .
Glossing over many details , a ' generic ' portfolio balance model of the exchange rate lets us evaluate investor expectations .
See Krugman ( 2007 ) for a mathematical exposition .
In this simple model , the real exchange rate is a function of external debt and expected appreciation .
External debt affects the portfolio balance – a larger net external debt requires foreigners to hold a larger share of US assets or Americans to hold a smaller share of foreign assets , so the dollar must be lower .
Expected appreciation affects the portfolio composition – investors prefer a currency that is expected to appreciate in value .
The dynamic of debt accumulation , the other variable of interest , is driven by the exchange rate and the debt level .
Since the US tends to hold real assets abroad while its liabilities are denominated in dollars , a real depreciation of the dollar raises the value of US external assets without increasing its liabilities .
So dollar depreciation reduces net external debt .
The debt level affects its own rate of change in two ways .
On one side , higher net debt reduces net investment income .
On the other side , the debt - GDP ratio tends to fall , other things equal , due to GDP growth with the size of this effect depending on the initial ratio .
Which of the two effects dominates depends on whether the marginal rate of return on foreign debt is above or below the rate of GDP growth ; this is not critical to the Krugman story .
Given these standard asset - markets dynamics – and assuming that investors are rational , and that the US external debt is below its long - run equilibrium level – the value of the dollar is held down by expectations of future decline .
Forward - looking behaviour rules out a sudden plunge .
But are investors forward - looking ?
If we believe that there are limits to how high the debt - GDP ratio may realistically rise , then the debt level ( and exchange rate ) must converge to the long - run equilibrium rapidly enough to avoid exceeding that limit .
US net external debt is about 20 % of GDP .
This ratio will continue to rise so long as the United States runs a large current account deficit .
Its rate of change depends on the rate of real depreciation along the assumed equilibrium path – faster convergence implies a lower long - run net external debt .
By how much must the real dollar fall to reach long - run equilibrium ?
In principle , this is endogenous to the steady - state debt level .
A reasonable lower bound on the necessary real depreciation is the decline that is sufficient to bring the US balance of payments on goods and services to zero .
Obstfeld and Rogoff ( 2005 ) estimate that a real depreciation of around 35 % would be required .
This is unlikely to be a serious overestimate and certainly might be a serious underestimate .
Given the current debt level and the depreciation required , consider whether there is any rate of convergence that is consistent with both present market expectations and plausible long - run net external debt levels .
A 5 % convergence rate implies an initial rate of depreciation of 1.75 % per year – 0.05 times the long - run depreciation of 35 % .
This results in an eventual net debt - GDP ratio of 118 % , which would generally be considered excessive .
A 10 % rate of convergence implies an initial 3.5 % real rate of depreciation and an eventual debt - GDP ratio of 58 % , which would be high by historical standards but perhaps plausible given financial globalisation .
What all this means is that a realistic long - run adjustment path requires real depreciation at more than 2 % annually , perhaps as high as 4 % .
Those are plausible rates – provided that investors are being compensated for the future depreciation by higher real returns on dollar investments .
They are not .
That ’s the catch .
As of April 2007 , there was essentially no real interest rate differential between the dollar and euro , and only a 0.9 % real differential against the yen .
As interest rates dropped worldwide in reaction to the Subprime mess , the gaps will not change much and may even move in the wrong direction .
Future real depreciation of 2 - 4 % annually implies that foreign investors are buying US bonds offering low or even negative real rates of return .
This strongly suggests investor myopia .
If markets are not taking the dollar ’s future decline into account , then the world economy is not on a smooth adjustment path .
There ’s a reasonable case that markets are headed for a Wile E. Coyote moment .
Moreover , the plunge may be larger than suggested thus far .
The 35 % depreciation target is a conservative estimate .
Indeed , the significant secular downward trend in the real dollar – the fact that since 1975 the real dollar associated with any given level of trade deficit seems to have declined –suggests that the dollar has even further to fall .

Darkish reasoning : how the Coyote can hover
While mainstream thinking asserts that that the US ’ big trade gap suggests that the dollar must fall , the dollar itself seemed impervious to such suggestions for years .
The strong dollar lasted so long that economists started inventing logics to challenge the mainstream thinking .
Four novel arguments are especially noteworthy as they posit structural reasons for why the US current account deficit , and hence the strong dollar , may be more sustainable than previously thought .
They are : 1 ) a global savings glut , 2 ) privileged rates of return enjoyed by US investors , 3 ) a ‘ Bretton Woods II ’ regime , and 4 ) ‘ dark matter ’ in trade flow statistics .
Let ’s address each in turn .
First , many economists , including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ( 2005 ) , have argued that there is a global savings glut that helps to explain the US current account deficit .
While high savings abroad could make a large , prolonged deficit economically sensible , the net indebtedness of the United States must eventually stabilise , necessitating an inevitable real decline in the dollar .
If investors anticipate this , then there ought to be a real interest differential between the United States and other countries to compensate them for the eventual real depreciation .
There is not .
A second objection might rely on the fact that US investors earn substantially higher rates of return abroad than foreign investors in the United States .
If this return differential is real and permanent , then it reflects what Gourinchas and Rey ( 2005 ) call – following De Gaulle ’s oratorical flourish – an ‘ exorbitant privilege . ’
But such a privilege is easily incorporated into the thought experiment above .
First , it might cause GDP growth to exceed the marginal rate of return on foreign debt , dampening the impact of debt build - up on the adjusted current account .
Second , it would modify the estimate of the debt - GDP ratio ’s initial rate of change , as the rate of debt accumulation would be further below the deficit on goods and services .
Nonetheless , investor expectations remain far from a feasible path .
The third novel argument , put forth by Dooley , Folkerts - Landau and Garber ( 2003 ) , says the international monetary order has entered a ‘ Bretton Woods II ’ era , in which many central banks , mostly Asian , buy dollars to maintain nearly fixed exchange rates .
Thus , despite a low rate of return , dollars will flow into the United States so long as central banks believe they need dollar assets .
However , if this bank activity ran contrary to private expectations of real depreciation , we would see private capital outflows at least partly offsetting official capital inflows .
But there is significant private inflow , so Bretton Woods II cannot explain the puzzling fact that private investors seem happy to buy dollar assets , despite a very modest real return differential that is overwhelmed by reasonable estimates of the rate at which the dollar must fall .
Finally , Hausmann and Sturzenegger ( 2007 ) explain the sustainability of substantial international imbalances with ‘ dark matter . ’
It ’s all down to Mark Twain ’s third - type of lie – statistics .
Official statistics , the story goes , drastically understate the assets US investors hold overseas by omitting US - based multinationals ' exports of hidden assets such as expertise and reputation .
However , the puzzling combination of a roughly zero US investment income balance and a negative US net investment position seems to reflect low returns on foreign investment in the United States rather than high returns abroad .
This implies that the ‘ dark matter ’ is foreign firms bringing bad reputations to US markets , which seems unlikely .
Moreover , dark matter could only alleviate the need for dollar depreciation if it were rapidly increasing , as its level does not counterbalance the large current account deficit .
While it is easy to imagine that many US foreign assets are undercounted , it is much more difficult to argue that such ‘ dark matter ’ is growing .
Therefore we still have reason to believe that a Wile E. Coyote moment is in the offing .
Though it 's always dangerous to second - guess markets , the data do seem to suggest myopia , and none of the various explanations of the US current account deficit advanced in recent years ease the difficulty of reconciling the willingness of investors to hold dollar assets enjoying only a tiny real interest differential with the size of the apparently inevitable dollar decline .
In February 2007 , Krugman wrote that we seem due for a discrete drop in the dollar .
That is looking pretty good at the moment .
How much the fall will hurt depends on other things .
He wrote in February that a dollar plunge is potentially frightening if it is coupled with a collapse of the housing bubble , but it is unlikely to be disastrous .
In the medium - run , a contraction exacerbated by dollar depreciation will be offset by greater net exports .
Still , a dollar plunge , by heading off what might otherwise be a substantial fall in long - term interest rates , may extend and deepen a housing - induced slump , as well as reduce the Fed ’s leverage over the economy .
That would be ‘ double bubble trouble ’ and it probably wo n’t be much fun .
POSTSCRIPT ADDED 9 November 2007
Flashback to 1985 : Krugman ’s view on the dollar
Rummaging around the web last night I came across a Paul Krugman paper on the how far and how fast the dollar needs to fall .
What ’s noteworthy is the date .
Paul wrote it in August 1985 for the Jackson Hole conference when the US trade deficit seemed huge and the dollar had just started its 3 - year slide .
The 1985 abstract could be the abstract for his February 2007 article on the same subject .
This paper presents evidence strongly suggesting that the current strength of the dollar reflects myopic behavior by international investors ; that is , that part of the dollar 's strength can be viewed as a speculative bubble .
At some point this bubble will burst , leading to a sharp fall in the dollar 's value .
The essential argument is that given the modest real interest differentials between the U.S. and its trading partners , the dollar ’s strength amounts to an implicit forecast on the part of the market that with high probability the dollar will remain very strong for an extended period .
The paper shows that such sustained dollar strength would lead the U.S. to Latin American levels of debt relative to GNP , which is presumably not feasible .
Allowing for the possibility that something will be done to bring the dollar down before this happens actually reinforces the argument that the current value of the dollar is unreasonable .
Of course , Paul has become a much better writer since then , so the “ bubble will burst , leading to a sharp fall in the dollar 's value ” is now the “ Wiley E. Coyote moment , ” but the economic logic has not changed .
Paul ’s thesis adviser was Mr. Overshooting , Rudi Dornbusch .
You could not complete Rudi ’s course at MIT , 14.582 , without having the link between current interest rates and market expectations of depreciation tattooed inside your brain .
Paul ’s prediction in 1985 and this year simply adds a rough calculation as to whether the US trade deficit would become unsustainably large if the dollar fell as slowly as the interest rate gap would suggest .
Here are a couple of quick charts that provide historical perspective .
Both are flawed since they are in nominal terms , but they illustrate the point .

Or What is Wrong with the Clintons
[ digg- reddit - me ]
In 1992 , a man from Hope inspired Americans , and a plurality voted him into the White House .
But something less hopeful lurked underneath the surface of this aspiring political dynasty .
Joe Klein , writing as Anonymous in his fictionalization of Bill Clinton ’s 1992 campaign , Primary Colors , told the story from the perspective of an idealistic young aide corrupted both by the process and the charismatic candidate himself .
The major subplot of the novel involved a close and lifelong friend of the Stantons ( representing the Clintons ) who when confronted with the venality , ruthlessness , and pure lust for power of the candidate and his wife killed herself in anger and sorrow .
George Stephanopoulos , writing in his memoir of the campaign and early Clinton presidency , attributed the suicide of the close Clinton confidante and advisor , Vince Foster to a similar emotional breakdown .
Writing shortly after Foster ’s death , Margaret Carlson of Time magazine , quoted Foster as saying : “ Before we came here , we thought of ourselves as good people . ”
Politics , as Stephanopoulos describes it delicately , is about “ play[ing ] the game for the sake of getting good things done . ”
Any realist – any student of history – any politician – will tell you that there is a large element of truth to this .
What was Lend - Lease but part of a game FDR was playing to drag us into World War II ?
What was Lincoln ’s careful campaign formulation of allowing slavery to stay where it was but preventing any new slave states from from joining the Union if not a political stratagem ?
But there is a sense among those who worked with the Clintons that they sold their soul to win this game – that their lust for power overrode all ethical impulses , and that they sullied everyone who believed in them .
There is a risk of this disappointment in every campaign – including Barack Obama’s .
Power corrupts .
Washington corrupts .
Dreams and ideals and promises are broken upon hard reality .
But sometimes , our leaders , all too human as they may be , help us rise above the game .
Martin Luther King , Jr. had a dream ; John F. Kennedy called on a nation to go to the moon ; Abraham Lincoln called on the “ better angels of our nature ” .
All of these men were corrupted by power ; none of them were perfect ; they were all politicians .
Yet each man met their moment ; each individual transcended mere politics even as they participated in the political game .
They had the judgment to know when to compromise and when to stand firm .
The Clintons had their chance .
They demonstrated their character – and were found wanting .
Bill Clinton recently said that to vote for Barack Obama is to “ roll the dice ” .
He had a point .
Obama may be corrupted as easily as the Clintons were .
But at least with Obama , there is a chance the story might turn out differently .
We need to , in Bill Clinton ’s words , “ roll the dice ” .

Michael Steven Gorbey , a 38 - year - old with a long criminal record , was arrested and is charged as a felon in possession of a firearm , police said .
Other charges are pending .
Gorbey did not resist arrest after he was apprehended walking in the direction of the Capitol , police said .
“ The officers were able to apprehend him quite easily , ” said U.S. Capitol Police spokeswoman Sgt. Kimberly Schneider .
She said Gorbey ’s residence was unknown and that there were several different addresses associated with his name .
“ He ’s got an extensive criminal record , ” Schneider said .
She did not provide details about where Gorbey might have been going or what he meant to do when he got there .
“ He could have been headed anywhere , ” she said .
Police with dogs cordoned off several blocks as a bomb squad inspected Gorbey ’s pickup truck , parked just a block from Senate office buildings and three blocks from the Capitol .
Schneider said there were “ items of concern ” inside the truck .
She declined to identify the items , which are still under investigation .
Police removed the vehicle from the area .
Shortly after , in the mid-1970s , he was thrown from his motorcycle one night , not far from his mother ’s home .
He had swerved to dodge a car .
His right leg was barely attached below the knee .
“ I was in a cast for 66 weeks , ” he said .
He began taking painkillers , and made regular trips to New York in the early 1980s to buy drugs for himself and to sell to others back home .
He moved here about 1984 .
He ran out of money and landed on the Bowery in the Providence Hotel , one of what used to be many single - room - occupancy buildings for men .
Mr. Foley said he does not drink or use drugs anymore , and he visits a methadone clinic on Cooper Square six days a week to curb cravings for opiates .
He has a long arrest record in New York City , mostly for possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia , and a few arrests for selling .
It is unclear how many times Mr. Foley was convicted .
The city ’s jails held a man named John Foley with the same birth date 22 times since 1983 .
Mr. Foley said that number sounded low .
Eighteen of the arrests involved drugs .
No one with his name and date of birth is listed in state correctional records , but Mr. Foley said he served 18 months in a minimum - security prison beginning in 1984 .
He collects small disability checks from the government .
Along the way , in SoHo , he met Fish , the co-creator and first resident of the box .
“ Fish was moving the box all over town , the poor guy , ” Mr. Foley said .
When Fish found his own place in Brooklyn , he gave Mr. Foley the box .
Mr. Foley wrote his name and address on the side and chained it to the pole on Broome Street .
He said the police told him he could stay if he did not cause any trouble .
He found a battery - powered nightlight , and slept on top of one sleeping bag and beneath another .
He read the papers and Sports Illustrated until the streets outside hushed .
“ The worst nights were Friday and Saturday , ” he said .
“ You had the drunks going by .
They would tease me , bang on the box .

Fans and entrepreneurs are running with The Post ’s “ 18 - 1 ” – creating memorabilia to celebrate the Giants ’ upset victory in Sunday ’s Super Bowl over New England .
On Thursday , The Post filed trademark application No. 77385477 for the term “ 18 - 1 ” after learning the Patriots attempted to trademark “ 19 - 0 ” and “ 19 - 0 The Perfect Season ” weeks before Super Bowl XLII .
“ Nobody ’s perfect , ” quipped Giant spokesman Pat Hanlon on the explosion of celebratory gear .
Now plenty of others are seeing the wisdom – and fun – of such an immortal slogan of victory that forever corrects the Patriots ’ premature attempt to write history .
“ When [ the Patriots ] filed the trademark , I heard about it in The New York Post .
I thought that ’s enough to make the New York Giants win the game , and I filed my own trademark , ” said Curtis Lyons , a Jackson , Miss . - based Web designer who unveiled his own line of celebratory wear .
His shirts – the slogan “ 19 - 0 The Perfect Season ” with a bold “ OOPS ” stamped underneath – are selling briskly on his Web said , he said .
Derek Payne , 28 , of Pittsburgh , designed a line of “ 18 - 1 ” shirts that are being sold on zazzle.com .
On his shirts , the numeral 1 is replaced with a graphic of a hand flipping the bird .
“ I ’m a Steeler fan , so I ’ll give the Pats the middle finger as much as anybody , ” he said .
“ I was definitely cheering for the New York Giants as they knocked the Pats off their perch last night . ”
As long as these souvenir sellers do not brand their T - shirts as “ 18 - 1 , ” they will likely not run afoul of The Post ’s pending trademark application , according to independent intellectual - property attorney Milord Keshishian .
Other homemade victory tees include “ Belichick ” and “ Belicheat ” – the latter a reference to spy - scandal Patriot coach Bill Belichick – along with “ 18 * - 1 – Giants 17 Cheaters 14 . ” With Barry Petchesky

It ’s the most wonderful time of the year … especially if you ’re a fan of candy canes !
Each passing year seems to bring more and more variety to the candy cane aisle , and 2007 is no exception .
This year ’s crop of canes covers every flavor from watermelon to popcorn , and with so many choices , it ’s hard to pick just one box .
Fortunately , I write about candy , so this was n’t a problem for me .
I walked in to my local drugstore , picked up seven boxes , and merrily went along my way .
So now , after a week of eating more candy canes than I care to admit , I ’m finally ready to bring you my Candy Cane Roundup of 2007 !
Nickelodeon Candy Canes
Nickelodeon gets into the holiday spirit with a set of 12 fruit - flavored candy canes , named after four popular cartoon characters : Strawberry Dora , Blue Raspberry Diego , Watermelon Patrick , and Sour Apple Spongebob .
This may be a nitpick on my part , but why on earth is n’t the Spongebob candy cane pineapple flavored ?
He lives in a pineapple under the sea , not a sour apple .
Come on , people .
If you ’re going to do a character tie - in , you might as well do it right .
The candy canes were quite sweet , including Spongebob Sour Apple , which did n’t taste very sour at all .
The Blue Raspberry Diego canes were very tasty , and reminded me of Blue RazzBerry Blow Pops , while the Strawberry Doras and Watermelon Patricks were both true to their flavor , though the watermelon and strawberry essences of both were often lost beneath an overall veil of general sweetness .
Though they were n’t my favorite canes , the Nickelodeon pack provides cute packaging , fun colors , and flavors that will surely be appreciated by younger Candy Addicts and fans of super - sugary treats .
Now and Later Candy Canes
My co-taster noted that the Now and Later canes , ( which come in four flavors : strawberry , apple , grape , and watermelon ) tasted “ true to the original candy . ”
He ’s absolutely right : these canes taste exactly like their candy forefathers , especially the grape , which is the standout of the pack .
The only drawback is that half the fun of eating the original Now and Laters is their hardcore chewy factor , which is missing in candy cane form .
They should really rename these “ NOW ” candy canes ; there ’s not much of a Later factor here , unless you wrap the cane in plastic and stick it in your pocket , and that ’s just kind of gross .
LifeSavers Candy Canes
If you like LifeSavers , you ’ll like LifeSavers candy canes .
They are exactly the same as the original LifeSavers fruit - flavored candies , stretched into cane form .
There are n’t any surprises here , unless you ’ve never had a LifeSaver before , and if that ’s the case , you should probably go down to the store , pick up a pack , and right a tremendous wrong in your life .
Jolly Rancher Bold Fruit Smoothies
Ok .
I love Jolly Ranchers .
If I could build a house out of Sour Apple Jolly Ranchers , I would .
But then I ’d be homeless , because I ’d eat the entire thing in about 2 days .
My love of Jolly Ranchers knows no bounds .
At least , I thought that was the case , until Jolly Rancher Bold Fruit Smoothies candy canes came along and blew that theory to bits .
Here ’s my issue with these canes : they do n’t taste like Jolly Ranchers .
At all .
They are n’t bad – they have a very smooth berry flavor and a nice sweet crunch , and a co-taster actually called them his “ absolute favorites ” – but they do n’t taste like Jolly Ranchers .
They taste like Strawberry Doras .
This would be fine , if they were n’t marketed as Jolly Rancher candy canes , but it ’s a disappointment to those of us who enjoy the original candy .
Jelly Belly Candy Canes
The box declares : “ Original Gourmet Jelly Belly Flavors . ”
Unfortunately , it also says : “ Very Cherry , Cotton Candy , Juicy Pear , Buttered Popcorn . ”
Half the fun of eating Jelly Belly jelly beans is the art of mixing various beans to create new and exciting flavors .
Mix a chocolate pudding and a toasted marshmallow , and voila !
Instant s’mores .
It ’s strange , therefore , that Jelly Belly decided to release a box of mini candy canes with the most incompatible flavor combinations possible .
How fun would it have been to get mint , gingerbread , eggnog , or cinnamon canes , or to get a box of flavors specifically designed to mix into various Christmas cookie combos ?
Instead , we ’re left with pear and popcorn , which are n’t particularly festive or compatible .
The canes themselves are decent : the cotton candy is the best of the four , with a true cotton candy taste that will be appreciated by those who are already mourning the close of State Fair season .
It just seems to me to be an unnecessary collection : I ’d much rather get a big box of Jelly Belly jelly beans , which would provide a candy experience with more variety and endless combinations .
Sometimes it ’s better to stick to the original .
Hershey ’s Chocolate Mint Canes
It ’s not really a secret that I love chocolate and mint , and so it ’s probably no surprise that I absolutely loved Hershey ’s Chocolate Mint candy canes .
The packaging was the best of all of the canes I tried : there are two recipes on the back of the box , as well as a craft project – instructions on how to make your very own Hershey Bar Sled !
The Chocolate Mint canes are quite tasty – the mint is more of a spearmint than a peppermint , which provides a unique twist on the standard candy cane , while the chocolate is reminiscent of chocolate Tootsie pops – a killer combo of flavors that makes this particular cane super delicious and a welcome addition to my holiday candy dish .
Bob ’s Original Peppermint Candy Canes
The holidays make us do strange things .
I ’m not sure how it is in your family , but it seems that in my family , we go back to tradition , regardless of how we ’ve changed , or how the world has changed , or how silly it may seem .
We watch the same old movies , we eat the same dishes , we hang the same ornaments on the tree , and we always have a dish of candy canes on the table .
I know there are millions of different flavors out there , as I ’ve eaten nearly every available candy cane out there over the past few weeks ( Seriously – SO .
MANY . CANDY CANES . ) but in the end , my favorite candy canes are the ones that remind me of Christmases past – old school peppermint .
We can have peppermint anytime we want , in mints , in gum , even in toothpaste .
But it never tastes as good as it does when it comes from a candy cane , and Bob ’s Peppermint Candy Canes are old - fashioned , brightly - colored , and as good as peppermint candy canes come .
So there you have it .
I realize there are some brands and flavors that I did n’t cover , but a girl can only eat so many candy canes in one week .
Trust me .
If I could have eaten anymore , I totally would have .
( Especially if I ’d found Spree Candy Canes , which , sadly , were nowhere to be found . )
If you have a favorite that I missed , let me know .
And if you happen to have the blueprints for a Jolly Rancher house , pass those along , too .
I ’ve got big plans for 2008 .
PS : If you or a loved one has a peanut allergy , here is a helpful link that lists 10 Peanut Allergy Safe Candy Canes for 2007 .
Faster transmission speeds , low power usage , and significant range are the trifecta of results that all wireless standard companies are chasing with a vengeance .
The WirelessHD consortium released the final version of its own standard back in early January , while the startup company Pulse ~LINK debuted its own next - generation wireless chipset back in December .
The new WirelessHD specification defines a device that operates in the 60GHz spectrum and is capable of transferring up to 4 Gbps over 10 meters , while Pulse ~LINK claims its new chipset its chipset can deliver up to 890 M bps at close range ( 8 feet / 2.4M ) and 120 Mbps at 40 feet / 12 M ) .
If a team from Australia 's NICTA ( National ICT Australia ) is accurately representing their own advancements , however , both these standards are about to be exceeded .
The group from NICTA , lead by Gigabit Wireless Project team leader Prof.
Stan Skafidas , is claiming to have developed a CMOS - based chip capable of transferring up to 5 Gbps at up to 10 M — a 25 percent improvement over the WirelessHD specification .
That 's a substantial achievement in and of itself , but NICTA 's new " GiFi " transmitter is supposedly loaded with a host of other goodies .
GiFi is small , at just 5 mm per-side ( 25 mm sq. ) , it 's built using CMOS , uses a 1 mm antenna , costs less than $ 10 , uses a built - in power amplifier that 's only a few microns wide , and draws around 2W of power .
That much power consumption means we 'll not be seeing GiFi in any mobile devices anytime soon — not unless NICTA can cut the chip 's power draw by an order of magnitude — but the rest of the claims made for the nascent standard paint it as the ultimate solution for high - speed , close - range wireless networking .
Professor Stafidas , at least , seems to think this is likely .
He claims to have spent over a decade designing GiFi , and states that he believes the chip will one day be found " in every consumer device . "
According to Stafidas , NICTA will spin out a startup corporation later this year to market and commercialize the design .
He estimates that his team needs about a year ( and $ 10 million ) to finish R&D and begin production of GiFi transmitters .
NICTA is working with the IEEE to ensure GiFi meets standard specifications as defined by IEEE 802.15.3c , and plans to have prototype GiFi 's built by the end of the year .
If GiFi seems a little too good to you , you are n't alone .
NICTA is essentially claiming to have leapfrogged the competition , and is representing its product as the only real solution for this type of transmission moving forward .
That 's enough to raise anyone 's skepticism level , and the optimistic cost projections and time - to - market estimates do n't help much .
It 's possible that NICTA has actually made fundamental advancements that will speed deployment of short - range , ultra - high - speed networks — but it seems more likely that the organization has drunk a bit too much of its own Kool - Aid .

As I noted yesterday , the latest National Intelligence Estimate reports that Iran stopped actively pursuing nuclear weapons back in 2003 .
So , how are the neoconservatives who ’ve been pushing for confrontation with Iran for years now reacting to this news ?
Well , Norman Podhoretz himself is out with a piece that sounds more like it came from DailyKos than Commentary :
I must confess to suspecting that the intelligence community , having been excoriated for supporting the then universal belief that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction , is now bending over backward to counter what has up to now been a similarly universal view ( including as is evident from the 2005 NIE , within the intelligence community itself ) that Iran is hell - bent on developing nuclear weapons .
I also suspect that , having been excoriated as well for minimizing the time it would take Saddam to add nuclear weapons to his arsenal , the intelligence community is now bending over backward to maximize the time it will take Iran to reach the same goal .
But I entertain an even darker suspicion .
It is that the intelligence community , which has for some years now been leaking material calculated to undermine George W. Bush , is doing it again .
This time the purpose is to head off the possibility that the President may order air strikes on the Iranian nuclear installations .
As the intelligence community must know , if he were to do so , it would be as a last resort , only after it had become undeniable that neither negotiations nor sanctions could prevent Iran from getting the bomb , and only after being convinced that it was very close to succeeding .
How better , then , to stop Bush in his tracks than by telling him and the world that such pressures have already been effective and that keeping them up could well bring about “ a halt to Iran ’s entire nuclear weapons program ” — especially if the negotiations and sanctions were combined with a goodly dose of appeasement or , in the NIE ’s own euphemistic formulation , “ with opportunities for Iran to achieve its security , prestige , and goals for regional influence in other ways . ”
In other words , the CIA , NSA , and DIA are all involved in a vast conspiracy to undermine the Bush Administration ’s foreign policy and , horror of horrors prevent us from engaging in yet another war in the Persian Gulf .
What ’s clear , of course , is that there ’s no amount of evidence outside of the smoking remains of Tehran itself that could convince Podhoretz that the Iranian nuclear program had in face been ended .
In fact , the lack of evidence is , under this logic , evidence itself .
This is the same type of logic , or lack thereof , that got us involved in the Iraq War .
While everyone suspected that Saddam Hussein was still pursuing chemical and biological weapons , there was no conclusive evidence either way that this was the case — and that lack of evidence was presented as proof that the weapons in fact existed and that war was therefore justified .
The difference today , which Podhoretz does n’t seem to realize , is that this is n’t 2003 and the American public is n’t nearly as gullible as it was back then .
A report reveals that French President Nicolas Sarkozy worked for Israeli intelligence for a long time before he was elected president .
French daily Le Figaro has revealed the French leader once worked for the Zionist regime as a sayan , Hebrew for ' collaborator ' .
Ex -Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky says sayans , who perform many roles , are Jewish citizens of other nationalities assisting Mossad .
Le Figaro claimed that French police officials managed to keep secret a letter , which exposed Sarkozy 's past participation in espionage activities for Mossad .
The letter fixed Sarkozy 's alleged spying activities as far back as 1983 .
In the immediate aftermath of Le Figaro 's exposé , the Zionist regime 's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was on a state visit to France to discuss Iran 's nuclear program , which raised more questions about the report .
Analysts believe since Sarkozy took office in May , he has taken every opportunity to pledge his allegiance to the United States and the Zionist regime . " " Sarko the Sayan " " has also followed in the footsteps of the White House by choosing a hostile approach toward Iran and its peaceful nuclear activities ( Source : Press TV )
Although Israel argues that it wants to see strong diplomatic pressure put on Iran , it is reluctant to rule out the threat of a unilateral military attack .
Matan Vilnai , Israel 's deputy defence minister , told Army Radio today : " No option needs to be off the table . "
Avigdor Lieberman , the hard - right deputy prime minister , said Israel should be ready to act if sanctions did not work .
" If they do n't , we will sit and decide whatever we have to decide , " he told the Jerusalem Post in an interview today .
Several of Israel 's Iran experts say the American rethink on the threat posed by Iran had ruled out a US military strike and probably an Israeli strike too , at least for now .
However , Israel 's political hawks continue to keep the threat of action alive .
Binyamin Netanyahu , the popular rightwing opposition leader , was asked whether Israel should launch its own military operation .
" We always prefer international action , led by the United States , but we have to ensure that we can protect our country with all means , " he told the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz today .
The repercussions of the new US intelligence assessment are consuming Israeli politicians , analysts and the press .
Although Israeli leaders had been briefed in advance , the national intelligence estimate ( NIE ) which was declassified and published on Monday , brought surprise and frustration in Israel 's defence establishment .
In a marked shift from earlier assessments , the NIE said Iran had halted its nuclear weapons programme in autumn 2003 and had not restarted it .
America 's intelligence agencies said they now did not know whether Iran intended to build nuclear weapons .
Israeli officials quickly offered a direct challenge .
Ehud Barak , the defence minister , said although Iran 's nuclear programme was halted in 2003 " as far as we know it has probably since revived it " .
It is , however , far from clear whether Israel has its own unique intelligence on Iran strong enough to contradict the American findings .
Ha'aretz noted in an analysis today : " It was n't in the intelligence arena that Israel suffered a blow this week , but rather in the public opinion arena . "
Some have suggested that with Israel feeling isolated by its hardline stance on Iran , it might be more inclined to launch a unilateral military strike and a comparison is frequently drawn to Israel 's 1981 bombing of Iraq 's Osirak nuclear reactor .
David Albright , a former UN nuclear inspector , said this week if Israel felt its " red line " had been crossed it might strike .
" They may force a military confrontation , " he told the Associated Press agency .
However , it is widely assumed Israel would need at least American approval if not cooperation for any bombing mission .
In particular , Israel 's air force would need the US flight codes that would allow its planes to cross safely into Iran .
When Israel requested those codes in 1991 , to attack Saddam Hussein 's Iraq during the first Gulf War , the United States refused and there was no Israeli strike .
Yet Israel , the only nuclear power in the region , is not shy of acting alone and has been heartened by the lack of international censure over its bombing raid in northern Syria in September , which may or may not have targeted a Syrian nuclear installation .
Israel 's Iran experts argue that the US intelligence assessment did not wholly exonerate Tehran - they point to evidence of a continued enriched uranium programme which has only limited civilian use - but they admit that for now an Israeli military operation is unlikely .
" I think it is quite unrealistic to think Israel will go it alone against Iran in a military way , " said Ephraim Asculai , a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv .
He said it appeared Iran would respond to a tougher sanctions regime that demonstrated to Tehran that the cost of its nuclear ambitions outweighed their benefits .
Meir Javedanfar , an Iranian - born analyst based in Tel Aviv , said there was also a chance Israel might pursue a peace agreement with Syria , in an effort to divide Damascus from Tehran and further isolate the Iranian regime .
" The quickest route to isolate Iran is through Damascus , " he said .

Islam and Evolution
a letter to Suleman Ali
© Nuh Ha Mim Keller 1996
In the name of Allah , Most Merciful and Compassionate
14 July 1995
Dear Suleman ' Ali :
Thank you for your fax of 27 June 1995 which said , in part :
" Recently a pamphlet has been circulated around Oxford saying that evolution is synonymous with kufr and shirk .
I myself am a biologist and am convinced by the evidence which supports the theory of evolution .
I am writing to ask whether the Quranic account of Creation is incompatible with man having evolved .
Are there any books which you would recommend on the subject ? "
Coherence
Logicality
If evolution is not scientific , then what is it ?
It seems to me that it is a human interpretation , an endeavor , an industry , a literature , based on what the American philosopher Charles Peirce called abductive reasoning , which functions in the following way :
(1) Suprising fact A .
(2) If theory B were the case , then A would naturally follow .
(3) Therefore B .
Applicability
In the 1970s , Peter Williamson of Harvard University , under the direction of Richard Leakey , examined 3,300 fossils from digs around Lake Turkana , Kenya , spanning several million years of the history of thirteen species of mollusks , that seemed to provide clear evidence of evolution from one species to another .
He published his findings five years later in Nature magazine , and Newsweek picked up the story :
" Though their existence provides the basis for paleontology , fossils have always been something of an embarrassment to evolutionists .
The problem is one of ' missing links ' : the fossil record is so littered with gaps that it takes a truly expert and imaginative eye to discern how one species could have evolved into another ....
But now , for the first time , excavations at Kenya 's Lake Turkana have provided clear fossil evidence of evolution from one species to another .
The rock strata there contain a series of fossils that show every small step of an evolutionary journey that seems to have proceeded in fits and starts " ( Sharon Begley and John Carey , " Evolution : Change at a Snail 's Pace . "
Newsweek , 7 December 1981 ) .
What the record indicated was that the animals stayed much the same for immensely long stretches of time .
But twice , about 2 million years ago and and then again 700,000 years ago , the pool of life seemed to explode -- set off , apparently , by a drop in the lake 's water level .
In an instant of geologic time , as the changing lake environment allowed new types of mollusks to win the race for survival , all of the species evolved into varieties sharply different from their ancestors .
Such sudden evolution had been observed before .
What made the Lake Turkana fossil record unique , says Williamson , is that " for the first time we see intermediate forms " between the old species and the new .
That intermediate forms appeared so quickly , with new species suddenly evolving in 5,000 to 50,000 years after millions of years of constancy , challenges the traditional theories of Darwin 's disciples .
Most scientists describe evolution as a gradual process , in which random genetic mutations slowly produce new species .
But the fossils of Lake Turkana do n't record any gradual change ; rather , they seem to reflect eons of stasis interrupted by brief evolutionary " revolutions " ( ibid . ) .
Of what significance is this to Muslims ?
In point of religion , if we put our scientific scruples aside for a moment and grant that evolution is applicable to something in the real world ; namely , the mollusks of Lake Turkana , does this constitute unbelief ( kufr ) by the standards of Islam ?
I do n't think so .
Classic works of Islamic ' aqida or " tenets of faith " such as al - Matan al - Sanusiyya tell us , " As for what is possible in relation to Allah , it consists of His doing or not doing anything that is possible " ( al - Sanusi , Hashiya al - Dasuqi ' ala Umm al - barahin .
Cairo n.d. Reprint .
Beirut : Dar al - Fikr , n.d , 145-46 ) .
That is , the omnipotent power of Allah can do anything that is not impossible , meaning either :
( a ) intrinsically impossible ( mustahil dhati ) , such as -- creating a five - sided triangle -- which is a mere confusion of words , and not something in any sense possible , such that we could ask whether Allah could do it ; ( b ) or else impossible because of Allah having informed us that it shall not occur ( mustahil ' aradi ) , whether He does so in the Qur'an , or through the Prophet ( Allah bless him and give him peace ) in a mutawatir hadith , meaning one that has reached us through so many means of transmission that it is impossible its transmitters could have all conspired to forge it .
This category of the impossible is not impossible to begin with , but becomes so by the revelation from Allah , who is truthful and veracious .
For example , it is impossible that Abu Lahab should be of the people of paradise , because the Qur'an tells us he is of the people of hell ( Qur'an 111 ) .
Man
" And [ mention ] when your Lord said to the angels , ' Truly , I will create a man from clay .
So when I have completed him , and breathed into him of My spirit , then fall down prostrate to him . '
And the angels prostrated , one and all .
Save for Satan , who was too proud to , and disbelieved .
He said to him , 'O Satan , what prevented you from prostrating to what I have created with My two hands ?
Are you arrogant , or too exalted ? '
He said , 'I am better than he ;
You created me from fire and created him from clay ' " ( Qur'an 38:71 -76 ) .
The same interpretive considerations ( of Allah 's transcendance above the attributes of created things ) apply to the words and breathed into him of My spirit .
Because the Qur'an unequivocally establishes that Allah is Ahad or " One , " not an entity divisible into parts , exegetes say this " spirit " was a created one , and that its attribution to Allah ( " My spirit " ) is what is called in Arabic idafat al - tashrif " an attribution of honor , " showing that the ruh or " spirit " within this first human being and his descendants was " a sacred , exalted , and noble substance " ( ibid. , 228 ) -- not that there was a " part of Allah " such as could enter into Adam 's body , which is unbelief .
Similar attributions are not infrequent in Arabic , just as the Kaaba is called bayt Allah , or " the House of Allah , " meaning " Allah 's honored house , " not that it is His address ; or such as the she - camel sent to the people of Thamud , which was called naqat Allah , or " the she - camel of Allah , " meaning " Allah 's honored she - camel , " signifying its inviolability in the shari'a of the time , not that He rode it ; and so on .
All of which shows that , according to the Qur'an , human beings are intrinsically -- by their celestial provenance in janna , by their specially created nature , and by the ruh or soul within them -- at a quite different level in Allah 's eyes than other terrestrial life , whether or not their bodies have certain physiological affinities with it , which are the prerogative of their Maker to create .
Darwin says :
" I believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors , and plants from an equal or lesser number .
Analogy would lead me one step further , namely , to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some one prototype .
But analogy may be a deceitful guide " ( The Origin of Species , 454-55 ) .
But what He has made us responsible for is precisely belief in the unseen .
Why ?
In order that the divine names -- such as al - Rafi ' or " He Who Raises , " al - Khafidh " He Who Abases , " al - Mu'ti " He Who Gives , " al - Mani ' " He Who Withholds , " al - Rahim " the Merciful , " al - Muntaqim " the Avenger , " al - Latif " the Subtlely Kind , " and so on -- may be manifest .
How are they manifest ?
Only through the levels of human felicity and perdition , of salvation and damnation , by the disparity of human spiritual attainment in all its degrees : from the profound certitude of the prophets ( upon whom be peace ) , to the faith of the ordinary believer , to the doubts of the waverer or hypocrite , to the denials of the damned .
Also , the veil for its part has a seamless quality .
To some , it is a seamless veil of light manifesting the Divine through the perfection of creation ; while to others , it is a seamless veil of darkness , a perfect nexus of interpenetrating causal relations in which there is no place for anything that is not material .
Allah says ,
" Exalted in Grace is He in whose hand is dominion , and He has power over everything .
Who created death and life to try you , as to which of you is better in works , and He is the All - powerful , the Oft - forgiving .
And who created the seven heavens in layers ; you see no disparity in the creation of the All - merciful .
Return your glance : do you see any fissures ? " ( Qur'an 67:1 - 3 ) .
Other Species
" O people : Fear your Lord , who created you from one soul [ Adam , upon whom be peace ] and created from it its mate [ his wife Hawa ] , and spread forth from them many men and women " ( Qur'an 4:1 ) ,
" When they were too arrogant to [ desist from ] what they had been forbidden , We said to them , ' Be you apes , humiliated ' " ( Qur'an 7:166 ) .
If , as in the theory of evolution , we conjoin with this possibility the factors of causality , gradualism , mutation , and adaptation , it does not seem to me to add anything radically different to these other forms of change .
For Islamic tenets of faith do not deny causal relations as such , but rather that causes have effects in and of themselves , for to believe this is to ascribe a co-sharer to Allah in His actions .
Whoever believes in this latter causality ( as virtually all evolutionists do ) is an unbeliever ( kafir ) without any doubt , as " whoever denies the existence of ordinary causes has made the Wisdom of Allah Most High inoperative , while whoever attributes effects to them has associated co-sharers ( shirk ) to Allah Most High " ( al - Hashimi : Miftah al - janna fi sharh ' aqida Ahl al - Sunna .
Damascus : Matba 'a al - taraqi , 1379 / 1960 , 33 ) .
As for Muslims , they believe that Allah alone creates causes , Allah alone creates effects , and Allah alone conjoins the two .
In the words of the Qur'an , " Allah is the Creator of everything " ( Qur'an 13:16 ) .
A Muslim should pay careful attention to this point , and distance himself from believing either that causes ( a ) bring about effects in and of themselves ; or ( b ) bring about effects in and of themselves through a capacity Allah has placed in them .
Both of these negate the oneness and soleness ( wahdaniyya ) of Allah , which entails that Allah has no co-sharer in :
(1) His entity ( dhat ) ;
(2) His attributes ( sifat ) ;
( 3 ) or in His acts ( af'al ) , which include the creation of the universe and everything in it , including all its cause and effect relationships .
In this connection , evolution as a knowledge claim about a causal relation does not seem to me intrinsically different from other similar knowledge claims , such as the statement " The president died from an assassin 's bullet . "
Here , though in reality Allah alone gives life or makes to die , we find a dispensation in Sacred Law to speak in this way , provided that we know and believe that Allah alone brought about this effect .
As for someone who literally believes that the bullet gave the president death , such a person is a kafir .
In reality he knows no more about the world than a man taking a bath who , when the water is cut off from the municipality , gets angry at the tap .
To summarize the answer to your question thus far , belief in macro-evolutionary transformation and variation of non-human species does not seem to me to entail kufr ( unbelief ) or shirk ( ascribing co-sharers to Allah ) unless one also believes that such transformation came about by random mutation and natural selection , understanding these adjectives as meaning causal independence from the will of Allah .
You have to look in your heart and ask yourself what you believe .
From the point of view of tawhid , Islamic theism , nothing happens " at random , " there is no " autonomous nature , " and anyone who believes in either of these is necessarily beyond the pale of Islam .
Unfortunately , this seems to be exactly what most evolutionists think .
In America and England , they are the ones who write the textbooks , which raises weighty moral questions about sending Muslim students to schools to be taught these atheistic premises as if they were " givens of modern science . "
Teaching unbelief ( kufr ) to Muslims as though it were a fact is unquestionably unlawful .
Is this unlawfulness mitigated ( made legally permissible by shari 'a standards ) by the need ( darura ) of upcoming generations of Muslims for scientific education ?
If so , the absence of textbooks and teachers in most schools who are conversant and concerned enough with the difficulties of the theory of evolution to accurately present its hypothetical character , places a moral obligation upon all Muslim parents .
They are obliged to monitor their children 's Islamic beliefs and to explain to them ( by means of themselves , or someone else who can ) the divine revelation of Islam , together with the difficulties of the theory of evolution that will enable the children to make sense of it from an Islamic perspective and understand which aspects of the theory are rejected by Islamic theism ( tawhid ) and which are acceptable .
The question of the theory 's adequacy , meaning its generalizability to all species , will necessarily be one of the important aspects of this explanation .
Adequacy
It is only if we accept the premise that there is no God that this answer acquires any cogency .
The Qur'an answers this premise in detail and with authority .
But evolutionary theory is not only ungeneralizable because of Allah informing us of His own existence and man 's special creation , but because of what we discern in ourselves of the uniqueness of man , as the Qur'an says ,
" We shall show them Our signs on the horizons and in themselves , until it is plain to them that it is the Truth " ( Qur'an 41:53 ) .
The locus of this attachment and this knowledge is not the mind , but rather the subtle faculty within one that is sometimes called the heart , sometimes the ruh or spirit .
Allah 's special creation of this faculty has been mentioned above in connection with the Qur'anic words and breathed into him of My spirit .
According to masters of the spiritual path , this subtle body is knowledgeable , aware , and cognizant , and when fully awakened , capable of transcending the opacity of the created universe to know Allah .
The Qur'an says about it , by way of exalting its true nature through its very unfathomability :
" Say : The spirit is of the matter of my Lord " ( Qur'an 17:85 ) .
" Beholding the Divine ( mushahada ) is of two sorts , that of the eye and that of the heart .
In this world , the beholding of the heart is had by many of the ' arifin ( knowers of Allah ) , and consists of looking at contingent things , created beings , that they do not exist through themselves , but rather exist through Allah , and when the greatness of Allah occurs to one , contingent things dwindle to nothing in one 's view , and are erased from one 's thought , and the Real ( al - Haqq ) dawns upon one 's heart , and it is as if one beholds .
This is termed ' the beholding of the heart . '
The beholding of the eye [ in this world ] is for the Chosen , the Prophet alone , Muhammad ( Allah bless him and give him peace ) .
As for the next world , it shall be for all believers .
Allah Most High says , ' On that day faces shall be radiant , gazing upon their Lord ' ( Qur'an 75:22 ) . "
[ I wrote of the above : ]
If it be observed that the term heart as used above does not seem to conform to its customary usage among speakers of the language , I must grant this .
In the context , the term denotes not the mind , but rather the faculty that perceives what is beyond created things , in the world of the spirit , which is a realm unto itself .
If one demands that the existence of this faculty be demonstrated , the answer -- however legitimate the request -- cannot exceed , " Go to masters of the discipline , train , and you will be shown . "
Unsatisfying though this reply may be , it does not seem to me to differ in principle from answers that would be given , for example , to a non-specialist regarding the proof for a particular proposition in theoretical physics or symbolic logic .
Nor are such answers an objection to the in-principle " publicly observable " character of observation statements in these disciplines , but rather a limitation pertaining to the nature of the case and the questioner , one that he may accept , reject , or do something about ( Keller , Interpreter 's Log. Manuscript Draft , 1993 , 1 - 2 ) .
This is not to denigrate the power of imagination ; indeed , if not for imagination , we could not believe in the truths of the afterlife , paradise , hell , and everything that our eternal salvation depends upon .
Rather , I mention this in the context of the question of evolution as a cautionary note against a sort of " fallacy of misplaced concrescence , " an unwarranted epistemological overconfidence , that exists in many people who work in what they term " the hard sciences . "
As someone from the West , I was raised from early school years as a believer not only in science , the practical project of discovery that aims at exploiting more and more of the universe by identification , classification , and description of micro- and macro-causal relations ; but also in scientism , the belief that this enterprise constitutes absolute knowledge .
As one philosopher whom I read at the University of Chicago put it ,
Scientism is science 's belief in itself : that is , the conviction that we can no longer understand science as one form of possible knowledge , but rather must identify knowledge with science " ( Habermas , Knowledge and Human Interests .
Tr. Jeremy J. Shapiro .
Boston : Beacon Press , 1971 , 4 ) .
It seems to me that this view , in respect to evolution but also in respect to the nature of science as a contemporary religion , represents a sort of defeat of knowledge by an absolutism of pure methodology .
As I mentioned at the outset , the categories of understanding that underly every observation statement in the theory of evolution arise from human consciousness , and as such cannot be distinguished by the theory from other transient survival devices : its explanative method , from first to last , is necessarily only another survival mechanism that has evolved in the animal kingdom .
By its own measure , it is not necessary that it be true , but only necessary that it be powerful in the struggle for survival .
Presumably , any other theory -- even if illusory -- that had better implications for survival could displace evolution as a mode of explanation .
Or perhaps the theory itself is an illusion .
These considerations went through my mind at the University of Chicago during my " logic of scientific explanation " days .
They made me realize that my faith in scientism and evolutionism had something magical as its basis , the magic of an influential interpretation supported by a vast human enterprise .
I do not propose that science should seriously try to comprehend itself , which it is not equipped to do anyway , but I have come to think that , for the sake of its consumers , it might have the epistemological modesty to " get back , " from its current scientistic pretentions to its true nature , as one area of human interpretation among others .
From being the " grand balance scale " on which one may weigh and judge the " reality " of all matters , large and small - - subsuming " the concept of God , " for example , under the study of religions , religions under anthropology , anthropology under human behavioral institutions , human behavioral institutions under evolutionary biology , evolutionary biology under organic chemistry , organic chemistry ( ultimately ) under cosmology , cosmology under chaos theory , and so on -- I have hopes that science will someday get back to its true role , the production of technically exploitable knowledge for human life .
That is , from pretentions to 'ilm or " knowledge , " to its true role as " fann " or " technique . "
In view of the above considerations of its coherence , logicality , applicability , and adequacy , the theory of the evolution of man from lower forms does not seem to show enough scientific rigor to raise it from being merely an influential interpretation .
To show the evolution 's adequacy , for everything it is trying to explain would be to give valid grounds to generalize it to man .
In this respect , it is a little like Sigmund Freud 's Interpretation of Dreams , in which he describes examples of dreams that are wish fulfillments , and then concludes that " all dreams are wish fulfillments . "
We still wait to be convinced .
Summary of Islamic Conclusions
As for claim that man has evolved from a non -human species , this is unbelief ( kufr ) no matter if we ascribe the process to Allah or to " nature , " because it negates the truth of Adam 's special creation that Allah has revealed in the Qur'an .
Man is of special origin , attested to not only by revelation , but also by the divine secret within him , the capacity for ma'rifa or knowledge of the Divine that he alone of all things possesses .
By his God - given nature , man stands before a door opening onto infinitude that no other creature in the universe can aspire to .
Man is something else .

You Wo n't See It First on Digg
After all of the discussion regarding the new Digg algorithm , I finally had an opportunity to get a closer look at the impact on promotion .
While there has been much speculation about the algo requiring many more Diggs than before , and that having been explained by a strengthened “ Diversity of Diggers ” measurement , I thought it would be useful to see exactly how much this algo slowed down the promotion of stories compared to other popular Web 2.0 sites .
The results , in my opinion , were staggering .
Today the Associated Press became aware that John Edwards was making his exit from the Presidential Campaign .
Within minutes , submissions were made to Digg , Reddit and Netscape regarding this event .
Which of the three sites took the longest to promote the story ?
Speed to Front Page
Site Submitted Promoted Elapsed Propeller 9:24 9:49 * 25 min Reddit 9:26 9:58 32 min Digg 9:06 10:16 70min
* Netscape has a special “ Anchors Recommend ” feature which allows them to promote important news stories more quickly .
Since this is a feature that either Digg or Reddit could implement , if they wanted , I think it is fair game .
Taking 2 x as long to promote a legitimate story as Reddit and 3x of Propeller indicates that there are serious lag issues with Digg ’s algorithm .
While the blackbox of Digg ’s , Reddit ’s and Propeller ’s algorithms make it impossible to know exactly what keeps a story from being promoted in a timely manner , I believe that there is strong evidence to suggest that if you want News when it happens , you ca n’t go to Digg anymore .

It ’s been decades since the Democrats have controlled the New York State Senate .
Decades .
But , tonight , they moved within one vote of control .
With a Democratic Governor , a Democratic Assembly , the State is on the verge of becoming the blue bastion it should be :
Democrat Darrel Aubertine has upset Republican Will Barclay in the special election for New York State ’s 48th Senate District – slicing the Republican majority in the State Senate to just one .
With 99 percent of the precincts reporting , the Associated Press projected the victory .
Aubertine has 27,532 votes , or 52 percent , to 25,001 votes for Barclay , 48 percent .
A New York politico tells me this win is HUGE : “ it is a bellwether race – in a district that has nearly twice as many republicans as dems . ”
State legislatures matter .
A lot .
Control of state legislatures matters .
A lot .
What Dave Roberts said .
You do hear with a frightening frequency people with green sympathies , up to and including Al Gore , suggest that global warming should n't be a " political issue . "
Drained of senseless rhetoric this seems to reduce to the view that " everyone ought to agree with my favored policies . "
And , of course , I think everyone really should agree with my favored policies .
But , in practice , they do n't .
And so : Politics .
This is the world , and anyone who aspires to radically alter America 's energy use patterns needs to learn to live with it .
Achieving the goals requires lots of political change .
Meanwhile , both whatever degree of climate change can't be prevented and whatever prevention measures we adopt will all have different kinds of costs and benefits .
Different policies will allocate these costs to different people .
The mechanism by which we decide what to do is called " politics " and it exists so that individuals and organizations with somewhat divergent interests and ideas can make collective decisions about how to tackle common problems .
The rhetoric of anti-politics is n't just an analytic mistake , it 's part of the problem .
A public that does n't believe divergent interests can be reconciled and common solutions devised for common problems -- a public that does n't believe in politics -- is going to be a public that does n't believe there 's anything that can or should be done to prevent catastrophic climate change .

here is part of the long complicated explanation about the problem ...
" Therefore , it is impossible to determine with absolute certainty that a vote for a Presidential candidate without a mark for a party selection indicates clear voter intent to vote for a Democratic Party or American Independent Party Presidential candidate . "
It does not make sense to me .
For example ,
If a person voted for Obama does n't the registrar know that he is a democrat ?
The specific party affiliation apparently required is totally irrelevant to the vote cast .
Are LA voters voting for candidates or parties ?
or both ?
The party selection is stupid .
If a vote for Obama ( for example ) is selected , then for heavens sake , what is so hard about counting that vote ?
Who cares whether the voter considers himself to be a dem or indie ?
Hey , I know , lets make it as difficult as possible for peoples ' vote to count !
seems to be the operating factor here .
Stupid people really should be put out of the way .
Outrageous !
Have ya'll noticed that the closer we get to paper ballots , the more of this kind of confusion goes on ?

As I understand it , please correct me if I 'm wrong , the candidate 's names were not on the ballot .
The ballot was apparently designed so that the first three positions were assigned to candidates running in both the American Independent Party or Democratic party .
So the only , alleged way , to ID the ballot was that bubble indicating party at the top .
Please correct this if I 've got it wrong .
If ever a design was set up to disenfranchise voters , this is on a par with the infamous butterfly ballot .
However , some people may have written in a candidate too , perhaps ?
Were n't the voters assigned to booths depending on the party primary they were voting in ?
Would n't those ballots be in a separate bin from the AIP ballots ?
Seems there ought to be some way of figuring out the ballots if the bins were separate - and if they were not or if they were co-mingled later , that 's just another straw on the camel 's back of bad management .
Yes , I agree that with the mandate to go to paper there seem to be more problems " created " with paper ballots .
Texas and Ohio should not run into lack of paper ballots at the polls .
The huge turnouts in the primaries are not exactly hidden from view .

Brad ,
take a look at the transcript of the Bof Sups yesterday , Tuesday .
You have to see it to believe it .
Yesterday the Supervisors signed a contract with a software company called SOE Software , from FLorida , which is partnering with Diebold to create election management software .
They will now be managing our elections for the next 6 years .
Of course , Dean presented it as a way to avoid future mishaps .
The Sups did not care that this company is partnering with Diebold , it 's owner was indicted for securities fraud , and it has already screwed up elections in Florida .
Also see what the Sups have to say about the bubbles .
( It would n't really make a difference , but we cannot have outraged voters , so Dean , make this problem go away . )
One jam - packed 15 minutes .
( listed as items 14 , 15 , and a special unnumbered item introduced by Zev , the no bubbles in June item . )

I decline to state party affiliation , and elected not to vote in either of the half - open primaries , but the voting form I had showed spaces for both the Democratic primary and the American Independent primary .

Why does it matter what bubble they filled or whether they filled any bubble designating the party ?
How in hell does that effect the outcome ?
I can see how it might effect what ballot they received , but if the questions are on the ballot they must have received the correct ballot so why does it matter if they are independent democratic voters or American independent party voters if the ballot is the same ?
Does the American Independent Party have specific delegates assigned to them ?

RE : The above note from OMSMedia .
OMSMedia is Don Haas , brother of failed former San Diego County Registrar of Voters , Mikel Haas who never met a Diebold DRE he did n't love and a ( non-Republican ) voter he did n't hate .
That said ...
No , Don , DRE 's would not " fix " this problem .
The good news is , because we had paper ballots , we KNOW that some 100,000 votes were miscounted .
Had we used DRE's ( touch - screens ) millions of ballots could have been miscounted , and it would have been impossible to prove that any of them had been either counted correctly or counted incorrectly .
IF Dean Logan , who seems to come from the same failed school of how to run elections that both your brother and Conny McCormack came from , refuse to count the ballots which are easily counted , then yes , you can add them to the " disenfranchised by Election Administrators " list .
The paper ballots have n't disenfranchised them .
Administrators like Logan and your brother ( he did the same to thousands of voters in San Diego ) have disenfranchised them .
Way to keep up your anti-democracy agenda , Don. Somewhere , Josef Stalin is smiling down on you and your family .

Onyx # 11 - Read my coverage of the problem from last week .
On the Non-Partisan ballot , the choices for Dem Presidential candidate use the same bubbles as the choice for American Ind. Party Presidential Candidate .
The ballots do n't list names .
They only have bubbles .
The ballots must be slipped into a template booklet to know which bubble is meant for which candidate , etc .
If one only looks at the ballot and sees a vote for some Presidential candidate or another , then unless they have marked the other bubble ( Dem. vs. AI Party ) you can't know for certain if the vote was intended for Dem candidate or for an AI candidate .
However , the poll rosters have a notation in them if a Non-Partisan voter wanted to vote DEM or AI .
In most precincts , there will be NO non-partisan voters who asked to vote for AI .
Therefore , every NP ballot in that precinct with a Prez vote can reasonably be assumed to be a vote for one of the DEM candidates .
Hope that clarifies .
For the moment , nearly 100,000 votes are potentially miscounted .
ANY counting of those ballots , by hand , will decrease the error rate with every single tabulation !

Some very simple , cheap things that could have helped avert this travesty : Different colored ballots Just - simply - PRINTING THE NAME OF THE PARTY ON THE BALLOT , if it was too much effort to print the candidates names .
The problem with paper voting for administrators like these , is that it does not cover up incompetence .
Brad is correct , with DRE's , we would never know what happened .
The only clue you get is more voters than people registered or out of whack results with the polls .
In New Hampshire , the recounts have proven that the law was not followed .
Just that alone is a huge issue and ought to be grounds for dismissal of the top two election officials in the state .
Paper gives a way to audit the election , audit the process , and audit compliance with the law .
A good administrator welcomes that scrutiny .

Let 's see .
A voter forgot to bubble in Democrat , so the machine can't read the ballot where the voter bubbled in a vote for a Democratic candidate .
The officer in charge of the election knows of no way to have the scanner ignore the bubble for the party and count the bubble for the vote cast for the candidate , and he sees no way to tell voter intent from looking at ballots with a vote bubbled in for a Democratic Presidential candidate .
That ’s even more ludicrous than the explanation that I received from the staff at the Virginia Board of Elections about how using computers to count votes does n’t violate the Virginia Constitutional prohibition against counting votes in secret .
Virginia ’s Elections Are UNCONSTITUTIONAL ?!?!
Yes , Virginia , your elections are unconstitutional , and frankly , no one in power gives a damn !
Technically , they say that they did not know that computers count in secret , that Virginia 's Constitutional prohibition against counting votes in secret is n't really clear and does n't Federal law control everything any way , and that no one even really thought about this secret vote counting issue that they know of .

OMSMedia , electronic voting machines would NOT fix the problem created by a ROV who approves a stupidly designed ballot .
Getting a new ROV who can look at a ballot critically WILL solve this problem for the future .
Also , having ROVs who are not inappropriately chummy with the U.S. electronic voting machine cartel would be a big help as well .
Electronic voting machines have nothing to do with this problem in LA , AND they carry with them a WHOLE NEW SET of problems .
Being financially connected to the profits of the electronic voting machine industry disqualifies you from being able to be objective about this .

We 've had recounts halted in Florida and never started in Ohio .
We 've had touch screen machines in Florida magically producing 14 % residual vote rates .
We have Republicans nationwide purging the rolls of legally registered voters , while intimidating others , and we have numerous attempts to make voting more difficult when there is almost zero evidence of voter initiated polling place fraud .
And yet ... in WA state we conducted the ultimate audit in 2004 by hand counting every single ballot in the state .
But it 's Dean Logan and KC Elections you focus on .
Get over it , and focus on the real threats to election integrity instead of the imagined ones .

Hi , everyone , I have a friend who worked as a precinct captain in LA County and explained to me why the voter intent cannot be determined for non-partisan voters .
Idiotically stupid ballot design , as follows :
The computer cards with little bubbles just have numbers next to each bubble .
There are always plenty of extra numbers in unused columns on the cards , but some idiot decided to assign THE SAME NUMBERS to presidential candidates from various parties .
So on my Democratic Ballot , it looks like this : VOTERS REGISTERED WITH DEMOCRATIC PARTY SKIP TO PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENCE'S CONTEST BELOW TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES , NONPARTISAN VOTERS MUST FIRST SELECT PARTY IN THE BOX BELOW ( This box for Non-Partisan Voters Only - Vote for One ) American Indepent ( no number ! )
Democratic 6 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
( Presidential Preference - Vote for One ) Bill Richardson 8
Dennis Kucinich 9
Mike Gravel 10
John Edwards 11
Chris Dodd 12
Hillary Clinton 13
Joe Biden 14
Barack Obama 15
Now , I do n't have an American Independent Ballot to type in for you , so I will have to make up some names , but here are the numbers those ballots have on them , according to my friend the precinct leader : ( This box for Non-Partisan Voters only - Vote for One )
American Indepent ( no number ! )
Democratic 6 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
( Presidential Preference - Vote for One ) Jane Doe 8
Luke Monroe 9
John Bledsoe 10
Green McClean 11
Warner Winsome 12
Andy Anderson 13
Taylor Made 14
Ty Coltrane 15 Additionally , to make sure that no candidate 's name appears at the top or bottom of every ballot , each precinct has a different code , and the code on the ballot card has to match the code on the printed booklet that goes with it to indicate what the numbers mean .
This allows the order of the names to be randomly rearranged for each precinct .
So it 's not like Barack Obama is # 15 across all of Los Angeles .
Other precincts could have Clinton or Richards as # 15 , and the problem is that if that damn bubble # 6 is n't marked , you do n't know whether # 15 was for Obama ( DEM ) or my made - up American Independent candidate , Ty Coltrane .
And to top it off , there are no marks on the cards that can be used to related them to the voter rolls where NP was crossed out and either AI or DEM written in , because the ballots are all the same , anonymous .
Actually , this brings up another question , because I had the impression that ballots from registered democrats were able to be counted , and non-partisan voters who filled in Bubble # 6 were able to be counted .
But unless DEM ballots are going into one bin and NP or AI ballots are going into another bin , how do they know the difference between registered democratic votes ( that were n't supposed to fill in bubble # 6 ) and registered independent votes that failed to fill in bubble # 6 ???
I took computer programming classes in college , and though I never worked as a programmer , I can see the idiocy of duplicating the definitions of numbers 8 through 15 when it would have been just as easy to have voters turn a page ( to move to the next column of bubbles ) , and the next party 's candidates could have been coded to bubbles # 28 through # 35 , or whatever the numbers are in the next column over .
THAT would have made it possible to determine voter intent , regardless of what party they were registered with :
One number assigned to each candidate , with no duplicates .
Idiots !!!
Sorry this is so long , but I wanted to give you the necessary details , the better to rant with .
Regards ,
Andrea

Andrea , your thorough description of the ballot problem in LA underscores that this problem would NOT be solved by doing away with paper ballots and replacing them with electronic voting machines .
It can't be proven , I realize , but it really seems that these ballots were intentionally confusing and misleading to one voting demographic , non-partisan voters , who were predicted to vote mostly for Sen.
Obama .
That this is likely the case further underscores the case AGAINST replacing paper ballots with electronic voting machines , because with electronic voting machines , as they exist today , citizens would be unable at all to notice voting anomalies such as this one in LA , that disenfranchised non-partisan voters .

Good morning Linda , # 23
I agree the ballot , and the process , is confusing and misleading for non-partisan voters , but I do not think it was intentionally so , because this destroys any chance for Acting Registrar / Recorder Dean Logan to be selected by the LA County Board of Supervisors to the permanent position and both Conny McCormack and Logan wanted Logan to get the job .
Logan was selected by McCormack to be her successor , but he already had at least one strike against him : no college degree .
His job performance had to convince the Board to overlook this issue .
Then " DoubleBubble " happened .
LA 's Board of Supervisors is predominately Democrats and this hurts mainly Democrats .
The death of Logan 's chances to be chosen for the permanent position was signalled when LA Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said at a board meeting that Logan 's handling of this , " really angers me . "
This fiasco absolutely guarantees Logan will not be selected for the permanent position .
And do n't worry , no California county is planning to abandon paper in the forseeable future .
First , they already spent a ton of taxpayer money for the systems paper systems they are now using and are unlikely to get support for the idea of abandoning their current certified system and buying a new , not yet certified non-paper system .
And second , election equipment vendors have a serious disincentive to attempt to sell new non-paper systems in California because of the unsettled environment concerning certification requirements and changing laws .
As Brad points out in his posting about Diebold 's declining earnings , these issues include : - unanticipated litigation , claims or assessments ;
- challenges raised about reliability and security of the company 's election systems products , including the risk that such products will not be certified for use or will be decertified ;
- changes in laws regarding the company 's election systems products and services
So for California , it 's paper as far as the eye can see .
Which is just fine with vendors because they sell paper - based systems , too .

The more I think about this Dean Logan proclamation that it 's impossible to count every voter 's vote in LA County 's primary , the madder I get .
Make him admit that he 's UNWILLING to count every voter 's vote !
Clearly , Dean Logan is not an Obama supporter , because he knows nothing about " Yes We Can ! " Dean Logan is a defeatist .
For all we know , he may believe in a hundred years of war , but he does n't believe that we can spend the necessary time , which would be less than a hundred years , and the necessary money , which would be less than what we 're spending in one minute to perpetuate the Iraq war , to successfully count LA County 's presidential primary ballots .
To steal a line from Obama 's fantastic post -Potomac win speech in Madison , " What better time and place to affirm our democratic ideals than right now , in LA County , by counting every single voter 's vote ! "

There are hundreds of different ways that corrupt election officials and those who influence them can steal elections .
They can disenfranchise legal voters ( look for 10 - 20 million new , predominantly poor , often young , predominantly black voters who got energized by the primary season find themselves somehow " missing from the rolls " in November in Obama is the candidate ) .
They can design stupid , ill - conceived , and non-user - friendly ballots .
They can fail to protect the votes from corruption .
They can choose to void or spoil votes in a manner that is disadvantageous to one side , or only tell one side when a vote has been spoiled .
They can steal votes .
They can lose votes .
( 16 K votes missing in a 250 vote race ? )
They can make it hard to vote ( 8 hours in the rain ?
That 's Democracy ) for those who do n't have all day .
And sadly , the Rethuglicans have done all these things ( and thousands of others ) before , and they will do them all again .
Rethuglicans do n't care about honest elections .
They do n't care about Democracy .
They only care about WINNING AT ALL COSTS !!!
Get used to it .
Most of the Democrats just do n't GET how ugly this is going to get , and they are n't prepared to fight .
We will probably be here bloggin on November 5 , 2008 about how it was a horrible election and millions of people were disenfranchised or forced to vote on non-counted provisional ballots and how the whole election was a fraud .
On the plus side , if tens of millions of black people who WERE able to vote for Obama in the primaries suddenly find they can't vote for him in the general , I would n't want to be the white Rethuglican ( or stupid Democrat ) poll worker who tells the 10th black person that they are n't on the rolls while the other 9 are still standing behind him .
It could ( and should ) get ugly .
Of course , if there are riots at the polls on November 4 , then Bush / Cheney can simply declare it a state of emergency and a threat to America and stop the whole process and declare Martial Law .
( " This would be a whole lot easier if this were a dictatorship , as long as I 'm the dictator . " )

Thank you Andrea .

OK , if that bubble # 6 appeared on the Democratic ballots too , and there is no other identification on the ballot to indicate it 's a Dem ballot , then your question is quite valid .
And the point I made before about different bins is valid .
Either there were different bins for the Dem and NP / AIP ballots , or the ballots were marked .
And if there were different bins , what Brad has said about checking the poll books is valid and there is a chance to narrow down the disenfranchisement .
If there were not different bins , then where did the Dem results come from ?
Perhaps this whole primary is invalid ?
If there were different bins and the ballots were mingled together after the Dem ballots were counted , is that normal SOP ?
It would be bad management if it were .
Is there any other race / issue on that ballot that suffered from the same flaw ?
With all those bubbles available , there simply was no excuse for this and tends towards deliberate .
It does not take a computer expert to figure out this is not the way to do it .
But one wonders , without further information on the ballot handling , your question about how they could then determine the Dem ballots has to be answered .
Interesting .

The number of NP voters who chose to vote in the AI primary is incredibly small .
So far , I 've been unable to find a poll worker who said any NP voter chose to vote AI at their polling place .
In a worst case scenario , counting EVERY NP ballot that had a choice for presidential candidate ( even if it was in the same bubble for a potential AI vote ) would decrease the current error rate where every NP Presidential vote without the second bubble filled in is currently being miscounted .
Of the ( conservatively stated ) 50,000 or so ballots , 100 % of them are currently miscounted .
Counting ANY of them as Dem ballots will reduce the current error rate with every single ballot counted .
Again , I 'll repeat , Logan is full of shit .

re : Linda -
" If there is going to be a citizen effort to count those ballots , let me know .
I will volunteer .
Also , I will request that my local paper let its readers know that LA County is looking for citizens to participate in this counting .
What involvement , if any , does our SoS have in this matter ? "
None whatsoever - this was n't a state election , nor is it an official one .
Due to the democracy hating media and the democrublican party conspiracy , primaries for the 2 major political parties are often discussed as though they were state or federal elections .
They are not .
It 's easy to misunderstand , but the parties are actually simply paying to use the voting facilities of the states to determine their candidates .
This is n't a real election except in the sense that the parties have legally given themselves the right to steal tax dollars to partially offset the cost of their " choosings " .
What did I just say ?
The political parties in question are paying ( part of the cost ) of running a choosing process ( " election " ) for their candidate .
A primary is NOT a real election - not one single vote has to be counted , nor is there any requirement other than party rules that says that all votes must be counted .
A primary can just as easily be run as an internet poll and a party boss can stop the poll after 2 votes .
STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE NO SAY OVER PRIMARY EVENTS .
NONE .
The primary is run by the parties - to the extent state / local workers make choices or are involved at all is typically habit or convenience .
( I say that generally - in some cases the parties have actually been able to write in laws specific to primaries to try and insert their specific party processes into the law and essentially force the democracy to forever recognize , and eventually totally pay for , their candidate selections . )
Of course this is not obvious to most people because these two political parties have worked hard to warp the media , warp the laws , and warp the democratic process to make you think that 400 million people should , could , and can only have 2 choices when voting - democrat or republican .
It 's certainly absurd enough to be funny , except the tragic element , in that the media reports on this propaganda , and all this " election " activity , as though it 's appropriate .
Let me ask you - how many media outlets , including this blog , have reported multiple stories ... 1 story ?
About the libertarian primary process or candidates ?
Reform party ?
Anyone ?
Well , the media hates democracy so much ( It 's inconvenient to do all that fair and balanced reporting ) , that they wholly contribute to totally excluding other parties or individuals .
How realistic is it for 3rd / 4th / 5th parties to compete in an environment when even the 4th estate , our supposed last resort protectors , create an environment where the democrat and republican parties , the democrublican machine , get thousands of hours worth of free media time ?
I have not heard the words " libertarian candidate " once used in the past year or so of campaigning .
In spite of my admiration for Brad , Raw Story , and similar independent media sites , I have to say - shame on you .
You could just have easily reported on election problems without repeating the key phrases the parties want to use - democrat or republican , in every story .
And we could see a few actual stories about other party candidates .
I realize it may not be as juicy , but with respect to some kind of fair " airtime " , as least posting links in stories to information about other parties seems like a reasonable thing to do , without taking away from the money generating headline stuff .
Please do n't help with this conspiracy to hold us all hostage to a single party with 2 heads .
A few regular links , if not actual news , to remind people that actual options do exist might go a long way .
Even better , in my opinion , is simply to stop pretending that these are huge differences and simply call them politicians .
Party affiliation is hardly relevant when 2 parties claim they can actually represent the differing views of hundreds of millions - the obvious generality and overlap of their positions , and inconsistency , makes the distinctions largely meaningless .
And if you doubt that , perhaps you should ask whether the so called lack of " democrat spine " in " defying " the republicans is n't more like " more of the same politicians doing more politician stuff " and not really doing their duty .
Why should they , when everyone is helping them to not represent actual public interests , which must obviously and necessarily fall outside only 2 options ?
If I were them I 'd be feeling fat and lazy too .
And happy , since the media is falling all over itself to report on " internal " party events that bear no relation to the actual election , while crushing third parties before the democrats or republicans even have to make an effort .
So Linda - if you are really a concerned citizen , then you do n't help the political parties count their ballots .
You make them pay people to do it , and help the libertarian , green , reform , socialist , etc. parties count for free , to make up for all the time you 've help them get screwed over by equating citizenship with helping " democrats " or " republicans " " elect " someone .

In your commentary / opinion , you blurred lines between fact and opinion to an extent that brings to mind for me how FOX " news " does the same thing .
You did it so much that I had to stop frequently , even multiple times within one sentence , to determine where the facting ends and the opinionating begins .
Look , you can write like that if you want to , but you 're going to lose a lot of readers , readers who might otherwise really identify with your opinionating , like me , but who would rather be able to easily see what the facts are upon which you are basing your opinions .
Anyway , I usu gloss over posts that use that style , but in this case I did not , because you directed some of what you wrote to me .

Oh , and there is actually a very good case that can be made for deprivatizing elections , to the extent that that is reasonably attainable .
Imagine our elections officials having teams of people to come in and work on elections problems , elections consulting firms that bid on elections problems contracts ahead of time , and that are dependent on there being problems for them to solve , such as recounts of poorly designed ballots .

WRS # 32
The comment that California 's Secretary of State has no role in primary elections and that the parties pay for even part of the costs of election administration is absolutely false .
WRS 's claim contradicts the provisions of the Elections Code that define elections , including primaries , as state elections .
( Elections Code section 318 ) Elections
Code sections 1000 et seq .
specify that primary elections are state elections and are conducted by local elections officials , with the secretary of state serving as the state ’s chief elections officer of the state .
The February presidential primary election was specifically established by Chapter 2 , Statutes of 2007 ( SB 113 ) and it expresses the intent of the Legislature that the state of California ( state taxpayers ) will pay the cost of this particular primary .
Counties ( county taxpayers ) have paid the costs of administering this primary election , and now the counties have seek reimbursment from the state .
( good luck ) Brad , I believe that comments such as WRS # 32 , even when clearly and completely wrong , should be allowed to be posted but I think by now my posts should be allowed to appear soon after I send them to you .
As you know , you have me " on probation " and I gather that my posts do not appear under you have an opportunity to review them and approve them for posting .
A few days ago it too 6 hours for my post to appear .
This morning it only took and hour and forty minutes .
It 's your blog and you are the decider .
But by now you may agree that I have been " more responsible . "
My point is , posts like WRS # 32 can seriously sidetrack discussion and I think my response , and those of others , should have an opportunity to appear on the blog in a timely manner .

" Were n't the voters assigned to booths depending on the party primary they were voting in ? "
Yes , except that non-partisan voters who indicated that they wanted to ' cross - over ' to the Democratic primary would have been directed to a Democratic voting booth .
( A non-partisan who wanted to cross-over to the AI primary would have - at least at the precinct where I was working - ended up in the same booth whether they were ' crossing over ' to AI , or voting true non-partisan .
That booth was a sort - or ' misc / other booth , where Greens , Peace and Freedom , Libertarians , etc , were directed .
But the " AI page " in that booth certainly had the 2nd AI bubble , bubble # 5 - as opposed to the Dems ' bubble # 6 ) .
" Would n't those ballots be in a separate bin from the AIP ballots ? "
I 'm not sure what you mean by ' separate bin ' .
At the polling place , all ballots went into the same ballot box , completely mixed together .
I am sure that later , when the votes were taken ' downtown ' to a counting center , they were separated out by ballot type .
But not at the polling place .
Badger at # 16 ( and again at # 27 )
" Some very simple , cheap things that could have helped avert this travesty : " Different colored ballots " Just - simply - PRINTING THE NAME OF THE PARTY ON THE BALLOT , if it was too much effort to print the candidates names "
The ballots used , as well as other materials , were color coded .
For example , if you still have your sample ballot booklet , you can see the colors I 'm talking about .
The ballots , the signs in the voting booths , the sample ballot booklets are all color coded .
The Republicans were a sort - of lavender - purple ; Dems a sort - of mustard - brown .
Non-partisans , if I remember correctly , were yellow .
In the voting booths , the signs indicating the type of booth it was - ' REP ' ' DEM ' - were of that party 's color .
I spent most of the day as the person taking ballots from the voters and feeding them into the scanner and into the ballot box .
Because of this color coding , I could see from across the room what type of voter was coming , and when it was a non-partisan , I made sure to manually check if they had correct ;y marked their " double bubble " ; about a dozen that I saw had not ; when I saw that , i explained to them a second time ( the ballot clerk had already explained once ) what they needed to do , and sent them back to their booth to mark the 2nd bubble .
And the ballots certainly had the name of the party ( or Non-Partisan ' ) printed on them .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A secret CIA overseas detention program revealed by President George W. Bush last year remains active and has held at least one al Qaeda militant since then , a U.S. official said on Thursday .
CIA Director Michael Hayden speaks with Senator Carl Levin ( D - MI ) before testifying to the Senate Armed Services Committee on the situation in Iraq , during hearings on Capitol Hill in Washington November 15 , 2006 .
A secret CIA overseas detention program revealed by President George W. Bush last year is still active and has held at least one al Qaeda militant since then , a U.S. official said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Joshua Roberts
The official confirmed the detention as the White House skirted the question of whether the agency had resumed holding prisoners at secret sites and insisted that the United States does not torture .
The New York Times reported on Thursday that the CIA was again holding prisoners at “ black sites ” overseas , and that the Justice Department under then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales had issued a secret opinion in 2005 that endorsed the harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the CIA .
“ The ongoing existence of the CIA program is extremely troubling , ” especially in light of the reported Justice Department opinion , said Elisa Massimino , Washington director of the advocacy group Human Rights First .
The detention and interrogation program , first revealed by The Washington Post in late 2005 and then acknowledged by Bush in September 2006 , has provoked an international outcry , with critics accusing the administration of secretly using torture to interrogate terrorism suspects .
Bush said all 14 high - level terrorism suspects held at that time had been transferred to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
But the Defense Department said in April it had taken custody of a suspected al Qaeda leader who had previously spent months in CIA hands .
A U.S. counterterrorism official , asked about detentions under the program , said : “ In late 2006 , Abd al - Hadi al - Iraqi , a high - ranking al Qaeda terrorist who planned and conducted attacks against U.S. military forces , was captured and held in CIA custody . ”
The official said the man , whose real name was given by the Defense Department as Nashwan Abd al - Razzaq Abd al - Baqi , was transferred to department control at Guantanamo Bay earlier this year .
“ WE DO NOT TORTURE ”
An al Qaeda leader said in May that Abd al - Baqi had been arrested in Turkey and handed over to the Americans .
Asked if the CIA currently holds anyone , agency spokesman George Little said , “ We do not comment on this question as a matter of course . ”
“ The agency ’s terrorist detention and interrogation program has been conducted lawfully , with great care and close review , ” he said .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino would not comment on the program , saying , “ We have n’t been in the habit of doing a press release every time we have a prisoner . ”
She also declined to comment on specific interrogation techniques but said , “ The policy of the United States is not to torture . ”
The Times said the Justice Department ’s secret 2005 memo differed sharply from a public legal opinion in December 2004 that declared torture “ abhorrent . ”
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller , a West Virginia Democrat , in a letter on Thursday to the Justice Department requested the legal opinions cited in the newspaper article .
Rockefeller said he had repeatedly asked for the classified opinions and the Justice Department had never provided a formal response .
House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , a Michigan Democrat , wrote separately to the acting attorney requesting the documents .
Citing unnamed officials , the Times said the 2005 memo for the first time explicitly authorized painful physical and psychological tactics including head - slapping , simulated drowning and frigid temperatures .
Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said the 2004 opinion “ remains binding on the executive branch ” but that he could not comment on any later , nonpublic “ legal advice . ”
Bush ordered in July that CIA interrogators comply with international Geneva Conventions against torture .
Massimino said the order and the administration ’s legal opinions appear to leave much room for harsh interrogations .
This poster hangs on the wall of waiting rooms at the doctor .
This way we let Dutch people know how privileged they are when it comes to medical care , and thus how appropriate it would be for them to help Doctors of the World help the less privileged .

OUTSOURCED CHART WONKERY …. No , not outsourced to India , just to another blog .
Afferent Input tries to chart the CBO ’s latest figures for increased income inequality but hits a snag : all the poor schmoes at the bottom have done so badly that their lines all get squashed together .
His solution : make the chart really tall and skinny .
The numbers in this chart are all normalized to zero in 1979 , and what they show is that the total share of national income going to the super - rich has more than doubled over that time .
The merely well off have also gotten a slightly bigger piece of the pie , while everyone else has funded this free - for - all .
“ Everyone else , ” in this case , means 90 % of the country .
Our share of national income has gone down in order to make sure that virtually all the fruits of economic growth over the past four decades could go to the well - off , the rich , and the super - duper - rich .
One of the reasons it ’s important to see charts like this , even if you ’ve seen them before , is that it gives the lie to the endlessly recycled myth that growing income inequality is mainly due to increased returns to education and technical skills .
But it ai n’t so .
The returns to education might be growing a bit — though even that ’s debatable — but by far the biggest beneficiaries of skyrocketing income inequality have been the top 1 % , the top 0.1 % , and the top 0.01 % .
Not even Republicans will try to make the case that the top 1 % have become better educated over the past 40 years compared to the top 10 % , so if that ’s where income inequality is concentrated then education just ca n’t be a huge factor .
If you ’re interested in the truth , you have to look elsewhere .
The Pythagorean theorem can apply to any shape , not just triangles .
It can measure nearly any type of distance .
And yet this 2000 - year - old formula is still showing us new tricks .
Re-arranging the formula from this :
to this :
helps us understand the relationship between slope ( steepness ) and distance .
Let ’s take a look .
Rescale Your Triangle
Scaling leads to new insights .
Yes , \$ 500 k / year is a lot ; but it really comes alive when you imagine things costing 10 x less ( A new laptop ?
\ $ 150 .
A new porsche ? \ $ 6000 ) .
Rescaling formulas can be eye - opening as well .
Let ’s start with our favorite 3 - 4 - 5 triangle and divide every side by 3 :
What happened ?
Well , we have a smaller red triangle with sides 3/3 ( aka 1 ) , 4/3 and 5/3 .
We ’ve got a mini version of the large triangle , and the Pythagorean Theorem still holds :
So Why ’s This Special ?
It does n’t seem like much , but there ’s some surprising insights :
First , we can rescale any triangle to have 1 as the smallest side ( divide by “ a ” ) .
All similar triangles ( i.e. those with the same ratios , like 3 - 4 - 5 and 6 - 8 - 10 ) will shrink into the same mini triangle .
This mini triangle has an interesting property : it only cares about the ratio b/ a .
The only “ meaningful ” numbers are 1 and ( b /a ) , giving :
And what ’s special about b/a ?
It ’s the slope of the hypotenuse line !
It ’s called the slope , the gradient , the derivative , rise over run — whatever the label , b/a is the rate at which the hypotenuse changes !
This makes sense .
For every unit traveled along the short leg , we gain “ slope units ( b /a ) ” on the other leg .
In a 3 - 4 - 5 triangle , we go 4/3 units “ North ” for every 1 unit “ East ” .
And the length of our hypotenuse increases 5/3 ( 1.66 ) for every 1 unit East .
The result is pretty cool : we used the steepness of the hypotenuse ( b /a ) to find the distance traveled per unit East , $ \sqrt { 1 + ( b / a ) ^2} $ .
An Example , Please
This is a bit weird , so let ’s do an example .
Suppose we ’ve gone 5 units East and 12 units North .
What ’s our distance from the starting point ?
The traditional approach plugs in the Pythagorean Theorem to get $c = \sqrt {5^2 + 12^2} = 13 $ .
It works , but let ’s try our mini-triangle method :
Instead of a large triangle with sides 5 and 12 , scale down by 5 : we get a mini triangle with sides 5/5 ( or 1 ) and 12/5 .
The “ mini hypotenuse ” is then $ \sqrt { 1 + ( 12/5 ) ^2} = 2.6 $ .
This means we travel 2.6 units along the hypotenuse for every 1 unit East .
Going the full 5 units East ( our original triangle ) is 5 * 2.6 = 13 units .
Neato — we got the same answer both ways .
But silly me , I made a mistake .
Instead of 5 units on that trajectory , I meant 6 . No 7 .
No wait , 8 . 9 , for sure .
Normally , we ’d be furiously hammering that square root button to find the new distance .
Maybe even using trigonometry to “ make it easier ” .
But not today — since we ’re on the same trajectory , we can re-use our scaling constant of 2.6 :
We can find the new distance traveled with regular multiplication , with nary a square root in sight .
Cool !
This approach is faster for humans and computers alike — you would n’t believe the crazy approaches programmers take to avoid a square root .
Static and Dynamic Formulas
I ’ve realized that our venerable Pythagorean Theorem focuses on a and b separately :
We consider a and b as separate elements , to be squared and summed .
This approach is straightforward , and helps when designing bridges or making pictures of triangles .
The traditional formula focuses on final values .
But the rescaled version has a new twist :
We ’re not that interested in the separate quantities — we want the ratio b/a , or the slope of the hypotenuse .
This slope creates a scaling constant , $ \sqrt{1 + ( b / a ) ^2} $ , that tells us how our “ Eastward ” motion translates to distance along our path .
The dynamic formula focuses on rates of change .
If we have a hypothetical function f( x ) , we might write the dynamic Pythagorean Theorem this way :
This concept is used in calculus to find the length of any line or curve — but we ’ll save that for another day .
The key is to realize a single formula can be re-arranged and lead to new insights .
Stay curious — we stop learning when we think we ’ve “ got it all figured out ” .
Appendix 1 : Slope vs. Distance
One point that confused me was separating the idea of slope ( b /a ) from distance traveled ( the hypotenuse , c ) .
Slope is b/a , rise over run — how much height you get when you increase width .
How “ steep ” the hill is , so to speak .
Unfortunately , the word “ slope ” makes us think of the side of the hill — but slope is really about height .
Distance ( the hypotenuse ) is about the side of the hill — how far you ’ve walked .
The “ steepness ” is n’t that important — you ’re laying a measuring tape on the ground , which could be flat , vertical or upside - down .
Does the length of a board depend on how you hold it ?
But , in our man-made world , slope and distance are related because we often express locations in terms of “ units East ( x coordinate ) ” and not “ units along a path ” .
So when a map says “ go 1 mile due East ” and you ’re in front a mountain ( large slope ) , you end up traveling a large distance ( more than 1 mile ) .
When on a flat road ( zero slope ) , 1 mile East is simply 1 mile East .
The bigger the slope , the more distance you must travel to “ go 1 mile East ” .
Again , we see that the Pythagorean Theorem is not just about triangles — it can convert slope ( steepness ) into distance traveled .
Happy math .

Allan Wood ( a baseball megafan who has written a book about Babe Ruth ) purchased over $ 280 worth of digital downloads of baseball games from Major League Baseball , who have just turned off their DRM server , leaving him with no way to watch his videos .
MLB 's position is that since these videos were " one time sales , " and that means that Wood and everyone else who gave money to MLB is out of luck — they 'll never be able to watch their videos again , .
MLB shut down the DRM server because they 've changed suppliers , and now they expect suckers to buy downloads of games in the new DRM format .
Anyone who does this needs their head examined — using DRM itself is contemptible enough , but using DRM this way is just plain criminal .
Just got off the phone with a MLB customer service supervisor .
" MLB no longer supports the DDS system " that it once used and so any CDs with downloaded games on them " are no good .
They will not work with the current system . "
Great .
Just effing great . …
As I told the supervisor , this is right in line with how wrong - headed and stupid and ass backwards MLB does everything .
I was told there is absolutely nothing MLB can do about these lost games .
Plus , they said my purchases were all " one - time sales " and thus " there are no refunds " .

NH landlord donates late Clinton rent check to Obama campaign Michael Roston
Published : Thursday February 14 , 2008

Print This Email This When Hillary Clinton left New Hampshire in January as the big winner , a doctor and building owner says she forgot to leave something on her way out of the state : a rent check .
After finally getting paid the money he was owed , the doctor says he 'll donate the proceeds to the campaign of her rival , Senator Barack Obama .
 Thirty days went by , with no replies to phone calls , e-mails , no replies at all .
Suddenly a newspaper article comes out .
It was the worst publicity they could get .
Three days go by and I get a check ,  said Terry Bennett of Rochester , NH says in a Wednesday article by Karen Dandurant in Seacoast Online , the website of the Portsmouth Herald .
Bennett went to an area newspaper with his story after the Clinton campaign was late in paying him a $ 500 rent check .
He had rented the space to Clinton 's team for 5 days before the Jan. 8 primary , and it was used as a headquarters and dormitory .
Bennett also said that the Clinton campaign left the space " trashed .
" " [ T ] here were fast food containers all over the place and lots of campaign signs left behind , " Dandurrant reports Bennett saying .
Bennett was eventually sent the rent check via express mail , but another landlord in Iowa where Clinton placed third in the Jan.
3 caucus told the paper that he had not yet received a $ 7,600 payment for space he had rented out to the campaign .
 I got a call on Sunday from the Clinton campaign who said they were putting the money in a two - day envelope ,  Richard Reese of Des Moines told the Portsmouth Herald .
 Today is Wednesday , and I already got the mail , but theres no check . 
The Clinton campaign has expressed regret on multiple occasions for not cleaning up some buildings it rented , but says most property owners it worked with were paid .
" A spokeswoman for the New Hampshire Clinton campaign said not paying Dr. Bennett for the space rented by campaign workers was unintentional , and called it an ' isolated delay , ' " Dandurrant wrote last week .
Ultimately , Bennett seemed angered by the experience .
" They have their tail in a vise , and I am holding a gas jet under it , " Bennett told the paper .

The Nixon - Mundt Bill , HR # 5852 , was passed by the House on May 21 , 1948 by 319 to 58 .
It required that members of the Communist Party of the United States register with the Attorney General .
It also said that federal employees could not participate in the Communist Party and could not " knowingly hire " any Communist Party members .
Finally , it denied passports to Party members to restrict their travels .
As there was absolutely no benefit to registering with the government , many communists remained " underground " and never registered .
Also called the " Subversive Activities Control Bill " , it was engineered by Representative Karl Mundt ( SD ) and then - Representative Richard M. Nixon ( CA ) , who was even called " one of the greatest patriots in all American history " by Representative Ben F. Jensen ( IA ) .
Arguing for support for the bill , Mundt is quoted as saying , " communists in this country are guilty of sabotage , propaganda against the interests of the United States in time of war , physical abuse during elections ( and murder ) plus hundreds of crimes such as draft dodging , passport faking , perjury and lesser crimes . "
The bill was fought by the National Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill .
However , many of their arguments against the bill were just as extreme as those arguing for the bill : the Committee said that , if put into effect , the bill would create legal fascism and pave the way for the restriction of civil liberties of any other group the government deemed a threat .
The Committee was not the only group against the bill ; Stephen I. Zetterberg , Nixon 's congressional election opponent , voiced his opposition to the bill , and even anti-communist public figures , such as William O'Dwyer ( Mayor of New York ) , did as well .
The bill died because the Senate never took action , but it was expanded and reintroduced two years later as a response to President Truman 's call for new legislation dealing with communists .
Added was a provision making publications or broadcasts produced by an organization labeled as communist specify that they were sponsored by a communist organization .
The second time around , it passed in the House 354 to 20 , and garnered much attention in the Senate .
Communism was seen by many of the bill 's supporters to be an international conspiracy to overthrow the Constitution and democracy as we know it , so the bill was not deemed unconstitutional because it was " protecting " the Constitution .
Those against the bill considered it thought control or " legislat[ion ] in a spirit of hysteria . "
After the bill passed through the House the second time , the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors passed an emergency ordinance " requiring all Communists or Communist sympathizers ... to register at the sheriff 's office after September 1st or face a $ 500 fine and six months in jail for each day 's failure to register . "
The bill itself did not pass the Senate , but after weeks of debating , Senator Pat McCarran ( NV ) drafted another one borrowing many of the provisions of the Nixon - Mundt Bill that , with the addition of the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 ( called the " concentration camp clause " ) , passed by a large margin .
The McCarran
Act reads :
" The detention of persons who there is reasonable ground to believe probably will commit or conspire with others to commit espionage or sabotage is , in a time of internal security emergency , essential to the common defense and to the safety and security of the territory , people , and the Constitution of the United States of America . "
Punishment was a fine not more than $ 10,000 or ten years in jail , or both .
Upon the bill 's passing , communists vowed never to register .
With Nixon 's help , the McCarran Act became known as the Internal Security Act of 1950 .
This act was so harsh that even President Truman questioned its constitutionality , saying , " We must be eternally vigilant against those who would undermine freedom in the name of security , " reflecting the 200 - year - old words of Ben Franklin .
Truman went on to veto the Internal Security Act , but his veto was overridden with an 89 % majority vote .
The battle over this bill strongly reflects the dispute over the USA PATRIOT Act : just replace " communist " with " terrorist " and " Internal Security Act " with " USA PATRIOT Act . "
How the Troubles should be described was debated
Speculation that the Consultative Group On The Past could suggest this had caused uproar among many unionists .
The group , co-chaired by Lord Eames and Denis Bradley , is to publish a report on how best to deal with the legacy of the Troubles in the summer .
DUP and Sinn Fein members clashed in the assembly during the debate on the motion .
Throughout the Troubles , successive governments and the security forces said they were dealing with criminal activity and a breakdown of law and order in Northern Ireland , not a war .
Now it seems to be a case of , like a scene from Fawlty Towers , ' do n't mention the war '
Jennifer McCann
Sinn Fein
" We know that the IRA did not fight a war - for they ignored the international conventions that govern warfare , " he said .
" We know too that they stand guilty of sectarian murder , ethnic or racial murder , and political assassination .
So what exactly was their campaign about ?
" Mr Speaker , they fought a seedy , grubby , sectarian terrorist campaign - nothing more and nothing less . "
In a very real sense you cannot rewrite history in any case , the past is exactly that : it 's the past , warts and all
Danny Kennedy
Ulster Unionist Party
" It was n't so long ago they were calling on the IRA to say the ' war ' is over , " she said .
" When it suited their political interests they had no problem using the word ' war ' ; now it seems to be a case of , like a scene from Fawlty Towers , ' do n't mention the war ' .
She added : " To the relatives of those who lost a loved one in the conflict , war , troubles , call it what you will , their loss is the same . "
Ulster Unionist deputy leader Danny Kennedy accused republicans of trying to rewrite the past .
" In a very real sense you cannot rewrite history in any case , the past is exactly that : it 's the past , warts and all , " he said .
SDLP leader Mark Durkan also rejected the notion that the Troubles was a war .
However , he said his party would not support the DUP motion , which he claimed presented a skewed and biased view of the past , adding there had been " wrong on both sides " .
Trevor Lunn from the cross-community Alliance Party said politicians from both sides had shown an inability to deal with the past in an impartial and balanced manner .
" The real issue here Mr Speaker is we have parties that are so entrenched in division that they can't even deal with the tragedies of the past 30 years without dividing it up , " he said .
Breeders are prepared to spend vast sums on trusted stallions
Only 10 % of a horse 's lifetime winnings can be attributed to their bloodline , research in Biology Letters shows .
Edinburgh scientists compared the stud fees , winnings and earnings of more than 4,000 racehorses since 1922 .
They found that the vast sums breeders are prepared to pay for top stallions do not guarantee the best genes .
The research was carried out by evolutionary biologists Alastair Wilson and Andrew Rambaut at the University of Edinburgh .
There are good genes out there to be bought but they do n't necessarily come with the highest price tag
Dr Alastair Wilson
They found that while there was genetic variance in the quality of stallions at stud , this was not reflected in the size of the horse 's stud fee .
" There are good genes out there to be bought but they do n't necessarily come with the highest price tag , " Dr Alastair Wilson told the BBC News website .
" It seems much more likely that people who can afford to pay high stud fees can also afford to manage and train their horses well . "
The offspring of expensive stallions did tend to win more over their lifetime , he said , but genes played only a small role .
By far the biggest factor was the horse 's environment - the way they were trained , the choice of races entered and which jockeys were employed , Dr Wilson added .
The findings may have parallels in the natural world , he added , in how signals of male genetic quality - such as the size and shape of a peacock 's tail - are used by females to select a mate .
In this context , where the breeder was selecting the horse , fees paid for a stallion were not an honest signal of genetic quality , the researchers said .
Full details of the research are published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters .
Even though I have heard of this great mind , Sir Arthur , I never got the opportunity until few years back to meet him .
That is actually thanks to Michael Snowden , a professional astronomer who later became good friends with me .
And last year I had two unforgettable moments .
Around June of last year 2006 , during Michael ’s staying in Sri Lanka , he invited me to go on a trip with him and Sir Arthur to Kandalama ( North Central ) .
It was one unforgettable experience .
And just after we came back from the trip , we reactivated the first official astronomical association , “ Ceylon Astronomical Association ” ( later known as Sri Lanka Astronomical Association ) which was founded by Sir Arthur himself and was the first the president of the association .
With the involvement of the former president Rev. Dr. Marvyn Fernando and Michael Snowden and others , we managed to reactivate the association Sir Arthur as the Patron , Prof. Kavan Ratnatunga as the President and myself as the Secretary .
Sir Arthur was present himself at the event .

Life - building molecules might be spread throughout space .
The Taurus Molecular Cloud contains some suprisingly complex molecules .
NASA
Astronomers have found the largest negatively charged molecule so far seen in interstellar space .
The discovery , of an organic compound , suggests that the chemical building blocks of life may be more common in the Universe than had been previously thought .
The molecule is a chain of eight carbons and a single hydrogen called the octatetraynyl anion ( C 8 H¯ ) .
Two teams of scientists have spotted it near a dying star and in a cloud of cold gas .
The discovery , along with that of three smaller organic molecules in the past year , opens up a suite of potential chemical reactions and products .
It suggests that ' prebiotic ' molecules such as amino acids , the building blocks of protein , could form all over the Universe , says Tony Remijan , an astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory ( NRAO ) in Charlottesville , Virginia .
Remijan 's team spotted the octatetraynyl anion in a dense cloud of gas in the halo surrounding a dying star in the constellation Leo , 550 light years from Earth .
They made the discovery using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia , a radio dish 100 metres across .
Another team from the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Massachusetts , used the same telescope to spot the compound in the Taurus Molecular Cloud ( TMC ) , located 450 light years from Earth in the constellation Taurus .
Both findings are published in the Astrophysical Journal1,

Watch this space
Negatively charged organic molecules such as the octatetraynyl anion were long thought to be confined to Earth .
" People thought they were too fragile to exist [ in space ] , " says Sandra Brünken , a member of the Harvard - Smithsonian team .
To show that octatetraynyl anion could be found in space , Brünken made the compound , along with several similar ones , in the lab .
She then measured the chemical 's spectrum — the same property radio telescopes hunt for .
With this in hand , the two teams sifted through radio telescope measurements to find the molecule .

Brünken and her colleagues discovered the first interstellar organic anion — a chain of six carbons and one hydrogen — by chance in late 2006 when they noticed a blip in the measurements from the TMC .
The spectrum hinted at a compound called hexatriynyl anion , but confirmation only came when they made the compound in the lab and found that the two signatures matched up .
The researchers believe that even larger organic molecules are likely to be out there .
Although more complex molecules are harder to identify , Remijan is confident of further discoveries .
" They 're really easy to find once you know what you 're looking for , " he says .

The North - West Passage – the sea route running along the Arctic coastline of North America , normally perilously clogged with thick ice – is nearly ice - free for the first time since records began .
" Since August 21 the North - West Passage is open to navigation .
This is the first time that it happens , " Nalan Koc , head of the Norwegian Polar Institute 's climate change programme , told reporters in Longyearbyen , a town in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard .
" The Arctic ice sheet currently extends on 4.9 m square kilometres .
In September 2005 it measured 5.3 m square kilometers . "
Koc was quoting research from the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre , where scientists monitor the surface of the Arctic ice sheet at regular intervals .
Last week they noted " the imminent opening " of the North - West Passage .
" Analysts confirm that the passage is almost completely clear and that the region is more open than it has ever been since the advent of routine monitoring in 1972 , " they said in research conclusions published on the centre 's website .
The news is yet another milestone showing that the Earth is warming up .
The route was first navigated in the early 1900s by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen , who later beat Robert F Scott in the race to the south pole in 1911 .
Amundsen and his crew took nearly two years to pick their way through a labyrinth of narrow lanes of open water and thick ice .
Now it would be comparatively plain sailing .
It has long been expected that Arctic sea routes including the North - West Passage and its north - east counterpart along the coast of Siberia will become more passable as the Earth 's temperature climbs .
Both are considered strategic cargo routes because they are shortcuts between the northern parts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans .
In recent years Russia , Canada and Norway have turned their attention to their northernmost regions .
A quarter of all untapped reserves of oil and gas are to be found in the Arctic , according to the US Geological Survey .
Already the Russian gas giant Gazprom is eyeing the exploitation of the world 's largest gas offshore field , Shtokman , off the coast of northern Siberia .
This month Russia planted a flag on the sea bed under the north pole to symbolically claim the region .
Canada and Denmark , meanwhile , are embroiled in a battle over sovereignty over Hans Island , a speck of land off Greenland .
The plane ’s ground speed in a crosswind ?
Ms. Cascio ’s students will explain that it is greater than it would be in calm air , and with a few deft sketches of vectors and triangles , they will tell you by how much .

The students can articulate their reasoning because , for one thing , they have no choice .
One recent morning , Ms. Cascio asked several students in succession to explain the logic of their answer to the same question — and , “ Uh , yeah , I agree with Yasamin and Josh ” just would n’t do .
“ It ’s called dipsticking , ” Ms. Cascio said .
“ It ’s really important to make sure the kids are picking this information up , and so I ask , Is this clear to you ?
Do you really understand it ?
and I wo n’t go on until I get a positive , satisfying answer . ”
A bigger reason the students seemed to wear the material comfortably emerged when they pulled from the classroom closet genuine items of clothing : white lab coats .
The Academy of Science is built on the principle of what its director , George Wolfe , calls inquiry - based learning .
“ I want them to learn to think like scientists , ” he said , “ rather than regurgitate facts . ”
From the moment they enter the program , students do experiments , lots of experiments .
Not canned experiments , either , of the sort found in the average “ science is fun ! ” book that spell out every step .
Here , the students must design experiments themselves , which means they must learn essential lessons like how to ask questions in an answerable way , what ’s your error bar , and , will you please just give me some data already .
Their natty new lab jackets shrugged into place , the students in Ms. Cascio ’s physics class set out to demonstrate by experiment , in four four - person teams , the Newtonian verity that force equals mass times acceleration .
One team proved hyperefficient , and within moments was catapulting ever more heavily weighted wheeled mini-carts along the tabletop and timing each run .
Another team got bogged down debating whether their experimental design would work better with one long string or three short ones , until finally their teacher trilled , “ Stop obsessing — let ’s go ! ” A boy yearned for a pulley .
Too bad , none available .
A mildly manic half - hour later , the data from the four teams were in and projected on an overhead slide for all to see .
Calculators clicked as the young white coats computed the percentage of error in their collected findings , and , whoa , it was only 6.6 percent .
“ That ’s phenomenal ! ” Ms. Cascio crowed .
Think about all the things that could have thrown your experiments off course , she told the class — the low - tech equipment , friction from strings rubbing on stacked textbooks .
“ But even with that , look at how fabulous the results are , ” she said .
“ You set up a great lab , and you should be proud . ”
It ’s one thing to read about Isaac Newton and apples falling from a tree .
It ’s another to test his laws of motion and see how right they can be .
Ms. Cascio , 57 , is a law of motion herself , a stylish dynamo whose voice retains the comforting vibrato of her natal Jersey City .
As an undergraduate at Douglass College of Rutgers University , she studied molecular biology and planned to become a doctor , but while living in Greece she began teaching and fell in love with the profession , eventually earning master ’s degrees in biology and education .
With her decades of experience and a string of national teaching laurels , Ms. Cascio could easily have settled into rote mode , but instead she decided to join the fledgling Academy of Science , where , she admits , the pace can be grueling .
“ It takes a lot more time to teach inquiry than by plug and chug , by getting up in front of a class and lecturing by the book , ” she said .
Citizen journalism and citizen punditry is alive in the Philippine blogosphere , and we saw this within minutes of a deadly blast at the popular Glorietta mall in Makati City , the country 's financial capital .
As of posting time , eight have been confirmed killed while 120 others were being treated for various types of injuries .
Manuel L. Quezon III rounded up first - hand accounts , initial reactions and updates .
Also taking note of furious blogging about the bombing was Blog Addicts .
In fact , Inquirer came out with a special site on the incident .
Photos of the crime scene or disaster area taken and posted by Disney Cute Land are now all over the internet , including the frontpage of the country 's most popular news website .
Videos courtesy of Gambit01 who was at Glorietta could be viewed here .
My Life was there when it happened :
It was just an ordinary friday afternoon and we were assigned to man the booth at Glorietta .
Its actually located beside the Havin a Baby store at Glorietta 1 .
We were scheduled to man the booth from 10 am – 3 pm since another group would be manning from 3 pm to closing time .
Around 12:30 pm , Didith ate her lunch and left Jacy and I behind .
When she got back after eating , Jacy said she was still too full to eat while I was really planning on eating once I go home .
Around 1:30 pm we were saying that we need to give away all of our fliers before the next group comes in .
Then I distinctly remember I was seating on the couch facing the Glorietta 2 side when I heard a big boom .
Together with the big boom was an earth shattering like earthquake .
Then in just a couple of seconds , I saw something fell from the ceiling .
It was a big chunk but it looked like it did n't weigh much .
Then everybody started running as fast as they could towards our direction
Calls for prayers came out from citizens , including pas_la_truie .
Babble
On says :
let ’s also pray for the long term implications of this event .
Remember we have the Human Security Act now in effect in the Philippines .
Plus there ’s a lot of political chaos going on , with accusations of bribery , impeachments complaints , calls for resignation and large scale corruption charges being hurled everywhere .
Political alliances are slowly breaking , and the last thing we need is a “ terrorist attack , ” if it is one , to splinter the remaining stability we have .
For mallrats and those with fond memories of Glorietta .
the incident boggles the mind , says Akomismo :
A bomb hit Glorietta 2 while I was ending my class with Rosal today .
For me , G2 was where I used to get my comics ( Filbar ’s ) and the last thing I bought in that area was an R2 - D2 Mr. Potato Head I gave to a friend for her birthday .
The store where I bought that toy is now gone .
Akomismo also shared that his mom was there and , thankfully , got spared :
Mom was there when it happened .
She was packing her stuff in the Gold ’s Gym locker room when the bomb hit .
For her the sound is unforgettable — just imagine an entire hallway of glass shattering and stone breaking both punctuated by high - pitched wails and unadulterated screams .
Dust from the debris found its way to the locker rooms about 150 m away from the site of the blast .
Thankfully she made it out unharmed and relaxed despite being incredibly afraid .
She is proud to discover that she can remain calm awhile everyone else went into a frenzied panic .
These are the days I am inclined to believe in a God and His angels ; regardless I am thankful .
Tragic , yes , but The Four - eyed Journal is a but suspicious about the bombing and begs answers to some questions :
Why was there no reports or warnings or intelligence alerts that we get to recieve every now and then during the height of the call for the GMA to resign and coup rumors to overthrow her administration ?
The government ’s intelligence units were so quick to issue warnings of terror alerts or coup attempts or plots to destabilize the government last year .
But now that something horrible did happened , why is the government acting too calm and collected , it ’s as equally disturbing as the bombing itself ?
What happened to all that training and assistance , particularly anti-terror related training , exercises , assistance the AFP got from the US military ?
Is this another ploy of the administration to distract the public from the recent wave of scandals that has once more ‘ exploded ’ into its face ?
Or is it a signal to all its opponents and critics that this administration would not go down without a fight ?
The suspicions have become widespread that The Warrior Lawyer explains :
This may be a case of the tail wagging the dog , as Malacanang operatives are supposedly looking for ways to redirect public attention away from the latest shenanigans involving President Arroyo and her immediate circle .
The Makati Business Club has labeled the incident a possible “ diversionary tactic ” .
Sen .
Trillanes warns against Arroyo ’s setting the stage for a declaration of emergency rule .
These reactions were prompted by the obvious question :
Who has most to gain in the immediate term by this fomenting an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty ?
People are now looking intensely at the investigation and staying vigilant over possible maneuvers by the President to use the incident to justify emergency rule or martial law .
Dear Friends ,
I hope this finds you well .
A question , a reflection , and an endorsement .
Why is our country divided ?
Why has this division been growing ?
Can we not all agree that we are a country that supports its families , that protects its citizens and respects its neighbors ?
A country that educates its children ?
Are we not a country that can lead by example rather than by force ?
Is ours a government of the people , by the people , for the people ?
I would like to think so .
But I believe that corporate greed and its involvement in policy making , along with political cronyism have made it nearly impossible for the people to govern .
So we fight amongst ourselves over the spin of political slogans and half truths .
And so we are divided .
It is time for a change and that is why I support Barack Obama for President .
Respectfully ,
Dave Matthews
You 'll be able to download PhysX .
As you may be aware , NVIDIA purchased the company Ageia earlier this month .
Ageia was the company that developed the ' PhysX ' property , which they sold as a PPU ( physics processing unit ) expansion card .
The card never made a big impact on gamers -- many felt that a dedicated PhysX card was n't necessary , and special PhysX support did n't make into that many games .
But PhysX - capable games might become much more common in the future , as NVIDIA CEO Jen - Hsun Huang revealed that the PhysX support will be coming to Geforce 8x xx cards .
The PhysX engine is going to adapted to run under CUDA , which is the programming interface that uses the parellel processing power of the 8xxxx series GPU 's to run general - purpose programs .
Presumably , this reworking of PhysX will make it's way into future Forceware drivers .
When exactly this will happen has not been pinned down , but it should n't take all that long , considering that NVIDIA retained many of the employees from the absorbed Ageia company .
Some would argue that having PhysX optimizations does not really lead to improved gameplay experiences , as current generations ' of video cards have enormous amounts of processing power available , and only a small amount of that powered is sufficient for physics calculations .
However , it is conceivable that with NVIDIA 's weight they could push many more game developers to make PhysX - friendly games that take greater advantage of the potential of PhysX , to a level that maybe has not yet been reached .
If this is the case , it would become an attractive selling point for going with an NVIDIA card over an ATI option -- but ATI might have a trick or two up a sleeve as well .
Here was how Republican he was : in the early ’90s , he was drafted to run for lieutenant governor of our state on the Republican ticket .
But here is how open - minded he has always been : his candidacy was undone when a reporter discovered he had been a registered Democrat since college , and although he had long since stepped to the other side of the aisle , he had never gone to the trouble of undoing that .
( He soon did . )
Whatever his current politics , it was too late : I had already fallen in love with his combination of whimsy and steadfastness , his ability to fix broken doors , his wanderlust and just plain lust .
What can I say ?
Love can sidetrack a person .
Still , it did not feel good when I told myself : I love a Republican .
It felt , in fact , like I had betrayed someone .
Or many people .
Slowly , my close friends and family met Lorne .
And slowly , one by one , they took me aside .
“ Ann , ” they would hiss , “ he ’s a Republican . ”
“ But he ’s pro-choice , ” I would say , hanging on to the one political stance he and I actually shared .
“ But he ’s a Republican , ” they would say .
Slowly , I met his friends .
Clinton was president then , popular and charismatic .
But at my first dinner party with his three oldest friends and their wives , I had to listen to them complain about Clinton .
This was before Monica .
What was there not to love about Clinton before Monica ?
Well , I guess if you disagreed with what he stood for , there was a lot not to love .
But how could you not agree with what he stood for ?
Such was my worldview .
The home of Timorese Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao was also shot at early today , a witness said , suggesting this was a half - baked coup attempt .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said this afternoon that Australia will reinforce its troops in East Timor as a result of the attacks .
East Timor 's Foreign Minister Zacarias da Costa said Mr Ramos - Horta was stable after emergency surgery to " locate bullets " .
" One had hit him in the back and passed through to the stomach , '' he said .
Royal Darwin Hospital is on standby to receive Mr Ramos - Horta when he is flown out of Dili .
Mr Ramos - Horta 's adviser , James Dunn , told ABC Radio : " My understanding is that he was shot twice in the stomach by Reinado 's men , and then of course Horta 's army of Timorese military guards returned the fire and according to some reports Reinado was killed . ''
The attack on Mr Ramos - Horta was followed at 7.45 am by gunfire against Mr Gusmao 's home , neighbour Leandro Isa'ac said by telephone from Dili .
Mr Gusmao and his Australian wife Kirsty Sword - Gusmao live at Balibar , in foothills south of Dili .
" I heard the gunfire and alerted army commander Taur Matan Ruak , who also lives near here , " Mr Isa'ac said .
Mr Gusmao later told journalists the situation in East Timor was " under control ' ' after the assassinations attempts .
Shot in stomach " President Ramos - Horta was shot in the stomach and is undergoing surgery at the heliport , " Agusto Junior , a presidential adviser , told reporters earlier .
East Timor 's Deputy Prime Minister Jose Louis Guterres said : " He will survive , and this country will survive . "
He said two carloads of people went to the President 's house at Areia Branca , two kilometres outside Dili about 6 am and " assaulted him , but after rapid reaction by security , his attackers fled " .
Mr Ramos - Horta 's next door neighbour , Luis Vieira , said he was woken at 6.50 am ( Timor time ) by a 20 - minute gun battle coming from the President 's residence .
Senior UN officials held an emergency meeting at 8 am , while UN police and the East Timorese army were said to be at the house soon after the shooting stopped .
Rebel Reinado shot dead
Army spokesman Major Domingos da Camara said house guards had shot and killed Reinado , who was wanted on murder charges for a flare - up of violence in 2006 .
Australian officers with the International Stabilisation Force ( ISF ) said Mr Ramos - Horta 's house in Dili had been cordoned off and troops had rushed to the residence .
Australian non-government organisations in Dili have recommended that their staff remain at home today .
UN spokeswoman Isabelle Abric said via phone from Dili that UN police and the International Stabilisation Force were on high alert and were maintaining a presence on the capital 's streets .
" Our first concern is that the situation remains calm and for people not to panic ... it 's too early to say anything about the future at this stage . "
No evacuations were being considered , she said .
" So far everything is calm and hopefully it will remain calm . "
Heard the gun battle
Ms Abric , who lives only 50 metres from Mr Ramos - Horta 's house , said she heard the gun battle herself .
" I 've been in a lot of war zones but I did not calculate exactly [ how many shots were fired or what calibre the weapons were ] .
I heard definitely two series of shots which did n't sound to be the same [ calibre ] . "
Reinado had threatened to use force against the Government in November if it failed to concede to demands by a group of army deserters .
Reinado was indicted for his alleged role in several deadly shootings between the rebel army troops and police units in April and May 2006 .
The fighting spilled over into mayhem that left 37 people dead and drove 155,000 others from their homes .
Calm was restored by foreign troops and peaceful elections were held in which Mr Ramos - Horta was elected President , but low - level violence had continued .
East Timor , a former Portuguese colony , gained independence in 2002 after more than two decades of brutal Indonesian occupation .
Rampant poverty
Its new political leaders have vowed to tackle rampant poverty and restore damaged relations between the country 's police and army .
Reinado was involved in an incident last week when his rebel group fired up to eight warning shots at Australian ISF troops .
The ISF soldiers did not return fire and no casualties were reported .
Today 's attack follows growing tension in Dili linked to Reinado and his followers .
Explosion
Following his confrontation last Wednesday with Australian soldiers , an explosion last Thursday rocked the military base at Camp Phoenix , in central Dili .
There were no injuries .
Camp Phoenix houses elements of the ISF , which includes Australian and New Zealand defence personnel .
Security forces have previously failed to apprehend Reinado , who in January refused to attend a scheduled court hearing tomorrow to face murder and other charges .
Reinado's lawyer said the rebel leader would not submit to the judicial process until the Government met several demands , including that his case be heard by a military court .
The court issued an arrest warrant for Reinado following his escape from prison , but last year Ramos - Horta called off the warrant following a bungled attempt by the Australian military to arrest the rebel in Same , 50 kilometres south of Dili .
Died in raid Five of Reinado 's followers died in the mountain raid .
Reinado , who escaped from prison last year and led a group of 600 rebel soldiers , was a key figure in the 2006 violence that plunged the country into violence and was wanted on eight counts of murder .
Mr Ramos Horta called off the military search for Reinado last June so the sides could engage in talks .
Last August Mr Ramos - Horta met Reinado to seek an end to the unrest .
" At the meeting , both sides expressed support for a dialogue process with the aim of settling their differences peacefully and ending the armed confrontation , " Swiss - based mediators , the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue in Geneva , said in a statement at the time .
It called the meeting " a positive move towards the start of a genuine dialogue process " .
Mr Ramos - Horta shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize with Bishop Carlos Belo for their resistance to Indonesian rule .

Jerry Yang began his biggest public presentation since becoming chief executive of Yahoo with something of an apology .
“ I ’m guessing that a lot of you are here today to see what the new look and new face of Yahoo is all about , ” he told an audience of some 1,500 technology enthusiasts at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week .
“ Well , I ’m sorry to disappoint you .
It ’s still the same old face .
I ’ve been around since the beginning . ”
Mr. Yang , a co-founder of Yahoo , was picked last summer to run the company in part to end a string of disappointments for Yahoo shareholders .
Before his keynote speech was over , Mr. Yang had offered the audience and shareholders a glimpse of what may one day be the new face of Yahoo  a revamped set of online services that company executives hope will help turn around Yahoo ’s fortunes .
But it was only a glimpse .
Mr. Yang displayed a prototype version of Yahoo ’s popular e-mail software that had been transformed into a powerful communications hub .
KDE 4.0 Beta 1 Release Announcement
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
KDE Project Ships First Beta Release for Leading Free Software Desktop , Codename " Cnuth "
KDE 4.0 Beta 1 marks the stabilizing of foundations for the new major release of KDE .
August 2 , 2007 ( The INTERNET ) .
The KDE Community is happy to announce the immediate availability of the first Beta release for KDE 4.0 .
This release marks the beginning of the integration process which will bring the powerful new technologies included in the now frozen KDE 4 libraries to the applications .
Almost two months after the foundations of KDE 4 have been laid with the first alpha , KDE enters the stage of a full freeze of the library interface .
From now on , the applications will focus on integrating the new technology refined during the last months , and the library developers will try to fix all bugs found during this process .
No new applications will enter the official KDE modules and usability and accessibility work is of course an ongoing process .
In the following weeks KDE developers will be able to add features to their applications until the next beta is released and the application features will be frozen as well .
Current status
At this moment , the codebase is still moving quickly .
The new foundations are stabilizing , but applications are still in flux .
Since the last Alpha , a lot of work has been committed .
We 've seen improvements all over KDE again .
In the following sections we will try to highlight a few of them .
Marble widget being used in Qt Designer
Architectural
Marble is an application showing a spherical earth which you can zoom and rotate .
Marble is a geographical application and widget and it is compatible with Google Earth's KMZ files ) , but more lightweight .
Marble uses Wikipedia for retrieval of geographical data and offers easy downloading of new maps , views and other data .
Inspite of using a combination of vector and bitmap data , it is not slow , even without hardware accelleration in the form of OpenGL .
Google sponsors three students working on Marble through their Summer of Code project .
Marble also doubles as a generic geographical map widget and framework .
It will allow developers to easily show a person 's location or let the user choose a timezone by embedding it into their application .
Of course , the educational applications and the games will make use of this .
On July the 20th , the Icon / Pixmap Cache was merged by Rivo Laks into the KDE libraries .
The icon cache speeds up loading icons when starting applications , and in the future , it might contribute to performance when using fully scalable icons and other scalable interface elements .
The pixmap cache makes caching of images rendered by the application , such as from SVG files , easy for application developers .
The result will be improved startup and ( to a lesser extent ) runtime performance , already seen in the games KMines and KLines .
Applications
Slowly , the many changes to the foundation of KDE are starting to become visible to the users .
Applications are starting to capitalize on the new architecture , while adding features and other improvements .
Since the previous report on KWin , the KDE window manager , a lot progress has been made .
Most work has gone into new and improved effects and their configuration dialogs .
Users of low - end hardware are n't forgotten , as KWin will now automatically fallback to XRENDER or even disable compositing in the absence of OpenGL rendering .
Further , Integration between Dolphin the filemanager in KDE and Konqueror , KDE 's webbrowser has been improved , and Gwenview , the image viewer received usability work and features .
Konsole showing off split - screen and history highlight Konsole showing off split - screen and history highlight
In addition to lots of user interface cleanups and improvements , Konsole has improved automatic tab titles , support for random background colors per-tab , clickable URLs and a new default color scheme .
Konsole now also provides hints to the terminal about the color scheme being used to allow programs such as Vim to adapt their palette accordingly , improving readability for the user .
Okular , the universal document viewer of KDE4 introduces usability improvements , better multithreading and work on the print preview component .
The improved KRDC in action
The improved KRDC in action
System administrators will be happy to hear KRDC , our remote desktop tool , has been adopted by Urs Wolfer .
He is rewriting KRDC , solving many longstanding issues and adding features like tabbed view and KWallet support .
Work in KDE - PIM is picking up , as features from the KDE - PIM Enterprise branch are merged .
KOrganizer received a gantt - based time line view and an Outlook - style view , and KMail incorporated the tagging patches .
More effort went in KOrganizer 's theming interface by Loïc Corbasson , who is extending the theming and plugin interface and writing some example plugins like a Wikipedia ' this day in history ' one .
Next up
Now the KDE libraries are rather stable , the development focus is shifting to finishing other components of the desktop .
One of the most notable components is Plasma .
While the developers are pretty much ready with the infrastructure for the plasmoids , most of them are not yet shipped by default Development of those features is happening in KDE 's source code repository in the playground module .
Thus , you will still see good old Kicker , KDE 's panel and taskbar when you boot up KDE 4.0 Beta 1 .
Javascript support has been added to plasma , and according to its lead developer we might soon support the Mac OS X Dashboard widgets .
Superkaramba applets are supported already , Opera widgets might follow soon .
Porting
Extragear applications like DigiKam and KPhotoalbum are busy porting to KDE 4 , and we encourage all application authors who have n't started this yet to get going with the porting guide .
Get it , run it , test it ...
For those interested in getting packages to test and contribute , several distributions notified us that they will have KDE 4.0 Beta 1 packages available at or soon after the release .
The complete and current list can be found on the KDE 4.0 Beta1 Info Page .
KOffice Releases Second Alpha
Along with KDE 4.0 Beta 1 , KOffice releases its second alpha version .
This version is released as a technology preview to let the public catch a gleam of what is coming in KOffice version 2.0 .
It does not have the same level of maturity as the rest of KDE 4.0 Beta 1 .
KWord , a KOffice application using Flakes of various types
The infrastructural changes are enormous .
KOffice version 2 series will take full advantage of the improved Qt 4 , giving it new features like text directionality and improved layouting .
The text rendering is also much improved , giving it a professional quality text layout if the fonts support it .
The core of the new improvements is the revolutionary Flake library which will allow KOffice to use any shape in any application .
A
Flake shape can be something as simple as a circle or something as complex as a complete spreadsheet .
It is also extremely simple to create new shapes , something that is demonstrated by the Google - sponsored Summer of Code project Music Notation flake , in which a student creates a music notation plugin in just 6 weeks .
Although KOffice is included in KDE 4.0 Beta 1 , it has its own release cycle , and the first version of the KOffice version 2 series is expected around the new year 2007 - 2008

John McCain is clearly hurting for support from conservatives .
The maverick senator 's candidacy has been attacked by pundits from the Republican base viciously even after his nomination became all but certain .
Rush Limbaugh told listeners to vote for Obama and Ann Coulter even promised to campaign for Hillary if McCain was the GOP nominee .
In her rant against him she said he was wrong on torture .
Now , when she says " wrong " about torture , she means that he opposes the use of torture .
He would be " right " if he supported it , but McCain is a former POW who was tortured and abused to death 's door , and his past record shows a consistent stance against its use by America .
This week , however , he did what most senators running for President do ; he cast a vote to appeal to a certain target demographic rather than his own constituency or personal convictions .
Even though he 's been known to break from his party and has repeatedly described waterboarding as torture , he voted against a recent Senate bill aimed to limit the CIA 's interrogation techniques and stop the illegal practice of waterboarding .
He 's gone beyond that and recommended that the President veto the bill and allow the CIA to go on using torture even after they have so clearly betrayed the public trust by lying and destroying evidence .
McCain is a victim of torture and an outspoken opponent of it's practice by Americans , so it 's hard to imagine that this surprising decision was anything other than a spineless attempt to win over his conservative detractors .
I wonder if his mama ever told him that if someone wo n't be his friend unless he tortures people , then he does n't need that person as a friend after all .

This is an example of how off the rails the United States has gone .
The pharmaceutical industry that has handicapped countless children with mercury - based vaccines is able to buy a study that says a known neuro - toxin is good for the brains of infants and small children and improves their behavior !
First , " behavior " is not quantifiable and is completely subjective .
There 's no science here .
Just corruption of science on an inconceivable scale .
Second , mercury is a poison , a neuro - toxin that destroys the functioning of the central nervous system .
There is no conceivable justification for it to be mainlined into the bloodstream of anyone for any reason ever .
You may want to watch this twice so you can be sure you really heard what you thought you heard .
You did .
This year ’s death - penalty bombshells  a federal moratorium , a state abolition and the smallest number of executions in more than a decade  have masked what may be the most significant and lasting development .
For the first time in the modern history of the death penalty , more than 60 percent of all American executions took place in Texas .
Over the past three decades , the proportion of executions nationwide performed in Texas has held relatively steady , averaging 37 percent .
Only once before , in 1986 , has the state accounted for even a slight majority of the executions , and that was in a year with only 18 executions nationwide .
But this year , enthusiasm for executions outside of Texas dropped sharply .
Of last year ’s 42 executions , 26 were in Texas .
The remaining 16 were spread across nine other states , none of which executed more than three people .
Many legal experts say that trend is likely to continue .
Indeed , said David R. Dow , a law professor at the University of Houston who has represented death row inmates , the day is not far off when essentially all executions in the United States will take place in Texas .
As his readers most likely know , Pinyo and his wife are expecting a baby .
In fact , why you ’re seeing this post I wrote for Pinyo is most likely because they ’ve had the baby and are off in the hospital or at home enjoying their new little bundle of joy .
Having had two babies of my own , I ’ve picked up a few tips on saving money in feeding , clothing , and raising your new bundle of joy — at least in the beginning .
Babies are expensive — it is just a fact of life .
But they do n’t have to be as expensive as you think .
Photo of Pinyo and nephew taken by his wife
1 . Tell everyone you know you are having a baby
Seriously — people love babies .
People love buying things for babies .
No , not everyone , but a LOT of people .
I got gifts from people I hardly knew ( and never expected a gift from ) after I gave birth to my first child .
So spread the word !
2 . If you can , nurse
Yes , I do know , first hand no less , that not everyone can nurse their child .
My first child had more nursing problems than I can really enumerate here , and we struggled for a long time .
He did eventually go on to have a successful nursing relationship with me , but it was n’t easy .
Not everyone can nurse , and that is okay .
But if you can , and it works out — it is a lot cheaper than formula .
Trust me .
A lot cheaper .
3 . Hand me down clothing is trendy for babies
It may be taboo to hand down adult or even children ’s clothing , but there is no such taboo on baby clothing .
Babies hardly wear their clothes before they grow out of them , and parents end up with boxes of adorable things they have no use for .
Hit up a few friends for hand me downs .
Or visit a yardsale or a consignment shop or two .
No need to buy new — they ’ll look adorable and a baby does n’t care what they wear .
4. Cloth diaper
It is a bigger initial investment but then you can keep reusing them over and over and it ends up a lot cheaper .
But not everyone has spouses agreeable to cloth diapering ( mine flat out refused ) so in that case …
5 . Try different brands of diapers and find what works for you
With one of my children , only the most expensive brand worked without constant leaks .
However , my second child wore very inexpensive generics with no problems at all for the entire first year of her life .
So buy small packages of four or five different kinds and try them out .
If you find a generic that works for you , you ’ll save a lot of money in the long run .
6. Hand Me Down or Used Baby Gear ( Just Not the Car Seat ! )
Most baby gear is still in great condition because babies use it for such a short time .
Ask friends with toddlers if they have bouncy seats , swings , play yards , or other random baby items .
But buy a new car seat .
Car seats only last 6 years and you never know if it has been in an accident unless you own it .
7. Do n’t Buy Everything Baby Books Suggest
The baby books have lists a mile long of “ must - haves ” .
Do n’t .
Buy the essentials and then as you perceive a need for something , then buy it .
We never bought a changing table .
We do n’t miss it .
Wipes warmer ?
That ’s what I have hands for .
8. Make Simple Toys Out of Household Items
My son ’s favorite toys were an old cell phone ( batteries removed of course ) and a plastic Tupperware container .
Really .
He had lots of toys because my relatives doted on him , but he did n’t need them .
My daughter loves an old remote control and an old calculator ( again , batteries removed from both ) .
Simple pleasures . 🙂
9. Make Your Own Baby Food
It really is not very hard at all , and there are tons of websites to help .
But really , all I did was microwave - steamed or steamed on the stove veggies or fruit until soft , and then mashed it up ( in a food processor when baby first started eating solids ) .
Simple .
Seriously simple .
And then I froze in ice cube trays and stored in plastic baggies .
Could n’t be easier and it was cheap and fun .
10 . Ask Your Friends For Useful Gifts
Good friends , when they ask what you want , tell them the truth .
Get diapers .
Get bigger clothes .
No one needs 500 newborn sized onesies and outfits .
Seriously .
Your friends will understand .
We asked my in laws for diapers for Christmas .
And we even got some .
So there are my 10 frugal baby tips .
Hopefully it helps Pinyo and anyone else out there expecting a little one in the near or distant future .
And if you ’re having a girl , hit me up for some baby clothes .
It was just $ 2,492.63 , a pittance , really , alongside million - dollar television buys and direct mail drops .
But with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination enduring a rough patch , Peter Semetis , the owner of a deli and catering business in Lower Manhattan , had been following the news and growing increasingly worried that he was not going to be paid for the assorted breakfast trays , coffee , tea and orange juice he had provided the campaign for an event in mid-December .
“ I ’m afraid of her dropping out of the campaign and me becoming a casualty , ” Mr. Semetis said .
So on Thursday , he went to small claims court and filed suit .
Mr. Semetis , 53 , said he was hardly a political pundit but like others across the country , he had become caught up in the election in the last year and was able to offer some analysis .
“ There is potential for her to lose Texas , ” he said  an assessment not at odds with the polls  “ which would pretty much force her to quit . ”
Mr. Semetis catered a Clinton event , a rally she did not attend , at the offices of District Council 37 , the public employees ’ union , on Dec. 15 , charging the campaign $ 2,300 , plus $ 192.63 in tax .
Officials promised him that his business , Sale & Pepe Fine Foods , would be paid by check or credit card in a couple of weeks .
After a few weeks passed , he started calling to see about the holdup .
By Jonathan Fildes
Science and technology reporter , BBC News
US and Canadian scientists have built a novel device that effortlessly harvests energy from human movements .
The adapted knee brace , outlined in the journal Science , can generate enough energy to power a mobile phone for 30 minutes from one minute of walking .
The first people to benefit could be amputees who are being fitted with increasingly sophisticated prosthetics .
" All of the new developments in prosthetics require large power budgets , " Dr Douglas Weber of the University of Pittsburgh , and one of the authors of the paper , told BBC News .
" You need power to run your neural interface ; you need it to run your powered joint , and so on .
" Getting that power is going to be really important . "
Walk and talk
The new device generates power by a process known as " generative braking " , analogous to the braking systems found in hybrid-electric cars such as the Toyota Prius .
" Walking is a lot like stop - and - go driving , " explained Dr Max Donelan of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby , Canada , lead author of the paper .
" Within each stride muscles are continuously accelerating and decelerating the body .
Hybrid electric cars take advantage of stop - and - go driving using so - called " regenerative braking " where the energy normally dissipated as heat is used to drive a generator .
" We have essentially applied the same principle to walking . "
Using a series of gears , the knee brace assists the hamstring in slowing the body just before the foot hits the ground , whilst simultaneously generating electricity .
Sensors on the device switch the generator off for the remainder of each step .
In this way , the device puts less strain on the wearer than if it was constantly producing energy .
Tests of the 1.6kg device produced an average of 5 watts of electricity from a slow walk .
" We also explored ways of generating more electricity and found that we can get as much as 13 watts from walking , " said Dr Donelan .
" 13 watts is enough to power about 30 minutes of talk time on a typical mobile phone from just one minute of walking . "
However , to generate this amount of power the generator had to be constantly switched on , which required more effort from the wearer .
Battery pack
The knee brace is the latest development in a field known as " energy harvesting " .
The field seeks to develop devices and mechanisms to recover otherwise - wasted energy and convert it into useful electrical energy .
" We 're pretty effective batteries , " Dr Donelan told BBC News .
" In our fat we store the equivalent of about a 1,000 kg battery . "
Tapping this power source is not a new idea and has been exploited in everyday devices such as wind - up radios and self - winding watches .
The US defence research agency Darpa has a long - standing project to tap energy from " heel - strike " generators implanted in soldier 's boots and powered through the pumping motion of a footstep .
And in 2005 , US scientists showed off an energy - harvesting backpack which used a suspended load to convert movement into electrical energy .
However , heel - strike devices generate relatively little energy whilst people using the backpack have to bear the burden of carrying the bag .
" It requires a relatively heavy load - around 38kg - to get a substantial amount of power , " said Dr Donelan .
Simulations showed that a soldier carrying the pack and walking at a relatively brisk pace could generate around 7.4 watts of power .
" It 's about the same amount of power as [ the knee braces ] produce , " said Dr Donelan .
Kit list
The team believes the new device could have many uses .
The technology could be used to make " smart prosthetics "
" I think the early adopters will be people whose lives depend on portable power , " he told BBC News .
" On the medical front , portable power is used by those who have amputated limbs to charge their powered prosthetic limbs , " he said .
However , Dr Art Kuo at the University of Michigan does not believe it will be simply a case of strapping the device on to an existing prosthetic .
" It would probably involve building a new [ prosthetic ] knee that uses some existing ideas and then also tries to harvest energy using these principles , " he said .
The team also hope the device could be useful for people who have suffered a stroke or spinal cord injury who wear an " exoskeleton " to help them move .
" The current and future emphasis is on powered exoskeletons , " said Dr Donelan .
Soldiers may also benefit from wearing the knee brace to power the multitude of devices they now carry , such as night vision goggles and GPS .
" They treat batteries like they treat food and water - they are so essential to what they do , " he said .
Dr Donelan has now set up a spin - out company to exploit the technology and believes it will eventually be possible to develop a small device that can be fitted internally across different joints .
However , in the short term he has his sights set on a light weight , slim - line version of the knee brace .
" That 's about 18 months away , so it 's not science fiction far in the future stuff , " he said .
A team at the University of Copenhagen have tracked down a genetic mutation which took place 6-10,000 years ago and is the cause of the eye color of all blue - eyed humans alive on the planet today .
What is the genetic mutation ?
“ Originally , we all had brown eyes ” , said Professor Eiberg from the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine .
“ But a genetic mutation affecting the OCA2 gene in our chromosomes resulted in the creation of a “ switch ” , which literally “ turned off ” the ability to produce brown eyes . ”
The OCA2 gene codes for the so - called P protein , which is involved in the production of melanin , the pigment that gives color to our hair , eyes and skin .
The “ switch ” , which is located in the gene adjacent to OCA2 does not , however , turn off the gene entirely , but rather limits its action to reducing the production of melanin in the iris – effectively “ diluting ” brown eyes to blue .
Therefore the switch ’s effect on OCA2 is very specific .
If the OCA2 gene had been completely destroyed or turned off , human beings would be without melanin in their hair , eyes or skin color – a condition known as albinism .
Different eye color phenotypes .
a Blue ( without brown areas ) .
b
Blue with brown spots ( with brown ) scored as “ unknown ” in the linkage and association studies .
c Brown–green / hazel ( BEY1 ) with a board puripupillary ring .
d Brown ( BEY2 ) , total brown pigmentation .
The person with blue eye color ( a ) represents the genotype rs12913832 G/G , while the persons b–d represent the genotype rs12913832 A/
G
Limited genetic variation
Variation in the color of the eyes from brown to green can all be explained by the amount of melanin in the iris , but blue - eyed individuals only have a small degree of variation in the amount of melanin in their eyes .
“ From this we can conclude that all blue - eyed individuals are linked to the same ancestor , ” says Professor Eiberg .
“ They have all inherited the same switch at exactly the same spot in their DNA . ”
Brown - eyed individuals , by contrast , have considerable individual variation in the area of their DNA that controls melanin production .
Professor Eiberg and his team examined mitochondrial DNA and compared the eye color of blue - eyed individuals in countries as diverse as Jordan , Denmark and Turkey .
His findings are the latest in a decade of genetic research , which began in 1996 , when Professor Eiberg first implicated the OCA2 gene as being responsible for eye color .
Nature shuffles our genes
The mutation of brown eyes to blue represents neither a positive nor a negative mutation .
It is one of several mutations such as hair color , baldness , freckles and beauty spots , which neither increases nor reduces a human ’s chance of survival .
As Professor Eiberg says , “ It simply shows that nature is constantly shuffling the human genome , creating a genetic cocktail of human chromosomes and trying out different changes as it does so . ”

The most intriguing at - bat of 2007 is leaking into 2008 .
You can sense it by the way a 25 - year - old wannabe struts through his February workouts .
You can sense it by the way a 40 - year - old shoulder shrugs at the line of questioning .
You can sense it by the way a Hall of Famer is uncomfortably stuck in the middle .
And you can sense it by the way a filthy rich man stares into space .
On Sept. 29 , 2007 , Tony Gwynn Jr. , for all practical purposes , knocked Tony Gwynn Sr. 's team out of the playoffs .
But it 's much crueler than that .
He did it with two outs and two strikes in the bottom of the ninth -- against his Uncle Trevor .
He did it with the champagne on ice and the Colorado Rockies on life support .
He did it against the franchise that clothed and fed him and against a fan base that , 81 days a year , walks down Tony Gwynn Drive to the turnstiles .
He did it as the only son of San Diego 's favorite son .
And this is how he pays everyone back ?
But to understand Sept. 29 , 2007 , you need to scoot back one day to Sept. 28 .
That night , in a corridor of Miller Park in Milwaukee , Tony Gwynn Jr. asked San Diego Padres owner John Moores for a favor .
Wait until you hear it .
*****
The most intriguing at - bat of 2007 has its roots in 1997 .
Back then , a boney 15 - year - old kid named Anthony Gwynn , otherwise known as Little T , sat at the same locker every day in the Padres ' clubhouse :
Not his dad's .
Trevor Hoffman's .
Center Field
Milwaukee Brewers
Profile
Virtually every game , Little T was with Hoffman , a relief pitcher whose work ethic knew no bounds .
They had first met in 1993 , back when Hoffman was a power pitcher , back when nobody outside of San Diego knew Trevor from Adam .
But Little T knew him .
Trevor would kneel down and ask him about his favorite TV shows and video games , and out of the blue one day , he even asked Little T if he wanted to play football in the outfield .
" Football ? ' '
Little T asked .
" Football , '' Trevor said .
" We stretch our arms out by tossing it around . ''
They 'd play passing games out there , and Little T would get two points if he caught a pass one - handed , and one point if he needed both hands .
The pitcher treated the kid as an equal , and from that day on , Little T belonged to Trevor .
By 1997 , you never saw one without the other .
Little T would follow the pitcher to the warning track to shag flies , to the weight room to do curls , to the food room to eat gumbo .
He 'd study how Trevor stretched , how Trevor set up hitters , how Trevor iced his shoulder .
They 'd talk about girls , the Lakers and how to hit a changeup .
Little T hung on every word .
Eventually , Little T went to San Diego State as a center fielder , and by 2003 , was considered a legit major league prospect .
The scouts liked his speed and his defense , but -- imagine this -- the son of the greatest hitter of this quarter century had n't proven he could rake .
Still , the eager Padres had secretly planned to draft him with their second - round pick , 41st overall .
They knew the whole town , including Trevor , would 've gone nuts over it .
But the Brewers , the spoilsport Brewers , picked Little T first , at No. 39 overall .
All over town , it was an oh - shucks moment , although Little T breathed a sigh of semi-relief .
Part of him would 've adored life as a Padre , but part of him was n't ready for the madness .
Part of him was n't ready for the standing O's just because of his last name .
What if he batted .250 instead of .350 ?
What if he let the San Diego fans down ?
He could n't live with himself .
He decided he was better off in the land of bratwurst , and during his early spring trainings , he 'd always bump into Hoffman and thank him .
He'd thank him for teaching him how to be a pro , for teaching him how to think , think , think along with the pitcher .
Maybe some day , he told Trevor , it 'd all pay off .
*****
The most intriguing at - bat of 2007 has its roots in a San Diego owner 's suite .
Every night , after he'd leave Trevor in the clubhouse , Little T would climb a stadium ramp to see the Moores family .
And then he'd raid their pregame spread .
He felt so at home there .
His dad was always calling John Moores the best owner in baseball , and the reason was Moores ' sentimental , philanthropic outlook on life .
For instance , right after Moores bought the club in 1994 , he waltzed into the clubhouse to invite Tony Sr. and his wife , Alicia , to his house for dinner .
Tony said no .
His owners in the past had been the eccentric Joan Kroc and the unmotivated Tom Werner , who 'd staged an infamous fire sale , and Tony preferred to keep his distance .
But Moores told him , " I do n't want to hear that ; you 're coming . ''
They rode over to the house together , and , for the first time in his career , Tony Sr. actually heard an owner ask him , " How can I make your life easier ? "
Tony gulped , and let it out .
He asked for a more integrated spring training , with minor and major leaguers mingling together .
He asked for open dialogue with the front office .
And he asked for team babysitters , so the wives could watch games in peace .
" Oh , you have kids ? ''
Moores said .
" A daughter and a son , '' Tony said .
" What 's your son 's name ? ''
Moores asked .
" Little T , ' ' said Big T .
The Brewers won 83 games in 2007 , finishing two games back of the division - winning Cubs .

So that 's how the introductions went , and before long , Little T became a regular in the Moores ' private box , the Moores ' private home and the Moores ' private jet .
The Moores flew Little T and Alicia to Cleveland for the 1997 All - Star Game , and to myriad other big games .
According to Moores , Tony Sr. and Alicia were nervous flyers , whereas Little T always enjoyed the small , sleek Leer jet .
On many of the trips , Little T would bond with Moores ' daughter , Jennifer , and all of them became trustworthy friends .
" I do n't know if it 's because my dad was who he was , but they just kind of gravitated toward us , '' Little T says of the Moores .
" Their whole family and our whole family , we kind of gravitated toward each other , really . ''
The Moores simply had a soft spot for Big T .
They were ringside for his 3,000th hit in Montreal in 1999 , when Tony singled off a low , diving pitch that seemed unhittable .
They built a ballpark at Tony 's alma mater , San Diego State , on one condition -- it had to be named Tony Gwynn Stadium .
They built Petco Park and made its street address 19 Tony Gwynn Drive .
They built a life - sized Tony Gwynn statue and lit it up at night 365 days a year .
They retired Tony 's jersey No. 19 and presented him with a new Mercedes .
They gave Tony a personal services contract .
They even had their lieutenant , Sandy Alderson , ask Tony if he wanted to interview for the Padres ' managerial job when Bruce Bochy left following the 2006 season .
Tony declined , feeling he needed to manage in the minors first , but he appreciated the gesture , appreciated John Moores .
" Well , it 's difficult to think we ever would 've bought the Padres without Tony being there , '' Moores says .
" Tony Gwynn is truly iconic .
People outside Southern California can't imagine what it 's like .
He can't leave his house without someone telling him how much he meant to them .
He 's like their family . ''
And that 's why Moores has held numerous " Tony Gwynn Days ' ' in San Diego .
But the best Tony Gwynn Day of all , the one people talk about , was the day in 2002 , when the Padres brought back the entire starting lineup from Tony 's first - ever game in 1982 .
All the old - timers marched out onto the field , in uniform , and were sent to their original positions around the diamond , just to shock Tony .
One by one , they were announced .
But wait a minute , who was that kid playing the part of Tony in the outfield ?
Who was out there wearing Tony 's old taco Padre uniform ?
Little T !
The crowd went bonkers .
They loved him , too .
*****
The most intriguing at - bat of 2007 has its roots in a simple handshake .
It was May 25 of last season , and the Brewers came to town with a young , wide - eyed rookie named Anthony Gwynn .
The kid arrived with -- it 's true -- a .350 batting average , and it was clear now he did know how to rake .
Coming home was a thrill for the kid .
And hours before the first game of the series , Little T peered out of the dugout , took a deep breath and looked for you - know - who : Trevor .
Hoffman was where he always is : in the outfield running , stretching , grinding .
Eventually , he and the kid laid eyes on each other , and the exchange was priceless .
" He shook my hand and told me how proud he was of me , to see me up here , told me , ' Congratulations , ' " Little T says .
" I was like , ' Man , I 've officially arrived in the big leagues . '
I was like , ' Man , Trevor just told me how proud he was of me . '
The only person that could 've meant more hearing that from was my dad . ''
That first game , Little T strode to the plate and heard a raucous round of applause , almost unheard of for an opposing player .
" Seriously , he got like a mini standing ovation , '' Big T says .
" They were like , ' That 's Little Tony !
We saw him shagging balls here ! ' "
And in return , Little T turned into the perfect guest :
He kept making outs .
Through the first 26 innings of the series , he was 0 - for - 8 , and had a particularly rough time seeing the ball against Jake Peavy on the night of the third game .
But then Peavy exited with a 3 - 0 lead , and out of the bullpen , to the sounds of AC / DC's " Hells Bells , " came you - know - who again : Hoffman .
On May 27 , 2007 , Tony Gwynn Jr. got a base hit off Trevor Hoffman , but Hoffman got the save .
Icon SMI
Hoffman recorded the first two outs of the ninth , lickety - split , and then up stepped the other you - know - who : Little T .
The kid says he was n't nervous , that he just wanted to scrape out any sort of a hit .
Instead , the tension and the wide eyes belonged to baseball 's all - time saves leader , who admitted later that as soon as he saw Little T at the plate , his heart was in his esophagus .
" It was something unlike I 've ever experienced in the game , '' Hoffman told reporters that night .
" I 'm staring down the barrel , trying not to look at him , and all I could think about was my [ own three ] little guys now , playing in the outfield , and thinking that 's where we started . ''
It was a surreal moment .
With Big T standing with Moores in Moores ' private box , Trevor could only gulp and get on with it .
He threw consecutive fastballs , eschewing his money changeup , and when he fired a third fastball , Little T lined it viciously to the outfield for a single .
" I 'm standing up , shouting , ' Yeah , that 's my boy ! ' "
Big T says .
" But I did it in John 's box , so nobody could see me . ''
Trevor regrouped , got the final out , and everyone went home thrilled .
The Padres had won , and Little T had his hit .
It 'd been harmless .
Absolutely harmless .
A lot of San Diego fans wished Little T belonged to them , and curiously , as the season morphed into summer , there was an interesting phone call between Brewers GM Doug Melvin and Padres GM Kevin Towers .
Milwaukee wanted pitching help , and inquired about set - up man Scott Linebrink , a free - agent - to - be who 'd fallen into a rut .
They asked what it would take to get him , and Towers mentioned the G word : Gwynn .
" The kid 's name came up in conversations , '' Towers admits .
" Doug basically said , ' He 's not untouchable , but it'd be tough for us to move him . ' "
Instead , Melvin gave the Padres three young pitchers for Linebrink , and both teams moved on with their pennant races .
In fact , the two squads were scheduled to meet again the last weekend of the season , in bratwurst land , and maybe , just maybe , that final series would be huge .
Would n't that be something ?
Sure enough , four months passed , and that 's what happened .
The Padres came to Milwaukee for a four - game series , on Sept. 27 , 2007 , with a one - game wild - card lead over the Mets , Phillies and Rockies , while trailing the D - backs by one game in the NL West .
The Brewers , on the other hand , trailed the Cubs by two games in the NL Central .
So they were all must - win games , and Little T found himself immersed in it .
He was a middle - inning replacement in the series opener , going 0 - for - 2 in a 9 - 5 Padres victory .
The following night , Sept. 28 , he lined out hard in the fifth as a pinch hitter -- his average down to .254 -- and watched helplessly in the ninth as Trevor earned the save , eliminating the Brewers .
So that was that .
The Padres ' magic number was one , and the Brewers were no longer relevant .
Little T mingled afterward with his dad , who had broadcast the game on San Diego TV , and he bumped into Moores , his wife Becky and their daughter Jennifer in a stadium corridor .
There were pats on the back and small talk .
And that 's when Little T asked the Padres ' owner for a favor .
A favor that , at the time , seemed awfully , awfully tame :
" Can I have a ride home on your plane after Sunday 's game ? ''
" Of course , '' Moores answered .
" Why not ? ''
*****
The most intriguing at - bat of 2007 arrived like an unexpected baby .
It was a Saturday day game , televised nationally by Fox , and Big T did n't even go .
He had to drive Alicia from Milwaukee to Chicago that morning -- so she could catch a nonstop flight back to San Diego -- and he did n't return to his hotel until the eighth inning .
He flipped on the TV , saw the Padres held a 3 - 2 lead and had no idea if Little T had already pinch hit or not .
The bottom of the ninth began , and out of the San Diego bullpen trotted Trevor .
He 'd recorded 42 - of - 47 saves on the year , and with the Padres just three outs away from the postseason , he had an obvious bounce in his step .
The first batter was Prince Fielder , who earlier in the week had hit his 50th home run , but Fielder could not read Trevor 's changeup , and whiffed .
Next up was Corey Hart , who got behind 1 - 2 .
But he timed another changeup perfectly and ripped a double to left .
By now , Trevor , for whatever reason , was only throwing one pitch : his Bugs Bunny changeup .
A Brewer was now in scoring position , and when manager Ned Yost sent up the slumping Laynce Nix to pinch hit , Big T figured Little T had already batted .
Nix struck out on three straight nasty changes , but then Big T heard a strange roar .
And then heard his own name announced : Gwynn .
Everyone in San Diego stopped breathing .
Little T was facing Trevor with two outs and a runner on second .
Fox cameras flashed a shot of John , Becky and Jennifer Moores , and they looked stunned .
Fox flashed a shot of Padres fans watching on a Jumbotron at 19 Tony Gwynn Drive , and they looked stunned .
Trevor looked stunned .
And guess what else : Little T looked stunned .
" It freaked me out , '' Little T says .
" I had gone through it all in the on - deck circle .
I was just thinking , ' Man , I have a chance to ruin their season right now .
And in the back of my mind , I 'm thinking , ' Man , that 'd be great , but I 've got to go home to that city , too . '''
Little T stepped into the batter 's box , but then rushed right back out .
" I was like , ' Hold up , I ca n't hit like this , ' " he says .
" I was like , ' Let me stop , regroup . '
I stepped back in , and the next thing that went across my mind was , ' Man , I 've seen Trevor trick people so many times after throwing so many changeups .
He 'll suddenly throw three fastballs right by you . '
So I did not want that to be me .
I was not going to get beat by a fastball , that 's all I knew . ''

He had a perspective no other Brewer had , and maybe no other baseball player had .
He 'd lived and breathed Trevor Hoffman for 14 years .
He 'd caught footballs from the man .
He knew his mind - set , his delivery , his routine , his pattern , his thought process , his wife , his kids , his cars .
Trevor had basically taught him how to hit him .
The first pitch came , and Little T sat on a fastball , hoping he could stay back if it was a changeup .
And it was a changeup , inside , for Ball 1 .
He was thankful he'd seen it clearly out of Trevor 's hand , so he felt confident enough to think fastball first again .
The next pitch , another changeup , dipped late , and Little T could n't check his swing .
Strike 1 .
The third pitch was another change that traveled only 59 feet , and Little T did hold back this time .
The count : 2 - 1 .
He continued to think fastball first , even though -- according to his calculations -- Trevor had now thrown 10 straight changeups .
Soon , the fourth pitch was on its way -- another changeup -- and this time Little T did n't have a chance .
Swung right through it .
" I thought I had waited on it forever !'' he says .
" And I was still out in front of it by two feet .
I 'm like , ' OK , it 's 2 and 2 , there 's a good chance he 's going to throw that again , but you can't get beat by the fastball .
Do n't go back to this dugout with a strikeout , because you got beat by a heater . ''
And then , for the 12th straight time , Trevor launched another changeup .
It was a diving , unhittable pitch , about ankle high .
Go back and watch Big T's 3,000th hit in Montreal , and it was almost the same low , leave - it - alone anvil .
But just like Big T , Little T took a whack at it -- and slammed it into the right - field corner
We take you to Big T's hotel room , where there was a loud , sudden thud .
" That was me , jumping out of my chair , '' Big T says .
" I was yelling .
I know everybody on that floor must 've heard me , because I was like , ' Yeah !
Yeah !
Nobody thought he could get a hit .
Yeah !'
I called Alicia 's cell and left her a message : ' Ahhhhhhhhhhhh !
Your son tied the gaaaaaaame !
He tied the gaaaaaaame ! '
When she got off the plane and got my message , she said , ' I 've never heard you that excited . '
And I said , ' Well , he stood in there , and busted them up . ' "
We take you to John Moores , sitting in the stands at Miller Park .
He acts as if he is going to slam his hands down , but instead he reaches for his head , as if he 's afraid it might burst .
We take you to his wife , Becky , who looks at John and says : " Oh [ expletive ] . ''
We take you to Trevor , who is absolutely unreadable .
We take you to Little T , who slides head - first into third base for a triple , sending the game into extra innings .
He pumps his fist .
It is the hit of his life , and two innings later , the Brewers go ahead and win it 4 - 3 .
We take you to the Padres ' clubhouse , where John Moores finds Hoffman in a corner , weeping .
" He was devastated , and I went over and told him , ' You 're the greatest pitcher we 've ever had , ' " Moores says .
" And he was pretty emotional about that .
He wanted to win that game more than anybody .
He was bawling .
He was n't just crying ; he was bawling .
It was probably the most upset I 've seen somebody in a baseball clubhouse .
Usually , you see someone that emotional after a game , you think it 's someone you can't depend on .
But obviously , we can depend on Trevor .
I love the guy . ''
We take you to a phone call from Jennifer Moores to Big T later that night .
" Tell Anthony he 's walking back to San Diego , '' she said .
" Sorry . ''
*****
The most intriguing at - bat of 2007 started a freefall .
The next day , Sept. 30 , the Padres -- whose magic number was still one -- took a 3 - 0 first - inning lead and then frittered it away .
Manager Bud Black chose not to start ace Jake Peavy on short rest , and the pitching staff got blistered , 11 - 6 .
Big T did the broadcast for San Diego TV , and Little T's hit was the elephant in the room all day .
Big T -- Mr. Padre himself -- only talked about it early in the telecast , saying he obviously was rooting for his own flesh and blood , but that the Padres had chances to win it after the triple .
" Last I checked , it only tied the game , '' he would say later .
Clearly , the team was reeling , and next up was a one - game , winner - take - all wild - card playoff in Colorado .
As planned , the Moores were flying first back to San Diego , and they waited awkwardly for Little T , who was slow getting dressed after Sunday 's game .
You can imagine the thoughts going through the Moores ' heads .
" I 'm confident that we talked about leaving Anthony behind at the ballpark , '' Moores says , laughing .
" Which would 've been a lot of fun . ''
He can chuckle about it now -- or , at least , sometimes he can -- but the limo ride over to the airport that Sunday was almost macabre .
" Well , I wanted to be on that flight , because my wife was having a baby pretty soon , like within the week , '' Little T says .
" I wanted to get home .
After Saturday 's game , the Moores told me I could n't come , and even though they were just joking , they wore me out in the ride to the airport .
They were just on me about getting a hit .
They wanted me to strike out .
He was like , ' You know what , we 're happy for you , we 're happy you got the hit , but we'd have rather you grounded out , struck out , flew out , anything but get a hit in that situation . '
" Yeah , they were joking .
Yeah , they were busting my chops .
But I think John was more serious than anybody else .
And I can completely understand where he was coming from .
Honestly , there was a part of me that felt guilty .
And I can't explain why I felt guilty , but there was a part of me that did .
And trust me , I was pulling for them to win that playoff game . ''
On the flight , Little T was joined by Alderson and special assistant Paul DePodesta , and he tried sneaking his way past all of them to the rear of the jet .
From time to time , they 'd razz him , and Moores , in particular , told him , " You had an unfair advantage -- you 've been scouting Trevor for 15 years . ''
Overall , the mood was somber , and so , at one point , Little T felt compelled to blurt out : " I really feel bad about this . ''
Everyone lost it .
" We all just started dying laughing , '' Moores says .
" It was utterly absurd .
He 'll be proud of that hit ' til the day he dies , and he should be .
Utterly absurd . ''
And with that , Little T did the only thing he could :
He fell asleep for the rest of the flight .
*****
The most intriguing at - bat of 2007 has traveled West .
On the morning of Oct. 1 , the day of the Padres ' one - game playoff in Denver , a UPS delivery man dropped off a package at Little T's house and wagged a finger .
" Ah , why did you have to do it to us , Tony ? '' the UPS guy said .
That night 's game only exacerbated matters .
Trevor blew a two - run lead in the 13th inning , and the Padres were officially done .
Moores says he again found Hoffman sobbing in the clubhouse , but sensed Trevor " had been more emotional that previous time in Milwaukee . ''
Being one strike away .
Throwing a good , sinking pitch .
Having the child of one of your former teammates crush it .
All of that was too much to take .
And in the nearly five months that have passed , it lingers for all of them
We take you to Moores , who has daily moments of being catatonic -- because he still feels his pitching - rich Padres could 've reached the World Series .
" I 'm getting to the point I can get through a couple hours a day without thinking about it , '' he says .
" And I 'm hopeful in about a year , I can make it a whole day .
But right now I 'm only in my fifth month of recovery .
I mean , of all people , Anthony Gwynn ?
Not possible .''
We take you to Big T , who is stuck as the middle man .
He arrived in Colorado in October 2007 to broadcast the Rockies - Phillies playoff series for TNT , and the first person he saw , Todd Helton , told him to thank Little T .
" You 'll get a standing O in Colorado next year , '' Big T told his son later .
" They 're gonna build you a statue . ''
We take you to Trevor , who has spent this winter in relative hiding .
When approached for interviews in the offseason , he bit his lip and hoped to avoid the subject of his two catastrophes .
But he 's also a stand - up guy , and he told the San Diego Union - Tribune , " Any human would dwell on something like that .
It was a pretty magnified incident on a big stage .
The outcome is what it is .
And not once , but twice .
" It still hurts .
I know what happened .
I 've played it over in my mind .
I 've seen the video , although I do n't have it on file .
It serves no real purpose to watch it anymore . ''
He also had surgery this winter at age 40 to clean up his elbow , but people around town are more concerned about his head .
They wonder :
Will he ever recover ?
Is he done ?
" Oh , he 'll save 40 or 50 games this year , '' Moores says .
And lastly , we take you to Little T , who has spent the offseason absolutely beaming .
Not long after the year concluded , the Brewers ' video director sent him a DVD of his season highlights and entitled it : " Milwaukee Brewer 2007 Hitting , Bunting , Fielding , Stealing and Padre Killing . ''
The kid just could n't live the triple down .
He 'd go out in San Diego , and people would seriously ask him , " Why did n't you strike out against Hoffman ?
Why did n't you make an out on purpose ? ''
But all it 's done is fuel him .
He has lifted and run and hit and grinded all winter -- the way Trevor taught him to -- and he 's determined to start in Milwaukee 's outfield this season , even though the Brewers have signed Mike Cameron -- an ex-Padre , of all people .
Little T says he watched the tape of his Trevor at - bat every day for " a good two months ' ' -- his favorite part being Becky Moores ' " Oh [ expletive ] ! '' -- and he will now try to carry it over into 2008 , 2009 , 2010 and beyond .
But there 's just one small thing he 's worried about :
He has to play a game this coming season at 19 Tony Gwynn Drive .
The fans may viciously boo him .
Or the Padres may not pitch to him .
Or , if they 're smart , they 'll trade for him .
The most intriguing at - bat of 2007 is to be continued .

NPD Group released recently a report for the best - selling games in March in the United States .
Overall , it seems that Ghost Recon : Wildlands , by Ubisoft , was the game best sold from February 26 to April 1 .
Horizon : Zero Dawn was released on February 28 , and got a fourth place in the top , just below Mass Effect : Andromeda , which occupied third place , and The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild , number 2 .
So Which Are the Most Popular Games ?
As such , the first 10 best - selling games were :
Ghost Recon : Wildlands ;
Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild ;
Mass Effect : Andromeda ;
Horizon : Zero Dawn ;
MLB The Show 17 ;
GTA V ;
For Honor ;
NBA 2k17 ;
Nier : Automata ;
Call of Duty : Infinite Warfare .
Console Tops
The company made also some tops for the best - selling console games on the market .
For PS4 , we also find Ghost Recon : Wildlandson the first place , followed by Horizon : Zero Dawn , Mass Effect : Andromeda , MLB The Show 17 , Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 and 1.5 Remix , Nier Automata , GTA 5 , NBA 2k17 , For Honor and Call of Duty : Infinite Warfare .
For Xbox
One , the titles are pretty much the same , but in a slightly different order .
We start off with Ghost Recon : Wildlands , Mass Effect : Andromeda and For Honor on the first three spots .
Then we have NBA 2k17 , GTA 5 , Call of Duty : Infinite Warfare , Battlefield 1 , Halo Wars , and we end with Overwatch and Forza Horizon 3 .
Meanwhile , for Nintendo Switch , the company only listed 6 games in the top , namely Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild , 1 - 2 Switch , Super Bomberman R , Just Dance 2017 , The Binding of Isaac : Afterbirth and Skylanders : Imaginators .
However , for this one the team did not include the digital sales , which may also bring some changes to the final top if you were to do the math .

OBAMA'S TRIFECTA : FOREIGN POLICY LINE IS RUN BY TRILATERAL FOUNDER ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI -OBAMA ''S WIFE LINKED TO COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS WASHINGTON DC -- Barack Obama 's top economics adviser is a member of the super - secret Skull & Bones society of Yale University , of which George H.W. Bush , George W. Bush , and John Kerry are also members , reliable sources confirmed tonight .
Goolsbee is widely reported to have told Obama not to back a compulsory freeze on home mortgage foreclosures to help the struggling middle class in the current depression crisis , as demanded by former candidate John Edwards .
Hillary Clinton has advocated a one - year voluntary freeze on foreclosures .
Obama has offered counselors to comfort mortgage victims as they are dispossessed , citing the ' moral hazard ' of protecting the public interest from Wall Street sharks .
By adding the infamous Skull & Bones secret society to his campaign roster , Obama , who bills himself as the candidate of change and hope , has attained a prefect trifecta of oligarchical and financier establishment backing for his attempt to seize the nomination of the Democratic Party for 2008 .
Obama 's main overall image adviser and foreign policy adviser is Zbigniew Brzezinski , the co-founder of David Rockefeller 's Trilateral Commission , and the mastermind of the disastrous Carter administration .
Obama 's wife Michelle is reputed to be closely linked to the Council on Foreign Relations .
Behind the utopian platitudes dished up by the Illinois senator , the face of the Wall Street money elite comes into clearer and clearer focus .
George Will , in an October 2007 Washington Post column saluted Goolsbee 's " nuanced understanding " of traditional Democratic issues like globalization and income inequality ; he " seems to be the sort of fellow -- amiable , empirical , and reasonable -- you would want at the elbow of a Democratic president , if such there must be , " wrote the arch - oligarchical apologist Will .
From Wikipedia : ' Austan D. Goolsbee is an economist and is currently the Robert P. Gwinn Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business .
He is also a Research Fellow at the American Bar Foundation [ 1 ] , Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and a member of the Panel of Economic Advisors to the Congressional Budget Office .
He has been Barack Obama 's economic advisor since Obama 's successful U.S. Senate campaign in Illinois .
He is the lead economic advisor to the 2008 Obama presidential campaign . '

A man obsessed with video games killed his 17 - month - old daughter when she knocked over his Xbox console after a six - hour playing session .
Enraged Tyrone Spellman pummelled Alayiah Turman to death , cracking her skull several times , while her pregnant mother slept in another room .
American Spellman , 27 , who had been playing the game " Ghost Recon " told detectives : " The only reason I snapped ' cause I thought she broke my brother 's $ 600 Xbox and I do n't have any money to pay him back . "
And prosecutor James Berardinelli said the sickening attack was carried out " with a wickedness of disposition , a hardness of heart and extreme indifference " to the impact such a battering would have .
" That little baby 's head cracked like a walnut , " he added .
But Spellman 's defence lawyers told a court in Philadephia that he only confessed to protect the mother , Mia Turman , from becoming a suspect .
But jurors rejected this claim and yesterday convicted him of third - degree murder and child endangerment .
He now faces up to 47 years in prison .
Spellman , also known as Anwar Salahuddin , was arrested in September 2006 after an autopsy indicated that the toddler 's skull had been shattered by blows to the head .
Throughout the trial , defense attorney Bobby Hoof maintained that his client was innocent and tried to cast suspicion on Miss Turman , who had a history of neglecting the child .
Spellman fled the house after the beating , and the mother , Miss Turman , had no reason to go in the bedroom where the baby was found , prosecutors said .
" He ( Spellman ) spent six to seven hours a day in there playing Xbox , " Assistant District Attorney James Berardinelli said .
Spellman , of Philadelphia , confessed to police the next day , but defense lawyer Bobby Hoof noted that his statement came after 24 hours in custody .
An autopsy showed that Alayiah had suffered a broken arm about two weeks before she died - an injury that city social workers did not see on two visits to the house in late August , when they found the baby well .
The city took custody of the couple 's second daughter , born after Alayiah 's death .
Apple calls them “ high - definition movie rentals , ” but to people familiar with Blockbuster Video , Netflix , and HD cable box alternatives , Apple TV 2.0 ’s new ability to download and play back certain 720 p movies is more of a “ video on demand ” service — with certain advantages and limitations .
So how do Apple ’s HD movie downloads compare with DVDs , Blu - Ray Discs , and currently available HD video on demand content ?
We did a direct comparison to help you see the differences .
Updated February 14 , 2008 : Based on reader requests , we have added an additional set of comparison photos to this article , showing how an Apple TV 2.0 “ standard - definition ” movie rental looks alongside the other versions .
We have been awaiting comment from Apple regarding whether or not its standard - definition rentals are truly DVD - quality , as was suggested during the announcement of Apple TV 2.0 in January ; our photographs seem to suggest otherwise .
To help you quickly distinguish between Apple TV ’s HD and SD rentals , we ’ve put new labels on these shots to differentiate them , and made minor text updates to note references to the HD Apple TV video ; in all photos , the SD rental is clearly less detailed than the HD Apple TV version , as well as the DVD .
If you ’ve previously viewed this page , please reload the images to see the updated HD labels on the prior Apple TV images .
The Film and the Equipment
After reviewing all of the options in Apple ’s catalog of 75 high - definition movies , we chose 20th Century Fox ’s Live Free or Die Hard ( known as Die Hard 4.0 overseas ) as a test film .
Unlike the majority of the other films in the library , Live Free or Die Hard was not only available in Blu - Ray Disc and DVD versions , but also could be downloaded as a HD video on demand from our cable provider , Bright House Networks , using a Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8300 HD set top box .
Additionally , the latest Die Hard was one of relatively few live - action movies in Apple ’s collection from 2007 — unlike older films such as Superfly or cartoon content such as The Simpsons Movie , we could rely on the quality of the HD video transfer and different types of action , dialogue , and detailed scenes as fairly representative of other modern films .
For our tests , we bought both discs and rented videos from both Bright House and Apple .
We used a very recent 40 ” Sony Bravia XBR4 television with 1080 p and 120 Hz support for our testing , and set all of our HDMI - connected playback devices to display at their best possible resolutions : the Blu - Ray Disc player was a PlayStation 3 console at 1080 p , the Apple TV was set to its new 1080 p mode , the Scientific Atlanta cable box was set to its maximum of 1080i , and the DVD player was the same PlayStation 3 at 1080 p , set on normal upscaling mode .
Four test screens were picked as representative of the film ’s content , and a Nikon camera was used to shoot each paused screen at 1/80 of a second .
What We Saw
While the Blu - Ray version was the clear winner of the bunch , we were surprised by how well the Apple TV fared in comparison to the other formats we tested .
Its weakest performance was in the straight shot - for - shot resolution test , where we looked at how all four devices displayed a scene with fine details .
Here , the Blu - Ray Disc ’s image could n’t be beat — it is capable of putting out a true 1080 p ( 1920 ×1080 , 2.0 Megapixels , 60 fps ) signal with the right source material , and with Die Hard , it had a clear edge on detail when viewed up close .
By comparison , the cable on - demand HD video displayed at 1080i ( 1920 ×1080 , 2.0 Megapixels , 30 fps ) , which made its output look very similar to the Blu - Ray when paused , and in some cases , better than Apple TV , for which HD videos are capped at 720 p ( 1280×720 , 0.9 Megapixels , 60 fps ) , while DVDs run at 480i ( 720×480 , 0.35 Megapixels , 30 fps ) before upscaling .
Each device was set up to let it make the most of its video signal on the Sony ’s 1080 p display .
You can see the differences below — look to the people to see how finely they ’re rendered by each device .
Yet , other than in still image tests , the resolution numbers did n’t necessarily make one video better than another : compression , motion , color , and aspect ratio were other differentiators .
Four of the versions — Blu-Ray , HD / SD Apple TV , and DVD — presented Live Free or Die Hard in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.40:1 , while the cable version reformatted the film to roughly 16:9 , resulting in an image that better fills your TV but has other issues .
When we actually watched the cable HD video , we noticed that it contained more blurring and artifacts during fast - moving scenes than we saw in either competing HD format , and had the most highly compressed sounding , worst audio of any of the formats we tested .
In other words , the cable box ’s video might hit a peak of 1080i resolution , but what you actually see and hear from second to second will be compressed enough that you do n’t get a better experience than a lower - resolution 720 p Apple TV video .
Smaller letterbox black bars aside , the cable video ’s only positive was color : in person , though the photos might n’t show it , we ’d give a slight edge to the cable version .
All five versions displayed very similar color range , but the cable image looked a little more lively , perhaps because had more of the screen to occupy with colors rather than black .
The Apple TV , Blu - Ray , and DVD colors were all neutral and clean ; no one would complain about their accuracy .
Note that getting the Scientific Atlanta cable box to pause on precisely the same frame as the other devices was a challenge ; the cable box does n’t offer the same precision pause , rewinding , and forwarding controls of the other devices .
What impressed us about the Apple TV HD rental was that the video , despite needing to be sent over the Internet rather than residing comfortably on a DVD or Blu - Ray Disc , exhibited little in the way of motion blur or compression artifacts — it looked as good as could be expected from 720 p , which is to say comfortably better than DVD quality , but shy of the best a Blu - Ray Disc can offer on a top TV .
The Apple TV video also contained a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround audio track , which the HD cable version did not , and its sound did n’t suffer from obvious compression issues like the cable version did .
A motion test revealed the heavier artifacting and blurring present in the HD cable version , which on paper should have looked better than the Apple TV and DVD versions , but did n’t .
The same high - motion scene in its full - frame presentation .
Because of its cleaner motion and audio , we felt that the HD Apple TV experience was better in both overall audio and video quality than the HD cable experience , and for most users , superior to renting a standard DVD as well .
It ’s also worth noting that the Blu - Ray Disc ’s biggest video and audio advantages are real , but will be lost on many HDTV users .
Since the majority of HDTVs sold before 2007 were not capable of displaying true 1080 p output — most were capped at 720 p or 1080 i — the superior video quality of the Blu - Ray versions of movies wo n’t be noticeable on such sets , and the difference between the Apple TV and Blu - Ray versions will be less noticeable .
If you ’re using a TV without the ability to display 1080 p video — especially if you do n’t have a receiver capable of decoding the Blu - Ray Disc ’s DTS - HD signal — an Apple TV rental will be an almost complete substitute for renting the Blu- Ray .
Cost and Convenience
That brings us to the final points : cost and convenience .
Both of the on - demand HD rental services , cable and Apple TV , charged the same $ 4.99 fee to rent Live Free or Die Hard for a 24 - hour viewing period , but the rentals worked differently .
The cable box downloaded the video for immediate viewing — ready to start within 20 - 30 seconds , even if you want to skip around in the video — as many times as you want in a 24 - hour period , disabling it under any conditions after 24 hours .
By comparison , the Apple TV HD rental requires at least 2 - 3 minutes of downloading time before you can start watching , and takes an hour or so to finish downloading , but keeps an unwatched video for 30 days , letting you start and finish watching it as many times as you want over a 24 - hour period .
These are small differences , but Apple TV ’s formula is more convenient if you want to queue a bunch of videos for playback whenever you ’re ready , assuming you have the hard disk space to store them .
Fine details on Bruce Willis ’ face are considerably easier to see on the Blu - Ray version of the video ; Apple TV does well , too .
Netflix and Blockbuster Video have a clear advantage over these services : pricing .
Blockbuster ’s monthly rental packages start at $ 3.99 , and Netflix ’s at $ 4.99 , letting you rent and return a number of movies for the same price as the cable box and Apple TV let you see only one .
Both Blockbuster and Netflix rent both DVDs and high - definition discs , with much larger libraries of both than Apple or your cable box can offer .
Assuming you already have a DVD or high - definition disc player , you need n’t buy special Apple TV hardware or rent an HD cable box .
But with Blockbuster and Netflix , you have to actually return each video after you ’re done , whereas the Apple TV and cable option requires no such effort .
Once you ’ve bought into Apple ’s or your cable company ’s on - demand hardware , returns are n’t an issue .
From where we stand , frequent and quality - sensitive video watchers will find Netflix or Blockbuster to be better month - to - month values for HD video rentals than Apple TV or on - demand cable services , while Apple TV provides an option that ’s in the upper middle of the pack on quality and the best on convenience , so long as you ’re willing to pay the $ 229 - $ 329 cost of entry .
The question is : are you ?
Kombucha is the Western name for sweetened tea or tisane that has been fermented by a macroscopic solid mass of microorganisms called a " kombucha colony , " usually consisting principally of Acetobacter - species and yeast cultures .
It has gained much popular support within many communities , mentioned by talk show hosts and celebrities .
The increase in popularity can be seen by the many commercial brands coming onto the retail market and thousands of web pages about this fermented beverage .
Preparation
In one method , the beverage is made by placing some existing kombucha culture in a jar , usually a 3 liter glass container , then pouring in cold black tea with sugar .
In about 8 - 12 days , the first portion of the beverage is ready ; part of it is removed for consumption , and more tea with sugar is added to fill the jar .
A mature kombucha is several centimeters thick and produces a portion of beverage every day .
As the kombucha slowly grows , from time to time slices are taken off it , which can be used to start new cultures in separate containers .
Another method allows for the bottling and saving of kombucha for later consumption .
As in the previous method , the culture is placed into a large glass jar and the tea is added .
The jar is covered with a coffee filter or paper towel secured with string or rubber bands , and left for seven or eight days .
Part of the kombucha is poured off into glass jars and refrigerated for a few days , while part is kept back to start a new batch .
The refrigeration allows the flavor to deepen , and the natural carbonation to build up .
Each time the kombucha culture goes through the fermentation process , it creates one new " mushroom " layer , or zoogleal mat , which will form atop of the original .
After three or four layers have built up , the tea will become sour and taste somewhat like sour cider .
When the new batch is ready , one may either use the second layer to start another batch , along with the original one for its own batch or it may be thrown away .
Each culture can be used over and over again but most people discard an older one and use the newer to make their next batch of tea .
The average American is carrying close to $ 40,000 of debt .
That debt comes from a variety of sources .
Medical expenses , home loans , school debt …
The list goes on .
While it may seem as though all of that debt is a bad thing , that ’s not necessarily true .
Think about it …
Somebody needed to get surgery and they were able to get a company to loan them the money they needed for the procedure .
Somebody wanted a house that they could n’t pay for and an entity was there to foot the bill .
This “ borrowed money ” typically comes in the form of loans and when you manage loans responsibly , they can be incredible tools for unlocking a great life for yourself .
Below , we answer the question , “ How does a loan work ? ” by outlining 7 things that all borrowers should know before signing their name on a dotted line .
Loans Are for Adults
If you ’re 15 years old and asking , “ How do loans work ? ” our response to you is that you probably do n’t need to know all of the particulars yet because no established lender is likely to give you money .
In almost every case , a base requirement to take out a loan is being over 18 years of age .
While this age requirement may not be the case in all countries , in the United States , you ’d be hard - pressed to find lending programs for minors and that ’s a good thing because there would be a lot of capacity for abuse if pre-adult lending was common practice .
You ’ll Likely Need to Prove Some Sort of Income
Lenders let people borrow money under the assumption that borrowers will eventually pay them back .
If a borrower does n’t pay back their lender , the lender has very little recourse for recouping their losses .
So then , it makes sense that lenders will want to verify that you have enough income to eventually pay down the debt you ’re taking on .
This is why lenders do n’t lend to people that do n’t have jobs .
In order to get a loan , you ’ll need to present bank statements that show direct - deposits from an employer , pay stubs or at very least an offer letter from a new job .
Your Credit May Be Checked
If you do n’t know what a credit score is , it ’s important that you learn before you start applying for personal loans .
That ’s because your credit score is going to make up a large part of your lender ’s decision on whether or not they ’re going to loan you money .
Your credit score is basically a record of how good you ’ve been about managing your debt in the past .
If you ’ve borrowed money before and have never missed a payment , you ’re going to have an excellent credit score and lenders will line up to let you borrow .
If you ’ve been delinquent on payments in the past , your credit score will be bad and it will be hard to find loan products .
If you ’ve never borrowed money before , you wo n’t have a credit score yet which means that you ’ll need to look for loans that are targeted at first - time borrowers .
Loans Are Not Free
People do n’t lend you money out of the kindness of their heart .
They lend you money because they want you to pay them back plus interest .
Interest is a percentage on top of what you borrowed that your lender will expect from you .
For example , if somebody loaned you $ 100.00 at a 10 % interest rate to be paid back by the end of the month , you ’d pay them back their original $ 100.00 ( this is called principal ) plus $ 10.00 in interest .
Loans Save Many People ’s Quality of Life
Loans get a bad rap because a lot of people fall victim to them ( more on that in a moment ) .
The truth is though , loans managed responsibly are a beautiful thing .
If it was always your dream to study dance and the school that you want to go to charged $ 50,000 for a 4 - year education , how would you pay for that without a loan ?
Chances are , you could n’t .
Loans enable us to do wonderful things that we ordinarily could n’t and they also save us when we ’re caught off guard by emergency expenses .
Loans Can Ruin People ’s Lives
As we mentioned previously , loans are n’t free .
If you borrow amounts of money that you ca n’t responsibly pay back and take out loans with ultra - high interest rates , you ’ll eventually fall behind on payments and find yourself unable to pay .
That will lead to bankruptcy which will ruin your credit score and disable you from doing things like taking out money or even renting a nice apartment later on down the line .
Not All Lenders Are Created Equal
Now that you have most of the how does a loan work question answered , you might be tempted to run out and get one .
Before you do , understand that different lenders offer similar loan products that carry vastly different terms , interest rates and fees .
Getting a loan from Bonsai Finance is n’t the same as getting a loan from Dale ’s Discount Loan Emporium .
Bottom line – Read over your loan ’s conditions carefully .
Vet your lender .
The more you know , the safer you ’re going to be as a borrower .
Wrapping Up How Does a Loan Work
Congratulations !
At this point , you should be able to confidently answer your loan questions and are a much better borrower thanks to that education .
If you feel that a loan is a good option for you , shop around and find once that suits your lifestyle .

Ars was at FOSSCamp this weekend .
Think of FOSSCamp as an " un-conference " without a set agenda where the minds behind open source projects get together and plot world domination ( and , err , ways to improve their code ) .
One fascinating session ( and one that shows how FOSSCamp works and why it 's so productive ) was given by Mirco Müller , who discussed using OpenGL in GTK applications .
Müller — the developer behind Cairo - Clock and the LowFat image viewer — talked about the state of OpenGL support in desktop applications and described various techniques that developers can use to make OpenGL content integrate better with conventional GTK user interfaces .
At the start of the session , Müller explained the reasons why developers might want to use OpenGL in GTK applications .
Although Compiz offers some significant aesthetic improvements for desktop environments , it does n't do much to improve the visual appearance of application user interfaces .
In order to expand the potential for bling in open source software , developers will have to incorporate hardware - accelerated 3D rendering into the underlying widget toolkits .
Developers in the GTK community have been reluctant to take such drastic steps because of the complexity involved and concerns about the detrimental impact of the unwanted API breakage that would likely result .
" Core GTK people have n't decided how they want to approach OpenGL integration yet , " said Müller during the session .
" It 's still in the experimental phase . "
Even though conventional Linux GUI toolkits have n't bought into bling just yet , application developers can take the first steps on their own by embedding OpenGL drawing areas in their programs .
GTK application developers can use the GTK / GLExt bindings , which are very effective despite not yet being an official part of GTK .
The GTK / GLExt bindings enable developers to incorporate interactive OpenGL drawing areas in GTK programs in a manner that is fully compatible with the conventional GTK event loop .
Unfortunately , developers find it difficult to make OpenGL elements look natural in conventional GTK applications .
Müller points out that developers who are using OpenGL in GTK applications tend to smack a rectangular drawing area into a form surrounded by GTK widgets — an approach that significantly detracts from the fluidity of the user interface .
Müller encourages programmers to think about ways to make OpenGL more natural and seamless in GTK programs .
He suggests , for instance , using the color data from the user 's current GTK theme when rendering OpenGL elements , particularly backgrounds .
He also explained how to apply gradients to the edges of an OpenGL rendering area to make it blend more gracefully with the rest of the user interface .
In addition to providing insight into various techniques for effective OpenGL programming , Müller also discusses various emerging GNOME technologies that provide increasingly - useful support for creating rich user interfaces .
In particular , he discusses hardware - accelerated canvas libraries like Clutter and Pigment , which he describes as " playgrounds " for testing next generation rendering technologies .
Although Müller regards Clutter and Pigment as an important step towards the kind of user interface improvements he ultimately envisions , he is convinced that a more holistic approach is necessary .
It 's wrong to think just about the programming libraries , says Müller .
He believes that it is also important to think about the people writing the applications .
He elaborates by citing areas where he thinks that the developer community could be better served .
He wants to see development tools for integrated GL development that are as easy to use as the Glade user interface design tool .
Inspired by the success of the Tango project , Müller also sees a very clear need for uniform standards and guidelines that describe best practices for OpenGL integration and specify which animation effects to use in various contexts .
The session provoked much discussion .
After Müller finished describing some of the important technologies that are presently being adopted by application developers to build visually rich interfaces , Mark Shuttleworth expressed some interest in finding ways to unify these disparate projects .
" There is very cool stuff happening in different places [ but ] it seems very fragmented , " said Shuttleworth , referring to the open source projects mentioned by Müller .
Shuttleworth believes that aesthetic improvements in desktop Linux applications would " kick serious ass " if there was a way to " get people excited about it as a vision . "
He then asked the session participants if there is a way to " get better alignment between the different groups that are doing cool stuff in this area . "
Several attendees provided recommendations in response to Shuttleworth 's question .
Ubuntu community manager Jono Bacon suggested that the situation could be improved if the various libraries and technologies were more accessible to developers .
In particular , he suggests " work[ing ] closely to make sure those pieces are there , and present in a distro . "
Another possibility that was discussed at length is the potential for events that bring together contributors from different parts of the stack so that they can find solutions collaboratively .
Such events would include developers involved with Xorg , GTK , Compiz , OpenGL , and other relevant projects .
This suggestion was enthusiastically supported by Compiz contributor Robert Carr , who commented that people know what they need to do to improve their own parts of the stack , but do n't know what they need to do to improve integration of those parts .
One of the highlights of Müller 's presentation was a technical demo .
Müller created a program that displays live video captured from a webcam as a texture on an OpenGL surface .
The video plays seamlessly as the surface is moved and turned .
Although Müller had little time to prepare , the session was very productive and informative .
Much like open source programming projects , the session itself started out as the presentation of a single individual and transformed rapidly into an active , participatory dialog that sparked new ideas .
Sessions like this illustrate thge unique value of events like FOSSCamp ; stay tuned for more FOSSCamp and Ubuntu Developer Summit coverage from Ars over the next few days .

Consumers Can Sue Debt Collector , Federal Court Rules
Public Citizen Wins California Consumer Case on Appeal
WASHINGTON , D.C. –
In a win for consumers , a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that a private California debt collector can be sued for its overly aggressive tactics , even though the company is working on the behalf of local prosecutors .
The company , American Corrective Counseling Services Inc. ( ACCS ) , is a so - called “ check diversion ” company , meaning that it uses its contract with local prosecutors to send out letters on official stationary threatening consumers who have written bad checks with criminal prosecution or jail unless they pay collection fees .
The company then gives the prosecutors a share of its revenues .
In the suit , Del Campo v. ACCS , California consumers represented by Public Citizen claim that ACCS ’s threats of prosecution violated their rights under state and federal consumer protection laws .
A lower court had ruled in 2006 that the company did not have sovereign immunity – a protection given to branches of state government .
ACCS appealed and the case was argued in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco in September .
In rejecting the company ’s claim of sovereign immunity , the Ninth Circuit characterized sovereign immunity as “ strong medicine ” that should be carefully limited , especially in the case of private corporations that are not accountable to the public .
The court called the argument that a private company could enjoy state sovereign immunity a “ category error , ” like “ inquiring into the gender of a rock or into which day of the week is reptilian . ”
ACCS has insisted throughout the litigation that it is not a debt collector and is therefore not covered by federal law protecting consumers from abusive collection practices .
But in its ruling , the court described ACCS ’s practices as “ debt collection rather than law enforcement . ”
“ In an era of increasing privatization of public functions – from private prisons to Blackwater in Iraq – this decision is an important reminder that private contractors will be held accountable by the courts , ” said Deepak Gupta , the Public Citizen attorney who argued the case on appeal .
“ They ca n’t simply hide behind the cloak of government authority . ”
Public Citizen ’s lawyers are joined in the case by attorney Paul Arons of Friday Harbor , Wash .
The case will now go back to the district level so the court can decide the merits of the suit .

“ We are measuring the effects of the change we made yesterday , and if we think more needs to be done to improve the user experience for deleting an account , we ’ll test different implementations and measure them accordingly , ” she added .
The updated Facebook help page now includes the question “ How do I delete my account ? ”
The answer : “ If you do not think you will use Facebook again and would like your account deleted , we can take care of this for you .
Keep in mind that you will not be able to reactivate your account or retrieve any of the content or information you have added . ”
The entry then says , “ If you would like your account deleted , please contact us using the form at the bottom of the page and confirm your request in the text box . ”
Ms. Geminder said that Facebook ’s policies were a reflection of the fact that many people came back to Facebook after they stopped using the site for a time .
“ On any given day , the number of users reactivating their accounts is roughly half of the number of users deactivating their accounts , ” she said .
As The New York Times reported on Monday , some Facebook users who wished to close their accounts had been unable to do so , even after contacting Facebook ’s customer service representatives .
Many departing users , who could spend weeks or months trying to erase their accounts without success , turned to unofficial guides like the Facebook users group “ How to permanently delete your Facebook account . ”
This weekend I finally registered project quagmire with Google ’s code hosting service .
I ’ve checked in all my initial .mk files , plus a little bit of documentation .
I ’m a little nervous about posting this …
Quagmire is still very immature , and I do n’t want expectations set too high .
There is still a lot to do !
But , the good news is , you can easily help set the direction .
I suppose I will set up a Google group for Quagmire eventually .
What do you think ?
Meanwhile , edit the Quagmire wiki with your questions , comments , and ideas .

I 'm tellin ya dudes , someone better check those provisionals and see if they were counted , if not , check if someone / thing else voted under those peoples names and who was voted for vs the provisional .

First , I just got back from volunteering with the counting of provisional ballots in NM .
The Dem party is centralizing everything in Albuquerque , and I was with Brian Colon ( Dem State Chair ) and Maggie Oliver and staff ( Bernalillo County Clerk assisting as volunteers ) and a host of other Democratic volunteers .
We have been compiling the qualification lists for provisional ballots - it's not complete yet , but should be done by early AM tomorrow , and my understanding is at that point the actual counting of ballots can begin .
Here also is my understanding as to why there were not enough provisional ballots in some locations : in 2004 , there were 105,000 caucus voters , and many of those ( I do n't know the % ) voted absentee .
This time around , there were over 140,000 caucus voters and the percentage of absentee voters was significantly less .
Thus , the long lines at polling places , not that that excuses the fact that in some places there were simply too few polling places ( such as Rio Rancho , where there was only one for the entire city . )
Brian Colon is a good guy , and his efforts as the new chair of the state party were part of the reason that voter turnout was so high .
I do n't blame this on him , especially not with the efforts that are being made right now to correct the problem .
Yes , it is going to take a few days before those provisional ballots are counted , but having seen firsthand the lengths that the state party is going to to make sure than every ballot that exists is qualified and counted accurately , I think it is worth the wait .
It is a very intense process , and being that things did not go as well as they could have on Tuesday , the state party leadership must be given credit for doing everything possible to correct the situation .
Unfortunately the media do not have a lot of patience , which is a huge part of the problem with our elections to begin with .
If we get to a point where it seems like ballots were not counted correctly in this provisional process , then there 's going to be cause for serious complaint .
I do n't think that 's going to be the case , and believe me that the Mr. Colon and the other state party officials are not going to let this happen again .
And furthermore , if there have been some fuckups ( I mean incidences , not people ... except in Rio Arriba County ) then I 'm glad they are being identified and corrected NOW and not in the general election in November .
ES&S , however , HAS to go .
I 'd lay money that their voter rolls were wrong , and it is too true that ES&S has an unholy relationship with this state .
Mary Herrera 's personal comment to me , was that the previous SoS , Rebecca Vigil - Giron ( who , incidentally is joining the NM CD - 1 preprimary race ) was responsible for signing on with ES&S ( at least for the M100 optical scanners , I do n't know about overseeing voter rolls ) and that she ( Herrera ) is now stuck with cleaning up that mess .
Christ , cut the cord already , even if it means the state loses money .
Better to have a secure and accurate voting process .
I 've been trying to get to the bottom of the ES&S relationship for months , and to no avail ... but I do know from inside sources that there was campaign money involved .
Would n't ya know ?

The FBI Deputizes Business
By Matthew Rothschild , February 7 , 2008
Today , more than 23,000 representatives of private industry are working quietly with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security .
The members of this rapidly growing group , called InfraGard , receive secret warnings of terrorist threats before the public does — and , at least on one occasion , before elected officials .
In return , they provide information to the government , which alarms the ACLU .
But there may be more to it than that .
One business executive , who showed me his InfraGard card , told me they have permission to " shoot to kill " in the event of martial law . "

Interesting that Arizona is one of the states listed using privatized voter rolls .
That 's a new swing state and I bet will be the new Ohio in 2008 .
I really do n't want to see a repeat of history , but brace yourselves for " less jobs , more wars " .

Privatization is just another word for incompetence when eVoting Vendors are involved .
Will they ever live down the fact that it was the " you 're doin ' a heckuva job " presidency regime that brought republican owned eVoting machines to infamy ?
A decade of infamy .

Soul Rebel , thank you so much for your efforts on the ground in NM !
VERY interesting report .
As for ES&S , I 've been following our S.O.S. KATHY DENT 's strange and symbiotic relationship with them for over a year and a half / very wonky / they 've strong - armed us at every turn re : FOUR so called " independent " tests / attempted ( successfully ) to obtain copies of our election definition files / dubious CONTRACT pushed on Canvassing Board during our recount ( nothing to recount down here , by the way from iVotronics , just rolls of poll tape ; no ballots to count , so we did n't count them TWICE ) / their creepy lawyers slithering around the court - room with their misinformation and outright lies ...
Hell , this is the sort of stuff Joseph Heller would have a field day with !
Here 's an interesting , brief 10 minute video of their antics that you might find informative as background re : CONTRACT with S.O.E. DENT ( and husband ) ...
http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=PFEgYIHsM8w
" KATHY DENT DENIES TIES ( TO ES&S ) / REVISED WITH NEW LIES " ... and this particular creepy video was taken at THE TALLAHASSEE HEARINGS in the JENNINGS / VOTERS OF SARASOTA vs ES&S case in December of ' 06 : http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=bXcyzVtMGD4
" ES&S OPENING MISTATEMENTS "
My partner , Leonard Schmiege , asks ES&S Lawyer MIGUEL DeGRANDY about secret vote counts / gets a hell of a freaky response .
( Many digital stills in this clip , as we were not allowed to film in JUDGE WILLIAM L. GARY 's courtroom , despite filling out all the proper paperwork ... but we had our audio rolling / came home and cobbled this one together from so much disgust . )
We have every reason to believe money and favors have been exchanged between ES&S and our elected officials .
More than enough to go on , just can't get anyone to investigate , even harder to get someone to PROSECUTE .
Keep us upped / following this very closely .
We gotta get these tools ...

Need I point this out : the Republican agenda has always been to corporatize ( do n't use the word ( " privatize " ) the public arena , thereby taking power off the public and giving it to corporations ( or " privatizing " as Republicans put it ) .
Bush / Republicans have always wanted to CORPORATIZE social security so the big , bad nasty government ( THEM ? ) wo n't " ruin " it on you !
Expect a last - ditch effort by the outgoing Bush / Kristol / Cheney administration to begin by planting stories that " social security is in trouble " ... AGAIN ... like they did before , which was the first thing they failed at tricking us into believing ( see " Iraq War " , 9/11 , etc...etc...etc ... ) .
The first chink in the armor was " the people " rallying around NOT falling for the Bush / Kristol / Cheney LIES about social security being in trouble .
" Do n't touch our social security ! " is what everyone said at the time .
They CORPORATIZED the war with Blackwater , how'd that turn out ?
The list goes on an on of things the Republicans have and have always wanted to CORPORATIZE .
How about CORPORATIZING democracy with e-vote machines ?
Oh , yes !
" Privatizing " is the anser for everything ... TO TAKE POWER FROM THE PUBLIC AND GIVE IT TO CORPORATIONS ! ( " privatization " )

re : NM
The real problem is that Mary Herrera is dumb as a rock and she has hired the political hack and totally slimey Daniel Ivey - Soto as head of elections .
He will do what he can to get a buck , and kickbacks are what he has been waiting for .
He was a failed attorney who was a pet of the former head of the Bernallo County Dem Party .
People need to be demanding his head or there will be more fuck ups down the line .
If he can be moved out then a decent person can be put in .
This has not been Colon 's fault but he has taken full responsibility .
The county chairs had the responsibility for getting and setting up polling places so the Rio Rancho one polling place mess was because of that county chair .
But Colon said
It 's my responsibility and it wo n't happen again .
I reckon that county chair should appreciate that as it has saved him a battering .
Then , this early and very expensive caucus was set on the insistance of our fat Gov who wanted to have it for his ' string of victories ' he had planned .
When he flamed out he just ignored it and DID NOT HELP WITH FINANCING IT .
The Party did n't have funds --- and did n't even know NM would be in play till His Highness dropped out .
The big 2 were staying away as a courtesy to Richardson ( and maybe cause they knew how nasty he can be he he thinks someone has thwarted him ) .
Colon is a breath of fresh air after the sludge that was running the party before , strictly on Big Bill 's behalf , John Werthheim .
Give Brian a chance .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A record number of Americans say that most members of Congress do not deserve to be re-elected , according to new CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll .
Next year could be rocky for incumbents as a new poll shows dissatisfaction with Congress .
Democrats fared better than Republicans , according to the poll released Friday .
If the elections for Congress were held today , Democratic candidates would get 53 percent of the vote and Republicans would get 42 percent , according to the results .
Party affiliation aside , 2008 could be a rocky year for incumbents .
While overshadowed now by the race for the White House , the battle for control of Congress will heat up next year .
Fifty - three percent of those surveyed said that most members of Congress do not deserve re-election -- the highest figure since the question was first asked in 1991 .
Except for one downturn in October 2004 , those numbers have been rising since April 2002 .
Americans think more highly of the lawmaker representing them , but 39 percent say their own member of Congress does not deserve re-election .
That view is also a record high since polling began on that question in 1991 .
See the results »
Broken down by party , GOP lawmakers received less support for re-election from the public than Democrats .
" The public seems to be concentrating its wrath on the GOP .
Only 38 percent believe that most Republican members of Congress deserve re-election .
But 50 percent say that most Democrats in Congress deserve to be re-elected , " said Keating Holland , CNN 's polling director .
Last year voters gave the Democrats control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1994 .
But their lead is tenuous .
The Senate is split 49 - 49 between Democrats and Republicans .
But thanks to the support of two independent senators who ally themselves with Democrats , the party holds a razor thin 51 - 49 advantage in the Senate .
In the House of Representatives , the lead is slightly larger , with the Democrats holding a 30 - seat margin .
The CNN / Opinion Research telephone poll of 1,024 American adults was carried out November 2 through Sunday .
The sampling error for the full sample was plus or minus 3 percentage points ; some questions were asked of a half sample of about 500 respondents .
That sample carries a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .

All About U.S. Congress
EVERY four years , Washington moans about the way the national political parties select their presidential nominees .
But the grumbling about the 2008 contest has struck an unusual note .
Instead of complaining about a process that is too short , some now mutter that the process is too drawn out .
Instead of being too predictable , the campaign is too confusing and uncertain : no one has any idea what will happen next .
Is this any way to pick a president ?
Actually , yes : the Democrats in particular appear to have stumbled  partly by design and partly by chance  into a primary calendar that fixes many of the problems with the way the party has chosen its presidential candidates in the past .
Sure , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have run extraordinary campaigns .
But the framework of the calendar has enriched the competition between them .
Here ’s how we got here .
In 2000 and 2004 , the votes of white men and women in two relatively small states determined the Democratic presidential nominee .
The party ’s financiers do not live in Iowa or New Hampshire .
Democratic interest groups felt as if their votes and generous donations were being taken for granted .
So in 2004 , the chairman of the party , Terry McAuliffe , appointed a calendar commission to serve his successor , Howard Dean .
The movie " Jumper , " opening today , has a hero with the extraordinary power to teleport anywhere on Earth by imagining the place he wants to go .
As fantastic as teleportation seems , it can actually happen in the real world .
" The fact is that physicists have teleported things over miles , " said Edward Farhi , the director of MIT 's Center for Theoretical Physics .
" It does n't violate the laws of physics . "
There 's a huge — or rather , very tiny — caveat , however .
For now , it only works with a single photon .
Quantum teleportation
When scientists talk about teleportation , they do n't typically mean teleporting matter from one place to another as in the new movie .
Rather , teleportation involves capturing the essential information about something — its " quantum state " — to recreate it exactly someplace else .
Teleporting , say , an electron would first involve " entangling " a pair of electrons .
After the particles are made to interact a certain manner , whatever one does influences the other , regardless of the distance between them — a bit of quantum physics that Einstein called " spooky action at a distance . "
Next , one electron — the one you want teleported — would stay wherever you like while you would physically bring the other electron to whatever destination you wish .
Then you have to measure the quantum state of the electron you want teleported and send that in a signal to your destination , where it can be used on the other electron to recreate the first one .
Voila — quantum teleportation .
So far scientists have teleported single photons — a packet of light — across miles .
But that 's " a far cry from teleporting a person , " Farhi said .
To begin with , measuring the quantum state of an object essentially destroys it .
Ouch .
Next , your average person is made of more than 10 ^ 27 atoms — a 1 with 27 zeroes behind it — and each atom is made of subatomic particles such as protons , neutrons and electrons .
Measuring the quantum states of all of a person 's particles would likely take a long , long time .
It 's not clear how you would entangle all of a person 's atoms with the mass of particles you want to bring to a destination .
Also , teleporting an object composed of many parts that all interact with each other , such as a person , would be far more complex than teleporting an isolated photon .
" It looks easier just to send whatever object you want to teleport " via conventional means , Farhi said .
Wormholes
In " Jumper , " a person teleports by essentially opening a rift in the fabric of reality .
In reality , passages across space and time — dubbed wormholes — could theoretically exist , and going into one mouth of a wormhole could spit you out another instantaneously .
It 's not as easy as it sounds , though .
" Wormholes seem to be unstable .
If you try to travel through one , it would collapse into a black hole , which kind of sucks , " said MIT physicist Max Tegmark .
It might be possible , however , to stabilize wormholes with dark energy , the enigmatic force driving the accelerating expansion of the universe .
Of course , since dark energy is a mystery , it remains unknown whether there is any way to actually use it .
In addition , " the entrance to a wormhole looks a little bit like a black hole , " Tegmark said .
In other words , there are gravitational forces at hand that can easily tear anything near it apart .
That means if you wished to survive crossing into a wormhole , you would need a very large wormhole , so any forces acting on you would even out across your body .
If not , your toes might get tugged on more strongly than your head , for instance , stretching you into a noodle — a process that scientists call " spaghettification . "
Even if the wormhole had the mass of the sun , it would only be about two miles wide , " and that would still kill you , " Tegmark said .
" You would need something like the monster black hole at the center of our galaxy , " he explained , which is roughly 2.6 million times the mass of the sun .
And if you succeed in creating a wormhole ?
You still need to drag each of its " mouths " or openings to where you want to start and stop .
Only after you do that can you rapidly go back and forth .
Tegmark said he does hope " Jumper " gets people " more psyched about science .
I think a lot of scientists today went into science after they got fired up by science fiction .
It 's good for scientists to watch sci-fi , as it forces you to ask deep questions about the nature of reality .
You do n't want to just find the right answers , but to ask the right questions too , and sci - fi can trigger great questions . "

HONEST Swede Andreas Back travelled 1000 miles to plead guilty to a driving offence in Scotland .
The 26 - year - old spent £ 400 on two flights , two bus trips and a hire car to get him to Fort William Sheriff Court , where he admitted driving without insurance in nearby Corpach last November .
And sheriff Colin MacKay was so impressed , he let Andreas off without so much as a fine .
He said : " This is almost unbelievable .
People from this very town can't turn up for court on time but you managed to do it from north Sweden .
Due to the exceptional circumstances , I will take the unusual course of not fining you .
" Despite the summons to attend the court today , I think if you had phoned from Sweden and explained where you lived you would have been excused a personal appearance . "
The sheriff admonished Andreas and imposed six penalty points .
The exhausted Swede said later : " I set out on my travels at 4 am yesterday .
" I phoned the court but maybe they did not fully comprehend that I would have to come all the way from Sweden - although after working in Scotland for three years my English is quite good .
" It is excellent that the sheriff letme off with no fine . "
Andreas had worked with a Scots chef in Sweden - and when he returned home to Oban , Andreas decided to join him .
He worked in a restaurant , with a builder and latterly at Banavie Quarry , near FortWilliam .
But he returned home last December as his mother was dying from cancer .
Andreas said yesterday : " I did not plan to return to Scotland for another year as my father is taking the death of my mother very badly and I need to be at home to support him .
" My Volvo was off the road for a couple of months here and I was driving it to the garage on the last day of its MOT to renew the MOT when the police stopped me for having cancelled the car 's insurance while it was laid up . "
After receiving his summons , Andreas set off early on Wednesday from his home in the ski resort of Vemdalen , where the snow is currently two metres deep .
He got on a bus for a 130 - mile trip south to Mora .
The journey took three hours .
He then had to catch an internal flight from Dala airport outside Mora to another small airport near the capital Stockholm , 140 miles away .
Andreas then had a 65 - mile bus ride to Skavsta airport - where staff told him he'd have to wait 12 hours for a flight to Prestwick .
The 870 - mile flight took off at 9 pm and took around two hours .
But the Hertz hire desk at Prestwick was closed and Andreas had to sleep in the terminal building until it opened in the morning .
He arrived in court in Fort William by the skin of his teeth after travelling by car for a further three hours and 125 miles .
And having avoided a fine , all Andreas faces now is the 1000 - mile journey home .
I saw this story yesterday on the BBC , which reports on the danger of collapse of bluefin tuna stocks , and did n’t cover it then because I thought it was the sort of thing that would get plenty of media attention .
The fact that the not - terribly - environmentally - minded US is supporting a 3 - 5 year ban on tuna fishing in the North Atlantic says the situation is serious .
I am stunned to see today that when I put “ tuna ” into Google News , I got all of 5 articles on this issue ( BBC , a New York Times editorial , Fish Update , the Telegraph , and the Edmunton Sun ) .
Readers may note that I have never advocated any particular pro-environment course of action , so I hope you will take this request seriously .
As much as I am a sushi-holic ( and tuna is a prized offering ) , I have been avoiding tuna for some time , not so much for the stock collapse issue ( I was unaware of that until recently ) but because it is very high up the food chain .
You consume a lot of ocean food energy when you eat tuna .
And believe me , I am not as virtuous on the environmental front as I ’d like to be , but for the vast majority of people , food is one area where it is relatively easy to implement changes ( and I anticipate it will become more a focus of attention in the next few years ) .
A crude rule of thumb is that every time you go one step up the food chain , you get only 10 % of the calories you ’d get by consuming the next lower item ( note I am not sure how this is measured , whether by weight or portion size .
Carbohydrates and proteins have the same amount of calories per unit weight , but fats have more than two times as many calories per gram as carbs and protein ) .
So say you eat corn -fed beef .
It took ten times the amount of corn to produce that unit weight of beef ( and that may not even allow for waste , like skeleton and hide ) .
Tuna is a top predator .
I recall reading it can be as high as 10 levels up the food chain , and per the chart below , it is routinely 4 - 5 levels up .
So tuna is one of the most environmentally costly foods .
( Anyone who has better factoids on this matter is encouraged to contribute , but directionally , this depiction is accurate , even if the particulars are a bit off ) .
So please , no more tuna !
And ( nicely ) encourage any restaurant you frequent to stop serving it .
From the New York Times , “ The Bluefin Slaughter “ :
The hunting of highly valued animals into oblivion is a symptom of human foolishness that many consign to the unenlightened past , like the 19th century , when bird species were wiped out for feathered hats and bison were decimated for sport .
But the slaughter of the giant bluefin tuna is happening now .
An international conference that ends tomorrow in Turkey could help to rescue the bluefin , a noble , ocean - crossing predator , from the brink of collapse — or seal its doom through empty promises and inaction .
The United States has gone to the meeting urging a ban on bluefin fishing in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean .
The world should heed it .
Think of a giant bluefin as an 800 - pound torpedo of sushi — some of the finest , fattiest , most expensive there is .
Since the 1970s , when the sushi craze took off , purse - seine haulers and longline fishing boats and fish hunters in spotter planes have chased the giant bluefin across the world ’s oceans .
They have been ruthlessly efficient :
The worldwide bluefin population has plunged more than 90 percent in the last 30 years .
There are bluefin tuna “ farms ” — large - scale ranching operations in the Mediterranean , but these are no less destructive than boats on the open seas .
Farms catch their fish in the wild , young and small , exploiting a loophole in rules that set limits by weight .
The tuna are fattened in pens , like foie - gras geese , using vast supplies of smaller fish whose plundering is its own ecological disaster .
Scientists of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas recommended last year that the annual catch in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean be lowered to 15,000 metric tons to let the fish recover .
The commission instead set a quota that was practically twice that : 29,500 tons .
The evidence so far suggests that the actual catch this year will be 40,000 to 50,000 tons , said William Hogarth , director of the National Marine Fisheries Service , who is at the commission ’s meeting in Turkey to plead for the moratorium .
Blame for the crisis is global .
The European Commission has promoted ruinously excessive fishing quotas .
The United States is a major source of sushi demand , and must do much more to protect the bluefin in one of its important spawning grounds , the Gulf of Mexico .
And a huge slab of raw guilt should be placed on Japan , the world ’s most voracious fish consumer , whose appetite for the bluefin has done the most to make it disappear .
And from the BBC :
The crystal structure of a molecule from a primitive fungus has served as a time machine to show researchers more about the evolution of life from the simple to the complex .
By studying the three - dimensional version of the fungus protein bound to an RNA molecule , scientists from Purdue University and the University of Texas at Austin have been able to visualize how life progressed from an early self - replicating molecule that also performed chemical reactions to one in which proteins assumed some of the work .
" Now we can see how RNA progressed to share functions with proteins , " said Alan Lambowitz , director of the University of Texas Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology .
" This was a critical missing step . "

" It 's thought that RNA , or a molecule like it , may have been among the first molecules of life , both carrying genetic code that can be transmitted from generation to generation and folding into structures so these molecules could work inside cells , " said Purdue structural biologist Barbara Golden .
" At some point , RNA evolved and became capable of making proteins .
At that point , proteins started taking over roles that RNA played previously - acting as catalysts and building structures in cells . "
In order to show this and learn more about the evolution from RNA to more complex life forms , Lambowitz and Paul Paukstelis , lead author and a research scientist at the Texas institute , needed to be able to see how the fungus ' protein worked .
That 's where Golden 's team joined the effort and crystallized the molecule at Purdue 's macromolecular crystallization facility .
" Obviously , we can't see the process of moving from RNA to RNA and proteins and then to DNA , without a time machine , " Golden said .
" But by using this fungus protein , we can see this process occurring in modern life . "
Looking at the crystal , the scientists saw two things , Golden said .
One was that this protein uses two completely different molecular surfaces to perform its two roles .
The second is that the protein seems to perform the same job that RNA performed in other simple organisms .
" The crystal structure provides a snapshot of how , during evolution , protein molecules came to assist RNA molecules in their biological functions and ultimately assumed roles previously played by RNA , " Golden said .
A team led by Purdue structural biologist Barbara Golden crystallized a fungus molecule that has allowed researchers to visualize a stage of evolution .
Researchers from Purdue and the University of Texas at Austin collaborated to study the change from a world of RNA to one of RNA and proteins and DNA .

Before the crystallization , Lambowitz , Paukstelis and their research team at The University of Texas at Austin were involved in a long - term project to study the function of the basic cellular workhorse protein and other evolutionary fossils from the fungus .
In earlier work , the scientists studied a different protein that showed how biochemical processes could progress from a world with RNA and protein to DNA .
The protein , as found in the fungus , had adapted to take over some of the RNA molecule 's chemical reaction jobs inside cells .
The protein stabilizes the RNA molecule - called an intron - so that the RNA can cut out non-functional genetic material and splice together the ends of a functional gene , Paukstelis said .
" The RNA molecule in our study is capable of performing a specific chemical reaction on itself , but it requires a protein for this reaction to take place efficiently , " he said .
This basic scientific information eventually could lead to clinical applications .
" This work has potential applications in the development of antifungal drugs to battle potentially deadly pathogens ; that 's one of the next steps , " Lambowitz said .
" Another is to produce more detailed structures so that we can understand the ancient chemical reactions . "
Golden and Lambowitz are senior authors of the study were published in Thursday 's ( Jan. 3 ) issue of the journal Nature .
Golden is a member of the Markey Center for Structural Biology and Purdue Cancer Center .
The Markey Center will be housed in the Hockmeyer Hall of Structural Biology when it 's completed on the West Lafayette campus .
Other researchers involved in this study along with Paukstelis were Jui-Hui Chen , a Purdue biochemistry doctoral student , and Elaine Chase , a Purdue biochemistry research technician .

This episode is an interview with Guy L. Steele Jr.. Guy is a Sun Fellow and heads the Programming Language Research Group within Sun , and a generally well known “ programming language guy ” ( see here for details ) .
We briefly talk about Lisp and the resurgence of dynamic languages before we delve into the main topic , the Fortress programming language he is working on .
Fortress is a language intended to replace Fortran as a scientific computing language .
We talk about how mathematical notations , syntax extensio and built - in support for parallelism are crucial properties of such a language .
We then briefly talk about potentials for compiler optimization before taking a closer look at the type system ( static typing , type inference ) , traits and contract specification as well as first - class support for hierarchical components .
We conclude the discussion with a look at automatic partitioning and distribuion of concurrent algorithms and a brief look at the future roadmap for the Fortress language .

The effects of a decade of fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo is continuing to kill about 45,000 people each month - half of them small children - in the deadliest conflict since the second world war , according to a new survey .
The International Rescue Committee said preventable diseases and starvation aggravated by conflict had claimed 5.4 m lives since the beginning of the second Congo war in 1998 , equivalent to the population of Denmark .
Although the war officially ended in 2002 , malaria , diarrhoea , pneumonia and malnutrition have continued to claim enormous numbers of lives in part because fighting continues in the east of the country .
The study of 14,000 households across Congo between January 2006 and April 2007 found that nearly half of all the deaths were of children under the age of five , who make up only 19 % of the population .
" The majority of deaths have been due to infectious diseases , malnutrition and neonatal - and pregnancy - related conditions , " the survey says .
" Increased rates of disease are likely related to the social and economic disturbances caused by conflict , including disruption of health services , poor food security , deterioration of infrastructure and population displacement .
Children are particularly susceptible to these easily preventable and treatable conditions . "
Congo has endured two foreign invasions and protracted civil war since the aftermath of Rwanda 's genocide spilled across the border in 1994 with an influx of more than a million Rwandan Hutu refugees .
The years of conflict resulted in millions of people fleeing their homes , sometimes to live for years in forests where many died , and the collapse of what infrastructure still remained after decades of neglectful rule under Mobutu Sese Seko .
Those who returned home found water sources , health clinics and farms destroyed .
Marauding bands of armed men were responsible for mass rape , particularly in the east of the country , which made it much more difficult for women to venture into fields to grow food .
" When war destroys a country 's economy and infrastructure , there 's no quick fix , " said Dr. Richard Brennan , one of the survey 's authors .
" Significant improvement in Congo 's health and mortality will require years of unwavering commitment from the government and the international community and substantial financial investment .
Sadly , the humanitarian crisis in Congo continues to be overlooked and funding remains disproportionate to the enormity of need . "
The IRC said that a peace deal in the eastern province of North Kivu , where continued fighting has displaced hundreds of thousands of people in recent months , is also crucial to curbing the rising death toll .
There was hope today that the conflict in the east might finally be drawing to a close after the government and armed groups were reported to be ready to sign a peace agreement .
But the deal apparently did not directly address how to deal with two of the most important armed factions - that of the rebel Tutsi general , Laurent Nkunda , who is wanted for war crimes , and the Rwandan Hutu group that has been a leading cause of instability .
Congo is one of 11 countries where 20 % of children die before the age of five according to a Unicef report released today .
A child born in Sierra Leone has the lowest chance of surviving until the age of five .
The report , the State of the World 's Children , says nearly 9.7 million children under five died worldwide last year from disease or lack of food .
In Sierra Leone , which is still recovering from an 11 - year civil war , the child mortality rate was 270 deaths per 1,000 births .
The average rate in developed countries is six deaths per 1,000 births .
Twenty - eight of the 30 countries with the highest child mortality rates are in sub-Saharan Africa .
But Unicef said there have also been successes on the continent .
Mozambique has seen a 41 % drop in child mortality since 1990 .
CouchDB Catchup
The big trip
So last week I flew to San Jose for some meetings and to give 2 talks about CouchDB .
I unfortunately missed my connection in Las Vegas and had to be booked on a later flight , which meant it was n't until 2:30 am PT that I got to my room .
Which for me , was n't until 5:30 am .
Then when I finally got to bed , I could n't fall asleep .
My sleep cycle had reset and I was wide awake for at least another hour and slept like crap .
But when I woke up , I was so pumping with adrenaline it hardly mattered .
I started the day at IBM's Silicon Valley Labs ( SVL ) , and though it 's technically in Silicon Valley , it 's out in the middle of what looks to be orchards and farms and undeveloped land .
It rained nonstop the whole trip , but the scenery there was still beautiful .
It must look incredible in the spring .
I met in - person for the first time David Fallside , my manager and a very interesting guy .
I learned he'd been involved in a zillion different standards , like XML and SOAP .
And despite my XML - hatin ' , he still digs CouchDB .
My talk was later at Almaden Research Center ( ARC ) , which is set in the middle of a nature preserve in the hills that border San Jose .
And I thought the SVL views were amazing , ARC is one of the most beautiful office facilities I 've ever been too , inside and out .
I 'm told it was built in the 80's when IBM was crazy rich .
The talk was well attended , there was a handful of external guests and everyone else was from IBM .
There were lots of DB2 developers and researchers there , and including PHDs , Distinguished Engineers and Fellows .
Cool , except for ... well , lets just say , my first ever CouchDB talk did n't go as well I would have liked .
It makes for a funny story though .
Ask me sometime .
Then I had a meeting with the JAQL and JSON team that went much better ( though I think I was losing coherency towards the end ) .
JAQL is a new JSON query language they are developing and open sourcing , and is currently being integrated with HBase and Hadoop .
The nice thing about JAQL is the ability to do straight forward " joins " , which Couch DB does n't have a simple answer for yet .
They also were working on some really cool inverted indexes for semi-structured data that would allows for some really interesting dynamic queries .
Of everything I saw there , the stuff they showed me got me most excited .
This is a huge benefit to working with the people that I am at IBM , access to some really cool technology and brilliant people .
I 'll be writing some more about this in the future .
The next day I had more meetings , and gave a talk to the DB2 XML guys .
Despite being 30 minutes late ( I was sent to the wrong IBM facility , doh ! ) and having to rush my still unpolished talk and dissin ' XML , they seemed pretty receptive to CouchDB .
And again , in talking with them I saw they had some deep insights into semi-structured data that was very applicable to CouchDB .
These people get it .
One thing many IBMers were very interested in is Erlang , which I discovered I completely suck at explaining .
But people seemed genuinely interested in learning about it .
My advice is just start playing with it .
That 's how I finally " got it " .
IBM Training
I just spent 2 days at the IBM Training for all new permanent hires .
In Armonk .
In January .
So you know I was totally looking forward to it .
Fortunately the hotel and facilities were first rate , and we had a great instructor whose been with the company for 20 years and her enthusiasm was infectious .
So the whole thing was better than I thought it would be , even if a little propagandistic .
But one thing that has always impressed me is IBM really does have a long history as a progressive company and a commitment to diversity and integrity , and they make a big deal about that , that it 's taken seriously and you can be fired for being a shithead .
My previous experiences have shown they do take it seriously and I think its a big part of why it 's still a thriving company after nearly 100 years .
I think that 's pretty cool .
Big Company Blues
Something in my HR records got seriously messed up when I joined , and somehow all our HR stuff , including live paychecks , was getting sent to our previous address from a year ago .
In the IBM system , everything I had access to had the correct address , but when we 'd call for support they'd have our old address .
And we'd ask them to change it , but they said they did n't know how , that we'd have to change it on the web .
The one that had the correct address already .
And it 's not an isolated case , a woman at the IBM Training was experiencing the EXACT same thing .
The address records she had access on the web were correct , but mail was getting sent to a previous address , and support reps could n't help her .
Another guy said his pay and everyone is his new division was wrong by hundreds of dollars .
Anyway my wife spent a ton of time on the phone about this issue and she just now got it fixed today , after 2 weeks of calling up various support people .
We think it 's fixed anyway .
Yay big companies !
To the start - up in the Boston area who needs an Erlang Expert
I have been contacted by exactly 6 different headhunters for this job .
Stop calling .
I know it 's the same job because they all say top salary , working from home , dual 30 " Apple Displays and an Aeron chair , or variation thereof .
It sounds sweet and I 'm flattered , really .
But you really can't pay me enough to stop working on CouchDB .
Sorry .
BTW , if any Erlang expert wants to be referred for a pretty sweet sounding job , just let me know .
Maybe I can get a big fat commission .
Scale Baby !
Here is someone who actually did some scalability testing on CouchDB .
I 'm not sure of what to make of the data , but he hit the limit of the testing tool at 20 k concurrent requests .
That 's pretty cool .
On a related topic , Brian Aker wrote recently about the connection thread pooling work I implemented for MySQL 6.0 .
The improvements in client scalability look really impressive .
I hope it scales like that on Solaris :)
Eating Dogfood
Christopher Lenz is now running his live blog off of CouchDB .
Awesome .
Please backup frequently Chris !
The CouchDB Components
Two drawings of the same thing .
I like the hand drawn version , but it actually takes more effort than using Apple Keynote .
Apache
Sam Ruby and David Fallside have made a ton of progress with the Apache work .
Sam has created an Apache Incubator Proposal and we are presenting to the Apache Review Board next week .
Things are moving ahead quite nicely .
Talk Slides
Here is a PDF of the slides for the talk I gave , with some minor changes and additions .
The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
While it sounds like a bad 70's Disney movie , it 's actually a fast and cheap way to create a big computing cluster using Amazon.com 's resources .
And someone has a created CouchDB Amazon Machine Image , calling it ElasticDB. Nice .

« How the neocons turn George Washington into a symbol of their own ideology | Main | American culture » Anti-Islamic blogger commits suicide
A poster at Free Republic has athas discovered that a right - wing blogger named Ronald Barbour committed suicide on February 19 .
Barbour announced the planned suicide in a blog entry posted at his website on February 17 .
He said that the suicide would be to protest America ’s failure to oppose the spread of Islam .
Barbour ’s views on what to do about Islam , as shown in another article of his below , were basically the same as my own : get Muslims out of the West , confine them to their own lands ( he called his policy “ quarantine ” rather than “ separationism ” ) , and use military force to destroy any dangerous Islamic regimes but without occupying any Muslim countries .
In addition to quarantining Islam as I would do , Barbour also , following the more hard - line position of David Yerushalmi of SANE , wanted to destroy Islam by destroying every sharia regime , whether or not it directly threatened us .
Strikingly , Barbour understood that the problem is not terrorism , and the problem is not jihad , the problem is sharia .
He said that any sharia - believing Muslim should be made to leave the U.S. According to a badly written and confusing article in the March 5 , 2000 Florida Today , Barbour served a four year federal prison sentence in the 1990s for threatening and planning to assassinate President Clinton by shooting him as he jogged in Washington D.C.
The article says that Barbour was innocent and was set up by the Secret Service .
Below is Barbour ’s suicide note .
In it , he links the article explaining his prison conviction , which he says ruined his life , though he says he is not depressed .
He does however say that the suicide is a response to his prison sentence as well as to the West ’s surrender to Islamization .
Below his suicide note is an abridged version of his January 2007 article on what to do about Islam .
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE
Sunday , February 17 , 2008 I understand the ______ building is more than 150 feet tall .
At the time of my last recon I noticed easy access to the roof that would allow someone to leap to their death to the parking lot below .
I ’m not an expert in these matters , but if I recall from my physics classes in college at 100 feet a falling object reaches a speed of about 100 MPH .
This means that the falling man would hit the pavement at a speed great enough to cause instant death .
I understand that over the years since the construction of this building several persons have died by jumping from this structure .
I plan to make such a leap .
I do this in memory of the several hundred victims on 9/11 who jumped off the World Trade Center as a means of avoiding burning to death , and the over 3,000 American soldiers killed fighting Islamofascism in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A parallel reason is a protest against the American Left and the Democrat Party who have stabbed the Armed Forces in the back in the early stages of what is shaping up to be The Third World War .
This is an excellent time to make a final statement — a dying declaration — about an event that resulted in my life being ruined .
This is my imprisonment for an attempt on the life of President Clinton in 1994 .
In truth I made no such attempt and I was convicted on the basis of lies told to the court by the U.S. Secret Service and an edited audiotape .
I have no way of knowing the dynamics behind my conviction , but I suspect that it was done on the basis of personal advancement and political reasons on the part of certain individuals in the District Federal Court and Secret Service .
In addition I would not rule out Bill or Hillary Clinton being personally involved in my case based on their well known records of revenge against their opponents .
I have no doubt the Leftist Media will spin my death as that of an insane man with few options left in life who killed himself in desperation .
In fact , the objective investigator will notice no signs of depression on my part the last months of my life .
I would describe myself as an idealist .
I know this is a personality strange to many people who would say such a person is “ unusual ” or “ crazy ” or “ a bit off . ”
The fact of the matter is that the actions of many people that were described as heroic happened because they were idealists who chose death rather than selling out what they hold to be sacred .
In my case I can not allow myself to continue to live in a world that is largely indifferent to a neo - pagan religion called Islam that in league with Leftist appeasement and multiculturalism , and seems on the fast track to destroy the United States and Western Civilization .
[ Emphasis added . ]
What I did is not suicide .
It is the action of a patriot and idealist who loves God and Country , and who makes a very public statement as a warning of a New Dark Age that looks America straight in the face armed with a hideous ideology that makes the German Nazis or Russian Communists look like bleeding heart liberals .
I hope my fellow Countrymen will rally once gain in the defense of liberty no matter how long and hard the struggle .
In this life or death struggle between civilizations it would be a critical mistake to limit our attention to the plight of isolated individuals whom Islamic militants have threatened with death : the sort of mistake that leads to a “ law - enforcement ” attitude toward Islam - powered violence .
The Qur’an commands Muslims to impose themselves on the whole world , by any means expedient .
Muhammad ’s recorded history and sayings reinforce that command .
Islamic militants believe that God and His Prophet have commanded them to erect a totalitarian , world - girdling Islamic state .
If the last few years have taught us anything , it ’s that there are enough adequately motivated Muslims in any of the countries of Europe to reduce those countries to chaos or shari’a , as long as Islamic militancy is regarded as a law - enforcement issue … which means , as long as Islam is welcomed in the nations of the West .
This can not be a law - enforcement issue .
It must become a war issue .
Muslims as individuals might well be overwhelmingly inclined toward peace and amicable relations with non-Muslims , though , given the sanctification by Islam of taqiyya and kitman , one can never be perfectly sure .
But Islam the ideology is inherently and openly at war with any nation that refuses it .
Barring extraordinary good fortune such as America had with the Fort Dix Six , militant Islam ’s “ active agents ” cannot reliably be seined from their concealment until they ’ve struck .
To allow them to roam among us yet safeguard ourselves from them proactively , we would have to erect a totalitarianism that would make Oceania in 1984 look like a kindergarten class picnic .
We must accept that we ’re on a war footing , and do what a people at war must do to survive : expel our putative enemies from among us and confine them where they can do us no further harm .
Europe ’s policy has been the reverse .
India ’s policy has been inanition .
America ’s policy defies elucidation .
This cannot continue if we wish to survive as free men .
Quarantine or genocide .
There are no other options .
A Declaration Of War On Islamic Tyranny
Posted January 17 , 2007
After listening mostly in vain to the President tonight and his new approach to Iraq , we thought it time to come out with a clear statement on the War Against Islam .
Here it is :
We are at war whether we like it or not .
There is no hiding from this enemy .
Either we lock him out and go after his strongholds or we cower as he picks us apart piece by piece .
We listened to the President this evening .
Nothing he said was convincing nor did it address in any serious or detailed way what he is going to do about the most immediate problem in Iraq and further out in what should be , but is not , the War Against Islam .
Let ’s first focus on the Global problem and then we ’ll return to Iraq in a follow - on essay .
The following can be considered the SANE War Manifesto .
On the so - called Global War on Terrorism , GWOT , we have been quite clear along with a few other resolute souls .
This should be a WAR AGAINST ISLAM and all Muslim faithful .
In particular , historical , traditional , and authoritative Shari’a , or the Islamic Way of Life , bound most tightly by Islamic law and jurisprudence , or fiqh , is the focus of the ideology which drives our enemy .
People who do n’t grasp that Islam is first and foremost a religious ideology built on a legal foundation or jurisprudence simply do n’t understand Islam .
All traditional Islamic legal schools adhere to the notion that the Islamic world must persuade , conquer , or kill all of the non-Islamic world ( dar al - kufr ) and convert this territory to the Land of Submission to Allah ( dar al - Islam ) .
The particular emphasis on the jihadist strategic issues varies — such as aggressive and offensive outright war or a more subtle and deceptive war which capitalizes on the infidel ’s inclination toward appeasement ; suicide - homicide attacks against soldiers and “ settlers ” or the murder of all infidels whether they be men , women or children ; and other such tactical issues .
But the Islamic legal dictate to conquer the world for Mohammad ’s rightful successor to establish the World State Caliphate occupied by the One People ( Ummah ) in submission to Allah is the common denominator .
Ignoring the enemy and fighting a tactic such as terrorism or worse , reducing the enemy to just those men and women dressed up in their suicide bombs on the way to attack civilians is to open the US and the West to death and destruction by the parts .
Bit by bit we will be dismantled as a society and as a nation .
This is unfolding before our eyes in Israel .
The Jewish State is hemorrhaging land , people and resources and morphing into a “ post - Zionist ” or “ post - Jewish Nation ” status as the “ State of its Citizens ” .
It has institutionalized since the beginning of the “ Peace Process ” the murderous notion of “ Sacrifices for Peace ” as the Hebrew word for “ victim ” is also “ sacrifice ” .
This is the line made famous by Prime Minister Rabin and repeated in speech or in deed by subsequent Prime Ministers Peres , Barak , Netanyahu , and Olmert .
The actual or physical enemy is any Muslim who adopts or accepts historical and traditional Shari’a as authoritative .
This includes individuals , terrorist networks , clans , tribes , regimes , or states .
One law and one Rule of Engagement :
If you adopt Shari’a as your ideology , you constitute our enemy and you are in our cross -hairs .
We of course will pick the most opportune time and place but you will be targeted .
At a practical level , this means that Shari’a and Islamic law are immediately outlawed .
Any Moslem in America who adopts historical and traditional Shari ’a will be subject to deportation .
Mosques which adhere to Islamic law will be shut down permanently .
No self - described or practicing Muslim , irrespective of his or her declarations to the contrary , will be allowed to immigrate to this country .
The US will cease trade and all economic ties with countries which embrace Shari’a and with countries which befriend the Shari ’a - based regimes .
This includes the duplicitous oil - rich Gulf states .
The US will take emergency measures to open up new oil extraction facilities in US territories and will immediately make available land and reasonable regulatory structures for new refineries .
Massive free market incentives such as marketable and securitized coupons and vouchers will be used to promote alternative fuels .
America and its Western allies will quarantine every enemy regime and will search out and destroy the leadership and the physical infrastructure of these regimes with air bombardment , drones , airborne gunships , sea - based missiles , special ops , and covert activities .
We will not occupy these territories to “ build democracies ” or even to replace regimes directly .
We will simply quarantine and police these regimes with a hair - trigger response to hostile behavior .
We repeat : adoption of Shari’a is by definition hostile behavior .
This plan , as many of you will notice , is quite similar to a growing list of respectable thinkers who have addressed the problem of Islam in a serious way .
The following list has been proposed by Lawrence Auster , himself one of the more vocal of the advocates of what has been dubbed Separationism : Serge Trifkovic , Diana West , Randall Parker , the Norwegian blogger Fjordman , and Hugh Fitzgerald .
There are others and you could probably include Mark Helprin and Angelo Codevilla who have written in the Claremont Review .
For our part , we prefer a different nomenclature than Separationism because that smacks of a kind of Buchanan - like isolationism and appeasement of the Muslim regimes .
Buchananism will not work because science and technology will allow our enemies to plot , conspire and strategize until they have perfected a delivery system for WMD .
By then , it will be too late .
We need to implement the Separation platform with a Search and Destroy mission wherever Islam raises its ugly head .
There are two critiques of this Manifesto .
One , it reduces America to a state of perpetual war and turns us into a war - like society falling short of the ideal of the City on the Hill .
Two , given the liberal Open Society Elite ’s stranglehold on both major political parties , it is not practical .
As to the first critique , what would be the better approach ?
Wait for the next attack with WMD ?
Wish for a miraculous theological revolution among a substantial number of the world ’s 1.3 billion Muslims who consistently express support for Shari’a and Islamic law as a guiding political and social structure ?
Adopt the democracy - building ideology so tragically failing in Iraq ?
With the SANE War Manifesto , we need not target all or even any substantial number of the world ’s Muslims .
Instead , we target their leadership strongholds and their infrastructure .
Will many of them be killed in the war ?
Of course , and it is intended to be so .
Otherwise we can never expect to be victorious .
Muslims will certainly never abandon historical and traditional Shari ’a easily .
But given sustained and determined separate - quarantine - search - and - destroy operations , Muslims will have the choice : either reform your own societies or forever be rebuilding them while burying your dead .
The second critique is valid to the extent that either we accept the destruction of our nation and we are merely looking to forestall the inevitable or we agree that we have no alternative but to believe in and rely exclusively upon miracles .
We certainly believe in Divine intervention in the affairs of men and nations but it is a fundamental principle of the Judeo - Christian creed that we do n’t rely exclusively upon them .
We fashion our lives and our political affairs on the basis that we must confront the reality of the world in which we live .
The second critique is for us not a legitimate one .
We owe it to ourselves , our families , our nation , to act now to put Islam on notice .
We are at war .
There is no chance of victory over America .
- end of initial entry - Laura W. writes : Judging from his statements , Barbour appears to be intelligent , sane and highly principled .
But , he says , “ I have no doubt the Leftist Media will spin my death as that of an insane man with few options left in life who killed himself in desperation . ”
Then what is the purpose of his death ?
Given the likelihood that his action will go largely ignored , could he be sane ?
LA replies : LA replies : I do n’t know , there ’s a lot that ’s puzzling here .
I ’m not sure where he would be located on a spectrum of mental health .
I have to do more reading of him and try to understand where he was coming from .
Here ’s one question :
If he wanted his suicide to be a public statement protesting America ’s ongoing surrender to Islam , why not kill himself in a much more noticeable way so that his death would make an impact ?
Think of the Buddhist monks who burned themselves to death in Vietnam in 1963 to protest Diem ’s rule .
The suicides were widely covered and had a big effect on public opinion .
Not that the effect was good — it led to President Kennedy ’s calamitous decision to give his ok to the coup that overthrew and killed Diem , and from that point on Vietnam was a mess that was completely in our lap .
Nevertheless , the suicides “ worked . ”
Suicide is a grave sin , but if you ’re going to kill yourself for a political point , then you ’d better make a splash of it .
Yet apparently Barbour jumped from a 15 story building without publicizing his motive , and it only became known when the poster at Free Republic read the suicide note at Barbour ’s blog , then did a Web search for his name and came across the death notice .
And the death notice gives no information other than that he died .
Furthermore , in a Google search , all the references to his suicide that I find are at blogs .
There is not one newspaper or other mainstream media article about it ( other than the death notice ) .
So it appears that Barbour ’s suicide is to “ message ” suicides what Woody Allen ’s attempted bank robbery in Take the Money and Run ( with his note to the teller saying “ I have a gub ” ) was to bank robberies .
Laura W. writes : Laura W. writes :
He says on his website he was a Christian and a libertarian .
He was an unorthodox Christian if he committed suicide .
James P. writes : James P. writes :
There ’s obviously a lot more to Ronald Barbour ’s suicide than Islam .
However , taking his note at face value , the last thing the West needs is people committing suicide to protest America ’s failure to oppose the spread of Islam .
The West is already committing suicide — physically through failure to reproduce and morally / intellectually through propagation of the pernicious doctrines of liberalism — the last thing it needs is its supporters voting themselves off the planet .
If Ronald Barbour was serious about fighting Islam , he would have stayed alive and raised at least three children who believed in traditional values and who understood Western history and culture .
LA : LA : Yes , it would seem about as useful as a way of opposing an immigration invasion as Netherlanders leaving the Netherlands to escape Muslims , British leaving Britain to escape Muslims , and Californians moving away from California to escape Mexicans .

It was n't supposed to work that way .
States ' rights was a rallying cry for conservatives for much of the 20th century , first in allowing segregation and racial discrimination across the south and then in allowing environmental destruction around the west .
Rightwingers have usually believed in a weak federal government - except when they run it ; and that weakness , or rather the strength of the local , has been one of the bright spots during the seven bleak years of life under Bush .
The changes operate on all scales .
Across the country , quite a lot of cities and towns have passed measures condemning the Iraq war or calling for the troops to be brought home .
A handful of California counties have banned GM agriculture , and others have tried but been defeated by industry money - but may try again .
North Dakota farmers created so powerful a pact against the use of Monsanto 's GM wheat that the corporation eventually gave up on commercialising the invention worldwide .
My own city , San Francisco , has made plans to issue identity cards to undocumented immigrants , attempted to legalise same - sex marriage a few years back , and as of November 20 2007 banned plastic grocery bags in supermarkets and pharmacies as a step towards banning them altogether .
San Francisco , which is as much a peninsular republic unto itself as an irritation on the left edge of the superpower , has also gone for solar energy in a big way , kerbside compost pick - up as part of a successful programme to radically reduce landfill , and various other green programmes ( though affluence itself is environmentally devastating , and we also have lots of big cars and air traffic ) .
We are also trying out a universal healthcare plan .
Since a 2005 national mayors ' conference , more than 500 mayors from around the country have vowed to make their cities comply with or exceed the Kyoto accords , even while the federal government stalls .
Any bleak picture you may have of the American hinterland as a vast sprawl of big - box stores , soulless suburbs and mindless consumption is n't wrong , but is incomplete .
Eating locally , starting community gardens in the inner city , supporting and spreading farmer 's markets , growing organically , promoting bicycle use , creating denser , more alternative , transport - friendly housing , increasing solar and wind technology , and building greener are all proliferating parts of the contemporary landscape too .
Portions of New Orleans , for example , are being rebuilt to be energy efficient , use alternative energy and generally be green .
Detroit is full of community gardens and experiments with local economies .
As Los Angeles becomes a more and more Latino city , it develops more neighbourhoods of small businesses and lively pedestrian life .
From abroad , viewers mostly see this country as its federal government , the government that brought on a belligerent foreign policy while refusing to address the crises of climate change .
It 's more than fair to say that the federal government could not behave this way without implicit consent from the majority of the governed .
And from afar , it 's hard to see how tacit that consent is , or how much dissent is part of the landscape - it's a big part , especially on climate change .
Alexis de Tocqueville noted about 160 years ago that Americans had a talent for congregating in groups and organisations , so there 's nothing new about the way that existing environmental groups and new grassroots organisations have taken up that issue .
But it is exciting .
Last year in Vermont the environmental writer Bill McKibben and a few college students started a walk across the state , something that grew into a thousand - person march to demand positive action on climate change .
This push went for federal legislation to stipulate a reduction of 80 % in climate - change gases by 2020 , a far more radical standard than most have yet broached .
A weaker federal bill is under consideration , and , pushed by his constituents , the Vermont senator , Bernie Sanders , continues to work towards far tougher regulations .
However , the big changes may be made by an end run around the federales .
Since 2002 , California has been battling the federal government for the right to set emissions standards for vehicles within the state .
Since more than 10 % of the nation 's population lives in California , any such regulation could change the face of the domestic auto industry , and so both car - makers and the White House have tried to defeat the measures .
Happily , they have lost .
One step came when Massachusetts sued to get the Environmental Protection Agency to stop saying that it did n't have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions ; the state won in the supreme court in the autumn of 2006 .
Another landmark came in November when a federal circuit court for the west struck down national vehicle mileage standards that increase efficiency by one mile per gallon , which California 's attorney general called " pathetic " .
Soon afterwards , the attorney general joined 16 states in demanding that Congress prevent the Bush administration from blocking its 2002 motor vehicle greenhouse - gas emissions law .
Change for the better largely comes from the bottom up , and in a decentralised country it does n't always have to reach the top to matter .
These changes that are afoot across the US suggest that the federal government may become increasingly irrelevant on many issues .
The centre cannot hold , Yeats wrote ; his next line is " Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world " .
Anarchism in the contemporary sense of decentralised direct democracy is on the loose , and that 's the rest of the good news .
Globally , as the nation - state becomes increasingly less meaningful - a provider of positive goods and more and more just an army and some domestic enforcement - people are withdrawing to shape and support more localised forms of organisation and power .
To the extent that it 's part of that civilised and localising world , the same is true of the US .

Humans are social animals ; we spend much of our time with others in groups .
We are also wise .
It is not our size , speed , or strength that distinguishes us from other mammals , but our intelligence .
How might these two features -- being social and being smart -- go together ?
Article lead author Oscar Ybarra * and his colleagues at the University of Michigan explored the possibility that social interaction improves mental functioning .
In a series of related studies , they tested the participants ' level of cognitive functioning , comparing it to the frequency of participants ' social interactions .
They found that people who engaged in social interaction displayed higher levels of cognitive performance than the control group .
Social interaction aided intellectual performance .
" Social interaction , " the authors suggest , " helps to exercise people 's minds .
People reap cognitive benefits from socializing , " They speculate that social interaction " exercises " cognitive processes that are measured on intellectual tasks .
" It is possible , " the authors conclude , " that as people engage socially and mentally with others , they receive relatively immediate cognitive boosts . "
* The article , " Mental Exercising Through Simple Socializing : Social Interaction Promotes General Cognitive Functioning , " written by Oscar Ybarra , Eugene Burnstein , Piotr Winkielman , Matthew C. Keller , Melvin Manis , Emily Chan , and Joel Rodriguez of the University of Michigan , and published by SAGE in the February issue of Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin .

I HAVE today signed into law a measure recently enacted by the Congress repealing the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 .
This repeal legislation was wholeheartedly supported by this Administration .
The Emergency Detention Act was enacted as title II of the Internal Security Act of 1950 .
Among its provisions , it established procedures for the apprehension and detention , during internal security emergencies , of individuals likely to engage in acts of espionage or sabotage .
No President has ever attempted to use the provisions of this act .
And while six detention camps were established and funded by the Congress , none of them was ever used for the purposes of this legislation .
In fact , all six camps have been abandoned or used for other purposes since 1957 .
Nevertheless , the mere continued existence of these legal provisions has aroused concern among many Americans that the act might someday be used to apprehend and detain citizens who hold unpopular views .
Some have feared that it might someday be used to permit a situation comparable to the detention of Americans of Japanese ancestry during World War II .
I have supported and signed this repeal in order to put an end to such suspicions .
In taking this action , I want to underscore this Nation 's abiding respect for the liberty of the individual .
Our democracy is built upon the constitutional guarantee that every citizen will be afforded due process of law .
There is no place in American life for the kind of anxiety -- however unwarranted -- which the Emergency Detention Act has evidently engendered .
This strong country has no reason to fear that the normal processes of law - together with those special emergency powers which the Constitution grants to the Chief Executive - - will be inadequate to deal with any situation , no matter how grave , that may arise in the future .
But we do have a great deal to fear if we begin to lose faith in our constitutional ideals .
The legislation I have signed today keeps faith with those ideals .

1. Erich Jarvis , Neurobiologist
When Duke professor Erich Jarvis wanted to find the key to human communication , he turned to birds .
Strange , but true .
Jarvis has been studying songbirds ' brains for insight into human linguistics , and his research has led to a startling discovery :
Birds use two distinct neural pathways to learn songs — one in the front of the brain and one in the back .
Guess what ?
Humans learn to speak in the same way .
Jarvis believes this is an evolutionary clue suggesting that , when we shared an ancestor 300 million years ago , our brains were hardwired for language .
Theoretically , once Jarvis and other neuroscientists fully understand this genetic blueprint , they can alter it and , in the process , make it easier to learn new languages and possibly even repair brain damage .
2. Nathan Wolfe , Epidemiologist
Instead of spending his days in a lab , UCLA professor Nathan Wolfe has thrown himself into the heart of the jungle .
Trekking right along with hunters in Cameroon , he 's attempting to learn how they 're exposed to diseases by asking them to donate blood samples ( their own and their prey 's ) .
Wolfe 's method is difficult , but his idea is simple : HIV , Ebola , and other human viruses originated from human - animal contact , so it 's possible that these hunters — who come in close contact with their catch — are the ones inadvertently triggering the outbreaks .
Wolfe 's work will go a long way toward predicting where emerging diseases could occur and stopping the next HIV or Ebola epidemic before it starts .
3. Emily Oster , Economist
A few years ago , as an economics PhD student at Harvard , Emily Oster chose to focus her attention on the AIDS epidemic in Africa .
Traditionally , that was the turf of sociologists , anthropologists , and public health officials .
But the 26 - year - old Oster was n't afraid to hop the scientific fence and join the other side .
She also has n't been afraid to suggest things we have n't heard before — namely , that treating herpes and other STDs ( instead of AIDS ) can significantly reduce HIV transmissions .
Oster also believes that while the HIV numbers commonly used by the UN , popular press , and researchers are about three times too high , the disease is spreading faster than ever in Africa .
By casting her economist 's eyes on the issue , Oster has forced the old turf - guarders to reevaluate their approaches to AIDS in Africa and come up with new solutions .
4. Hiroshi Ishiguro , Roboticist
Most robots look like , well , robots , but Ishiguro 's robots look remarkably human .
To many people , this is discomforting — creepy even .
To Ishiguro , it 's essential .
As director of Osaka University 's Intelligent Robotics Lab , Ishiguro believes robots ' main role in our future will be to interact naturally with people — to pitch in as the workforce shrinks or to do necessary , unpleasant tasks .
And because Ishiguro contends that people respond better to his humanlike robots ( aka , androids ) than other machine - like ones , he 's taken a no-holds - barred approach to studying cognitive behavior and human activity .
In addition to nearly perfecting his silicone molds and metal skeletons , he 's figured out how to mimic even the most minute human movements , such as breathing , blinking , and even fidgeting .
The result is " android science . " 
The idea is that by using robots that are indistinguishable from humans in scientific experiments , researchers can still elicit natural responses from their subjects but also have more control over the environment .
So far , Ishiguro has already learned plenty about his students using the Geminoid HI - 1 , an android version of himself , which he operates via remote control to teach class .
5. Jeffrey H. Schwartz , Forensic Anthropologist
Jeffrey Schwartz became the first modern man to lay eyes on a young George Washington .
Yes , that George Washington .
Although he normally works on forensic cases reconstructing faces from bones , Schwartz re-created Washington by working from the outside in .
Using only clues from statues , portraits , dentures , and clothing , Schwartz plugged his " evidence "  into a three - dimensional computer program , which allowed him to combine and manipulate the clues to arrive at his reproduction .
Schwartz created renderings of the founding father at ages 19 , 45 , and 57 , and from the looks of it , George Washington might have been the George Clooney of his day .
The lasting ramifications of Schwartz 's applications and research will be seen almost immediately , as other forensic anthropologists follow his method to see what distant past heroes ( and villains ) really looked like .
6. Pardis Sabeti , Biological Anthropologist
Pulling a typical all - nighter in med school , Pardis Sabeti achieved a not - so - typical feat — she confirmed the effects of genetics on the evolution of human diseases .
By inputting different DNA sequences into an algorithm she created , Sabeti was able to find genes still linked to their neighbors — suggesting that their success within the gene pool is due to natural selection , not pure chance .
Sabeti now plans on using her algorithm to deconstruct the malaria parasite .
By seeing how the parasite has evolved to develop drug resistances , she hopes to detect genetic vulnerabilities in malaria 's makeup .
If she 's successful , future cures will be designed to attack those weaknesses .
Meanwhile , Sabeti is n't your typical lab rat .
She 's the lead singer of the alt - rock band Thousand Days and sounds more than a little like Liz Phair .
And did we mention that she 's a Rhodes Scholar who just graduated summa cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 2006 ?
7. Thomas A. Jackson , Aerospace Engineer
Piloting a real - life Luke Skywalker X - wing fighter is every aeronautical engineer 's fantasy , and Thomas Jackson is helping make it a reality .
A scientist for the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory , Jackson is setting the direction for the supersonic combustion ramjet — aka , the scramjet .
By scooping up oxygen from the atmosphere as it ascends , the scramjet eliminates the need for the heavy liquid oxygen and solid oxidizer used by a typical space shuttle .
And once it catches on , it will revolutionize air travel .
How does a 2 - hour flight from New York to Sydney sound ?
Or a layover on the Moon ?
And the best thing is , it 'll all happen sooner than you think .
In April 2007 , NASA successfully test - powered a hydrocarbon - fueled scramjet engine to Mach 5 .
8. , Probabilistic Roboticist
Sebastian Thrun is a Stanford professor who drives a Volkswagen — but not just any Volkswagen .
Thrun 's
Touareg is autonomous , and its name is Stanley .
The VW drives itself thanks to state - of - the - art road - finding and obstacle - avoidance software , along with radar systems , video screens , and laser range finders .
Like every driver , Stanley makes mistakes , and Thrun programmed him with that in mind .
Stanley 's decisions are based not on absolutes , but on probabilities , which results in more natural and realistic driver reactions .
But Thrun is n't so sure people will immediately hand over the keys to a bunch of Stanleys .
It may take up to 30 years , he says , " simply because we do n't know how to insure a car where no one is at the wheel . " 
9. Nima Arkani-Hamed , Particle Physicist and Applied String Theorist
Nima Arkani - Hamed thinks big .
He has a theory that our universe is one of an infinite number of universes — meaning the largest thing we can wrap our minds around is actually pretty tiny .
He did n't pull the " multiverse "  out of thin air , though .
After becoming a Harvard professor at age 30 , Arkani - Hamed first made a name for himself by suggesting that our universe is five - dimensional .
Then he moved on to the multiverse , theorizing that our own universe has a hidden feature called " split supersymmetry , "  which means that half of all particles have partner particles .
The theory will be tested soon in Switzerland 's brand - new Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , and if the LHC finds Arkani - Hamed 's partner particles , it could prove that the multiverse is real — and that our place in it is that much smaller .
10 . Margaret Turnbull , Astrobiologist
Hunting for aliens is n't necessarily the most respected academic endeavor in the world , but Margaret Turnbull pursued it anyway .
More precisely , she set out to catalog the stars most likely to develop intelligent alien civilizations .
Turnbull 's system was painstakingly tedious .
She started with the 120,000 cataloged stars , narrowed down her list to 17,129 ( excluding the ones that were too hot , too close together , or too erratic ) , and then parsed that list down to 100 candidates .
Her final criteria ?
An ideal star would be at least 3 billion years old and have a high iron content ( the better to spin off life - yielding planets with ) .
Turnbull 's mind - blowing patience has paid off .
In 2015 , NASA will be launching its Terrestrial Planet Finder , which will use space telescopes to look for planets beyond our solar system , and it'll start with the stars on Turnbull 's short list .
In other words , nobody 's laughing at Turnbull 's search for aliens now .

But European diplomats , speaking on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the subject for attribution , expressed worries that Kosovo ’s Serbs could provoke ethnic Albanians , undermining whatever collective Serbian and Albanian authority remained in northern Kosovo , and entrenching Serbian control so that de facto partition became a political reality .
Image Cabra was also the scene of ethnic tensions in 2004 .

“ The Serbs appear intent on provoking an Albanian reaction and to make the international community ’s mission here impossible , but we will not allow legal partition , ” said one senior European Union diplomat .
But another European diplomat said that if Serbs pursued de facto division , “ there is not a lot that could be done . ”
The political temperature in Cabra , an agricultural village of about 70 ethnic Albanian families , has particular resonance because it was here in March 2004 that three ethnic Albanian boys drowned under mysterious circumstances , prompting Albanians to riot across Kosovo .
As the Serb protesters gathered on the road outside the village Wednesday , local ethnic Albanians vowed they would stay to ensure that northern Kosovo remained in ethnic Albanian hands .
Children wearing T - shirts with Albanian flags gathered to observe the peacekeepers ’ tanks parked at the edge of the town .
“ This is my land , and we must stay here to show Serbia that this is Kosovo , ” said Zuka Ilir , an unemployed 28 - year - old .
“ But we are afraid .
We do n’t know what will happen . ”
Xhevadet Beka , a 26 - year - old engineer , added : “ I will stay here and fight if I have to .
For now we put our faith in NATO , the E.U. and the United States .
But we are very , very afraid that the Serbs will try and take over northern Kosovo , and it is impossible .
We will not allow it . ”

MOUNT VERNON , Virginia ( Reuters ) - The U.S. and French presidents forged a common front against Iran ’s nuclear ambitions on Wednesday , signaling a further warming of once - chilly relations between Washington and Paris .
In a sign that diplomatic ties have advanced beyond the era of “ freedom fries , ” President George W. Bush and French President Nicolas Sarkozy agreed to keep the pressure on Tehran , which has defied demands to halt uranium enrichment .
“ The idea of Iran having a nuclear weapon is dangerous , ” Bush said standing shoulder to shoulder with Sarkozy at a news conference in Mount Vernon , the historic estate of George Washington , the first U.S. president .
Sarkozy , who has won U.S. praise for taking a stronger stand against Iran than his predecessor , Jacques Chirac , agreed that a nuclear - armed Iran would be “ unacceptable ” and said there was “ a need to toughen the sanctions ” against Tehran .
Bush has been ratcheting up his rhetoric toward Tehran and last month raised the specter of World War Three if it were allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon .
Bush and Sarkozy expressed hope that the standoff can be resolved peacefully .
Tehran insists it wants nuclear technology strictly for civilian purposes , which Sarkozy acknowledged was its right .
Underscoring how times have changed , Sarkozy trumpeted strengthened ties with Bush in a speech earlier to a joint session of the U.S. Congress that was filled with effusive praise for American values .
“ America can count on France in its battle on terror , ” Sarkozy said , pledging that his country would stand by the United States in the fight against nuclear proliferation in Iran and terrorism in Afghanistan .
Bush , notably frosty toward Chirac , has been just as eager for a fresh start in relations badly strained by the Iraq war , and called Sarkozy a “ a partner in peace . ”
VISIT EVOKES LONG ALLIANCE
Sarkozy , 52 , France ’s most pro-American president in decades , was welcomed on his first official visit to Washington with a warmth normally reserved for the British , whose “ special relationship ” has made them the closest U.S. ally .
Bush gave Sarkozy a guided tour of the hillside mansion overlooking the Potomac River just south of Washington , D.C. Mount Vernon was chosen to evoke the long alliance between the two countries stretching back more than 200 years to the American War of Independence .
Sarkozy has made no secret of his affinity for American culture , and White House officials say he and Bush used earlier meetings , including an informal get - together at the Bush family compound in Maine in August , to forge close personal ties .

But mindful of Bush ’s deep unpopularity in France , Sarkozy , a fellow conservative , must also show he will not flinch at disagreeing with him .
Sarkozy was mocked as “ Bush ’s poodle ” by Socialists before coming into office in May .
Signaling the countries still have their differences , Sarkozy warned lawmakers that by standing by as the dollar falls the United States risks an “ economic war ” in trade .
Still , it was a far cry from Bush ’s chilly relations with Chirac , who rankled the U.S. administration with his outspoken opposition to the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .

That prompted some indignant Americans to make a show of giving french fries the less Gallic name of “ freedom fries ” and to boycott products such as French cheese .
Taking a swipe at Chirac over Iraq , Bush told Sarkozy , “ We had a difference of opinion with your great country over whether or not I should have used military force to enforce U.N. demands . ”
Sarkozy sought to avoid any divisiveness and said only that France wanted a united , democratic and peaceful Iraq .
Preferring to dwell on what the United States and France have in common , Sarkozy told lawmakers earlier : “ It is together that we must fight to defend and promote the values and ideals of freedom and democracy . ”
Sarkozy also said he wanted France to “ resume its full role ” in NATO , and assured Bush that France would not pull its forces out of Afghanistan .
Case Study V : Ubiquity of finite fields December 21 , 2007
Zadaje pytania wymijajace , by przeciac droge wymijajacym odpowiedziom .
I ask circumspect questions to avoid circumspect answers .
Stanislaw Jerzy Lec
Posted by Alexandre Borovik in Uncategorized
Whenever you discuss the realities of mathematical life , words of wisdom from Vladimir Arnold , an outspoken critic of the status quo of modern mathematics , often help to clarify the issues :
All mathematics is divided in three parts : cryptography ( paid for by the CIA , the KGB and the like ) , hydrodynamics ( supported by manufacturers of atomic submarines ) and celestial mechanics ( financed by the military and by other institutions dealing with missiles , such as NASA ) .
Cryptography has generated number theory , algebraic geometry over finite fields , algebra , combinatorics and computers .
Let us pause here and , ignoring the irony of Arnold ’s words , take them at face value .
Indeed , why there is so much fuss around finite fields ?
Why is modern , computer - implemented cryptography based on finite fields ?
This question is relevant to our discussion since computers can be viewed as very crude models of a mathematical brain .
One of the major problems of human mathematics — and the battleground of platonists and formalists — is why mathematics chooses to operate within a surprisingly limited range of basic structures .
Why does it reuse , again and again , the same objects ?
It is this aspect of mathematical practice that turns many mathematicians into instinctive ( although not very committed ) platonists .
But why not ask the same question about computers ?
Let us make it more specific : why is the range of structures usable in computer - based cryptography so narrow ?
Unlike the philosophical questions of mathematics , this last question has the extra bonus of having very obvious practical implications .
Imagine that the proverbial little green men from Mars stole a satellite from its orbit around Earth and attempted to analyze the dedicated microchip responsible , say , for the Diffie - Hellman key exchange .
Would they be surprised to discover that humans were using finite fields and elliptic curves ?
For further discussion , we need some details of the Diffie - Hellman key exchange .
I repeat its basic setup in a slightly more abstract way than is usually done .
Alice and Bob want to make a shared secret key for the encryption of their communications .
Until they have done so , they can use only an open line communication , with Clare eavesdropping on their every word .
How could they exchange the key in open communication so that Clare would not also get it ?
The famous Diffie - Hellman key exchange protocol is a procedure which resolves this problem .
Historically , it is one of the starting points of modern cryptography .
In an abstract setting , it looks like this :
Alice and Bob choose a big finite abelian group ( for our convenience , we assume that the operation in is written multiplicatively ) .
They also specify an element .
( As the result of her eavesdropping , Clare also knows and . )
( for our convenience , we assume that the operation in is written multiplicatively ) .
They also specify an element .
( As the result of her eavesdropping , Clare also knows and . )
Alice selects her secret integer , computes and sends the value to Bob .
( Clare knows , too . )
, computes and sends the value to Bob .
( Clare knows , too . )
Similarly , Bob selects his secret integer and sends to Alice .
( Needless to say , Clare duly intercepts as well . )
and sends to Alice .
( Needless to say , Clare duly intercepts as well . )
In the privacy of her computer ( a major and delicate assumption ) Alice raises the element received from Bob to her secret exponent and computes .
( Clare does not know the result unless she has managed to determine Alice ’s secret exponent from the intercepted values of and . )
received from Bob to her secret exponent and computes .
( Clare does not know the result unless she has managed to determine Alice ’s secret exponent from the intercepted values of and . )
Similarly , Bob computes .
. Since , the element is the secret shared element known only to Alice and Bob , but not to Clare .
The string of symbols representing can be used by Alice and Bob as their shared secret key for encryption of all subsequent exchanges .
So , what do we need for the realization of this protocol ?
I will outline the technical specifications only in a very crude form ; they can be refined in many ways , but there is no need to do that here , a crude model will suffice .
Since we can always replace by the subgroup generated by , we can assume that is cyclic .
We will also assume that has prime order .
Therefore , to implement the Diffie - Hellman key exchange , we need :
A cyclic group of very large prime order such that its elements can be presented by short ( that is , of length ) strings of 0s and 1s .
of very large prime order such that its elements can be presented by short ( that is , of length ) strings of 0s and 1s .
The group operation has to be quick , in any case , better than in basic operations of the computer .
basic operations of the computer .
The discrete logarithm problem of finding the secret exponent from and has to be very difficult for all elements in ; in any case , it should not allow a solution by a polynomial time algorithm .
( Even if a polynomial time algorithm is practically unfeasible , its very existence will undermine the commercial confidence in the cryptographic product since it potentially opens up a venue for possible improvements which will eventually destroy the cryptosystem .
Commercial and military users of cryptographic products are not willing to take such risks . )

This should preferably ( but not necessarily ) be done for an arbitrary prime , or for sufficiently many primes ; to make the problem easier , let “ sufficiently many ” mean “ infinitely many ” .
, or for sufficiently many primes ; to make the problem easier , let “ sufficiently many ” mean “ infinitely many ” .
The implementation of the particular instances of the algorithm , compilation of the actual executable file for the computer ( or realization of the algorithm at the hardware level in a microchip , say , in a mobile phone ) should be easy and done in polynomial time of small degree in .
There are two classical ways of making cyclic groups of prime order : one of them is the additive group of the field of residues modulo , .
In another , we select a prime such that divides and generate by an element of the multiplicative order in the multiplicative group .
In the additive group , the exponentiation is just multiplication by , , and the Euclidean algorithm instantly solves the discrete logarithm problem .
In the multiplicative group , the discrete logarithm problem is apparently hard .
It is also conjectured to be hard in the group of points of an elliptic curve over a finite field , thus giving rise to elliptic curve cryptography .
Notice that , in all cases , the group , as an abstract algebraic object , is exactly the same , the cyclic group of order ; it is the underlying computational structure that matters .
How can we compare different computational structures for ?
Look again at the examples
and
.
Elements of can be naturally represented as integers .
Given an element of multiplicative order , we can use square - and - multiply to raise to the power of in time .
Hence the map
given by is an isomorphism of the two computational implementations of , ( an isomorphism which can be computed in time linear in ) .
An impressive body of mathematics has been developed over the last half century for efficient implementation of exponentiation , with the likes of Paul Erdos and Donald Knuth involved .
We shall say that the implementation of as is reducible to its implementation as .
To compute the inverse isomorphism means to solve the discrete logarithm problem , which , it is universally believed , cannot be done in time which is polynomial in .
Therefore morphisms of computational structures for are homomorphisms computable in polynomial time .
As Blake , Seroussi and Smart comment in the introduction to their book on elliptic curve cryptography , the three types of groups we just mentioned represent the three principal classes of commutative algebraic groups over finite fields : unipotent — , tori — , and abelian varieties — elliptic
curves .
They can all be built from finite fields , by simple constructions with fast computer implementations .
So far I am aware of only one another class of computational structures for finite abelian groups proposed for use in cryptography , “ ideal class groups ” in number fields ( but it is not clear to me whether they allow a cheap mass set - up ) .
My million dollar question is
Are there polynomial time computational structures for cyclic groups of prime order ( which therefore have a chance to meet memory and speed requirements of computer - based cryptography ) and which cannot be reduced , within polynomial space / time constraints , to one of the known types ?
Notice that non-reducibility to would mean that the discrete logarithm problem cannot be solved in polynomial time , giving such structures a chance to meet security requirements as well .
I accept that this question is likely to be out of reach of modern mathematics .
The answer will definitely involve some serious advances in complexity theory .
If the answer is “ yes ” , especially if you can invent something which is quicker than elliptic curve systems , you can patent yourinvention and make your million dollars .
If the answer is “ no ” — and this is what I expect — it will provide some hint as to how similar questions can be asked about mathematical algorithms and structures acceptable for the human brain and about algorithms implemented in the brain at the innate , phylogenic level .
Meanwhile , mathematics already has a number of deep results which show the very special role of finite fields in the universe of all finite structures ; we shall discuss one such theorem later .

It would become known inside the Central Intelligence Agency as “ the Italian job , ” a snide movie reference to the bungling performance of an agency team that snatched a radical Muslim cleric from the streets of Milan in 2003 and flew him to Egypt — a case that led to criminal charges in Italy against 26 Americans .
Porter J. Goss , the C.I.A. director in 2005 when embarrassing news reports about the operation broke , asked the agency ’s independent inspector general to start a review of amateurish tradecraft in the case , like operatives staying in five - star hotels and using traceable credit cards and cellphones .
But Jose A. Rodriguez Jr. , now the central figure in a controversy over destroyed C.I.A. interrogation tapes , fought back .
A blunt - spoken Puerto Rico native and former head of the agency ’s Latin America division , he had been selected by Mr. Goss months earlier to head the agency ’s troubled clandestine branch .
Mr. Rodriguez told his boss that no inspector general review would be necessary — his service would investigate itself .
It was a protective instinct that ran deep inside the C.I.A. ’s fabled Directorate of Operations , the agency ’s most powerful branch .
The same instinct would resurface months later , when Mr. Rodriguez dispatched a cable to the agency ’s Bangkok station ordering the destruction of videotapes that showed C.I.A. officers carrying out harsh interrogations of operatives of Al Qaeda .
“ He would always say , “ ˜I ’m not going to let my people get nailed for something they were ordered to do , ’ ” said Robert Richer , Mr. Rodriguez ’s deputy in the clandestine branch until late 2005 , who recalls many conversations with his boss about the tapes .

Gold - pressed Latinum , the currency used by the Ferengi ( and sometimes other races ) in TNG - era Star Trek .
It 's a super - valuable liquid encased within ( possibly ) worthless gold bars .
Exchange rate : According to this site , you can buy 2,000 tons of Kohlanese barley for 189 bars of Latinum .
Assuming Kohlanese barley is similar to the Earth kind , that would make one bar of Latinum worth about $ 1587 .
Or somewhat more , if you factor in shipping and handling .
We 're not even going to try and figure out an exchange rate for other Trek currencies like quatloos or Federation credits .

Cubits , the money used on Caprica and the other planets in the Twelve Colonies in Battlestar Galactica , both new and old versions .
It 's just coins in the old version , but there 's paper money as well as coins in the reinvention .
Exchange rate : Pretty much worthless , now that the Cylons have trashed everything .
That 's Starbuck tearing up a 1,000 cubit note in the picture above .
Solari , the currency used in the Dune universe .
Of course , Spice represents the true wealth , and the value of Solari is pretty much measured in how much Spice it can buy .
Exchange rate :
This site claims one solari is worth roughly one pound sterling , or U.S. $ 1.95 .
Dollarpounds , the currency used in the distant future of Red Dwarf .
Exchange rate : I 'm guessing about $ 0.30 to the dollarpound .
Olaf Petersen is able to buy a fancy house for just 2,000 dollarpounds — super cheap , because it's in a dome that has n't yet received an atmosphere .

As the BBC has been quick to point out , Dr Williams was not apparently arguing for nasty hand - chopping sharia .
No , he simply wants a little bit of civil sharia .
Just in a few cases .
Domestic disputes , you understand .
By consent , of course .
No " blank cheques " , whatever that means .
Yet , if Qutb 's Milestones is anything to go by , the kind of folk who want sharia - bar the odd Anglican clergyman - are unlikely to be satisfied with sharia 's limited application in a few civil cases .
However one looks at what Dr Williams said - and millions on Al Jazeera have - his comments can only have encouraged those inspired by Qutb 's teachings .
Qutb argued that God 's sovereignty over all the earth is violated wherever there is no sharia .
Anyone who therefore ignores sharia in favour of man-made laws cannot be a true Muslim .
Unlike Rowan Williams , Sayed Qutb - the intellectual architect of political Islamism - was never noted for his nuance .
Qutb 's 1964 manifesto , Milestones , is to the point ; sharia - the law of God - needs to be forcefully imposed on a decadent ( jahili ) world by a revolutionary Islamic vanguard .
Douglas Carswell , MP for Harwich & Clacton and a CentreRight contributor , explains why sharia cannot be implemented into UK law to any degree .
The Archbishop 's " clarification " that he does not want a parallel legal system does not really reassure .
Williams " only " seeks an acceptance by the English legal system of some aspects of sharia .
Perhaps this is a nuance they will miss in some madrassas .
And that 's surely the point .
It 's not really about what Church of England clergy think , nor even what the majority of us think they think .
What counts is how this plays among Muslims .
For pious British Muslims , devoted in their faith , yet steadfast in rejecting Qutb 's absolutism , Dr Williams just made an increasingly difficult position a bit less tenable .
The Archbishop seems to genuinely think his " sharia lite " will help community cohesion .
Yet even just calling for it has done the precise opposite .
Qutb 's once outlandish notion that without sharia one cannot be a true Muslim has been made a little more mainstream .
Worse than what Dr Williams said is his justification for saying it .
Apparently " sharia lite " is necessary since not all those living in our country are now able to relate to Britain 's legal system .
Think about that .
What can possibly have possessed the most senior clergyperson in the Church of England to believe that since not everyone can relate to the English legal system , we need to change our legal system ?
It is an affliction called " multiculturalism " .
Dr Williams no doubt believes he was talking about Islam , but his opaque utterances reveal far more about muddled Western ways of thinking .
Williams has inadvertently highlighted the enormity of the problem caused by the cultural relativism of our own Western elites .
Once you stop proclaiming allegiance to a common culture , and kid youself that all cultures are of equal worth , the Archbishop 's position becomes almost logical .
If all is of equal worth , and some who live here cannot relate to what is here already , changing what is here - as opposed to helping adapt the attitudes of the newcomers - becomes your norm .
Rather than social cohesion , public policy built on this bogus series of assumptions will make for fragmentation .
The politicians we elect have belatedly begun to wake up to this reality , but so what ?
Multicultural assumptions are now the default setting of the British State , its unelected institutions and unaccountable quangos - not merely the Anglican Church .
The most inspirational book I 've read in a long time is Ed Hussein 's The Islamist .
Why am I uplifted by a book which depressingly confirms that such a large chunk of youth in London , Birmingham and Bradford now heeds Qutb 's call ?
Because ultimately Hussein seems to show that Islam , and being a British Muslim , could be made compatible with the ideas of the Western Enlightenment .
How sad that the Archbishop should now put his church at odds with the ideals of the Enlightenment .
How tragic that our own nuanced elites should be the ones who break with what are universal ideals .
Researchers have found native gold , silver and platinum salts in the dust of decayed stumps .
A ton of their ashes contains 3 kilograms of silver , nearly 200 milligrams of gold and 5 grams of platinum .
These biogeochemical anomalies in complex ore deposit regions were formed by microbes and trees , which act as " gold - diggers " and draw soluble salts out of the soil and then die off , leaving behind the concentrate with enormous precious metals content .
The oxidation zone of some ore bodies is very close to the ground surface , within reach of tree roots .
That is why , the researchers believe , the soil contains almost as much noble elements as the ore does .
For centuries , trees and microorganisms gradually sucked them out of the depths and laid them in the soil .
A living substance decayed , washed out and turned into carbonic acid gas , but metals remained intact .
The researchers investigated mineralogical composition of protore and oxidized ores from the Dovatka and Mykert - Sanjeevsky deposits .
It has turned out that native gold , silver and minerals , which include platinum , palladium , iridium , rhodium and ruthenium , are contained in the extinct bacteria capsules .
The mineralogical composition of particles of bacterial origin turned out to be almost identical in the dust , soil and oxidized ores .
Consequently , biomass of the trees , ( reformed by bacteria ) , growing above the ore bodies ’ oxidation zones is as if their natural continuation or their overground part .
There is peculiar division of labor among bacteria in the course of soil enrichment by precious metals .
Sulfur - oxidizing bacteria leach minerals , i.e. , transfer minerals from not readily soluble forms into labile forms , and iron bacteria glue them into new granules or nuggets .
Trees assimilate the most readily soluble substances , which are later found in the cells of organolytic microbes feeding on dead timber .
The latter also ensures normal vital functions of the first two groups .

LOS ANGELES  Informal talks between representatives of Hollywood ’s striking writers and production companies have eliminated the major roadblocks to a new contract , which could lead to a tentative agreement as early as next week , according to people who were briefed on the situation but requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak .
A deal would end a crippling writers strike that is now entering its fourth month .
The agreement may come without renewed formal negotiations between the television and movie writers and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers , though both sides still need to agree on specific language of key provisions .
If that process goes smoothly , an agreement may be presented to the governing boards of the striking Writers Guild of America West and Writers Guild of America East by the end of next week , the people said .
The breakthrough occurred Friday after two weeks of closed - door discussions between the sides .
Even if approved by leaders of the guilds , a deal would require ratification by a majority of the more than 10,000 active guild members .
Writers walked out on Nov. 5 after failing to reach a new contract with producers in months of difficult bargaining .
Talks resumed briefly in December , but quickly broke off again .
The latest round of talks came more than two weeks ago in the wake of a tentative contract agreement between producers and the Directors Guild of America .
McCain ’s record includes ‘ some inconsistencies ’
Update :
This post has been updated , expanded , and broken down by category .
I ’m delighted the NYT noticed .
Senator John McCain likes to present himself as the candidate of the “ Straight Talk Express ” who does not pander to voters or change his positions with the political breeze .
But the fine print of his record in the Senate indicates that he has been a lot less consistent on some of his signature issues than he has presented himself to be so far in his presidential campaign .
Mr. McCain , who derided his onetime Republican competitor Mitt Romney for his political mutability , has himself meandered over the years from position to position on some topics , particularly as he has tried to court the conservatives who have long distrusted him .
For its part , the McCain campaign told the Times that the senator “ has evolved rather than switched positions in his 25 - year career . ”
That ’s a perfectly sensible spin — when a politician holds one position , and then , for apparently political reasons , decides to embrace the polar opposite position , it ’s only natural for his or her aides to say the politician ’s position has “ evolved . ”
But in McCain ’s case , the spin is wholly unfulfilling .
First , McCain sells himself as a pol who never sways with the wind , and whose willingness to be consistent in the face of pressure is proof of his character .
Second , Republicans have spent the last four years or so making policy reversals the single most serious political crime in presidential politics .
The dreaded “ flip - flop ” is , according to the GOP , the latest cardinal sin for someone seeking national office .
And if we ’re playing by Republican rules , McCain ’s “ inconsistencies ” should be a fairly serious problem .
With this in mind , for the first time in months , I thought now would be a good time to update the list of John McCain ’s Biggest Flip - Flops .
There have been some key additions since the last time I did this ( in November ) .
* McCain pledged in February 2008 that he would not , under any circumstances , raise taxes .
Specifically , McCain if he were a “ ‘ read my lips ’ candidate , no new taxes , no matter what ? ” referring to George H.W. Bush ’s 1988 pledge .
“ No new taxes , ” McCain responded .
Two weeks later , McCain said , “ I ’m not making a ‘ read my lips ’ statement , in that I will not raise taxes . ”
* McCain ’s campaign unveiled a Social Security policy that the senator would implement if elected , which did not include a Bush - like privatization scheme .
In March 2008 , McCain denounced his own campaign ’s policy .
* In February 2008 , McCain abandoned his opposition to waterboarding .
* In November 2007 , McCain reversed his previous position on a long - term presence for U.S. troops in Iraq , arguing that the “ nature of the society in Iraq ” and the “ religious aspects ” of the country make it inevitable that the United States “ eventually withdraws . ”
Two months later , McCain reversed back , saying he ’s prepared to leave U.S. troops in Iraq for 100 years .
* McCain used to champion the Law of the Sea convention , even volunteering to testify on the treaty ’s behalf before a Senate committee .
Now he opposes it .
* McCain was a co-sponsor of the DREAM Act , which would grant legal status to illegal immigrants ’ kids who graduate from high school .
Now he ’s against it .
* On immigration policy in general , McCain announced in February 2008 that he would vote against his own legislation .
* In 2006 , McCain sponsored legislation to require grassroots lobbying coalitions to reveal their financial donors .
In 2007 , after receiving “ feedback ” on the proposal , McCain told far - right activist groups that he opposes his own measure .
* McCain said before the war in Iraq , “ We will win this conflict .
We will win it easily . ”
Four years later , McCain said he knew all along that the war in Iraq war was “ probably going to be long and hard and tough . ”
* McCain said he was the “ greatest critic ” of Rumsfeld ’s failed Iraq policy .
In December 2003 , McCain praised the same strategy as “ a mission accomplished . ”
In March 2004 , he said , “ I ’m confident we ’re on the right course . ”
In December 2005 , he said , “ Overall , I think a year from now , we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course . ”
* McCain went from saying he would not support repeal of Roe v. Wade to saying the exact opposite .
* McCain went from saying gay marriage should be allowed , to saying gay marriage should n’t be allowed .
* McCain criticized TV preacher Jerry Falwell as “ an agent of intolerance ” in 2002 , but then decided to cozy up to the man who said Americans “ deserved ” the 9/11 attacks .
* McCain used to oppose Bush ’s tax cuts for the very wealthy , but he reversed course in February .
* On a related note , he said 2005 that he opposed the tax cuts because they were “ too tilted to the wealthy . ”
By 2007 , he denied ever having said this , and insisted he opposed the cuts because of increased government spending .
* In 2000 , McCain accused Texas businessmen Sam and Charles Wyly of being corrupt , spending “ dirty money ” to help finance Bush ’s presidential campaign .
McCain not only filed a complaint against the Wylys for allegedly violating campaign finance law , he also lashed out at them publicly .
In April , McCain reached out to the Wylys for support .
* McCain supported a major campaign - finance reform measure that bore his name .
In June 2007 , he abandoned his own legislation .
* McCain opposed a holiday to honor Martin Luther King , Jr. , before he supported it .
* McCain was against presidential candidates campaigning at Bob Jones University before he was for it .
* McCain was anti-ethanol .
Now he ’s pro-ethanol .
* McCain was both for and against state promotion of the Confederate flag .
* McCain decided in 2000 that he did n’t want anything to do with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , believing he “ would taint the image of the ‘ Straight Talk Express . ' ”
Kissinger is now the Honorary Co-Chair for his presidential campaign in New York .
Now , it ’s worth noting that there are worse qualities in a presidential candidate than changing one ’s mind about a policy matter or two .
McCain has been in Congress for decades ; he ’s bound to shift now and then on various controversies .
But therein lies the point — McCain was consistent on most of these issues , right up until he started running for president , at which point he conveniently abandoned practically every position he used to hold .
The problem is n’t just the incessant flip - flops ; it ’s the shameless pandering and hollow convictions behind the incessant flip - flops .
Update :
This post has been updated and expanded .
WASHINGTON  Six Guantánamo detainees who are accused of central roles in the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , will be shown all the evidence against them and will be afforded the same rights as American soldiers accused of crimes , the Pentagon said Monday as it announced the charges against them .
Military prosecutors will seek the death penalty for the six Guantánamo detainees on charges including conspiracy and murder “ in violation of the law of war , ” attacking civilians and civilian targets , terrorism and support of terrorism , Brig .
Gen. Thomas Hartmann of the Air Force , legal adviser to the Defense Department ’s Office of Military Commissions , said at a Pentagon news briefing .
General Hartmann said it would be up to the trial judge how to handle evidence obtained through controversial interrogation techniques like “ waterboarding , ” or simulated drowning .
Critics have said the harsh techniques , which are believed to have been used on several of the defendants , amount to torture .
As expected , the six include Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the former Qaeda operations chief who has described himself as the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks , which killed nearly 3,000 people .
The Pirate Bay just launched their new music section where artists are categorized utilizing tagging data from the popular music community , last .fm .
Together with the previously released music discovery feature , it makes it easier than ever to find music you like .
The music section is a beta release , but it already looks very promising .
It allows you to discover new artists based on hundreds of genres or tags .
True to the p2p nature of the site , The Pirate Bay uses the last .
fm API to collect their data .
Pirate Bay admin Brokep told us : “ The last . fm API is one of those things that add value to the internet as a whole , made by users for the users – it ’s like peer2 peer data . ”
The genre and artist based browsing is designed to make it easier for users of the site to find music they like , and just as importantly , to discover new artists .
Last.fm does not openly support The Pirate Bay , however , they said that everyone is free to use their API .
I ca n’t think of any better implementations of the API than this , and i’m sure that the last .
fm team love the idea as well , they just ca n’t say it out loud .
We will probably see more of these “ user friendly ” features integrated into other sites in the near future .
For example , FlixFlux , a BitTorrent site dedicated to movies has already a description , IMDB rating and trailers from YouTube for every film .
The possibilities are endless .
Genre based browsing
This thesis presents a new architecture for programming language interpreters , in which interpreters are not only first - class values , but are also arranged in a tower of meta - circular interpretation which is accessible reflectively --- so that a program may modify elements of the meta - circular tower under which it runs , and thus cause changes in the manner of its own interpretation .
To facilitate such modification , we develop a representation for interpreters that splits each interpreter into a language ( a collection of independently implemented constructs ) and an evaluator ( connecting the constructs together ) .
To implement such a mutable infinite meta - circular interpreter , we need another interpreter outside the tower , the meta-evaluator .
We present this , along with a systematic way of linking it to the meta - circular tower .
We show that a further form of meta - circularity may be introduced by bringing the meta-evaluator into the reflectively accessible part of the system ; and that this may be repeated without limit , using the same techniques .
These techniques for meta- interpretation are then shown to be similar to the ``language and evaluator '' model for interpretation , and a concise version of the system is presented that uses common code for many of these functions .
Provision for reflective and mixed language facilities pervade the infrastructure of the system .
We show that despite all this power , it is possible to implement such a system efficiently --- well within an order of magnitude of the performance of a single - language non-reflective system --- and we show how a wide range of languages may be implemented on this infrastructure , which also allows transparent mixed - language programming .

The beam of light is just wonderful ...

The Amazon S3 team is now beta - testing support for an important low - level networking feature which has the potential to significantly increase the performance of large data transfers to and from S3 , particularly ( but not limited to ) for long distance data transfers .
In particular , there is a new beta endpoint which supports the RFC 1323 model for TCP window scaling .
With this option in effect , a larger amount of data can be in transit across the network at any given time , reducing the impact of speed - of - light delays as data is broken down in to chunks , sent across the internet , verified , and acknowledged .
When the two nodes in question are far apart , the time that it takes for the data to travel from sender to receiver ( and for the acknowledgments to travel back ) turns out to be just as important as the raw data transfer rate .
Per the thread in the Amazon S3 Forum , early results from the beta testers are quite good with reported speedups of 4 x to 18 x !
If you are moving large amounts of data into or out of S3 then you will definitely want to implement this feature .
Note that we are supporting this through a beta endpoint .
The endpoint will be present for the duration of the test and will then vanish .
Of course you wo n’t want to embed this endpoint in any shrink - wrapped software .
You will need to dig deep into your operating system ’s networking setting in order to take advantage of this new feature .
For Linux systems the information here will get you started ( there ’s also some information for other operating systems in there too ) .
Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 users can start at this Knowledge Base article .
I know nothing about the Mac except that my youngest daughter keeps asking me for one .
I would also recommend that you read this very informative article by Brian Tierney for further background information and some formulas and recommendations on how to calculate and set the optimal window size .

The Demonoid torrent tracker has gone the way of OiNK and ( apparently ) Albumbase before it , after the CRIA ( Canadian Recording Industry Association ) started playing hardball with the site 's hosting company .
A note on the site reads ,
" The CRIA threatened the company renting the servers to us , and becauseof this it is not possible to keep the site online .
Sorry for theinconvenience and thanks for your understanding . "
That 's one more mole down ; infinite more moles for the labels to whack .

“ Feedback is a gift ” - Craig Brown
Once upon a time , in the early part of their careers , two rookies from a semiconductor supplier were involved in a major annual review with one of their company 's largest customers .
The head of the customer crew that had descended upon their facility was very impressed with the presentation that these rookies had given in the morning , and invited them to join him for lunch .
During this short break , they immediately established a good level of rapport and trust .
At the end of the day , back in the conference room , the customers wrapped - up as usual with feedback about their supplier ’s performance .
Unusually , this time , the head of the customer crew asked the rookies directly , " Please give us honest feedback about how we are doing ? "
This was a surprise for these rookies , who were momentarily taken aback .
However , since they were impressed by the humility and commitment to improvement that the customer was demonstrating , the rookies enthusiastically started delivering " Honest Feedback " about their customer .
As this feedback progressed , one of the rookies noticed that the other seven members ( managers , engineers , a quality guy and some buyers ) of the customer crew were constantly interrupting and explaining that things had to be that way because of the nature of their business and elegance of their technology .
Also the faces of those magnificent seven seemed to be getting pinker and pinker .
The rookies could n’t figure out whether their faces were flushing with joy , or with something else .
Two days later , the rookies were summoned into their Boss ’ Boss office .
Their own boss was also present ; and both those gentlemen ’s faces looked pink and red , just like the faces of the seven customer folks two days earlier .
The big boss said that he had to field several calls from upset customer people .
" What did you do ? "
The rookies said , " The customer V.P. asked for honest feedback .
So we gave him many improvement ideas and told him what other companies did better . "
The bosses , faces still red , could not contain the laughter ; even though it seemed that they really did not want to do that .
The big boss said , " Honest , but not that honest ! "
Then he said ( kind of admiringly ) , " Get the hell out of here . "
Upon hearing about the episode , some senior employees were convinced that there would soon be a going - away party for the rookies .
Sequel :
A week later , the rookies were again summoned in to the big boss ’s office .
The customer V.P. had sent two boxes for the rookies .
Each box contained one tie pin representing his company ’s products ; one was a model of fighter jet F15 and the other was a model of the fighter jet F18 .
I think one of the rookies may still have the tie pin in a safe deposit box .
Reflection :
A feedback is a Gift .
And that " Gift " deserves a gift for the person who gives you that " Gift . "

According to Kripalu Ji Maharaj , the ultimate goal of a soul is only supreme Divine Bliss , and for attaining that , we are trying constantly , every single moment .
But up to now , we have n't received that Bliss .
There are only two fields : the field of maya , and the field of God .
We have attained a lot in the mayic field , to the extent that we have even become Indra , emperor of the celestial abodes , hundreds of times .
You always experience happiness in the world - that of your mother , father , child , wife , husband , wealth .
You have experienced these kinds of happiness a lot - but it all amounts to zero .
From this world one only gets tension and peacelessness , so it is proven that in the mayic field there is no true happiness anywhere .
So where is it ?
What remains is God 's field .
It might be there .
It 's not necessary to apply your intellect a lot to understand this .
For example , two people are together , and you only know their names : Ramesh and Dinesh .
If someone were to point out to you , " That one is Dinesh , " then you could understand that the other person is Ramesh .
Thus , if we were to firmly decide , " There is no happiness in the world , " then we could know it is in the Divine field , but we have n't determined this .
Instead we think , " This situation with my wife , husband , friend , etc. , is no good .
Everyone else 's wife , husband , friend , etc. is good .
We have n't determined that it 's the same everywhere , whether it relates to a prime minister 's home or Indra 's home , everyone is unhappy , sorrowful , peaceless .
So how could we find God 's Bliss ?
This is a big question , because if someone tries hard his whole life to earn a million or a billion dollars , he might be successful , he might not .
So how does one get unlimited , spiritual happiness , supreme Divine Bliss ?
We ca n't visualize God anywhere .
There are Deities , but we want to see
His actual form so we can ask Him to give us that Bliss .
How does one receive Divine Bliss from God ?
There are three methods to attain something from someone .
You can grab him , tie him up , and forcibly snatch it from him .
You can steal it from him .
You can humbly beg him for it .
Which one will you choose ?
It 's impossible to threaten God and tie him up .
There is no one equal to Him ; who could be greater than Him ?
And stealing from Him ?
He is omnipresent , omniscient .
Stealing is only possible when the other person does n't know you are doing it .
Even before you stole , when you were planning to steal , God made a note of your thoughts from inside .
So this wo n't work .
The third option is to beg from Him .
How ?
In Sanskrit , English , Hindi , Uriya , Bangla , Punjabi ?
No , not like that .
Ask him like a newborn baby .
You people might not remember that when you were an infant , you could n't speak a single word , nor could you indicate anything , nor did you even recognize your own mother .
How did you survive ?
You had a weapon : you simply cried .
When your mother heard your cries , she ran to you , " Why is my baby crying ? ! "
Several months passed like this .
We have to get back to this stage of an innocent child who has no strength , no means to help himself , who does n't even recognize his own mother , who can't demand or ask anything of his mother .
What will such a child do ?
Just cry .
God says , " Do n't come to me with strength .
Become powerless , destitute , without any means , humble . "
Feel more humble than a blade of grass .
Be more tolerant than a tree .
Respect all and do n’t desire respect for yourself .
These are three axioms written by Gaurang Mahaprabhu .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- While Sen. John McCain was inching toward the Republican presidential nomination , Sen. Barack Obama staked a claim as the Democratic front - runner .
Obama 's wins in the District of Columbia , Maryland and Virginia primaries propelled him past Sen. Hillary Clinton in the race for delegates .
According to CNN calculations , Obama has 1,215 delegates to Clinton 's 1,190 .
To clinch the Democratic nomination , a candidate must get 2,025 delegates .
Obama had led in pledged delegates , but Clinton had held the lead when superdelegates were factored in .
Superdelegates , a group of almost 800 Democratic Party officials and leaders , are not required to make their votes public and are free to change their minds .
The Illinois senator has now won eight consecutive contests .
McCain , the presumptive nominee for the Republican party , has 812 delegates to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee 's 217 , according to CNN estimates .
See CNN 's political team analyze Tuesday 's results »
A GOP candidate needs 1,191 delegates to secure the nomination .
" The change we seek swept through Chesapeake and over the Potomac , " Obama told supporters Tuesday night .
" We won the state of Maryland .
We won the commonwealth of Virginia .
And though we won in Washington , D.C. , this movement wo n't stop until there is change in Washington , D.C. , and tonight we 're on our way . "
Watch Obama rally supporters »
McCain saluted Huckabee after the results came in but turned his campaign toward the general election , saying he would offer " a better understanding of the challenges we face " than either of the Democratic front - runners .
" We know where either of their candidates will lead this country , and we dare not let them , " the Arizona senator said , without mentioning the Democratic candidates by name .
Watch McCain talk about what 's ahead »
McCain , who has come under criticism from conservatives who say he is too liberal to be the Republican nominee , carried the conservative vote in Maryland , according to exit polls .
See what some top conservatives say about McCain »
Huckabee , however , fared better with conservatives in Virginia .
He vowed to stay in the race despite losing three more primaries , pledging to give voters in the coming primaries " a solid , conservative , absolute pro-life candidate " as an alternative to McCain .
" The nomination is not secured until somebody has 1,191 delegates , " Huckabee said .
" That has not yet happened .
We 're still continuing to work and to give voters in these states a choice . "
Watch why Huckabee says he 's marching on »
Obama did well with Democrats across race and gender lines Tuesday night , and seems to be eating away at Clinton 's backbone of support : women .
According to exit polls out of Virginia and Maryland , Obama won roughly 60 percent of the female vote -- a demographic that has carried Clinton to success in past primaries .
Clinton fared worse among men -- more than two - thirds in both states chose Obama .
Meanwhile , Obama scored his highest percentage of African - American support to date , winning close to 90 percent of that voting bloc in each state .
The two evenly split the white vote in Virginia , while Clinton slightly beat Obama among whites in Maryland .
In most past primaries , Clinton has held an edge among white voters .
Tuesday , Obama even beat Clinton among Latino voters , a group that has heavily favored Clinton in most past primaries .
In Virginia and Maryland , Latinos went for Obama over Clinton by 6 points , though their support was not decisive in either contest -- only 5 percent of Democratic primary voters in Virginia and 4 percent in Maryland were Latino .
The only demographic Clinton won was white women , who broke for her over Obama by 10 points in Virginia and 13 points in Maryland .
Clinton turned her attention to Texas , which holds its primary on March 4 .
" We 're going to sweep across Texas in the next three weeks , bringing our message about what we need in America ...
I 'm tested , I 'm ready .
Let 's make it happen , " the New York senator told a crowd in El Paso .
Watch Clinton campaign in Texas »
Candidates from both parties face off again next Tuesday in Wisconsin and Washington , and Hawaii holds its Democratic caucuses then .
March 4 is another delegate - rich day , with contests in Ohio , Rhode Island , Texas and Vermont .
McCain needs 379 more delegates to clinch his party 's nomination .

Hillary Clinton's War Vote
We ’re making calls right now , but here ’s a promo to give you a head start :
The return of the war vote : what does Hillary Clinton ’s 2002 vote authorizing the Iraq
War say about her 2008 campaign , the future of the war , and the political calculus of never saying “ I ’m sorry ” ?
( More to follow . )
What do you think ?
[ mcotner / Flickr ]
Here ’s the short course : On October 11th 2002 , Hillary Clinton voted to authorize President Bush to use military force against Iraq .
She later called that vote “ probably the hardest decision I have ever had to make . ”
The previous day , she had voted against the Levin amendment , which would have required UN approval for the use of force against Iraq ; and , failing that , another Congressional vote authorizing the President to use American military force .
That same day , she had also voted for a Byrd amendment that would have set a time limit on the use of US forces in Iraq — but that also included procedures for extending the date .
Clinton ’s other notable Senate action on that day was drawing a link between Saddam Hussein and al - Qaeda , saying Saddam had given “ aid , comfort and sanctuary to terrorists , including Al Qaeda members . ”
As the Iraq war has grown unpopular , Clinton ’s public position on it has also changed .
She now vocally champions troop withdrawal .
She blames George W. Bush “ who misled this country and this Congress . ”
She says , about her own 2002 vote , “ Knowing what we know now , I would never have voted for it . ”
Unlike John Edwards , though , what she has n’t done is apologize for it .
So the big questions :
Did she vote yes , in 2002 , for political reasons or because she genuinely believed that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the US — or both ?
Why on earth did she vote against the Levin amendment if she hoped President Bush would pursue all possible diplomatic options ?
Why did she use the Bush administration ’s rhetorical device of linking Saddam with al - Qaeda ?
What ’s behind her decision not to apologize ?
And how is all of this playing out in the 2008 presidential campaign ?

If you enjoy Chess , but want to spice it up a bit , you ’ll probably enjoy some of the games in this post , which introduce the random element of cards into the royal game .
The first game (s ) you might consider are Knightmare Chess and Knightmare Chess 2 ( there is also a slightly different French language version called “ Tempête sur L’echiquier ” ) designed by Bruno Faidutti .
This game is a kind of mix between Chess and a trading card game like Magic the Gathering .
You ’ll hold a hand of cards which will let you do some special event each turn ( e.g .
“ For this turn , any one of your pieces may move as if it were a Knight .
You cannot capture a piece with this move . ” )
Faidutti , a French historian and sociologist , is one of the best - known and respected game designers .
His games tend to have a strongly chaotic element .
His most popular game , which I highly recommend , is Citadels ( “ Citadelles ” in French ) , which is best played with large numbers of players ( up to seven , and the closer to that number , the better ) .
Faidutti has an exceptional web - site , particularly notable for his Ideal Game Library , reviewing hundreds of games .
Returning to the subject of cards and Chess , the other set of games I want to recommend is Karten Schach , designed by Reiner Knizia , the prolific German mathematician and game designer whom I already discussed in this post .
Karten Schach was a labor of love by Knizia ( I ca n’t imagine he thought it would sell very well , and the rulebook is over 100 pages , mostly taken up by discussions of the game mechanics , with plentiful strategy tips ) .
It is actually collection of 16 games ( plus variants ) highlighting all sorts of different possibilities in game design ; a kind of game design version of Bach ’s variations .
The names of the games give you a flavor of the possibilities : “ Purist Chess , ” “ Liar ’s Chess , ” “ Ducat Chess , ” “ Daredevil Chess , ” “ Gambler ’s Chess , ” “ Psycho Chess , ” “ Cornucopian Chess , ” “ Feudal Chess , ” “ Generational Chess , ” “ Oracle Chess , ” “ Prophet ’s Chess , ” “ Eunuch ’s Chess , ” “ Doppelganger Chess , ” “ Wicked Witch Chess , ” “ Mysterious Stranger ’s Chess , ” and “ Capitalist Chess . ”
Without explaining the rules in detail , I ’ll just briefly describe how a couple are played .
In Oracle Chess , you must , at the end of each move , put a card face down which commits you to the piece you will move next turn .
In Capitalist Chess , on each turn a card is chosen , and you bid chips to have the right to move the piece displayed on the card .
Each game is defined by less than a page of brilliant rules , by the master of boardgame design .
I would recommend that you buy Karten Schach , but it has been out of print since 2001 , and the publisher has gone out of business .
So instead I will point you to the English translation of the rules by Christine Biancheria and a pdf file for the Cards necessary to play the game .
( Thanks to Matthew Gray , for pointing me to the English rules translations when they came out . )
And just as I did for Faidutti , I ’d also like to recommend one much more mainstream multi-player Knizia game ( in case Chess variants are not your cup of tea ) .
The Knizia game I ’ll recommend is “ Modern Art , ” , one of the most highly rated of the German games ; a classic in the auction game genre .

Ray Kurzweil has plenty of titles already : inventor , author , futurist , techno - optimist , artificial intelligence expert .
Now he 's adding a Hollywood gloss to that list by writing , directing , producing and acting in his first feature film .
He 's adapting his latest book to make a movie titled The Singularity Is Near : A True Story About The Future .
The " technological singularity " is a concept that 's enchanting to some , like Kurzweil , and terrifying to others .
As a result of the exponential progress of technology , Kurzweil believes , we 're racing towards a day when the power of the artificially intelligent machines we create will exceed human brainpower .
Our computers will then carry on fashioning a new world – with luck , they 'll keep our best interests in mind .
Wired News talked to Kurzweil about the movie that he hopes will give us a glimpse into that world .
Wired News :
Can you tell me a bit about the structure of the movie ?
Ray Kurzweil :
There 's an intertwined A - line and B - line :
The A - line is a documentary , and the B - line is a narrative .
Did you see What The Bleep Do We Know !?
I did n't like the movie that much .
But you can convey information well with that structure .
On its own , the narrative line is so specific , it can't give you all the information .
But sitting through 100 minutes of a documentary can be ponderous .
So we 're combining the two .
WN : What 's in the documentary part ?
Kurzweil :
It contains footage of myself , and also me interviewing 20 big thinkers , talking about their ideas , and their ideas about my ideas .
We have people like Eric Drexler , one of the founders of nanotech ; Aubrey de Grey , a theorist about radical life extension ; Bill Joy .
Bill Joy had a famous cover story in Wired that created a firestorm , because you had a technological leader talking about the dire prospects of technology .
His article was based on my previous book , The Age of Spiritual Machines .
He and I are often compared .
Even though I 'm known as an optimist , I 've always investigated the promise of new technology versus the peril .
In that Wired article , Bill Joy focused on the peril .
WN : So you 're debating some of these people in the interviews ?
Kurzweil : Yes , there 's Bill McKibben – have you ever heard about this phenomenon called global warming ?
Well , he coined the term .
He has a book called Enough , where he says we should not pursue more GNR – that 's genetics , nanotech , robotics .
He argues for the relinquishment view , and says , " Let 's relinquish these new technologies , they 're too dangerous . "
That 's not a view I can accept , for three reasons .
One , it would deprive us of all the benefits , like curing cancer .
One of the questions I ask him is , " If you really want to stop global warming and wean us from fossil fuels , and ( technological progress ) is the only way to do it , would you give it up ? "
Second , it would require an authoritarian system to implement such a drastic change .
Third , it would n't work , it would just drive the technology underground .
WN : OK , that 's the A - line .
What 's the narrative you use for a B - line ?
Kurzweil :
The narrative story is an outgrowth of the Ramona Project , which I started in the year 2000 .
I gave a presentation at TED 2001 ( the Technology Entertainment Design conference ) – the theme was that in virtual reality you can be someone else .
I turned myself into a computer avatar named Ramona .
I had magnetic sensors in my clothing , picking up all my motions and sending the data to Ramona , who followed my movements in real time .
My voice was turned into Ramona 's voice , so it looked like she was giving the presentation .
I was standing next to the screen , so people could see what was happening .
A band came onstage , and I sang two songs : " White Rabbit , " and a song I wrote called " Come Out and Play . "
Then my daughter came out , who was 14 at the time , and she was turned into a male backup dancer .
Her avatar was in the form of Richard Saul Wurman , the impresario of the conference .
He 's kind of a heavyset gentleman , not known for his hip - hop kicks , so it was quite a show .
WN : Ramona is also a presence on your website , right ?
You can interact with her , ask her questions , and sort of test her artificial intelligence .
Kurzweil : Right .
It 's a real 20 - year project of mine , to create an AI that can pass the Turing Test .
WN : So in the movie 's narrative , Ramona the avatar is the main character ?
Kurzweil : It 's a Pinocchio story .
She detects a " gray goo " attack , an attack of self - replicating nanobots .
The Department of Homeland Security is oblivious to this , and wo n't listen to her , so she gets her other avatar friends to work on this .
But she breaks some homeland security protocols in the process .
She 's arrested – and there 's a discussion about how you can arrest a virtual person .
She hires ( civil rights attorney ) Alan Dershowitz to defend her , and also to establish her rights as a legal person .
She feels she 's human enough to have human rights .
There 's a whole courtroom scene , and finally the judge says , " OK , I 'll grant your legal rights if you can pass the Turing Test . "
She hires Tony Robbins , the motivational speaker , to help her become more human , and the plot goes on from there .
WN : You 're making a thriller !
That 's ambitious .
How far along in the process are you ?
Kurzweil :
We have filmed the whole A - line documentary , and we 're editing it now .
We 're in pre-production for the B - line ; we will shoot that in the spring .
This will be released in late '08 .
WN : Who 's playing Ramona ?
Kurzweil :
It stars Pauley Perrette , who plays a very gothy , punky computer sleuth in ( TV crime show ) NCIS .
She 's perfect for the part .
I play myself in the future , and I have a complex relationship with this woman in the movie .
She 's a creation of mine , kind of like a daughter of mine , but ancient taboos are n't relevant , so there 's a romantic element .
And she 's trying to become independent , so there 's a Pinocchio aspect .
WN : You 've already written a book explaining your theories about the approach of singularity ; why did you want to do a movie ?
To spread the meme further ?
Kurzweil : Yes , but it's not just an idle desire to spread the meme – like , I had this idea , and now I want everyone to know about it .
There 's so much discussion that 's totally unrealistic , because people are not aware of this topic .
Al Gore gets up there to do his PowerPoint presentation on global warming , and he says , " Within 100 years , carbon levels will be here , " as if nothing 's going to change !
As if it 's going to be the same old world in 100 years .
He never once mentions nanotechnology .
WN : So you 're trying to make people understand how the exponential advances in technology will abruptly and unexpectedly solve many of the world 's problems ?
Kurzweil :
Think how different the world was 10 years ago – 10 years ago , most people did n't use search engines .
That sounds like ancient history now .
Generally , people think linearly .
I think it 's critical that people understand that linear thinking no longer applies .
If we capture one part out of 10,000 of sunlight that falls on the earth , we can solve our energy problems .
And nanotech will give us the capacity to store ( that solar energy ) .
Radical life extensions mean that the current discussion of social security is completely unrealistic .
People say , " Oh , there 's going to be a deficit in 2027 . "
Their model is based on linear predictions on longevity , productivity and economic growth .
The situation will be different when you have 65 - year - olds who look and act 35 years old .
WN : It 's certainly true that linear thinking runs through everything we do .
Kurzweil :
For thousands of years , it actually served our needs to think linearly .
If you think about our genes and our brains , they obviously evolved into their modern forms before advanced technology .
If you saw something in the trees coming towards you , and you made a linear projection about where it would be in 15 seconds , and where you needed to not be , that actually worked very well .
But these days we have different kinds of problems , and we need a different kind of thinking .
FORMER Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee has decisively won the Republican caucuses in Iowa , clinching once and for all his status as the most distinguished graduate of Ouchita Baptist University .
With his newly minted frontrunner status , Mr Huckabee 's economic policy is sure to garner closer scrutiny .
It is no secret that Mr Huckabee is despised among those elements of the GOP coalition who prioritise limited government and low taxes .
The Club for Growth , a low tax pressure group , has not minced words :
Nominating Mike Huckabee for president or vice - president , would constitute an abject rejection of the free - market , limited - government , economic conservatism that has been the unifying theme of the Republican Party for decades .
The libertarian Cato Institute has given Huckabee a dismal lifetime " D " grade in its " Fiscal Policy Report Card on America 's Governors " , including an " F " for his final term .
But Iowa Republicans were evidently unfased .
The lesson is either that traditional fiscal conservatism is becoming less central to the American conservative creed , that Mr Huckabee successfully convinced Iowa voters that he does not break the fiscal conservative mold , or , most likely , both .
In an effort to appear a tax hawk , Mr Huckabee has signed the American 's for Tax Reform ( activist Grover Norquist 's outfit ) no - new - taxes pledge .
He has promoted the FairTax , a 23 percent national sales tax that would replace the income tax , as if it will cure male pattern baldness and walk your dog .
But the Fair Tax seems to be rather ill - conceived , as economist Bruce Bartlett explains at length in " Why the FairTax Wo n't Work " [ pdf ] .
Despite the talk of abolishing the tax bureaucracy , the FairTax would require a complicated system of rebate checks , lest it turn out to be badly regressive and , well , unfair .
The real rate , Mr Bartlett argues , would have to be around 30 percent to maintain current revenue levels , which strikes voters as rather less attractive .
There would be significant compliance problems , people having gained an incentive to exchange outside the official taxable system .
And there would be manifold complexities in administration -- complexities that have led every almost every country in the world with a consumption tax to prefer a value - added tax , or VAT .
But Americans are not clamoring for a tax system more like France's .
The attractions of the FairTax , then , seem to rest in a number of promises it cannot realistically deliver , which may turn out to be an embarrassment for Mr Huckabee down the line .
Moreover , Mr Huckabee , who famously lost 8 stone while in office , seems more interested in trimming American waistlines than the American budget deficit — unless it comes to the same thing .
When asked about fiscal discipline in debates he has emphasised the potential medical savings from weight loss as a way to trim America ’s monstrous Medicare liability , though it is unclear what form of suasion could get chubby Americans to put down their burgers and pick up barbells .
He gestures toward support for a line - item veto as a way of cutting budgetary fat , but he is vague about what exactly he would cut , given the presidency and an amended constitution .
New Hampshire voters are said to be somewhat less open to the charms of smooth - talking Baptist preachers , so Mr Huckabee may need to do more there to sell his economic conservative bona fides .
If he can pull it off , the man may really have a future .
Here 's an amazing - but - true fact for you : not everybody was trying to copy Nintendo 's Super Mario Bros. at the close of the Nintendo Entertainment System era .
Some publishers were trying to copy Capcom 's Bionic Commando .
That brings us to the next installment of Beyond Beeps in which I guide you through some of my favorite video gaming soundtracks that deserve some time in the spotlight .
Today we 'll be listening to clips from Atlus 's Rockin ' Kats , a fun little NES platformer that took the classic cats versus dogs rivalry and applied a little bionic arm action to the mix .
A little title screen music if you please !
Rockin '
Kats is presented as a multi-episode television series in which each episode has the same basic plot : feline Willy is searching for his girlfriend Jill who has been kidnapped by the local criminal kingpin , Mugsy the bulldog .
This little tune plays on the level selection screen .

Each episode takes Willy to a different TV - inspired level .
One channel is set against an amusement park , for example , while another takes place in the old west .
Below we have the level tunes for the first channel : a snippet from the city streets overworld followed by the rockin ' subway theme .

Willy is a typical action platformer hero in that he must walk and jump his way through these different worlds , although the twist comes with Willy 's weapon of choice .
Our hero cannot jump onto enemies to defeat them , but instead makes uses of the traditional cartoon sping - loaded boxing glove to get the job done .
Enemies can either be punched directly or ( and here 's the Bionic Commando angle )
Willy can latch onto ledges with the glove and spin 360 degrees around the attach point , whacking enemies who wander into radius of the swing .
The punchglove is also used to swing and flip Willy over and across all manner of obstacles .
Most levels move in a left - to - right fashion with an emphasis on pounding enemies , but there are several large underground vertical segments that rely on Willy 's punchglove flipping abilities .
Below we hear the murky sewer theme .

At the end of each level Willy comes up against one of Mugsy 's criminal accomplicies such as the maniacally musical Bull Band or Mugsy 's own pet eagle .
Each boss encounter begins with a brief conversation between Willy , Jill , and Mugsy that sets up the battle .
Here we have the music that plays during these conversations and the battle itself .

Vladimir Putin has used one of the last major speeches of his presidency to deliver a defiant message to the West , accusing it of unleashing a new arms race that left Moscow no choice but to retaliate in kind .
Less than a month before presidential elections that his hand - picked successor is almost certain to win , the speech removed any lingering doubts that Russian foreign policy might become less aggressive after Mr Putin steps down .
" It 's clear that a new arms race is unfolding in the world , " said Mr Putin , one that Russia did not start .
And he vowed that Russia would respond to the threats by developing newer and more modern weapons that were as good as if not better than those possessed by Western countries .
" We are being forced into retaliating ... Russia has and always will have the answers to these challenges , " he said .
The speech in which he also condemned Nato expansion came as defence chiefs of the 26 - nation alliance , increasingly alarmed by Russia 's flexing of its military muscles , met in Vilnius , the Lithuanian capital , and urged Moscow to tone down its rhetoric .

Russian bomber patrols have recently been made over the Atlantic , Pacific and Arctic oceans and approached close to the borders of Nato airspace .
Two Russian Tupolev -95 aircraft strayed south from their routine patrol pattern off the Norwegian coast and headed towards Scotland last September .
In the most recent incident , two long - range " Blackjack " bombers flew to the Bay of Biscay off France and Spain to test - launch missiles .
The Russians have also hinted they want to re-establish a naval presence in the Mediterranean , probably using Syrian ports .
The strategy is designed to heighten the visibility of Russia 's military might but the sabre - rattling has alarmed Western countries and fuelled talk of a new Cold War .
Mr Putin went into overdrive yesterday , painting Russia as the victim of Western aggression and expansion , and promised a Russian response .
He said Western countries spent far more on defence than Russia , and also returned to a theme he has raised many times before – that of Nato enlargement towards Russian borders .
" We pulled out of bases in Cuba and Vietnam , " he said .
" And what did we get ?
New American bases in Bulgaria and Romania . "
He also complained about US plans to build elements of a missile defence system in Poland and the Czech Republic .
" They try to persuade us that all these actions are not aimed against Russia , " he said , " but they have no constructive answers to our well - founded concerns . "
Russia has previously threatened to deploy nuclear missiles in its Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad if the US goes ahead with its plans .
Russia 's annual defence spending has quadrupled since Mr Putin came to power and the Kremlin has announced a £ 100 bn programme to modernise ageing military hardware .
Symbolically ominous changes are under way too : Russia recently announced that vast parades in Red Square to showcase the nation 's military strength are to be revived this year for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Mr Putin also accused unnamed foreign countries of cynically trying to gain unfair access to Russia 's natural resources .
" Many conflicts , foreign policy acts and diplomatic démarches smell of oil and gas , " he said .
" This is the context in which we understand the growing interest towards Russia . "
He said the sovereignty of certain countries had been completely destroyed under slogans of freedom and democracy .
The speech was broadcast live on Russian television .
Mr Putin was addressing the State Council , an influential gathering of the country 's elite , including Dmitry Medvedev , the man virtually guaranteed to be Russia 's next president .
Also present was the Chelsea owner , Roman Abramovich , Russia 's richest man , attending in his capacity as governor of Russia 's Chukotka region .
Mr Putin has consistently portrayed Western attempts to foster democracy in Russia as nefarious intentions .
Last month , he told the security services to beware of foreign meddling in the upcoming presidential elections , and earlier this week the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe announced it would not monitor the election because of an unco-operative attitude from Russian officials .
Yesterday 's bellicose remarks came at the end of a speech devoted to outlining achievements during his eight years in office and setting out a blueprint of Russia 's development to 2020 .
He rattled off economic and social achievements over
the past eight years , boasting that Russians were now immeasurably better off than eight years ago , and laid out a development strategy to improve incomes , life expectancy , and quality of life for Russians by 2020 .
Bizarrely , Mr Putin made no reference in his speech to the fact that the presidency will soon be changing hands , and spoke repeatedly of what " we " need to do .
Mr Medvedev , who is virtually certain to win the elections on 2 March , has asked Mr Putin to stay on as prime minister
LarouchePac.com — Rep. Raul M. Grijalva ( D - AZ ) became the 23rd Congressman to co-sponsor the resolution ( H.R. 799 , formerly H.R. 333 ) introduced by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .
Grijalva , who represents the 7th Congressional District in Arizona , embracing Tucson and Nogales , is the son of a Mexican migrant worker .
He is the 2nd Vice Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus .
According to the Library of Congress , Rep. Grijalva added his name on Dec. 5 .
He is the first Congressman to join the effort to impeach Cheney since Kucinich raised the resolution on the floor of the House of Representatives and it was referred to the Judiciary Committee for consideration .
Although , as Lyndon LaRouche has stated , the recent National Intelligence Estimate that Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program in 2003 has made it more difficult for Cheney to launch an attack on Iran , as long as Cheney remains in office the danger still exists that a major staged incident could still provide the pretext Cheney so desperately desires for sabotaging the peace process supported by LaRouche , which took a step forward at Annapolis .

Damien Miller ( djm@ ) , who worked on this new feature with Markus Friedl ( markus@ ) , offers more details about ChrootDirectory :
More from Damien follows .
Unfortunately , setting up a chroot ( 2 ) environment is complicated , fragile and annoying to maintain .
The most frequent reason our users have given when asking for chroot support in sshd is so they can set up file servers that limit semi-trusted users to be able to access certain files only .
Because of this , we have made this particular case very easy to configure .
In a previous commit , markus@ implemented an " in-process " sftp server in sshd , basically linking sftp - server ( 8 ) into sshd ( 8 ) .
When the in - process sftp server is used , sshd does not need any special chroot configuration ( no / dev nodes , no libraries , no statically - linked sftp - server ) so the chroot setup and maintenance burden is eliminated .
The chroot support does work for login and command - execution sessions too , but administrators will need to configure the chroot environment manually .
To set up a restricted sftp server one should use the " ForceCommand " and " ChrootDirectory " directives in sshd_config .
Presumably most people will not want to restrict every user , so they should also use the " Match " directive to select a user or group to apply the restrictions to .
For example :
Match user djm ForceCommand internal - sftp ChrootDirectory / chroot
This will cause the user ' djm ' to be chrooted to the " / chroot " directory at login , and the use of the in - process sftp server will be forced for all connections .
I.e. the user will not be able to login interactively , or run arbitrary commands - the login will only be useful for sftp transfers .
Note that the user 's home directory may exist under the " / chroot " directory above ( e.g. " / chroot / home /djm " ) and sshd will try to chdir to it before starting to serve files , but it does n't matter if it does not exist .
Setting up a safe chroot jail is somewhat tricky , and it is quite easy to make to compromise one 's security .
To reduce this risk , sshd ensures the ChrootDirectory and each of its components is root - owned and not writable by other users , but it is still possible for administrators to break their own setups by doing dumb things ( e.g. leaving / dev nodes for the physical drives in a chroot , executing scripts inside the chroot from cron( 8 ) or elsewhere , etc. ) .
A limitation of the chroot support is that the in - process sftp server does not support scp ( 1 ) transfers .
scp is a really busted protocol and it would be a fair bit more work to build it in in the way we have built in sftp .
It is still possible to support chrooted scp , but administrators will need to populate the chroot environment manually .
Please use sftp instead .
During this year ’s primary campaign , much has been made about Mrs. Clinton ’s ties to campaign cash from lobbyists .
Is it possible to accept massive donations from K Street lobbyists and not be influenced by them ?
Mrs. Clinton came to her own defense on this issue .
She argued that these lobbyists , to use her exact words , “ represent real Americans . ”
She went on to point out that some of these real Americans included “ nurses , social workers and corporations that employ a lot of people . ”
Mrs. Clinton ’s point was that it is perfectly acceptable for her to take money from lobbyists because , in representing “ real Americans ” , lobbyists give voice to the issues and concerns of the American people .
What could be more democratic than a process that gives “ real Americans ” a chance to raise their issues and concerns with their elected representatives ?
The lobbying process , according to Mrs. Clinton , is an opportunity for “ real Americans ” to influence their own government by educating the Congress and trying to influence legislation and policy .
She justified taking cash from lobbyists representing real Americans and then , to prove her independence , stated she would not be influenced by them .
She takes their money because they are real people with real concerns and then says it 's OK to take their money because she will not be influenced by what they say .
Here is Mrs. Clinton ’s full statement :

British pilot has been fired after doing a fly - by with a new Boeing 777-330 ER at Paine Field in Everett , Seattle last month .
SEATTLE - A British pilot has been fired after doing a fly - by with a new Boeing 777-330 ER at Paine Field in Everett last month .
British newspapers report that Captain Ian Wilkinson , 55 , flew the Cathay Pacific jet at 300 mph just 28 feet above the ground without landing gear in a ceremonial fly - by on a delivery flight .
Several VIPs - including airline executives and Hong Kong lawmakers - were aboard .
The incident occurred on Jan. 30 , when the airplane , the sixth of 30 777-300 ERs for delivery to Cathay Pacific , was unveiled at a pre-flight ceremony at the Future of Flight Aviation Center in Everett .
The London Telegraph reported that passengers were " said to be stunned into silence , " while people on the ground cheered , and that Wilkinson later toasted the flight with champagne .
" Pilots love to show off , we all do , " said aviation expert John Nance .
He says for an experienced pilot , the stunt should n't have been all that dangerous , but it 's an unnecessary risk .
"
The problem is , if we let people just do anything they want , then eventually they 're going to press and press , it 's human nature , until someone gets into an accident , " he said .
Cathay Pacific fired Wilkinson after the video of the stunt showed up on the internet .
The airline says the pilot did n't have approval to perform the maneuver .
Fly - by's are traditionally done at about 400 to 500 feet .
While the pilot alerted air traffic control of his low - flying stunt , an FAA spokesperson says the agency is now investigating the incident .
In 1873 , the British scholar and traveller Professor Basil Hall Chamberlain visited Japan .
He recorded his views of the nation 's music in his subsequent book , Japanese Things : Being Notes On Various Subjects Connected With Japan .
" Music , " he wrote , " if that beautiful word must be allowed to fall so low as to denote the strummings and squealings of Orientals , is supposed to have existed in Japan since mythological times ... but ( its ) effect is not to soothe , but to exasperate beyond all endurance the European breast . "

Today this view seems shameful ; we can see that it was not , as Chamberlain assumed , that Japan had no musical ability , but that it had no musical tradition that a Victorian professor could recognise .
The Japanese musical vocabulary was simply utterly alien to him .
Similarly , a commonly held contemporary British view is that the Germans have no sense of humour .
But can this be possible ?
Can there genuinely be a nation incapable of laughter , or is it just that the German language of laughter differs so greatly from our own , that it appears non-existent ?
Our attitude to the Germans and their supposed lack of a sense of humour is best understood through the example of the joke known to comedy professionals such as myself as The German Child .
It goes like this .
An English couple have a child .
After the birth , medical tests reveal that the child is normal , apart from the fact that it is German .
This , however , should not be a problem .
There is nothing to worry about .
As the child grows older , it dresses in lederhosen and has a pudding bowl haircut , but all its basic functions develop normally .
It can walk , eat , sleep , read and so on , but for some reason the German child never speaks .
The concerned parents take it to the doctor , who reassures them that as the German child is perfectly developed in all other areas , there is nothing to worry about and that he is sure the speech faculty will eventually blossom .
Years pass .
The German child enters its teens , and still it is not speaking , though in all other respects it is fully functional .
The German child 's mother is especially distressed by this , but attempts to conceal her sadness .
One day she makes the German child , who is now 17 years old and still silent , a bowl of tomato soup , and takes it through to him in the parlour where he is listening to a wind - up gramophone record player .
Soon , the German child appears in the kitchen and suddenly declares , " Mother .
This soup is a little tepid . "
The German child 's mother is astonished .
" All these years , " she exclaims , " we assumed you could not speak .
And yet all along it appears you could .
Why ?
Why did you never say anything before ? "
" Because , mother , " answers the German child , " up until now , everything has been satisfactory . "
The implication of this fabulous joke is that the Germans are ruthlessly rational , and this assumption leaves us little room to imagine them finding time to be playful .
But be assured , the German sense of humour not only exists , it actually flourishes , albeit in a form we are ill - equipped to recognise .
In December 2004 I accompanied Richard Thomas , the composer of the popular stage hit Jerry Springer The Opera , to Hanover , where he had gained a commission to develop an opera about a night in a British stand - up comedy club .
We wrote the words in English and Richard then collaborated on a translation with a talented German comedy writer called Hermann Bräuer .
There were two initial problems with this comedically , one cultural and one linguistic .
First , the idea of stand - up is somewhat alien to the Germans .
They have a cabaret tradition of sophisticated satire , cross-dressing and mildly amusing songs , and there are also recognisable mainstream , low - brow comedy tropes in the form of vulgar popular entertainers .
But the idea of the conversational , casual , middle - ground of English speaking stand - up comedy is unknown to the Germans .
Indeed , initial attempts by the Hannover Schauspielhaus set designers to render a typical British comedy club floundered as they attempted to formalise the idea of a stand - up venue , and it was a struggle to explain that we needed to reduce the room to a bare black box rather than attempt to give it a cabaret stage vibe .
Second , this instinct to formalise a genre of comedy we accept as inherently informal is not indivisible from the limitations the German language imposes on conventional British comedy structures .
The flexibility of the English language allows us to imagine that we are an inherently witty nation , when in fact we just have a vocabulary and a grammar that allow for endlessly amusing confusions of meanings .
At a rough estimate , half of what we find amusing involves using little linguistic tricks to conceal the subject of our sentences until the last possible moment , so that it appears we are talking about something else .
For example , it is possible to imagine any number of British stand - ups concluding a bit with something structurally similar to the following , " I was sitting there , minding my own business , naked , smeared with salad dressing and lowing like an ox ... and then I got off the bus . "
We laugh , hopefully , because the behaviour described would be inappropriate on a bus , but we had assumed it was taking place either in private or perhaps at some kind of sex club , because the word " bus " was withheld from us .
Other suitable punchlines for this set - up would be , " And that was just the teachers " , " I was 28 - years - old " and " That 's the last time I attempt to find work as a research chemist in Paraguay . "
There is even a technical term used by those who direct comedy on camera to describe this one - size - fits - all mechanism .
Eddie Large is gasping for air as a hot dog falls into the end of his snorkel .
The shot widens to reveal Sid Little , whose sausages are flying into the air out of his hot - dog buns because he is using too much ketchup .
Pull back and reveal .
But German will not always allow you to shunt the key word to the end of the sentence to achieve this failsafe laugh .
After spending weeks struggling with the rigours of the German language 's far less flexible sentence structures to achieve the endless succession of " pull back and reveals " that constitute much English language humour , the idea of our comedic superiority soon begins to fade .
It is a mansion built on sand .
The German phenomenon of compound words also serves to confound the English sense of humour .
In English there are many words that have double or even triple meanings , and whole sitcom plot structures have been built on the confusion that arises from deploying these words at choice moments .
Once again , German denies us this easy option .
There is less room for doubt in German because of the language 's infinitely extendable compound words .
In English we surround a noun with adjectives to try to clarify it .
In German , they merely bolt more words on to an existing word .
Thus a federal constitutional court , which in English exists as three weak fragments , becomes Bundesverfassungsgericht , a vast impregnable structure that is difficult to penetrate linguistically , like that Nazi castle in Where Eagles Dare .
The German language provides fully functional clarity .
English humour thrives on confusion .
Third , for the smutty British comic writers , it seemed difficult to find a middle - ground between scientifically precise language describing sexual and bodily functions , and outright obscenity .
There seemed to be no nuanced , nudge - nudge no -man 's land , where English comic sensibilities and German logic could meet on Christmas Day and kick around a few dirty jokes in a cheeky , Carry On - style way .
A German theatre director explained that this was because the Germans did not find the human body smutty or funny , due to all attending mixed saunas from an early age .
Later on in my stay I found myself explaining to the dramaturg of Hannover Schauspielhaus why English was a great language for comedy , with its possibility for confusion of meaning and the flexibility of its sentences .
" There is no need for you to be so proud of yourself , " she explained in precise and accurate English , " it is not as if you personally invented the English language .
You merely inherited it by the geographical accident of your birth . "
I laughed , and everything finally fell into place .
The geographical accident of Germany has denied Germans the fun we have with language , and it seemed to me that their sense of humour was built on blunt , seemingly serious statements , which became funny simply because of their context .
I looked back over the time I had spent in Hannover and suddenly found situations that had seemed inexplicable , even offensive at the time , hilarious in retrospect .
On my first night in Hannover I had gone out drinking with some young German actors .
" You will notice there are no old buildings in Hannover , " one of them said .
" That is because you bombed them all . "
At the time I found this shocking and embarrassing .
Now it seems like the funniest thing you could possibly say to a nervous English visitor .
Since watching jokes I co-wrote for our German production withering in the translation process , all their contrived weaknesses exposed , I have stopped writing jokes as such , and feel I am a better stand - up because of it .
I try now to write about ideas , that would be funny in any language , and do n't rely on pull - back and reveals and confusion of meaning .
Germany kicked away my comedy crutches and taught me to walk unaided .
I am hugely grateful to the Germans .
Since you asked , the stand - up opera went OK , and sooner or later we 'll stage it in Britain , in English , where it will make a lot more sense .
To paraphrase Simon Munnery , a British comedian so rigorous in his intellect he is almost German , there is much we can learn from watching the Germans .
Not as much , however , as they can learn from watching us .
Are you kidding ?
Some Germans tell us their jokes ...

There are problems in the woods .
The animals of the forest are always drunk , so the fox decides to ban alcohol .
The following day , the fox spies a rabbit hanging out of a tree , clearly wasted .
The fox ticks him off , and carries on his way .
But the next day he sees the rabbit drunk again , and gives him a final warning .
The next day , the fox does his rounds and there 's no sign of the rabbit , but he notices a straw sticking out of a stream .
Wondering what it is , the fox scoops it out , only to find a very drunk rabbit on the other end of it .
" How many times do I have to tell you that animals of the forest are n't allowed alcohol ? " says the Fox .
" We fishes do n't give a toss what the animals of the forest are n't allowed to do , " says the rabbit

Starting on Thursday , January 31st , Time Warner subscribers in Texas starting experiencing connectivity issues to the iTunes store to the point where the service was n't usable .
General internet traffic issues have n't coincided with these problems ...
Perhaps not coincidently , Time Warner has announced that they 're going to begin trials of tiered pricing in one local Texas market .
Apple recently began movie rentals ( iTunes ) via the iTunes Store .
Editor 's note : ISPs asking users to pay for what they use is one thing .
Not offering service or changing terms of service without notice are quite different ...

TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) --
A high - level American delegation may be headed to Okinawa soon to smooth strained relations with Japan after allegations a U.S. Marine raped a Japanese teenager .
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda on Tuesday deplored the incident as " unforgivable . "
Okinawa authorities are bracing for protests if Staff Sgt. Tyrone Luther Hadnott , 38 , is charged in the alleged Sunday night attack on a 14 - year - old girl .
In Washington , U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said , " It 's a horrendous crime , and we take these allegations very seriously .
We are working very closely with Japanese officials on the matter . "
McCormack suggested an American delegation soon might meet with the family of the alleged victim or local officials , he said .
" I would expect there would be some senior - level U.S. visitors , not from the U.S. but from inside Japan , who might make a trip down there to Okinawa , " he said .
He would n't give any details other than to say such a visit might include the U.S. ambassador to Japan , Thomas Schieffer , and a top U.S. military officer .
The episode echoes a similar incident more than a decade ago that strained relations between the United States and Japan .
Watch as the new case strikes a raw nerve in Okinawa »
In 1995 , anti-U.S. sentiments boiled over when three American servicemen gang - raped a 12 - year - old Okinawan schoolgirl .
Two years ago , a U.S. civilian military employee was jailed for nine years for raping two women .
" There have been incidents like this in the past , and it is a problem that it has occurred again , " Fukuda told a parliamentary panel Tuesday .
" We take this very seriously . "
Also Tuesday , the deputy police chief of Okinawa City released more details of the case , saying Hadnott offered to take the girl home on his motorcycle .
The schoolgirl , he said , was walking with her friends and accepted Hadnott 's offer .
According to police , Hadnott took the girl to a house and later to his car .
They drove to a park where he allegedly attacked her , police said .
The girl used her cell phone to call friends , who notified police .
Hadnott reportedly told authorities he only tried to push the girl down and kiss her .
The girl disputed his claims , and police said they intend to file rape charges .
Under Japanese law , a person can be held up to 10 days without charges .
The assault was reported Sunday night in the Chatan entertainment district on Okinawa , a major hub for U.S. forces in the Pacific .
Hadnott is based at Camp Courtney there .
More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan , most of them in Okinawa .
They were placed there under a security alliance after Japan was defeated in World War II and forced to renounce its right to a military .
The servicemen 's presence has at times bred resentment among local residents who have long complained about crime , noise and accidents .

State legislators in Vermont introduced legislation Wednesday demanding the state ’s National Guard troops return from Iraq .
Lawmakers in Minnesota , New Hampshire , and Pennsylvania are poised to push similar legislation .
At the heart of the matter is a contention that President George W. Bush ’s legal authority to deploy the National Guard to Iraq has expired .
“ Congress laid out a pretty specific mission for the Guard in 2002 , ” Vermont State Representative Michael Fisher ( D - Lincoln ) told OneWorld .
“ That mission was two things : it was to defend the national security of the United States [ against ] the threat posed by Iraq , and , two , to enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions .
I do n’t believe there are any credible arguments that the state of Iraq poses a risk to the Untied States or that there may still be weapons of mass destruction in Iraq . ”
“ If the president believes there ’s still a need to have our National Guard in Iraq to stabilize that country or whatever , it ’s his job to go back to Congress and ask for that authorization , ” Fisher added .
“ The president does n’t have the authority to permanently federalize our Guards . ”
The legislation comes amid increasing antiwar sentiment in the Green Mountain state .
In 2005 , voters in 48 Vermont towns approved resolutions calling on the State Legislature to study the effect on Vermont of numerous deployments to Iraq and asked Vermont ’s congressional delegation ” to work to restore a proper balance between the powers of the states and that of the federal government over state National Guard units . ”
The Vermont State Legislature also asked the president and the Congress to withdraw the U.S. military from Iraq .
Vermont , like other rural parts of the country , has suffered disproportionately from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , say analysts .
A November 2006 report by the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire found soldiers from rural Vermont had the highest death rate in the nation .
A June 2007 survey sponsored by the nonpartisan Center for Rural Strategies found rural support for the war slipping : some 45 percent of rural Americans said then that the United States should “ stay the course ” in Iraq , down from 51 percent in 2004 .
And 60 percent of respondents said they knew someone serving in Iraq or Afghanistan .
Despite popular sentiment and rising casualties , Vermont ’s Republican Governor Jim Douglas reacted coldly to Fisher ’s legislation .
“ This is a federal issue , ” spokesman Jason Gibbs told the Burlington Free Press .
“ Governor Douglas would like to see Washington develop a strategy to bring the troops home . ”
The Free Press reported that , according to Gibbs , the Vermont governor ’s legal staff looked into the authority over the National Guard when the issue was under public scrutiny several years ago .
They found that states had no legal basis for refusing to deploy National Guard units , Gibbs said .
“ To change that , Congress would have to act . ”
This is not the first time states have looked into recalling their National Guards from an unpopular foreign conflict .
In the 1986 , several governors opposed to President Ronald Reagan ’s covert military operations in Central America refused to allow their National Guard units to participate in exercises there .
That fall , Congress , led by Mississippi Congressmen and longtime National Guard ally G. V. “ Sonny ” Montgomery , passed an amendment to the Defense Authorization
Act that prevented governors from withholding units from federal training in the future .
Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich took the lead in challenging the new law , but after losing several appeals , the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the law ’s constitutionality in 1990 .
Many constitutional authorities argue that the Montgomery Amendment essentially ended any power a governor might have to veto deployment of National Guard units .
But the bill ’s backers say the war in Iraq is different than the 1980s conflict in Central America .
“ In the 1980s , President Reagan said he wanted to send the National Guard to Central America for ‘ training , ' ” said Benson Scotch , a former chief staff attorney to Vermont ’s Supreme Court , who helped write the bill .
“ There is no such thing as a limited authorization by Congress for a permanent ongoing call - up . ”

WASHINGTON ( Dow Jones ) 
The Treasury Department declined again Wednesday to designate China as a currency manipulator , despite the increasing pressure from Congress .
In its latest semiannual report to Congress on the currency policies of countries around the world , the department reiterated its complaint that the recent appreciation in the Chinese yuan was “ too limited and modest , ” but said that the government ’s heavy intervention did not meet the legal definition for currency manipulation .
China should “ significantly accelerate ” the appreciation of the yuan ’s effective exchange rate “ to minimize the risks that are being created for China itself as well as the world economy , of which China is an increasingly critical part , ” the report said .
China abandoned a strict currency peg in July 2005 , but it maintains a trading band around an unspecified basket of currencies that includes the dollar and euro .
The entertainment industry says illegal file sharing costs it millions
A draft consultation suggests internet service providers would be required to take action over users who access pirated material via their accounts .
But the government is stressing that plans are at an early stage and it is still working on final proposals .
Six million people a year are estimated to download files illegally in the UK .
Music and film companies say that the illegal downloads cost them millions of pounds in lost revenues .

If the law were enacted it would turn ISPs , like BT , Tiscali and Virgin , into a pro-active net police force
Darren Waters , technology editor BBC News website
Read Darren 's thoughts in full
The government proposals were first reported by the Times newspaper .
The Department for Culture , Media and Sport said that early drafts of the document had been circulated among stakeholders .
" The content and proposals for the strategy have been significantly developed since then and a comprehensive plan to bolster the UK 's creative industries will be published shortly , " it added .
" We will not comment on the content of the leaked document . "
Voluntary scheme
The Times suggested that broadband firms which failed to enforce the rules could be prosecuted , and the details of customers suspected of making illegal downloads made available to the courts .
According to the Times , the draft paper states : " We will move to legislate to require internet service providers to take action on illegal file sharing . "
Internet providers are no more able to inspect and filter every single packet passing across their network than the Post Office is able to open every envelope ,
Internet Service Providers Association
Some of the UK 's biggest internet providers , such as BT , Virgin and Tiscali have been in talks with the entertainment industry over introducing a voluntary scheme for policing pirate activity , but no agreement has been reached .
So far , they have failed to resolve how disputed allegations would be arbitrated - for example , when customers claim other people have been " piggybacking " on their internet service .
' No liability '
Technology that allows internet providers to monitor what content is being downloaded is becoming more effective , said James Bates , media director at consultants Deloitte .
" This is also likely to help accelerate the process of identifying pirates , and may lead to swifter disconnection , or prosecution , " Mr Bates said .
However , the Internet Service Providers Association said data protection laws would prevent providers from looking at the content of information sent over their networks .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Is n't it strange that when corporations start losing money the Government acts quickly to stamp it out Jon Perez , Reading
" ISPs are no more able to inspect and filter every single packet passing across their network than the Post Office is able to open every envelope , " the association said .
" ISPs bear no liability for illegal file sharing as the content is not hosted on their servers , " it added .
The BPI , the trade body that represents the UK record industry , said internet providers had " done little or nothing to address illegal downloading via their networks " .
" This is the number one issue for the creative industries in the digital age , and the government 's willingness to tackle it should be applauded , " said BPI chief executive Geoff Taylor .
" Now is not the time for ISPs to hide behind bogus privacy arguments , or claim the problem is too complicated or difficult to tackle . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush will seek $ 140.7 billion on Monday for the U.S. Army in fiscal 2009 , including increased funds to buy helicopters and other equipment , according to budget documents obtained by Reuters .

That request would be 8 percent higher than the Army budget requested for fiscal 2008 .
The request for weapons and equipment procurement dollars will total $ 24.6 billion compared with $ 23.8 billion sought for fiscal 2008 .
The 2009 figure falls short of the $ 26.2 billion the Army previously said it would seek for procurement .
It will include $ 1.17 billion for CH - 47 heavy - lift Chinook helicopters and modifications from Boeing Co and $ 1.06 billion for UH - 60 Blackhawk helicopters from United Technologies Corp Sikorsky unit .
The budget request also will include increases for ammunition , Stryker vehicles and a family of medium tactical vehicles .
The funding request for Future Combat Systems , the Army ’s modernization effort , will hold roughly flat at $ 3.555 billion in fiscal 2009 compared with $ 3.563 billion a year ago .
Fiscal 2009 starts October 1 , 2008 .
The Army , the largest branch of the U.S. military , has been stressed by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Much of the fiscal 2009 budget request aims to address that strain by retraining personnel and fixing or replacing equipment .
The budget request also includes funds to increase the size of the Army to 532,400 soldiers by the end of fiscal 2009 , up from about 512,400 now .
That is part of a five - year plan to boost both the Army and Marine Corps .
Bush ’s overall Pentagon budget request will total $ 515.4 billion for fiscal 2009 , up 7.5 percent from the funds Congress approved for 2008 , according to Pentagon documents obtained by Reuters on Friday .
He also will seek $ 70 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Jamie covered Republican Rep. Jack Kingston 's smearing of Senator Barack Obama for being unpatriotic because he refuses to wear a lapel flag pin -- all while not wearing one himself .
Last night on Live with Dan Abrams , the host calls Kingston out for once again labeling Obama unpatriotic while he himself was NOT wearing a flag pin .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Abrams :
You 're not wearing a lapel pin , are you ?
Kingston : I will wear one and I have worn one .
I 'll bring one to your next show .
Abrams :
But you see my point .
I had no idea you were going to show up without a lapel pin , but it seems kind of absurd that you 're saying that Barack Obama 's patriotism should be questioned because he's not wearing a lapel pin and then you come on the show not wearing one .
Kingston : Well Dan , I 'm not following that at all .
Say , what ?
Kingston glosses right over Abram 's challenge , saying it 's OK to be a hypocrite on this issue simply because it's a good tactic to use as it gets a rise out of Democrats .
He also defends the juvenile use of Obama 's middle name , once again justifying the behavior because it pisses of the people on the left .
Abrams did a great job of making Kingston look like the nut that he is and shows how ridiculous this whole line of smears really is .
I think the GOP is going to find swiftboating a tad more difficult in '08 than in years past .
Not too long ago , The Powers That Be in the emerging eastern - European country of Latveria ( as I ’ll call it ) decided that the time had come for a massive , central monitoring system that would be used to ensure the country ’s security .
SENTINEL , as the system would be called , involved data exchange between virtually every governmental agency , airports , financial institutions , transit systems , and so forth , all for the purpose of being able to track people and the money they spend .
After well over a year of negotiations , The Powers That Be selected Christian B ’s company to design SENTINEL ’s enterprise architecture .
Over the next year or so , Christian got accustomed to the weekly Latverian commute : wake up at 4:00 AM on Monday , depart from Paris via airplane , arrive in Hassenstadt ( Latveria ’s capitol ) several hours later , work five twelve - to - fifteen hour days , catch a plane back home , and sleep until noon on Saturday .
He also got very accustomed with Latverian politics :
The Powers That Be , especially those from the Ministry of Defense , were personally involved with almost every decision at every level .
And they did n’t take criticism very well .
One network engineer was fired on the spot ( and some suspect , later executed ) for disagreeing with a Latverian director .
Despite all the bureaucracy , the number of parties involved , the complexity of the decision - making process , and the constant design changes , SENTINEL was actually delivered on time and nearly 70 % feature complete .
All the hard work that Christian and his team put in – along with the threat of capital punishment should the project fail – helped out quite a bit .
The missing features – left out mostly as a result of external systems – would be delivered months later in SENTINEL 2.0 .
And fortunately , Christian would have no part in this second project .
Upon returning to the office in Paris following a month - long holiday , Christian ’s boss told him that he ’d need to pack his bags and head to Hassenstadt right away to help with an audit project .
Although Christian argued that there were several others more qualified to do audit work , especially those who did n’t design the system , his boss was insistent .
Apparently , the Director of Information Systems personally requested Christian ’s presence .
Shortly after arriving in Hassenstadt , Christian jumped in to the audit team meeting .
They were discussing all the fun they ’d be having over the next months : architecture review , code review , deployment review , functional test review , database performance review , incident simulation , and so on , all with Latverian oversight .
Christian could n’t wait .
On a coffee break , Christian ran into a developer he had worked with on the project .
After the standard small talk , Victor ( as I ’ll call him ) asked Christian a rather odd question : “ Have you heard about my laptop ? ”
“ Sorry , ” Christian replied , “ I have n’t ? ”
He half - expected Victor to tell him that some Latverian general smashed it to pieces after learning about some system limitation .
It would n’t have been the first time .
“ Ha , ” Victor chuckled , “ you did n’t hear ?!
Well , OK , you just have to see this in person . ”
Christian followed Victor down the stairs towards the SENTINEL data center .
It took up an entire sublevel in the massive Ministry of Defense building they were all meeting in , and housed tens of millions of dollars worth of servers and network equipment .
The room stayed a cool 55° and was lined with racks of high - availability hardware , and more racks of backup high - availability hardware .
It was exactly how Christian had designed it .
However , there was something out of place .
A single chair sat in the middle of room and , on this chair , sat a beat - up laptop with a few wires connected to it from the surrounding racks .
It was like some sort of totem , completely contrasting the otherwise perfectly clean room .
The laptop ’s screen displayed the Performance tab from Windows Task Manager with a CPU - usage graph almost constantly at 100 % .
The only other program on the taskbar was Visual Studio .
Christian was surprised and baffled .
A laptop certainly was not in his architectural specification of the system !
When they left the cold room , Victor told Christian the whole story .
As more and more data poured in and out of the system , and more and more people started using the system , one of the application servers crashed .
And then it crashed again .
And again .
And again .
For some reason , one of the application ’s services would crash whenever it started up .
As a developer working on this part of the service , Victor was called in to fix and track down the bug .
He looked at the logs and saw exactly where the problem was : some UTF - 8 character string caused the service to crash .
It was odd , but must have been some bug in the request processing .
He fired up the service through Visual Studio on his laptop and submitted the same data .
It did n’t crash .
He tried it again , and it worked .
And again .
And again .
Nothing he could do would crash the service on his laptop .
This was not good .
Victor explained the situation to his manager .
They both knew that , if the crashes were noticed by the higher - ups in the Ministry of Defense , or worse , by The Powers That Be , heads would roll .
And probably literally .
They held a quick emergency meeting with the other development managers to get some help .
“ Well , ” one of the managers said , “ the service runs fine on your laptop , right ?
Well , let ’s just plug it to the production network !
In the mean time , we can examine exactly why it ’s failing on the application server . ”
Without any other ideas , Victor and his manager left the meeting and begin the IDDTP procedure : Install , Deploy , Do n’t Test , Pray .
Victor ’s laptop was placed on a chair and plugged - in to the network .
Within moments , SENTINEL was back up and running – quite a bit slower than usual – and Victor ’s laptop was working like mad .
A few days of tedious debugging later , Victor ’s team discovered that the problem was in some third - party communications library .
Try as they might , they could not get the application server to function properly .
Victor ’s laptop had just the right combination of patches , service packs , Win32 DLLs , and whatever other magic was needed to not crash the vendor ’s library .
And they were still in the process of fighting with the vendor to fix their library .
And that ’s the reason why Victor ’s laptop – an underpowered , $ 1,100 development computer – had been sitting between multi-million massively - available dollar hardware , courageously powering the huge enterprise application called SENTINEL .
And fortunately , The Powers That Be were none the wiser .

CHARLES GIBSON :
When he says it 's a strategic mistake ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : My , my objective is to solve this issue diplomatically , and I fully intend to , and I believe we can .
But diplomacy is effective when all options are available to a president , and all options are available .
No one wants to use military force to achieve any objective .
But , but it 's important for all parties to understand that , you know , while I 'm optimistic we can solve it diplomatically , options are available to the president .
CHARLES GIBSON : There 's been a lot of bellicose rhetoric that has been aimed at Iran , and you yourself , at a news conference recently , raised the specter of , of World War III if there was a nuclear armed Iran .
Just my curiosity , why not turn the rhetoric around and smother them with kindness , call their bluff and say , look , if you 're seriously interested in nuclear power , we 'll build the nuclear power plants for you ?
PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : I 've done that .
You must have not heard it , but we actually did it with Russia .
Russia and , has offered to , you know , construct Bushehr , which is fine .
I supported Russia and said that not only should you build it , but uh , the major suppliers group will provide the fuel and collect the fuel .
And , so Russia and the United States are in concert on that issue .
Matter of fact , I said this in a press conference , that it 's the sovereign right of Iran to have civilian nuclear power , and I agree , and I believe that .

In this corporate - sponsored cartoon , Martian dissidents learn that oil and competition are the two things that make America great .
Shotlist
This animated cartoon follows the adventures of " Colonel Cosmic , " a Martian , as he learns that Oil and Competition are the two things that make America great .
It is a sci-fi - influenced economic tract on the strengths of Earth - style free enterprise economics , compared to a stagnating Mars under the fist of a certain Mr. Ogg , who centrally controls the Martian economy .
In the film , a Martian undercover agent flies from Mars to Earth to learn about the oil industry , and finds that the lack of government regimentation and control is what makes our system flourish .
Destination Earth was produced by the same company as Make Mine Freedom , and both films share a similar graphic style .
But it 's six years later , and the United States is still in the middle of the flying saucer craze and worried about invaders from the skies .
Well , here come the Martians , and guess what ?
They come from a planet that looks a lot like the Soviet Union .
Even though the little cosmo-creature ostensibly flies to Earth to claim territory for the autocratic Martian ruler " Mr. Ogg , " he 's really on an intelligence mission .
Unlike Mars , fettered by a centrally controlled command economy , Earth is prospering due to private enterprise and cheap oil .
The evidence of Earth 's prosperity is shown in petro-centric terms , narrated by the space traveler .
This is subversive stuff for the Martians , and Mr. Ogg tries to control the spread of this information .
But the gospel of free enterprise is sufficient to foment a Martian revolution , and the planet begins to remake itself in a Terrestrial image .
Small businesses open and spread throughout Mars , and wildcatters start drilling for oil below the planet 's red sands .
This film is decidedly mellower than many of the other films expressing basically the same ideas .
It might be argued that the corporations in the U.S. were no longer so worried about losing " what we have , " and instead felt that it was now time to think about subverting our adversaries .
Throughout the Fifties and Sixties , the oil industry was far from shy about telling its story to the public .
Through the American Petroleum Institute and its Oil Industry Information Committee , a steady flow of booklets , brochures , speeches , press releases , planted news articles , " public service " advertisements and films made the case for oligopolistic ownership and marketing of petroleum .
Two supplements on this disc , " Oil Serves You " and " Oil and the American Way " serve as excellent examples of this public relations offensive .
The oil industry made special efforts to draw a link between freedom and prosperity , as long as prosperity was achieved through private enterprise .
In Destination Earth , private enterprise ( and cheap oil ! ) is actually pictured as a force sufficiently revolutionary to overthrow repressive societies .
The ending might have been different if American oil companies had decided to go into business with Mr. Ogg .
Oil companies also boasted about the extent of competition in their industry and extolled its benefits for the consumer .
These assertions considerably stretched the truth but achieved credibility through obsessive repetition .
Destination Earth avoids coming off as too doctrinaire or propagandistic through its self - deprecating humor ( a trademark of John Sutherland films ) , but it 's still an insidious , self - serving piece of corporate propaganda .
It takes the ideas expressed in films like Make Mine Freedom and How to Lose What We Have and takes them one step further , showing free - enterprise ideology not simply as a defense against socialism but as a means of subverting other societies .
If you care to read this film as prophetic , you can compare its plot to the course of events following the opening of Eastern Europe in 1989 .

I can't tell you how happy I am to see your smiling faces once more .
[ mild applause ]
First let me say that this trip was made possible only by our dauntless chief , Ogg the Magnificent , introducer of Ogg power , which runs most of our industry .
[ human slavery treadmills power generation generators ]
And inventor of Ogg speed , which doubles the original Ogg power .
A short time ago the master was having trouble with the state limousine .
He had , of course , developed the Ogg - plosive charge .
But it was inclined to get a little out of hand , just slightly , and of course there was always the problem of friction , parts rubbing together , heating up , and causing all sorts of trouble .
[ torture pins sticking pain rockets explosions wheels crashes accidents ]
[ cheers silence ]
But our - our leader was undaunted .
He immediately ordered our first expedition into space to bring back the secret of how other planets got their state limousines to run smoothly .
The target was picked with painstaking scientific accuracy - destination Earth . [ planets ]
You all know with what eagerness I volunteered for the mission and with what confidence I took off .
I took careful bearings and set out for my goal .
It seemed no time till I was approaching a country of Earth called the United States of America .
[ spaceships rockets space travel globes maps ]
I set her down like a feather . " [ crashes billboards UFOs unidentified flying objects flying saucers ]
" What 's that , Pa ? " " What 's all the racket ? "
" Naturally I protected government property by making the saucer invisible . "
" They 're after the chickens , Ma. " [ shooting guns bullets ricochets ]
" And though the natives showed great interest in me , I decided to make myself invisible , too .
Seeing moving lights in the distance , I headed for them .
What phenomenal luck - I had landed close to what seemed to be an endless procession of state limousines .
[ cities automobiles cars traffic driving highways skylines ]
They moved quickly and yet with fantastic smoothness .
I just had to get a closer look at one of those Earthmobiles .
[ crashes accidents animation psychedelia psychedelic ]
Just as I thought - not only smooth and efficient , but powerful as well .
I watched them for hours .
Great Ganymede - they were superb .
I just could n't help comparing them with ours , if you call that a comparison .
Surely these vehicles must be the property of the highest officials .
I was wrong .
It seems that almost everybody in this country has one of those - uh , they call them automobiles .
They use them for transportation , for business , for pleasure .
They use them for all sorts of things .
[ station wagons kissing Just Married newlyweds tin cans ]
I found that these vehicles gather at places called service stations where they are fed , lubricated - that 's how they beat friction - and given the finest care .
The source of their nourishment was something called petroleum .
A power source like that must be a highly prized state secret .
I had to find out about it .
Perhaps the secret lay within this government archives building .
It was highly guarded , but casting discretion to the winds , I walked boldly inside .
[ public libraries librarians Public Library gender stereotypes card catalogs invisibility ]
Their code was remarkably easy to break .
They merely substituted the word " oil " for " petroleum . "
And I soon got hold of a veritable mine of classified information .
[ books speedreading speed reading ]
I began to assimilate the material .
I soon found out that though petroleum products are easily found anywhere , petroleum itself is a very elusive substance .
[ oil research ]
Experts have to search for it constantly in all the most likely and unlikely places , with all kinds of scientific devices .
When they figure they 've found a good spot , they drill a hole in the ground called an " oil well , " for almost all oil lies far beneath the surface of the earth .
[ oil exploration wildcatting drilling ]
These wells go down thousands of feet and cost a lot of money to drill .
But that 's no guarantee that they 're going to find oil .
Matter of fact , in exploratory drilling , only one well in nine finds any oil at all .
Only one in forty - four recovers enough oil to pay for itself .
And only one in almost a thousand makes a major discovery - pretty big odds .
Yet America 's crude reserves - the oil supply still underground - have kept increasing steadily .
I could n't imagine how this ever - increasing supply of oil was achieved until I found out that there 's not just one , but thousands of oil companies , all competing with each other to discover and develop new sources of oil .
For believe it or not , in the USA , anyone who is willing to risk it can drill for oil .
[ competition free enterprise ]
But oil discovery is only part of the story .
Once they get oil out of the ground , it has to be moved through pipelines , on ships , or in tank cars to fantastic processing plants called refineries .
Crude oil goes in , and - great Jupiter - the things that come out .
Gasoline , for example , the most efficient mobile power source on Earth .
That was the stuff that powered all those cars and trucks .
And asphalt , which makes smooth , durable roads .
It seems that oil not only runs cars , it even gives 'em something to run on .
[ highways ]
Another oil product is the diesel fuel which runs giant trains across the nation .
In winter , fuel oil made from petroleum brings warmth and comfort to millions of homes .
And still other fuels help defend America 's shores and skies .
[ railroads military fighters airplanes ]
From refineries also come the lubricating oils and greases that keep the wheels turning in America .
But that still is n't all .
Crude oil like everything else is made up of billions of tiny molecules , and using the magic of research , oil companies compete with each other in taking the petroleum molecule apart , and rearranging it into , well , you name it !
[ chemistry ]
Fabrics , toothbrushes , tires , insecticide , cosmetics , weed killers .
A whole galaxy of things to make a better life on Earth .
[ industrial research new products technology ]
And you know , it is n't just oil companies that try to outdo each other competing for the customer 's dollar .
The same story is true of almost every successful business enterprise in America .
The result : a higher standard of living in the USA than in any other country on the whole planet .
[ competition free enterprise consumerism consumers shopping marketing advertising ]
At last the secret was mine .
And now to get proof of my discovery , smuggle it past the border guards .
In spite of my infinite precaution , one of them became suspicious and gave the alarm .
[ invisibility librarians screams whistles fear ]
" Come back for the eggs , didya ?
Get 'em , Pa . "
And so with a fond farewell to the natives ringing in my ears , I took off once again for Mars .
[ spaceships space ships space travel flying saucers crashes ]
My landing was a little bumpy , but I saved my precious cargo .
Yes , I brought the secrets back with me , and here they are .
The big secret is of course oil , which has brought a better life to all the people in the USA .
But the key to making oil work for everybody is competition .
Fellow Martians .
I thank you . "
[ Story of Oil Competition More For All ]
" Very interesting , Colonel .
Oil , eh ?
Sounds splendid .
But that , what was it , competition , not our kind of thing at all .
Why competition is downright un -Martian . "
" Oil for everybody .
Oh boy , oil . "

" Look at them .

" You bet I do , Ogg .

[ Joe 's Cafe .

So why do n't you get lost .
Yes , the real secret is not only a great source of energy , but also the freedom to make it work for everybody .
And if you have both of these things , any goal is possible .
It 's destination unlimited .

Neuronal Music
This page provides audio files where neuronal activity is " visualized " by creating music .
The music is created from neuronal spikes recorded extracellularly with multiple electrodes , either from the parietal cortex of awake and naturally - sleeping cats ( taken from Destexhe et al. , J Neurosci , 1999 ) , or from the temporal cortex of awake and naturally sleeping human subjects ( taken from Peyrache et al. , Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci. USA , 2012 ) .
We have made two types of neuronal music , a first " simple " type , consists of a direct translation of spike sequences into note sequences , as detailed in the Neuronal Melodies page .
This type of musical animation is available for cat parietal cortex and human temporal cortex .
A second attemps was made more recenty , in collaboration with Luc Foubert ( CNRS ) .
In the Spikiss Project , we have created more elaborated music based on associations with multiple and sophisticated sounds .
We also explained step by step how the conversion to music was made .
We are presently continuing to work on the Spikiss project , and use spike recordings from human and monkey , as well as other types of signals , such as the electroencephalogram ( EEG ) or the local field potential ( LFP ) .

The newest sensation at the center of Hollywood 's fashion scene is n't a famous designer or starlet .
It 's a 56 - year - old homeless man who spends his days dancing on roller skates .
John Wesley Jermyn has been a fixture in West Los Angeles for more than 20 years .
Nicknamed " The Crazy Robertson " and " The Robertson Dancer , " he is a constant presence on a stretch of Robertson Boulevard that has become the city 's trendiest shopping corridor and a prime strolling spot for tourists and movie stars .
Among locals and online , there 's much speculation about Mr. Jermyn's personal history , including one oft - repeated rumor that he 's a secretive millionaire .
In a plot twist worthy of Tinseltown , Mr. Jermyn now has a clothing label named after him .
Since it was introduced last month , " The Crazy Robertson " brand of T - shirts and sweatshirts , created by a trio of 23 - year - olds , has flown off the shelves at Kitson , a haunt of tabloid stars like Paris Hilton .
The clothes feature stylized images of Mr. Jermyn , including one design -- available on a $ 98 hoodie -- that has a graphic of him dancing and the phrase " No Money , No Problems " on the back .
At the largest of Kitson 's three boutiques on Robertson , shirts bearing Mr. Jermyn's likeness are sold alongside $ 290 " Victoria Beckham " jeans and $ 50 baby shoes designed by pop star Gwen Stefani .
The label 's owners , who grew up in Beverly Hills , have created a MySpace page for Mr. Jermyn .
It doubles as an ad for the clothing brand and their nightclub - promotion venture , which is also named " The Crazy Robertson . "
The young entrepreneurs spent months trying to forge a relationship with Mr. Jermyn -- who now goes by the name John Jermien -- before gaining his approval .
They have consulted him on design decisions and had a photographer shoot him for publicity images .
In May , Mr. Jermyn agreed to a deal that entitles him to 5 % of " net profit " from clothing sales , according to a copy of the contract seen by The Wall Street Journal .
He signed the contract , without speaking to an attorney or family members .
But so far he has refused to accept much cash , preferring to be paid in food , liquor and paper for his art projects , according to Teddy Hirsh , one of the label 's founders .
" He tries not to involve money in his daily life , " says Mr. Hirsh , who says he is Mr. Jermyn's agent and manager for future endeavors .
Mr. Hirsh says Mr. Jermyn has already received several small payments , even though the company has n't " made much profit " so far .
" We have n't collected anything for ourselves , " says Mr. Hirsh .
Mr. Jermyn's slide into homelessness is a painful subject for his sister Beverly .
And so is the clothing deal .
She believes " The Crazy Robertson " founders are exploiting her brother 's condition to build their brand .
" I think these guys saw an opportunity and they took it , " she says .
" I am not happy with the arrangement . "
Ms. Jermyn , who lives close to the alley where Mr. Jermyn sleeps , says her brother has a form of schizophrenia .
He refuses to take medication , she says , despite suffering from fits of shouting and cursing .
In the years since his condition began deteriorating in the late 1970s , " he slipped through my fingers like sand , " says Ms. Jermyn , 64 , who manages facilities for Oracle Corp .
In the late 1980s she testified in court in a proceeding to force her brother to seek help , but psychological evaluators found him " lucid and gracious , " according to Ms. Jermyn .
She has made countless attempts to provide him with shelter and therapy , and she still visits him twice a week with food .
She also pays for his cellphone and collects his Social Security checks on his behalf .
The repackaging of Mr. Jermyn as a fashion front man comes at a time of increased fascination with homelessness .
The producers of " Bumfights " -- a collection of videotaped street battles between vagrants -- claim to have sold more than 300,000 DVDs since 2002 , and a British TV series called " Filthy Rich and Homeless " made headlines this year for its depiction of real - life millionaires posing as London beggars .
Across the U.S. , a growing number of homeless people have gained attention through the Internet .
More than 17,500 videos on YouTube are tagged with the word " homeless . "
Leslie Cochran , a street resident in Austin , Texas , who has twice run for mayor , has 10,775 " friends " on his MySpace page .
In Boston , the profile of Harold Madison Jr. -- a homeless man better known as " Mr. Butch " -- rose through online clips and a Web site made in his honor .
Mr. Jermyn was raised in Hancock Park , a historic L.A. neighborhood that 's home to some of the city 's wealthiest families .
His father managed one of L.A. 's largest Chevrolet dealerships .
A star athlete in high school , Mr. Jermyn was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the 1969 Major League Baseball draft .
He attended Pepperdine University and played a season for a Los Angeles Dodgers ' minor - league team in Bellingham , Wash .
( He hit just .205 and made 12 errors in 63 games , according to the Society for American Baseball Research . )
Joel John Roberts , chief executive of People Assisting the Homeless , which provides shelters for L.A. 's street residents , says the branding of Mr. Jermyn is " like designing a line of clothing patterned after Iraqi refugees fleeing the war . "
Mr. Hirsh and Vic Ackerman , one of the other founders of the clothing line , are sensitive to Ms. Jermyn 's concerns about her brother , but say Mr. Jermyn " specifically asked " them not to contact her about the clothing line or the contract .
They view Mr. Jermyn as a " business partner " and say they make sure he 's aware of how his image is being used .
" He knows everything that 's going on , " says Mr. Ackerman , noting that Mr. Jermyn nixed a set of promotional photos because he did n't like his outfit and thought he " looked a little puffy . "
In conversation , Mr. Jermyn speaks softly and mixes short , lucid sentences with longer , less coherent remarks .
He has been arrested more than a dozen times since 1986 for violations such as trespassing and jaywalking , according to court records .
Most of his skating and curb - side dancing now takes place near Robertson Boulevard , but in the past he roamed throughout Beverly Hills and West L.A. , often cradling a boombox and shimmying to loud music .
" He was always an extraordinary dancer , " says Jim Horne , a classmate of Mr. Jermyn's at Los Angeles Baptist High School .
In addition to his sister , Mr. Jermyn speaks regularly with Ginny Berliner , a 64 - year - old woman who befriended him when she owned an antique shop on Robertson .
Mrs. Berliner , who now lives in Maryland , used to pay for Mr. Jermyn to sleep in a motel and covered his monthly coffee bill at Michel Richard , the well - known patisserie .
" He wants notoriety and glory , but he can't accept money , " she says .
On a recent afternoon , clad in his trademark black leggings and visor , Mr. Jermyn said he is " a facilitator " for the brand , and hopes it will expand into music or film .
He has become a one - man marketing team , plastering company stickers and pictures of himself on a wall that faces pedestrians on Robertson .
At Kitson 's boutiques and on its Web site , the first shipment of " Crazy Robertson " women 's clothes -- about 35 items -- sold out in three days , and the store immediately ordered about 90 more pieces , according to owner Fraser Ross .
Many of the online buyers were not from Los Angeles and presumably not familiar with Mr. Jermyn , he says .
The brand may have appeal beyond L.A. , says Mr. Ross , because its name includes " Robertson , " which like Rodeo Drive is a destination associated with glamorous shopping .
Mr. Hirsh says the success at Kitson has already generated interest from other retailers .
He calls Mr. Jermyn " our Michael Jordan " and is looking into a trademark for " the Crazy Robertson " name and logo .
Ms. Jermyn , meanwhile , has different hopes .
" I do n't want to see my brother get hurt , " she says .
" They 're taking advantage of someone who is very vulnerable and very trusting . "

AN 11 - YEAR - OLD boy was saved from sinking in waist - deep mud after his pals used their glowing mobile phones to guide rescuers in the darkness .
The child was stuck fast in the freezing mud when crews eventually managed to pull him to safety .
Hero fireman Mark Donohue took inspiration from TV action man Bear Grylls when he waded into the pool , spreading his weight across the treacherous surface to stop himself sinking .
The dramatic rescue happened last night when five youngsters took a shortcut across open ground off Sinderland Road , Altrincham .
The group had spent the evening playing and were heading home when one of the boys became trapped up to his knees in a pool of mud .
His worried pals tried to drag him out but quickly dialled 999 for help as he continued to sink past his thighs .
Fire service operators warned them to stay clear of the danger area and instructed them to use the blue screens of their mobile phones to guide rescuers to the spot , close to a council - run tip .
When three fire engines arrived at around 8.15 pm , they were met at the site entrance by two of the youths and a team of four fighters raced to the trapped youngster , while others prepared the rescue equipment .
One of the firemen tried to approach the boy but sank to his knees in the mud .
But Mark , who is watch commander of Altrincham fire station , remembered a recent television programme in which survival expert Grylls showed how spread his weight across the water .
By sliding onto his hands and knees he was able to grab hold of the trapped child and drag him to firm ground .
He told the MEN : " The boys had been playing in woods nearby and had decided to take a shortcut .
They had been told to use their phones so we could spot them .
A couple of lads met us at the entrance and we could see where their mates were .
" The land may have been used for quarrying in the past and they boy was trapped in a pool of sandy mud .
He had spent some time in there already and was cold and distressed .
" Although we get training rescuing people using equipment , I had seen this programme on television where the guy managed to spread his weight and move over the water . "
The boy , who spent 50 minutes in the freezing water , was wrapped in a foil blanket to keep him warm and was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital suffering from hypothermia .
Father - of - two Mark , 36 , said that the youngster was minutes away from serious harm .
He said : " His friends were worried that they would get in trouble but they did the right thing by phoning 999 as quickly as they did .
" If they had spent longer trying to get him out on their own , he would have sunk further and his core temperature would have dropped .
It could have been very serious . "

The cow featured daily in Granma , the Communist Party 's official newspaper , and earned a full obituary on its death in 1985 .
Castro commissioned a marble statue of Ubre Blanca , who was also stuffed and put on permanent display at the National Cattle Health Centre near Havana .
In an effort to boost milk production , which fell drastically when Soviet subsidies dried up in 1989 , Cuban scientists attempted in 2002 to clone Ubre Blanca , but failed .
VENEZUELA
Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez openly admires Fidel Castro as his political mentor .
In 2000 the two leaders sang a duet live on Venezuelan radio .
Venezuela is an important trading partner for Cuba and part of what Chavez has called the " axis of good " - an anti-American trading bloc that includes Bolivia .
Barrels of oil Venezuela sends to Cuba each day : 90,000 ( at heavily subsidised prices ) .
In return , Cuba provides Venezuela with , among other things , doctors and , in 2005 , free eye treatment for 5,000 people .
WEALTH , PERSONAL
Size of Fidel Castro's fortune , according to Forbes ' Rich List 2006 : $ 900 m
According to Fidel Castro , it 's $ 0
An incensed Castro appeared on TV to dismiss the Forbes claim , calling it " repugnant slander " .
In May last year George Galloway appeared on Cuban TV to defend Castro .
He said : " The Cubans are the only people in the world who have a leader who can say that he does n't possess one dollar to his name . "
Forbes admits that estimating the wealth of world leaders is " more art than science " , but says the figure is based on Castro's " economic power over a web of state - owned companies " .
Some claim the true figure is in fact much higher , pointing to " the Comandante 's reserves " , billions of dollars in real estate , yachts and other assets in Europe , Latin America and Asia .
YANK TANKS
Cuba has been described as the largest American car museum in the world .
An estimated one - sixth of Cuba 's 500,000 cars were imported from the US in the 1950s .
The supply of classic " yank tanks " stopped when America declared a trade embargo in 1962 , forcing Cubans to become experts in car maintenance .
Spanish government tells church to stop meddling
Relations between Church and State in Spain have worsened after the Government protested to the Vatican about Bishops urging voters to shun the ruling Socialist party in the forthcoming elections .
The Government was angered by the bishops ’ statement opposing social reforms introduced since the 2004 election victory by the PSOE party .
The bishops said that while “ Catholics may support and join different parties it is also true that not all ( electoral ) programs are equally compatible with the faith and Christian demands of life . ”
The reforms included the relaxation of divorce laws , the legalisation of gay marriage and the removal of religious classes from the national curriculum .
The statement has been seen as a thinly veiled call for voters to back the right wing People ’s Party ( PP ) .
The foreign minister , Miguel Ángel Moratinos , lambasted the statement , saying it came from a “ fundamentalist , neoconservative hierarchy that does not even represent the feelings of most Spanish Catholics . ”
The Bishop ’s comments may well backfire against the church and the PP .
Opinion polls regularly show that the Spanish , while still conservative by northern European standards , support the liberal social policies of the Zapatero government , while attendance at church is in steady decline .
According to a poll by Metroscopia published in El País , the PSOE has a small lead over the opposition only weeks ahead of a general election .
42 per cent of respondents would back the PSOE in the March ballot , while 38.6 per cent would vote for the conservative Popular Party .

22 February 2008
While the RIAA sues its customers , and blames filesharing for the decrease in record sales , a coalition of seven independent Swedish record labels explores alternatives that make use of the Internet and filesharing technology .
The increase in music piracy is a signal that customers want something that is simply not available .
High quality , DRM - free music that they can buy online for a reasonable price .
Filesharing is a virtue , and the coalition of Swedish record labels understands this , as they introduce The Swedish Model .
They write :
We in the music industry have shown ourselves unable to follow in this change .
Some of us have even waged war against those the music is recorded for , the listeners .
The rift between producers and consumers has never been bigger .
“ The truth is that Internet has provided us with a fantastic grey scale of possibilities !
Instead of fighting back we ought to obtain learning from the daily newspaper and the computer game industries .
They early realized the superiority of the internet and developed new services there .
This sounds like music to our ears .
We ’ve said it over and over again here at TorrentFreak , The Internet has changed the way people interact with music .
Music is more accessible , more popular and cheaper to distribute .
Record labels should embrace filesharing and compete with piracy instead of fighting it , and it seems like that these Swedish labels understand that .
TorrentFreak spoke with Henrik von Euler of Flora & Fauna , one of the labels participating in the initiative .
We asked him what he thinks the greatest benefits of filesharing are : “ Well the first thing is pretty obvious , that you can reach much larger audiences more quickly , ” he said .
“ You bypass many of the existing power - structures and communicate directly with the listeners .
It is also a very direct medium where the step from production to consumption is extremely short which is good for creativity I think .
In the old days you could have an album ready and have to wait like a year or so to have it released and now you can have your music up online the same day you get the master . ”
Henrik told us that he has “ no beef ” with The Pirate Bay , but he admits that filesharing also has its downsides .
“ On a personal note I find it hard to choose what to listen to ” , he told us “ The vast number of sites , bands etc makes me feel stressed out , like I ’m always missing something .
Speed and accessibility is good because it is fast and accessible but also bad because everything turns more superficial and volatile . ”
Henrik was also quite clear about the lawsuits that the RIAA has started agianst music fans : “ It ’s insane .
It can only have bad consequences .
I do n’t see how they can think antagonizing the listeners will help them secure any of their much desired income . ”
“ This is great ” , says Rick Falkvinge , leader of the Swedish Pirate Party Piratpartiet .
“ There are creative people who think ahead .
These are labels constructing a new business model .
The old dinosaurs lobby politicians , sue to the left and to the right and try to control the internet .
There is room for the services of a label , few musicians want to do everything themselves .
But the labels must serve their musicians and their fans , not the other way around .
These new labels have understood that .
The future belongs to them . ”
The role of the record labels will change in the future , but not entirely according to Henrik von Euler , “ I think the role of the label has started to change long ago .
It moves towards a more creative role much more like the art curator or such like .
And also , just because artists CAN do everything themselves from production to promotion , administration etc does n’t mean that they actually want to . ”
“ On another note , ” says Henrik “ I must add that this is hopefully the last time I will answer questions about filesharing , good or bad .
It is there !
Live with it .
Love it , hate it , I do n’t care .
But please do n’t for a second think that it will go away or that you can solve it like it is a problem .
As President Bush is fond of saying , “ You do n’t have to be a rocket surgeon to use it ! ”
Simply place the nut between her legs and squeeze !
Yikes , it gives Bill shivers just thinking about it .
The Hillary Nutcracker has stainless steel thighs and can crack the toughest nuts !
She ’s ready for you , but is America ready for this Nutcracker ?!

Climate change could lead to a heatwave in the south - east of England killing 3,000 people within the next decade , a Department of Health report said today .
It put the chances of a heatwave of that severity happening by 2017 at 25 % .
Without preventative action , the report said that a nine - day heatwave , with temperatures averaging at least 27 degrees over 24 hours , would cause 3,000 immediate deaths , with another 3,350 people dying from heat - related conditions during the summer .
It predicted that there would be an increase in skin cancers due to increased exposure to sunlight and that , over the next half century , air pollution could lead to an extra 1,500 deaths and hospital admissions a year .
While malaria outbreaks were likely to remain rare , the report – Health Effects of Climate Change in the UK 2008 – said health authorities would need to be alert to the dangers posed by possible larger outbreaks of malaria in continental Europe .
The report , a follow - up to a study first published in 2002 , said the latest modelling now suggested that temperatures would rise by between 2.5C and 3C over the next century .
Periods of very cold weather would become less common , but heatwaves would become more common .
It pointed out that the heatwave in France in 2003 , which contributed to more than 14,000 premature deaths , had been attributed by climatologists , in part , to the influence of human behaviour on the climate ,
" The air pollution climate of the UK will continue to change , " the report went on .
" Though concentrations of a number of important pollutants are likely to decline over the next half - century , the concentration of ozone is likely to increase .
This will increase attributable deaths and hospital admissions .
" The increases are likely to be significant : with the least constraining assumptions … up to about 1,500 extra deaths and hospital admissions per annum might be expected . "
The report also said that new studies had confirmed the effects of increased exposure to ultra-violet light .
" Skin cancers are expected to increase . "
On malaria , the report said there was a very slight chance that the disease could return to the south of England during the next 50 to 100 years .
But outbreaks were likely to be rare and to involve a small number of people .
However , health authorities would have to be on the alert for the emergence of new , more deadly strains of mosquitoes in Europe and the possibility that they could arrive in wetland areas of Britain .
Warmer summers would also lead to an increase in food poisoning .
The report predicted that there would be up to 14,000 more cases of food poisoning , including salmonella , a year – an increase of 14.5 % .
Tick - borne diseases such as Lyme disease were also likely to become more common , but that was more likely to be due to changes in land use than climate change .
Professor Robert Maynard , chairman of the expert panel that wrote the report , said : " Climate change is likely to be one of the major challenges that humanity faces this century .
It is important that we assess the possible health impact and take any actions that could minimise the consequences . "
Sir William Stewart , chairman of the Health Protection Agency , which published the report jointly with the Department of Health , said : " Climate change is perhaps the most significant environmental problem which mankind will face in the coming century .
" Efforts to reduce the extent of climate change are of course important , but it is likely that we will have to deal with at least some impacts on health . "
In a foreword to the report , health minister Dawn Primarolo said the national health service would have to adapt to deal with the problems posed by climate change .
Measures would include : ensuring that hospitals were equipped to deal with the effects of heat , gales , and floods ; developing local plans for heatwaves , gales and flooding ; disaster preparation ; and advising people how to adapt to climate change .

This is pretty much the most dangerous part so have water near by and wear thick leather or welding gloves as well as safety glasses and make sure the area is well ventilated .
You 're going to want to fire it up and put in your crucible .
I 'd wait until the bottom of the crucible is red hot .
( just a personal preference . )
Start out with small pieces of aluminum .
( I had " pipes " from an old wind chime . )
You could use cans but they tend to have a lot of slag .
I 'd wait until you have a nice quantity of aluminum before using cans .
You 'll probably have a rough start so go slow .
After you get a good quantity of aluminum it will be able to maintain a melting temperature and you can melt down large pieces in seconds .
I have found an old knock off of a razor scooter in th back of my garage that has worn out it 's usefulness .
I found a new use for it 's aluminum .
I have found covering the crucible with the top half of the empty propane tank helps keep the heat in and keeps things moving along nicely .
I had a troublesome piece of scooter that did n't want to release it 's steel screw so I dunked it in the pool of molten madness and that half did n't come back .
A mallet made short work of the obstructing piece of metal and allowed us to make a deposit in our crucible .
After you either fill up your crucible or run out of aluminum , you need to scrape off the slag .
The slag will be floating on the top and will look a little different than the metal underneath .
We used a scrap piece of metal to scrape off the slag .
We used the same scrap to make a hook to pick up the crucible and another piece to fit in the holes on the bottom of the crucible so you can easily pour it .
You could use a small screw driver for this .
Make sure you have something to pour the aluminum into .
I am just going to save them for later so I 'm pouring them into one of those " mini muffin " tins just because they 're small and fit in the crucible .
You could just use an impression in wet sand or something .
Muffin tins are faster .
But do n't expect to use them for muffins again .
Pour gently into the mold of your choice .
IT IS HOT !
WEAR PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT !
Because I 'm impatient , I wait until the aluminum in the tins are solid then throw them into a can of water .
The water may boil violently after a short delay .
It is a sight to behold but dangerous .
You now have aluminum ingots .

Post # 1377 : The Relatively Short Goodbye
Hello , everyone .
After 21 years , and almost 40 million posts ( we 'll have to check those numbers , but it 's something like that ) , we have decided to bring FJM to an end .
Although we have not lost our borderline - sociopathic joy for meticulously criticizing bad sports journalism , the realities of our professional and personal lives make FJM a time / work luxury we can no longer afford .
We started this site with two purposes : to make each other laugh , and to aid and abet the Presidential campaign of Bob Barr .
Although we failed in the latter goal , we gleefully succeeded in the first , and thanks to a grassroots internetty word - of - mouth kind of a deal , we appear to have positively affected the lives of actual citizens as well , which astonishes and delights us to this day .
We really never thought FJM would be for anyone but us .
We are thrilled and kind of humbled to have been proven wrong .
We thank all of you for the kind emails , and the tips , and the support .
To each and every person who ever contacted us : hat tip to you .
Perhaps the future holds another project for us on which to waste massive amounts of time .
For now , we will leave the site and the archives up as a testament to the fact that if you work hard enough , and blow off enough social occasions , and stare at the internet enough , and get nerdy enough , and repeatedly ignore entreaties from your friends and loved ones to please God stop blogging about Bill Plaschke and get out of the house it's a beautiful day ! , then you , too , can ... have a blog .
Again , from the bottom of our hearts , thank you .
And as Joe Morgan himself might say :
" I really have n't seen them play ... slidepiece ... Dave Concepcion . "
Love ,

OMG OMG OMG !!!!
OMG you guys !!!!
Could the 19 - year " Sunday Night Baseball " broadcasting partnership of ESPN's Jon Miller and Joe Morgan be coming to an end ?...
Well - embedded baseball moles contend the answer is " yes " to both questions .
Both Morgan and Miller have two years left on their ESPN contracts , but that would not prevent a change .
OMG !
Sources said Morgan could be shifted to the network 's midweek baseball telecast , where he would work with a new play - by - play partner .
OMFG ! [ snip ]
What 's coming to light is how unpopular Morgan has become with many of his ESPN colleagues , who are less than thrilled with the way he prepares for a telecast .
Some of them also do n't respond well to what they call Morgan 's haughty attitude , which he has displayed during some of his more outspoken performances in internal ESPN meetings .
Prone to on - air mistakes , Morgan also has come under some intense media scrutiny .
And during those moments when he 's made a mistake , the give and take between him and Miller can sound strained .
But some of this stuff ( if you do n't take it all seriously ) is kind of funny .
Could n't agree more .
OMFHWOMSHIFHPSKSHHGCDOSAG !!!!!!
Stay tuned .

" What Fucking Language Is This ? "
That is the title of an email I received from Don and Kim M. in reference to
Here are the first four lines -- like the 30 free seconds you get from iTunes .
These are unedited :
On Brett Favre Pass , a legacy catches hell .
Barely makes sense .
It is a dead end street , but a sports bar there is a thoroughfare of debate .
Does not really make sense .
What 's he doing ?
Where was he doing it ?
Who called whom ?
Why Brett why ?
Does not in any way make sense .
Sub -Seussian nonsense .
On Brett Favre Pass , some folks are wishing he had thrown his last .
No .
Bill ?
The English Language is on line 1 .
It wants to know why you hate it so much .
[ Edit : I woke up this morning to several hundred million emails defending Plaschke , and insinuating that what I failed to understand is that Brett Favre Pass is an actual street in Green Bay .
I knew that .
Even if I had n't known that , I could have determined it from context .
It 's capitalized , for God 's sake .
What I object to are clauses like , " ... a legacy catches hell . "
Which : ???
And " ... a sports bar there is a thoroughfare of debate . "
What the fuck is a " thoroughfare of debate ? "
A thoroughfare is a road , or highway , as I understand it .
A highway of debate ?
That makes zero sense .
What he means is " a locus of debate " or " an epicenter of debate " or something .
But that would n't match up faux - poetically with the fact that Brett Favre Pass is a dead - end street , so he went with " thoroughfare , " which is nonsense .
As for the last two lines , I object to : the goofball poetry , the overblown musing , the whimsical Dr. Seuss rhythms , and the unpleasantly haughty linguistic transmogrification of " Pass " into " pass . "
The only person in America , apparently , who assumed I knew that Brett Favre Pass was the name of a street and had something else to comment on was John M. , who wrote :
I ... wish you would have included this sentence , which is not only vintage Plaschke , but also would have given you an excuse to use the food metaphors tag :
" Whatever , it has been the equivalent of a warm farewell followed by the guy changing his mind , barging back through the front door for one last piece of pie , spilling that pie on his lap , dropping messily asleep on your couch . "
For you , John M. , the world . ]

Irrelevant / Counter - Irrelevant
It 's time to play no - one 's favorite game , "
These Phillies wo n't be playing in this World Series because they 're the best team in the National League .
Well , they did win the second - most games , and had the second - best run differential , trailing only the Cubbies .
They scored the second - most runs , had the most HR , and had the fourth - best ERA , only 0.03 behind second - place Milwaukee .
So , maybe they are n't the best team , but they 're certainly very close .
They 're here because they 're the toughest team in the National League .
Fuck all that statistical noise .
It 's about toughness .
The Phillies are tough .
The Phillies are like a hockey team .
The Phillies work in an Alaskan cannery 19 hours a day .
The Phillies could knock out Kimbo Slice in thirteen seconds .
And that toughness is the biggest reason I think they 'll win .
I 'm going with " they hit the most HR in the league and have a really good pitching staff . "
But whatever .
" They 're the most mentally tough team " in the field , an NL general manager told me three weeks ago .
That NL GM ?
Robert Duvall .
Legendarily tough .
Tough old sonofabitch .
He knows tough .
When he said this he was driving in a pick - up truck with 300,000 miles on it , that he built himself , and he was on his way to a black bear - wrestling contest , in which black bears take turns seeing if they can defeat him .
And he 's mentally tough , too .
He once survived fifty days of waterboarding without giving up any information .
The waterboarder ?
Marlon Brando , on the set of The Godfather .
So I think he knows what " tough " is .
By the way , I 'm currently watching Game One of the Series on like an hour TiVo delay , and Tim McCarver , after Shane Victorino almost got picked off second , said something like , " You 've probably heard that you should never make the first or third out at third base , but in this case , you should never make the first out at second base . "
What he could have said : " You should n't get picked off in a [ fucking ] World Series game . "
And he was just the lead singer in a chorus of GMs , scouts , coaching staffs and players who have run into this team along the way .
They 're called the " Stolen Bass - es " and they 're performing this Saturday at the St. Bartholomew Episcopal Church in Germantown , PA .
Tim McCarver just referred to Jason Werth 's double as a " check swing plop job , " which : ewww , and then he talked about Ben Zobrist racing to the line to grab said plop job by saying , " Gives you an idea about the closure [ sic ] speed of the Rays ' outfielders . "
Why is Tim McCarver allowed to broadcast ?
These people are always talking about " the way they play , " and " how hard they play " and how much fun it is to watch these Phillies play .
What [ people who talk about the Phillies ] Talk About When They Talk About [ the Phillies ] :
1 . The way they play
2 . How hard they play
3 . How much fun it is to watch them play
These people sound very interesting and knowledgeable .
These Phillies do n't seem imprisoned by their team 's tortured past .
In an odd way , they almost seem inspired by it .
They constantly talk , right out loud , about how driven they are to write their own history , make their own mark , put their own stamp on their franchise and their ballpark .
Look , as a Red Sox fan , I understand the importance of a traditionally - losing franchise being undaunted by the past .
But let 's also acknowledge that we are deep into this " Why the Phillies Will Win " argument , and we have nary a mention of Cole Hamels , Chase Utley , Ryan Howard , Pat the Bat , Brad Lidge , or , you know , anything related to what actually happens on the field of play .
This is a group that sets the bar as high as it can be set , and a group of players who seem remarkably comfortable on this stage .
What ?
Who ?
When ?
How ?
Which ?
For ?
Make ?
Jump ?
What is the evidence for this platitude ?
They 've won 12 games this year in which they trailed after seven innings .
They 've won 29 games decided from the seventh inning on .
They 've won a half - dozen games they trailed by two runs or more in the eighth inning or later , including a defining NLCS game in Los Angeles last week .
The Phillies will win because they are often behind late in games .
I get it .
I think the Phils should be fine late in the game -- it's not like the Rays ' bullpen
They may not have the best starting rotation in this World Series , but they do have the best starting pitcher -- Cole Hamels .
Hey look !
Something about an actual player !
I expect him to win Game 1 , set the tone and buy the offense a night to apply the Rust - Oleum after a week off .
History does tell us that 10 of the last 11 Game 1 winners have gone on to win the Series .
Actual analysis !
This is so much fun !
( Though that is a pretty small sample size , at least it 's something . )
So Game 1 starters are often Series - changers .
And Hamels fits that mold .
The Phillies also have the best bullpen , and the best closer ( Brad Lidge ) , in this World Series .
Best closer , maybe .
But best bullpen ?
The Rays ' bullpen had a .220 BAA .
The Phillies , in the NL , had a .251 .
Their OPS - against was a little worse , too .
Much like the Rockies last year , this team heads into this World Series playing as well as it has ever played .
So very soon , the Phillies will be able to hoist the Championship Trophy , just like the World Champion 2007 World Series Champion Colorado Champion Rockies , the 2007 World Series Champions of Championships !
Champs !
Maybe 20 - 5 is n't 21 - 1 , but it's in the same stratosphere .
The difference , though ,
... is that the Rockies did n't win the World Series , like you are predicting the Phillies will ?
is these Phillies are n't just a good team that got hot .
They 're a team that was built to win , a team with all the ingredients to win , and THEN they got hot .
...okay ...
As the Rockies found out last October , it is n't always the hottest team that wins the World Series .
The Rockies were hot !
The Phillies are also hot !
The Rockies did n't win !
The Phillies will win , because they are better than the Rockies !
I should go back and rewrite this without invoking the Rockies , which are irrelevant to my argument !
Too late !
Deadline is here !
Oh well !
But when the hottest team is also the toughest team , that 's a whole different story .
You 're telling me .
I just read that story .
And it 's a doozy .
How about this , instead of what you wrote :
The Phillies have a very good pitching staff , a very good bullpen , and hit the most HR in the league .
The Rays are a bunch of 24 year - old kids who had never , before this season , played a meaningful game after like April fucking 13th .
Now it 's time for Counter - Irrelevant : The Tampa Bay Rays Will Win !
As always , my esteemed colleague arrived at his World Series prediction after consulting with scouts , general managers and other people throughout baseball .
It 's time to play no - one 's favorite game , " Irrelevant / Counter - Irrelevant , " with Jayson Stark and Jim Caple .
The goal is to make as many irrelevant points as you can in the space alloted .
First , Irrelevant : The Phillies Will Win!
Well , they did win the second - most games , and had the second - best run differential , trailing only the Cubbies .
They scored the second - most runs , had the most HR , and had the fourth - best ERA , only 0.03 behind second - place Milwaukee .
So , maybe they are n't theteam , but they 're certainly very close .
Fuck all that statistical noise .
It 's about toughness .
The Phillies are tough .
The Phillies are like a hockey team .
The Phillies work in an Alaskan cannery 19 hours a day .
The Phillies could knock out Kimbo Slice inseconds .
I'm going with " they hit the most HR in the league and have a really good pitching staff . "
But whatever .
That NL GM ?
Robert Duvall .
Legendarily tough .
Tough old sonofabitch .
He knows tough .
When he said this he was driving in a pick - up truck with 300,000 miles on it , that he built himself , and he was on his way to a black bear - wrestling contest , in which black bears take turns seeing ifcan defeat .
And he 's mentally tough , too .
He once survived fifty days of waterboarding without giving up any information .
The waterboarder ?
Marlon Brando , on the set of .
So I think he knows what " tough " is .
By the way , I 'm currently watching Game One of the Series on like an hour TiVo delay , and Tim McCarver , after Shane Victorino almost got picked off second , said something like , " You 've probably heard that you should never make the first or third out at third base , but in this case , you should never make the first out at second base .
" What he could have said : " You should n't get picked off in a [ fucking ] World Series game .
" They 're called the " Stolen Bass - es " and they 're performing this Saturday at the St. Bartholomew Episcopal Church in Germantown , PA .
Tim McCarver just referred to Jason Werth 's double as a " check swing plop job , " which : ewww , and then he talked about Ben Zobrist racing to the line to grab said plop job by saying , " Gives you an idea about the closure [ sic ] speed of the Rays ' outfielders . "
Why is Tim McCarver allowed to broadcast ?
What [ people who talk about the Phillies ] Talk About When They Talk About [ the Phillies ] : 1 . The way they play2 .
How hard they play3 .
How much fun it is to watch them playThese people sound very interesting and knowledgeable .
Look , as a Red Sox fan , I understand the importance of a traditionally - losing franchise being undaunted by the past .
But let 's also acknowledge that we are deep into this " Why the Phillies Will Win " argument , and we have nary a mention of Cole Hamels , Chase Utley , Ryan Howard , Pat the Bat , Brad Lidge , or , you know , anything related to what actually happens on the field of play .
What ?
Who ?
When ?
How ?
Which ?
For ?
Make ?
Jump ?
What is the evidence for this platitude ?
The Phillies will win because they are often behind late in games .
I get it .
I think the Phils should be fine late in the game -- it's not like the Rays ' bullpen had the best OPS - against in the entire league or anything Hey look !
Something about an actual player !
Actual analysis !
This is so much fun !
( Though that is a pretty small sample size , at least it 's something . )
Best closer , maybe .
But best bullpen ?
The Rays ' bullpen had a .220 BAA .
The Phillies , in the NL , had a .251 .
Their OPS - against was a little worse , too .
So very soon , the Phillies will be able to hoist the Championship Trophy , just like the World Champion 2007 World Series Champion Colorado Champion Rockies , the 2007 World Series Champions of Championships !
Champs !... is that the Rockies did n't win the World Series , like you are predicting the Phillies will ?... okay ... The Rockies were hot !
The Phillies are also hot !
The Rockies did n't win !
The Phillies will win , because they are better than the Rockies !
I should go back and rewrite this without invoking the Rockies , which are irrelevant to my argument !
Too late !
Deadline is here !
Oh well !
You 're telling me .
I just read that story .
And it 's a doozy .
How about this , instead of what you wrote :
The Phillies have a very good pitching staff , a very good bullpen , and hit the most HR in the league .
The Rays are a bunch of 24 year - old kids who had never , before this season , played a meaningful game after likeNow it 's time for Counter - Irrelevant : The Tampa Bay Rays Will Win !
Did n't seem to help him .
He observed the Phillies up close and personal from opening day to the final game of the NLCS .
He observed their toughness .
Missed all the HR and good pitching performances .
He studied the statistics , sorting through OPS , VORP and WHIP in search of tell - tale trends .
No he very obviously did not .
He did no such thing .
Take that back .
He carefully analyzed player matchups , spoke with the participants and called upon more than 30 years of experience covering the game .
He observed their .
Missed all the HR and good pitching performances .
No he very obviously did not .
He did no such thing .
Take that back .
Then he talked about toughness for twenty paragraphs .
Likewise , I made a careful study before making my prediction .
Namely , I noticed that Tampa Bay rays play in the American League .
Which is why I 'm picking them to sweep .
Not the strongest argument , but I 'll accept it .
The AL ... dominated interleague play yet again this season , winning 149 of the 252 games played .
I 'm not sure what Braves - Royals games have to do with the World Series , really .
I 'm still with you , ish , though .
To put that in perspective , that winning percentage would translate into a 96 victory season .
The last time a league struggled as much as the NL has , Geena Davis was the catcher and Tom Hanks was the manager .
I 'm not sure what Braves - Royals games have to do with the World Series , really .
I 'm still with you , ish , though .
Did n't the AAGPBL become a success , after Geena Davis did that split when she caught the foul pop-up and got on the cover of Life magazine ?
Not that I 've seen that movie 25 times , or anything .
If you 're scoring at home , the Rays were 12 - 6 in interleague play while the Phillies went 4 - 11 , the worst record in baseball .
The Phillies had to play Toronto , Boston , Oakland , LAA , and Texas .
Tampa got Florida , St. Louis , the Cubbies , Houston , Florida again , and Pitt. Eh ... maybe it 's a wash .
The Phils had a rough patch against some pretty good teams .
Big deal .
Look , it 's nice the Phillies won the National League pennant and that Warren Giles trophy will look good in their office .
But now they 're playing with the big boys .
Matt Garza , B.J. Upton , James Shields , Evan Longoria , Carlos Pena , Grant Balfour ... these are all names of people who play for Tampa Bay .
You should talk about them .
The Rays are a well - balanced team with power , speed , great defense and deep pitching .
Getting warmer ...
They are so loaded with young talent that they were able to put a pitcher with just five major league games of experience on the mound and see him silence the defending world champions in two games of the ALCS .
... warmer ...
They have an experienced manager
Joe Maddon : 251-286 ( 537 total games ) .
Never managed in the post - season before this year .
Charlie Manuel : 573-485 ( 1058 total games ) .
Managed in the post - season twice before this year .
It took me 21 seconds to look that up .
who is willing to use his bullpen in unconventional ways if they make sense , rather than sticking to ways that boost his closer 's arbitration figures .
Probably because his " closer , " Troy Percival , is injured and out for the season .
... warmer ... Joe Maddon : 251-286 ( 537 total games ) .

And , more importantly , did I mention they play in the American League ?
Yes .
Very well done .
P.S. Tampa : 2nd - best team ERA , 2nd most Ks. Only 9th - most runs scored .
My money 's on the Phillies .
P.P.S. Originally , after the line about Maddon using his bullpen non-traditionally , I went on a long and snarky diatribe about how Brad Lidge pitched in like 70 games this year and never once went more than one inning .
I was very pleased with myself .
Then Timothy wrote in and politely pointed out that Brad Lidge plays for the Phillies , and Joe Maddon manages the Rays .
So I swiftly deleted that shit and replaced it with the Percival line .
I am , as always , a dummy .

Poetry
Bears - Vikes , 14:56 left in the 2nd quarter .
Marty Booker drops an easy TD pass from Kyle Orton , bringing up 2nd and goal from the 15 .
The announcer , whose voice I do not recognize and whose name I am too lazy to look up , watches the Bears ' offense come to the line and paints his verbal picture thusly :
Everybody out , two wide ends , wide outs , two tight ends , and everybody split out .
And Orton calls time out .
Or , if this were 1959 , in the West Village ,
Everybody out !
[ saxophone blast ]
Two wide ends ,
Wide outs ,
[ saxophone blast ; snare roll ]
Two tight ends , and
Everybody --
[ saxophone blast ]
Split --
[ saxophone blast ]
Out !
[ saxophone solo ]
And Orton
Calls ...
Time out .

" Jerry ' Needs An Instruction ' Manuel " -- Chris Berman ( 1955 -2008 )
KT covered some Manuel lunacy in the Gallimaufry , and there 's more
While the big offensive trio had respectable statistics or better , they did n't stop the September slide .
Manuel said spring training will be a time of teaching , for him to give " clarity " to players on his methods .
Execution in the clutch is his emphasis , and the Mets likely will bring in new offensive players , most likely in the corner outfield spots .
So Manuel plans on teaching " clarity " ( I assume this means making the team watch The Love Guru repeatedly ) , teaching guys to be clutch , and bringing in guys who are clutch .
Good luck with that , Jerry Manuel .
I have some suggestions about how you teach guys to get clutchier :
1. Just before Jose Reyes takes a swing in BP , scream in his ear " It 's Game 7 of the World Series ! " and also punch him in the gut because that 's what butterflies in the stomach feel like .
2. Secretly feed the team laxatives before practice because that 's what butterflies in the stomach feel like .
3 . Make the team eat butterflies .
4. Kidnap Carlos Delgado's kids and hold them at gunpoint while Carlos takes BP .
" You like pressure , Carlos ?
This is what the playoffs feel like . "
Then , after Carlos strokes a home run , shoot one of the kids .
Just in the leg , though .
Remember , it 's just a game .
5. Strap Luis Castillo to a speeding train .
" Unless you hit in the clutch , Castillo becomes the meat in a train sandwich . "
Everyone comes through , and you reveal that you basically just wanted Castillo gone anyway .
6 . One bat in the clubhouse is filled with plastic explosives .
Stay on your toes , gentlemen .
7 . Put up a picture of Derek Jeter in the clubhouse .
8 . Be positive .
" You do n't see a lot of guys that have statistical numbers play well in these championship series , " Manuel said .
This is so bonkers I do n't know where to start .
First of all : what are " statistical numbers " ?
How do they differ from " numbers , " " statistics , " or " numerical statistics " ?
Are there " statistical letters " ?
We have a right to know .
Second : Jerry Manuel is claiming that doing well in the regular season is a detriment to playing well in the playoffs .
That 's right .
You want to be a playoff hero ?
Fuck around for 162 .
Careful , David Wright .
Do n't let those numbers get too statistical !
Third , here are your League Championship Series leaders in on - base percentage :
1. Mark Grace .575
2. Will Clark .529
3. Kevin Youkilis .518
4. Carlos Beltran .476
5. Ryne Sandberg .457
6. Dusty Baker .451
Manny Ramirez .451
8. Darrell Porter .450
Gary Sheffield .450
10 . Albert Pujols .449
Look , these are pretty stupid because we 're talking about minuscule sample sizes .
But those are , for the most part , pretty awesome players .
Players who did accrue very statistical numbers .
Pujols , Manny , Sheffield , Sandberg .
And hey , Carlos Beltran 's number 4 !
Guess what : Carlos Beltran also leads the world in Divisional Series OBP and SLG .
His career postseason OPS is a cool 1.302 .
But he still needs clutch lessons from Jerry Manuel , according to Jerry Manuel .
" What you see is usually the little second baseman or somebody like that carries off the MVP trophy that nobody expected him to do .
That 's because he 's comfortable in playing that form of baseball , so therefore when the stage comes , it 's not a struggle for him . "
Here are the World Series MVPs for the past 10 years :
2007 Mike Lowell
2006 David Eckstein
2005 Jermaine Dye
2004 Manny Ramirez
2003 Josh Beckett
2002 Troy Glaus
2001 Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling
2000 Derek Jeter
1999 Mariano Rivera
1998 Scott Brosius
Two of these 11 players sort of stink .
The rest range from very good to Hall of Fame locks .
Because the best players in the playoffs are the best players .
Period .
Sure , there are Brosius - style flukes once every few years .
But Jerry Manuel is mistaking the fucking Brosius Exception and turning it into the rule .
That 's plain dumb .
Also , Jesus : coaching your team in a way that you think will produce a Craig Counsell or David Eckstein MVP award is white - hot , untrammeled madness .
Your team has : Jose Reyes , Carlos Beltran , David Wright , and Johan Santana .
Your bullpen stinks and you need some more starting pitching depth .
But you were second in the league in runs scored , tied with the Phillies , who are in the World Series .
" Clutch " hitting is not your problem .
" Clarity " on your methods is not your problem .
" Statistical numbers " are certainly not your problem .
But hey , by all means , start getting rid of the guys whose numbers are too good .
The more silly things happen , the better things go for me , a critical asshole with the free time on a beautiful sunny Friday afternoon to blog about dumb remarks about baseball .

Let 's Gallimaufry
This Shizz
Gallimaufry time , mofos .
Mark S. writes in and says :
In the Oct. 13 The Sporting News , somebody put together a panel of 16 former major - league shortstops and asked them some questions .
First I 'll list the 16 : Biancalana , Bordick , Burleson , DeJesus , DeMaestri , Elster , Foli , Fregosi , Harrelson , Joost , Kasko , Kubek , Larkin , Maxville , Menke and Petrocelli .
Second , the relevant question on the table : " Jeter or A - Rod ? "
Survey said :
Jeter 11
Too close to call 3
A - Rod 2
And with it runs a quote from Menke : " A - Rod will end up breaking some records , but Jeter is a winner . "
Interesting .
I have just conducted my own survey .
The question on the table : Biancalana , Bordick , Burleson , DeJesus , DeMaestri , Elster , Foli , Fregosi , Harrelson , Joost , Kasko , Kubek , Larkin , Maxville , Menke , Petrocelli or Logic and Reason ?
The results :
Biancalana : 0
Bordick : 0
Burleson : 0
DeJesus : 0
DeMaestri : 0
Elster : 0
Foli : 0
Fregosi : 0
Harrelson : 0
Joost : 0
Kasko : 0
Kubek : 0
Larkin : 0
Maxville : 0
Menke : 0
Petrocelli : 0
Logic and Reason : 1
I think everyone pretty much knew where I was going with that right from the beginning , which is why it delighted me to actually type it out and make you read it .
Back to
Many people reported this quote from Fire Joe Morgan favorite Joe Morgan , but Rob C. is the one I happened to flag , so he gets all the credit and the rest of you can suck it :
Just driving home from work with ESPN radio's call of the game on .
Morgan talking about Beltran 's great playoff performance in '03 :
" I read an interesting article that talked about how scouts will look at a player 's performance in postseason games to see how his mental makeup is , if he can handle playing under pressure .
I think that makes sense to a degree , but you can't put too much weight into it , because we all know that the playoffs are a very small sample size .
You do n't want to put all your marbles in one basket . "
I almost drove off the road .
This really does make me feel as though something has been accomplished , somewhere , by someone (s ) .
However , lest you think for one second that Mr. Morgan has come to his senses in like a large - picture worldview kind of way , peruse this little beauty from just the other day , sent in by 1.4 million of you , quoted here from Clark :
Joe Morgan just did a location spot during which he asserted -- repeatedly -- that " they [ Red Sox ] can not beat them [ Rays ] by outscoring them . "
And here I 'd thought that was the * only * way to win a game .
Oh , Clark .
You silly man .
There are plenty of ways to win baseball games .
Outscoring your opponent ... not un-outscoring them ... doing the un-opposite of not un-outscoring them ... the list goes on .
Alexander points us to a special video presentation here at Gallimaufry Time , which includes Matt Stairs and what can only be described as unfortunate phraseology :
" You want to rephrase that , Matt ? "
" Yes , I do .
Ahem .
When you get that nice celebration coming in the dugout , and you 're getting your weiner diddled by the guys --"
" Okay , thanks .
That 's enough . "
And now , a special Golf Note , from Chad , who , after a lengthy and kind series of compliments about our site , writes :
A note from the Ryder Cup : Johnny Miller stated , " the US will miss Tiger , as he is one of the two greatest clutch putters of all time .
The other being Jack . "
Guess who is in the top 5 in career putting statistics .
Yup , Tiger and Jack .
The fact that they are better tee to green than anyone else AND were / are great putters is why they are the two greatest GOLFERS of all time !
They had more chances to make " clutch " putts because their long games gave them more opportunities .
They made more " clutch " putts because they are GREAT putters !
Remove the word clutch from Johnny 's statement and it is true .
Clutch is bullshit !
Tiger and Jack have made more non-clutch putts , too !
Once again , because they are great putters !
I digress .
Thank you again for your work .
I thoroughly enjoy it !
Now , you might be thinking , " How did this mildly interesting note about golf make it into the Gallimaufry ? ! "
I 'll tell you why .
Because at the end it says :
Sent from my iPhone
That is insane .
Chad typed that whole thing on his iPhone , people .
Including the all - caps words .
And not one single typo .
It probably took him eleven hours .
That 's dedication .
As long as we 're going multi-media today , here are the Built Ford Tough Keys to the Game from NLCS Game 3 , sent in by Daniel :
Phillies :
Win this game too , like you won the other games , at the other place
Dodgers :
Try to do the things you did 6 weeks ago , when you won a baseball game
I like the idea that " Remember August 30 ! " is a " Remember the Maine ! " - style battle cry for Dodger fans .

I agree , my friend .
You never know what is going to come out of Harold Reynolds ' mouth these days !
Let 's play the
Sporting freshly trimmed , thick braids for the NLCS , Ramirez went 2 - for - 4 .
Not quite the torrid hitting the Dodgers were used to from him since he joined the team ...
What , pray tell , counts as " torrid " in a one - game sample , if not 2 - 4 with a double off the CF wall ?
Even if you think that 2 - 4 is n't " torrid , " using a one - game sample size to evaluate a baseball player is like
Finally , we close with some more bad news for Mets fans .
On his first full day as the Mets ' long - term manager , Manuel forcefully attacked the SABR - type mathematical analysis some have fixated on in recent years .
" You get so many statistical people together , they put so many stats on paper , and they say , well , if you do this and you score this many runs , you do that many times , you 'll be in the playoffs , " he said .
" That 's not really how it works , and that 's what we have to get away from .
And that 's going to have to be a different mind - set of the team in going forward .
We must win and we must know how to win rather than win because we have statistical people .
We have to win because we have baseball players that know and can understand the game . "
Ha ha ha !
I agree , my friend .
You never know what is going to come out of Harold Reynolds ' mouth these days !

Even if you think that 2 - 4 is n't " torrid , " using a one - game sample size to evaluate a baseball player is like using a 4 - game sample size to determine that Eli Manning is suddenly better than Peyton Manning .
And no one would ever be dumb enough to do that .
Finally , we close with some more bad news for Mets fans .
Here 's your new manager , on the first day of his new deal , talking about how to take his team to the next level : Congratulations to the Phillies , for winning the 2008 NL Pennant .

Snippet
We do n't have a lot of time these days , which is why our posts are appearing less frequently than Sarah Palin on Meet the Press .
( Ooooooooooooh shit !
Political humor !
Bam ! )
Anyway , I just got home from work and am watching the highly entertaining latter innings of the NLCS Game 4 , and overheard Timothy McCarver say this :
Boy , a devastating turn of events here in the 8th inning .
The 2 - run shot by Victorino to tie it , and Matt Stairs with a 2 - run homer .
Neither were cheap .
Forget about the big ol ' [ sic ] that needs to nestle its way in there , right after " were . "
Just go look at the videotape of Victorino 's line drive HR , which cleared the RF wall by about 30 inches .
What does " cheap " mean to you , there , Tim ?
That 's it .
Just a little snippet .
We 'll try to post more soon .

Fun With Math
ALCS Game 1 .
Sox up 2 - 0 in the ninth .
Your graphic reads :
ALCS History :
Game 1 winner has won series 12 of 22 times ( 55 % ) .
Your announcer , Chip Caray , says :
As you can see , winning Game 1... very important .
Or : the minimum amount of " important " a thing can be and still be considered " important " in any way .
That 's all .
Just wanted to point that out .

Albert Pujols Was Not A Good Enough Pitcher To Win The MVP
I for one can't wait for the deluge of Ryan Howard - for - MVP columns from older dudes wearing RBI Glasses™ .
RBI Glasses™ : Available at ShittyLensCrafters all across the country .
Hey , here 's the first one , from
Me : Bob Klapisch , you 're writing a column about your awards picks .
What are you going to call it ?
Bob Klapisch ( stopping to think for exactly 0.00038 seconds ) : The Klappie Awards !
I 'm on break .
Bob Klapisch 's Klappie Awards
MOST VALUABLE PLAYER , NL : Ryan Howard , Phillies .
Nope .
Wrong .
So so so so so so so wrong .
You should be criticized on some sort of hypercritical baseball blog for that opinion .
We ’re prepared to face the firing squad on this one , having passed over Albert Pujols .
Klapisch is talking about a literal firing squad .
He has written his farewell notes to his wife and kids .
But he 's doing this because he 's a man .
A man taking a stand .
A man choosing another man who is ranked 30th in his league in VORP for MVP .
These are the kinds of causes for which a man like Bob Klapisch is willing to stare death in the face .
Mark DeRosa and Cristian Guzman had higher VORPs than Ryan Howard .
VORP is not the final word by any means ; it obviously has deficiencies .
But hey , also : Ryan Howard was 6th on his team in OBP .
Think about that .
But as unthinkably dangerous as the Cardinals ’ slugger was , he could n’t get his team to the postseason .
Howard did .
You 're right .
Albert Pujols did not nearly pitch well enough , or for enough innings ( Can you believe zero innings ?
What a bum ! ) for the Cardinals to to make the playoffs .
( The Phillies had a team ERA of 3.88 ; the Cardinals 4.19 .
Albert Pujols ?
More like Albert Not A Very Good Pitching Coach ! )
Pujols should have lobbied to have St. Louis the city moved to Oregon , where his Cardinals would have won the NL West by two games and he would be lauded as a clutch MVP baseball superhero with quality intangibles and a leader with the uncanny ability to come through when it counts .
But unfortunately , Pujols has never been good at getting entire cities to spontaneously change their geographical locations .
Ryan Howard batted .168 in April . Albert Pujols ' batting averages , by month ( and I know batting average does n't matter .
Here they are anyway ) : .365 , .373 , .302 , .347 , .398 , .321 .
Bob Klapisch , do you think for some reason that games played in April do n't count in the standings ?
Ryan Howard batted .213 in August .
Granted , Pujols had better season - long numbers .
Granted , " The Wire " is a " better " show than "
But Howard was in another reality in September , when impact players make their mark .
But " Hole in the Wall " and one very funny moment where a guy could n't fit through the hole in the wall , and that is the kind of impact that impact TV shows make when it counts .
While the Phillies were catching and passing the Mets ( again ) , Howard batted .352 and hit 11 home runs — one every eight at - bats .
While the Cardinals were playing baseball , Albert Pujols batted .357 .
Ryan Howard hit behind Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley .
If Albert Pujols hit behind Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley , he would have had 493 RBI .
Do the math .
It checks out .
He finished the season with a mediocre .251 average , but otherwise led the majors with 48 HR and 146 RBI .
Sure , he hit by far the most home runs .
RBI are bullshit .
Here are things he did n't lead the majors in :
EqA
VORP
WARP1
WARP2
WARP3
OBP
OPS
SLG
WPA
BB
BA
R
Literally any defensive statistic .
Any of them .
Just pick one .
You know who led or was damn close to the lead in a shitload of those statistics ?
Albert Pujols .

Food Metaphor Fans : This One's For You
Tense times in the ALDS , but FJM fans know what 's important to be listening for : food metaphors .
Reader Brandon sends in the following Buck Martinez beauty , re : Jonathan Papelbon .
Jonathan Papelbon , not wasting any time , going to his bread and butter there , and that 's the cheese .
Simply magnificent , Buck .
He sure did n't serve up a meatball !

Colin Cowherd Nonsensical Falsehood of the Day
Driving in this morning , heard Cowbones lay this little ditty on his army of listeners ( paraphrase ) :
Lou Pinella , when he was a player , was the kind of guy who never took a day off .
Lou Pinella ,
1969 : 135
70 : 144
71 : 126
72 : 151
73 : 144
74 : 140
75 : 74
76 : 100
77 : 103
78 : 130
79 : 130
80 : 116
81 : 60
82 : 102
83 : 53
So ...it's truer to say that Lou Pinella , as a player , never did n't take a day off .
Colin Cowherd once again proving : you can just say anything you want and no one will care .

Let 's Talk About What 's Important , Here
Cubs - Dodgers starts in 10 minutes .
Huge series -- probably the most intriguing DS in a pretty overall - intriguing DS year .
Cubs trying to overcome 100 years of failure , the result of a curse put on them by a man with a goat .
( This , unlike other curses , is actually true .
It is an actual curse .
A real - life witchcraft / black arts type situation .
I know , I know -- I do n't generally believe in curses , but in this case , science , logic , and reason all point to the Cubs ' failure to win a World Series being the result of an honest - to - God occult situation .
It 's hard - core fucking Goonies type stuff .
That 's the deal . )
And the Dodgers trying to overcome exceptional mediocrity with the help of Manny Ramirez , who apparently , Red Sox fans are surprised to find out , has been phoning it in since July of 2002 .
Anyway , it should be a very interesting series , and not just because it 's fun to listen to Ron Santo 's insane - yet - somehow - charming homerism .
But let 's get right to the heart of the matter .
How do Yankee fans feel about it ?
I mean , that 's obviously the # 1 fucking thing we all have on our minds , right ?
Where do average , run of the mill Yankee fans stand on the Cubs - Dodgers series ?
Someone should fucking write about that .
Is everyone going to just ignore that huge fucking question mark ?
Is the liberal media just going to blow off the single most important question heading into the Cubs - Dodgers series -- namely : how do Yankee fans feel about it ?!
This is an outrage .
This is a farce .
I cannot believe that nobody is going to investigate how Yankee fans feel about the Cubs - Dodgers series .
I swear to God --
Oh .
Okay , good .
NEW YORK --
Along the avenue that borders the bleacher entrances to Yankee Stadium , the souvenir shops remained shuttered on Tuesday , as did most of the bars and restaurants .
There will be no baseball in the Bronx until next year , and none left in this 85 - year - old facility .
Cubs - Dodgers starts in 10 minutes .
Huge series -- probably the most intriguing DS in a pretty overall - intriguing DS year .

I swear to God-- Oh .
Okay , good .
Someone wrote about it .
Phew .
So there 's no point in writing an article about the Yankees right now .
The End .
But two figures near and dear to Yankees ' fans hearts will take their teams head - to - head in the National League Division Series , as Joe Torre 's Dodgers and Lou Piniella 's Cubs prepare to open their best - of - five series on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. ET on TBS at Wrigley Field .
Lou Piniella , I 'm sorry , is not a " Yankee . "
Lou Piniella is more a Mariner , a [ Devil ] Ray , or a Red than a Yankee .
I know he played for them for like 12 years , but he was n't like super good , really , and he 's way more well - known for being a manager these days , and he won a WS with the Reds , and 116 games with the Mariners one year ...
Hey -- Jeff Suppan is on the Brewers now , and Matt Stairs plays for Philly .
Why do n't you go ask Pirates ' fans how they deal with the gut - wrenching choice of who to root for .
And yes , I am saying that Jeff Suppan is as important to the Pirates as Joe Torre is to the Yankees .
And yes , that is totally fair .
And no , I will not be reading my email after I post this .
Outside the press entrance at Yankee Stadium , fans clustered for autographs from players cleaning out their lockers for the last time .
Even though their Yankees missed the playoffs for the first time in 13 seasons , many still felt a rooting interest with Torre , who brought the Bombers there 12 times .
Lou Piniella , I 'm sorry , is not a " Yankee . "
Lou Piniella is more a Mariner , a [ Devil ] Ray , or a Red than a Yankee .
I know he played for them for like 12 years , but he was n't like super good , really , and he 's way more well - known for being a manager these days , and he won a WS with the Reds , and 116 games with the Mariners one year ... Hey -- Jeff Suppan is on the Brewers now , and Matt Stairs plays for Philly .
Why do n't you go ask Pirates ' fans how they deal with the gut - wrenching choice of who to root for .
And yes , Isaying that Jeff Suppan is as important to the Pirates as Joe Torre is to the Yankees .
And , that isfair .
And , I willbe reading my email after I post this .
" I 'm rooting for Torre .
I 'll always root for him , no matter what , " said Jason Cardona , a 33 - year - old Yankees fan from the Bronx . " [ Piniella ] was n't like Joe Torre .
He never won the World Series four times .
Hey Bryan .
Great article on how Yankees fans feel about the Cubs - Dodgers series .
Great stuff .
I love the part where some random guy says he 's rooting for the Yankees because of Joe Torre .
That really cut to the quick .
But you know what would make the article even more interesting ?
If you could somehow find someone ... who is n't so sure who to root for .
Pat Bostonia of Wayne , N.J. , was more conflicted .
A season - ticket holder who estimated she attended more than 1,000 Yankees home games since the late 1970s , Bostonia , 49 , was not sure who she 'd prefer to see move on to the NL Championship Series .
Bingo .
" [ Torre is ] a great manager and a great guy , and I say good for him , " Bostonia said .
" I do n't wish him any harm .
To tell you the truth , if [ the Yankees ] are n't in , it just does n't mean anything to me .
I do wish him the best .
" If the Yankees are n't in , it just does n't mean anything to me . "
And with that simple declaration , the author of this article , and his employer , MLB.com , realized there was nothing interesting about this angle , and decided never to publish it .
And that 's why you never read it , and I never commented it about it , and you never read my commentary , and none of us wasted our time .
" But I 'm also a big fan of Lou Piniella .
Uh oh !
Now what kind of boring non-bind do we find ourselves in ?!
I 'm not watching anything .
I 'm going to go home and put my head in a corner .
Lou 's a real doll , kicking the dirt and everything .
I love them both . "
Wow , this is getting pretty goddamn uninteresting .
We 'd better keep going .
Is it possible to interview a woman with a comical name that sounds like it was made up by Jackie Mason in the 1960's ?
Miriam Pinto , who drove to Yankee Stadium from Springfield , Mass. , to say goodbye to the old place one last time , said the Dodgers - Cubs series would probably draw her in only because of the 68 - year - old man filling out Los Angeles ' lineup cards .
" I 'll probably flip back and forth on them , but to see Joe Torre sitting there , I think that 's a good thing , " Pinto said .
" I 'm upset the Yankees are n't there , but Joe Torre deserves it .
I think [ the Yankees ] let him go in the wrong way . "
There you have it .
A made - up woman with a ridiculous name is a fan of Joe Torre .
But what about people with names that are bad parodies of Italian - American Sopranos - style goombahs ?
What do they think ?
" I was glad that he left for somewhere else , " added Savino Stallone , 54 , who made the drive from Stormville , N.Y. , with his daughter , Jennifer , and son , Joseph .
1 . There 's no one named " Savino Stallone " in the whole world .
2 . There 's no such place as " Stormville , NY . "
This is a parody of Italian people .
You got drunk and made all of this up .
3 . If there were actually a person named Savino Stallone , from Stormville , NY , his kids would not be named Jennifer and Joseph .
They would be named I - Roc and Pasta Fagiole .
Steve Lombardi , who operates the Yankees fan site WasWatching.com -- a play on Phil Rizzuto 's old scorecard trick of writing " WW " for plays he 'd missed -- plans to watch the NLDS closely , believing that the winner may very well go on to win the NL pennant .
Here --
I 'll rewrite this graf in a way that points out how pointless this article is : Steve Lombardi , who likes baseball , plans to watch the NLDS closely , believing that the winner may very well go on to win the NL pennant .
When the part of the paragraph that links it to the overall premise can be removed without any consequence to the paragraph , there is something wrong with the premise .
" I want to see the Cubs win it all because I believe that gives Lou Piniella an excellent shot at making Cooperstown as a manager , " Lombardi wrote in an e-mail .
You emailed this guy ?
You sat down and emailed him ?
This was pre-meditated ?!
" Lou won 90 games with the Yankees [ in 1986 ] .
Not interesting or remarkable .
He won a ring with the 1990 Reds .
His teams in Seattle made the postseason and once won 116 games in a season .
Bringing the Cubs their first ring in a century would be the icing on the cake for Lou 's resume -- and one that Cooperstown could not ignore . "
This is probably true .
And you know what no one in the entire world would think about , or care about , or mention in his HOF ceremony ?
The three years he mediocre -ly managed the Yankees .
Further complicating the issue ,
Is that even possible ?!
This issue is so complicated already !!!!!!!111!!1!!11!11!111!11!!!1111 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!
111111 !!!!!!!
1111111111111
on some level , is the makeup of the Dodgers ' roster .
While Torre , Mattingly and -- to a lesser extent -- Dodgers third - base coach Larry Bowa and reliever Scott Proctor lend a Yankees flavor , the Red Sox are especially well represented .
Oh shit .
Oooooohhhhhhhhhhh shit .
There are former Red Sox on the DOdgers ?!!?!?!?!?!?
How WILL the YANKEE FANS ' OPINOINS OF THE CUBS_DODGERS SERIES be changed nowe THAT tTHEY HAVE THIS INFORMATION BAOUT THERE ARE RED SOX FANS on the DoDGERS ?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Manny Ramirez hit .396 in 53 games after joining Los Angeles and changed the clubhouse culture of a team that also features Derek Lowe and Nomar Garciaparra , three frequent thorns in the Yankees ' sides .
Sure , I 'll write this article .
How much will I get paid ?
A dollar a word ?
Okay .
Then I 'll just keep writing words until you tell me to stop .
Cool ?
" Those are former Boston Red Sox players and I 'm not too friendly with them , " Cardona said .
" Like Jorge Posada said on [ the YES Network program ] ' CenterStage , ' he can't stand the Red Sox .
I do n't blame him .
I 'll always be a Yankees fan , no matter what . "
You heard it here first : Yankee fans will continue to root for the Yankees .
How is this not the main headline on Drudge ?
" It 's very strange , but let me tell you -- since Manny left Boston , I'm a Manny fan now , " Pinto added .
" He 's just got to cut his hair , that 's it . "
So , let me get this straight .
Now that a guy does n't play for the team you hate , but rather plays for a team you are neutral about , which is managed by your favorite team 's former manager , you no longer dislike that player as much ?
Where is CNN ?
Where is the MSM on this ?
Where is the Presidential address from the Rose Garden ?
Why am I still typing these dumb sarcastic rejoinders ?
Oh my God , look -- he 's still writing this article .
Robert Anderson , 45 , made the trip to Yankee Stadium from Brooklyn , N.Y. , on Tuesday , hoping as much for autographs -- Chien - Ming Wang and Joba Chamberlain stopped and signed for most -- as to spend a little more time at his favorite stadium .
Saying that " there are a lot of memories in this place , " Anderson said his interests would be with the man who steered his club during the most recent dynasty seasons .
This is the same result as the first person you interviewed .
Why are you including this ?
" I'm pulling for him , " Anderson said .
" I 'll go for the Dodgers .
You 've got Torre , Mattingly , Bowa .
I 'll watch it , but it will never be the same because we 're not in it . "
So there you have it .
Yankee fans : owners of various boring feelings about an event that does n't really affect them .
So there you have it .

Dear Jon Heyman
Okay , I thought I was finished , but I 'm not .
Dear Jon Heyman ,
I know you probably think you 're a guy who " does n't rely on stats " and " thinks there 's more to the game than numbers , " but I submit to you that the only reason you selected Francisco Rodriguez to be your AL MVP ( MVP ! ) is that he corralled a large ( a record , in fact -- ! ) number of saves .
Saves , as I 'm sure you 've been told many times , are a ridiculous stat , the kind of stat that gives stats a bad name .
So you really should n't use them when making such important decisions as selecting your fictional # 1 MVP choice on your fake MVP ballot .
I will now list various players , persons , and other entities in the American League of U.S.A. professional baseball who were more valuable than Francisco Rodriguez :
Grady Sizemore
Joe Mauer
Dustin Pedroia
Alex Rodriguez
Carlos Quentin
Josh Hamilton
Milton Bradley
Aubrey Huff
Miguel Cabrera
Kevin Youkilis
Ian Kinsler
Brian Roberts
Nick Markakis
Vladimir Guerrero
Mark Teixeira
Jermaine Dye
Cliff Lee
Roy Halladay
Ervin Santana
Joe Saunders
Jon Lester
Daisuke Matsuzaka
John Danks
Joe Nathan
Mariano Rivera
Joakim Soria
Joe Maddon
Terry Francona
Mike Scioscia
The crowd at Camden Yards
A replay monitor
Heart , the intangible quality
Heart , the band
Ed Hochuli
The wind
Chief Wahoo
Jim Abbott
Curtis Pride
Gravity
Roberto Petagine
Levi Johnston
Birds -- all of them .
Just birds in general .
This guy Rick who fixed my rearview mirror
Monster.com
Zombie Bernie Mac
I bet if Scot Shields or Jose Arredondo were the closer they would have broken Bobby Thigpen 's record too , I 'm just saying -- does this count as an entity ?
Evan Longoria

I Figured Out How To Win The MVP
I want to stop writing about Jon Heyman .
We 're not targeting him , we 're not keeping an eye on him , we do n't have anything personal against him .
Honestly : you send shit in , we read each thing , and then we decide which things make us angry .
makes me angry .
I mean , look , it 's late , I just ate a giant bone - in ribeye and I 'm sleepy .
But a quick rundown here : guess who Heyman picks for AL MVP ?
( Easy one .
Just think about who would make you the angriest . )
Yeah .
It 's K - Rod .
The same K - Rod who ranks something like 80th amongst relief pitchers in WHIP .
Behind dudes like Tyler Walker and Mike Lincoln and other made - up names of guys who went to your high school .
Do n't like WHIP ?
Fine .
He was also only fourth amongst relief pitchers in the AL in WPA .
It gets better .
Numbers one and two on Heyman 's NL MVP ballot were Manny Ramirez and C.C. Sabathia , two men who combined to play something like 4 total innings in the NL .
I 'm not even being nitpicky here .
Take a look at the MVP criteria :
The rules of the voting remain the same as they were written on the first ballot in 1931 :
1. Actual value of a player to his team , that is , strength of offense and defense .
2. Number of games played .
3. General character , disposition , loyalty and effort .
4. Former winners are eligible .
5 . Members of the committee may vote for more than one member of a team .
See number two there ?
Yeah .
Apparently the rules of voting do n't mean a goddamn thing to Jon Heyman .
So here 's my secret way to win the MVP .
Play 50 games really well , then sit out the rest of the year .
Say you injured your biceps , your triceps , your quadriceps , and your quinticeps ( these are fake muscles ) .
Then wait until the end of the year and pray that your team narrowly makes the playoffs .
You point to your amazing 50 - game run and Jon Heyman and his ilk immediately choose to ignore the literally hundreds of players who played full seasons in blatant disregard for the rules of voting .
Or how about this : people like Heyman say that if your team does n't make the playoffs , then the whole season is essentially completely devoid of value .
Nothing -- nothing you do can redeem your individual performance .
But let 's take it a step further .
No one remembers who gets eliminated in the NLDS .
Hell , who cares who loses in the World Series ?
The only team that has a season of value at all is the team that wins it all .
So let 's wait until the absolute end of the playoffs , until the final out is recorded , and every year we 'll give the MVP to the guy who has the ball when the World Series ends .
' Cause fuck every guy who 's not on a winner .
Fuck you if your teammates were only good enough to get you to within one win of the wild card .
That renders your season moot .
I will insert a baseball - playing and is n't that the definition of value ?
Yes .
Yes it is .
I want to stop writing about Jon Heyman .
We 're not targeting him , we 're not keeping an eye on him , we do n't have anything personal against him .
Honestly : you send shit in , we read each thing , and then we decide which things make us angry .
This makes me angry .
I mean , look , it 's late , I just ate a giant bone - in ribeye and I 'm sleepy .
But a quick rundown here : guess who Heyman picks for AL MVP ?
( Easy one .
Just think about who would make you the angriest . )
Yeah .
It 's K - Rod .
The same K - Rod who ranks something like 80th amongst relief pitchers in WHIP .
Behind dudes like Tyler Walker and Mike Lincoln and other made - up names of guys who went to your high school .
Do n't like WHIP ?
Fine .
He was also only fourth amongst relief pitchers in the AL in WPA .
It gets better .
Numbers one and two on Heyman 's NL MVP ballot were Manny Ramirez and C.C. Sabathia , two men who combined to play something like 4 total innings in the NL .
I 'm not even being nitpicky here .
Take a look at the MVP criteria :
See number two there ?
Yeah .
Apparently the rules of voting do n't mean a goddamn thing to Jon Heyman .
So here 's my secret way to win the MVP .

Fuck you if your teammates were only good enough to get you to within one win of the wild card .
That renders your season moot .
I will insert a baseball - playing tarsier at first base in Game 7 of the World Series , and when the closer fields a comebacker to the mound and flips it to that tarsier , I will declare the tarsier the MVP of baseball because without him who knows what would have happened to the team during that final out ?
Yes .
Yes it is .

Holy Cow , Does Jon Heyman Hate VORP
I just crunched some numbers and data about various things that exist , using a scientific process verified by several mathematicians at top universities , and I came up with some interesting results .
Here are the five most boring things in the world , in order :
5 . Slowed - down time - lapse photography of a small puddle of room - temperature water evaporating .
4 . Two people you have never met , wearing identical colorless shirts and pants , talking about the dreams they had last night .
3. Debating what " Valuable " means w/r/t " Most Valuable Player . "
2. Lying in a sensory deprivation tank and staring straight ahead at a blank wall while you listen to white noise .
1. Ann Coulter
So right away , we 're on risky ground with articles like
Once again , VORP has nothing to do with MVP
Zero .
There 's a number the stat people will understand .
That 's the relationship between VORP , the stat that the stat people love , and MVP .
Well , that 's just not true .

" 2. Lying in a sensory deprivation tank and staring straight ahead at a blank wall while you listen to white noise .
1 . Ann CoulterSo right away , we 're on risky ground with articles like this one from SI. com 's Jon Heyman -- it 's the third most boring thing in the world , according to science .
And beyond that , it 's borderline hysterical in its boring and righteous anger :
Well , that 's just not true .
If you hate the stat , you hate the stat .
I 'm not sure why you should hate a stat that uses a relatively sophisticated model to calculate not just how good a guy 's stats are , but also what position he plays , and essentially evaluates how hard he is to replace ( the true measure of " value , " to me ...oh God ... I 'm the third - most boring guy in the world right now ) .
But if you hate it , you hate it .
Not much I can do but keep posting on this blog .
You cannot , however , say that there is " zero " relationship between VORP and MVP .
Because even if you choose to ignore it , it exists .
Last year ARod won the MVP , and was 1st in baseball in VORP .
Rollins , kind of a crummy pick , was at least top - 10 ( 9th , actually , in the NL , behind several other more deserving candidates ) .
People were generally happy with the choice of Ryan Howard in 2006 ... and it just so happens that he was 2nd in the NL in VORP , right behind Pujols .
Morneau was a terrible choice , much - reviled and controversial ... and he was 13th in the AL .
I do n't really remember anyone complaining about Pujols or ARod in 2005 ... and they were 2 - 3 in VORP in all of baseball .
Only DLee was above Pujols in the NL , and if he had won , nobody would 've been angry .
Keep looking at should win , we can look at VORP .
Right ?
Baseball Prospectus , as of a few days ago , had Alex Rodriguez leading the AL in VORP ( which stands for ( Value Over Replacement Player ) the stat its enthusiasts think is the best stat in the world to determine player value , and also the best to help determine who 's the Most Valuable Player .
You cannot , however , say that there is " zero " relationship between VORP and MVP .
Because even if you choose to ignore it , it exists .

Only DLee was above Pujols in the NL , and if he had won , nobody would 've been angry .
Keep looking at the list .
The MVPs of the league are generally very high VORPulators , year - to - year .
So it makes some sense that in order to predict who will win , or whowin , we can look at VORP .
Right ?
Maybe not " the best , " but , you know , pretty effing good , I think .
Better than batting average .
But as you can see , while VORP may tell you something , it should n't determine who wins the MVP award .
Beyond containing two of the letters in MVP , there appears to be almost no relationship whatsoever here .
But ... I just ... we ... you ... I... facts ...
I happened [ sic ] to love A - Rod .
He 's turned himself into a very good third baseman ( he 's probably the best defender on the Yankees ) , he 's a three - time MVP ( though I do n't believe he deserved it the year his Rangers finished last ) , he 's the best all - around player in the game and he's not among the prime list of reasons for the Yankees ' demise this year ( though , there are plenty of Yankees officials who'd have him on that list ) .
Yet , A - Rod should n't sniff the MVP award this year .
I 'm with you on this , for the record .
Like every other bored American who is bored at the yearly debate over what boring ways we should boringly parse the boring term " Valuable , " when there is no 100 % obvious winner , like Barry Bonds the year he steroided .370/.582/.799 with 46 contes for a team that made the playoffs , I take the famous approach espoused by Supreme Court Justice Stewart in reference to pornography , who said , " I can't define exactly what pornography is , but oh lordy , this FMF pictorial has me hard as a diamond . "
In other words , given a number of players with roughly equal stats , there is a kind of gut - level instinct one uses to cast the tie - breaking vote .
That could be : did the guy 's team make the playoffs , and was he an important part of the stretch run ?
Did the guy happen to have a lot of hits in crucial situations ?
Did other players on his team go down with injuries , making his production even more important to his team ?
And perhaps most importantly , is this guy a SS or CF or C or something , meaning that his production from that position is even more valuable , given the paucity of high - production players at that position ?
( In other words , in addition to whatever kind of gut - checking you want to do , you can look at VORP and WPA and stuff like that . )
For the record , again ,
( In other words , in addition to whatever kind of gut - checking you want to do , you can look at VORP and WPA and stuff like that . )
For the record , again , ARod 's WPA is barely above 0 this year -- 0.28 .
Look at Mauer's .
Or Pedroia's .
Or a bunch of other people 's .
He is not the MVP this year .
If devotees of VORP ( I 'm already on their bad side after calling them VORPies last year ) think their stat is key to determining the MVP , they should think again .
It 's worth a glance , at best .
It 's worth a glance at least .
It 's a measure of how valuable a player is , compared to other people at his position .
What is the downside of looking at it very seriously ?
But VORP is supposed to be an all - encompassing stat ,
No it 's not .
Does n't account for defense , and does n't account for " clutch " the way WPA does .
No one is arguing it is all - encompassing .
No one .
What people do argue , occasionally , is that if a guy is n't even in the like top 10 for VORP or something , like Justin Morneau that year , maybe he should n't be the MVP .
and it led some numbers people to determine that Hanley Ramirez was a viable NL MVP candidate last year .
And led many to say that David Wright was the NL MVP in a year in which Wright 's Mets choked ( Wright himself says no way was he MVP ) .
1 . HRam was , indeed , a viable candidate .
2 . What is Wright supposed to say ?
" I know my team choked harder than any team in the history of sports , but : Me for MVP ! "
3 . I do n't understand why people debate about whether a guy 's team has to make the playoffs to win the MVP , and some say " yes " and some say " no , " but when a guy 's team just barely misses the playoffs at the last possible second , meaning that they were in the race the whole year , and the guy in question hit .352/.432/.602 in September with 6 HR and 9 2B , it 's like , " No fucking way that guy is teh MVP !!1!!!!!111!!! "
VORP , like other stats , does n't come close to telling you everything .
It does n't take into account how a hitter hits in the clutch ( oddly enough , some stat people think that 's just luck , anyway ) , See above .
Then see WPA page .
Then remember that no one in the world with a brain thinks that the MVP award should be blindly handed out to the guy with the best VORP .
As for " clutch " " just being luck , " what we actually think is that it 's very hard to be " clutch " year in and year out .
( For example , ARod 's WPA last year was 6.85 .
This year it 's 0.28 .
Two excellent offensive years , two wildly different " clutch " results . )
or how many meaningful games he played in ( at last count Grady Sizemore was high up on the VORP list , as well ) .
VORP has some value .
But like all other stats , it does n't replace watching the games or following the season .
I have never watched a baseball game , so I can't speak to this .
I 'm not even sure what it is .
What I can tell you is : watch live baseball all you want .
I 'll be in my grandmother 's attic ( following a legal dispute over squatter 's rights with my mom w/r/t her basement ) , staring at my computer , looking at a little thing I like to call " data . "
That 's all I care about .
Data .
Raw data .
Baseball is good for one thing only : the production of data .
That 's what I believe .
If I and my friends had it my way , the games would n't even be " played , " but rather " simulated " by 1000 PCs , and the results would be downloaded directly into my brain through Optical Quanta Resonance ( OQR ) , and instead of " discussing " the games the next day , my friends and I would just await the Retinal Scans and then text each other brief congratulations , depending on whose favorite " team " won , and then we would all go on with our lives , grateful that the annoyance of actual " baseball " had been removed from our lives , allowing us to spend more time writing code for our start - up social network site , which we are I think going to call " Together -ing ! "
A - Rod may have the best VORP .
But he should n't be on anyone 's MVP ballot , much less at the top of the ballot .
I now want ARod to win .

It 's Cool
It 's cool everybody .
Everything 's cool .
Jason Bartlett was
I know , I know , he 's supposed to be a very good defender .
But let me say some things about Jason Bartlett :
He 's missed like 30 games this year ; he's hit three fewer home runs this year than Carlos Zambrano ; he 's 8th on his own team in VORP ; and he plays on the same team as Carlos Pena , Evan Longoria , and B.J. Upton .
I just want to announce here on this blog , that if any baseball analyst of any kind tells me that " you really have to watch Jason Bartlett play every day to understand how much he means to this team , " and that same analyst is found drowned at the bottom of my hot tub the next morning , and I am found standing upon that corpse , in the hot tub , wearing my trunks and a hoodie and just relaxing and smoking a joint , and maybe ordering a pizza or something , and instructing the delivery guy to come in through the gate because I 'm in the back standing on a body in my hot tub -- if all of that happens , I would really appreciate if someone could meet me outside , by my hot tub , and float me a few dollars for the pizza , because I will be in no mood to get off of that corpse , or get out of the hot tub for that matter , and plus I will probably have forgotten to bring some money out to the hot tub with me .
Thanks guys .
You 're the best .

Ned Colletti Should Be Time Magazine 's Person Of The Millennium
I know it 's early , but I do n't think it 's too early to make that call .
After all , the Dodgers have a winning percentage of .517 .
Think about it .
51.7 % of the time , the boys in blue have vanquished their opponents and bathed in their blood .
If you ask
General manager Ned Colletti , belittled all season for the signings of Jones , Pierre , Jason Schmidt , Rafael Furcal ( who may yet return to play shortstop ) , Hideki [ sic ] Kuroda and Nomar Garciaparra , is now a candidate for Executive of the Year after picking up Ramirez , Casey Blake and Greg Maddux for a pittance .

2 . Here is a list of teams with winning percentages greater than that of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball organization :
Tampa Bay Rays
Boston Red Sox
Toronto Blue Jays
New York Yankees
Chicago White Sox
Minnesota Twins
Los Angeles Angels
New York Mets
Philadelphia Phillies
Chicago Cubs
Milwaukee Brewers
Houston Astros
St. Louis Cardinals
Yes , the Los Angeles Collettis are tied for the 14th - best record in baseball .
The Florida Marlins also sit at 77 - 72 , but keep in mind that Marlins GM Michael Hill had the luxury of a $ 22,650,000 payroll , whereas Ned had to make to with just $ 118,188,536 .
Juggling the egos of guys who make more than the entire Marlins pitching staff is n't easy !
The great thing about the Dodgers is that their biggest problem - the oppressive weight of clubhouse discord - seemed to disappear overnight .
In Bruce Jenkins ' world , there exists one Universal Baseball Law :
The significance of the oppressive weight of clubhouse discord >>
The significance of hitting
Jenkins ' sentence is actually spot -on , if you 'll allow me to adjust the wording slightly .
The great thing about the Dodgers is that their biggest problem - their complete inability to hit for power - seemed to disappear overnight when they got a guy who could hit for power .
There .
It 's the best sentence Jenkins and I have ever co-written !
Of course Colletti gambled on Manny -- you 're getting fired if you do nothing , so you might as well pay the price in talent ( no one the greater Los Angeles area seemed to place any value on the next six or whatever years of Andy LaRoche ) to acquire a rent - a- player in a desperate Hail Mary attempt to save your job .
And hey .
Look .
It worked .
That was easy .
Jeff Kent , forever disapproving of the club 's petulant youth , was lost to a knee injury ( it has to be more than coincidental that the Dodgers won 10 of their first 11 games in his absence ) .
It has to be more than coincidence -- we thus have conclusive evidence that Jeff Kent was poisoning his teammates just like that mom in the Sixth Sense did to the little kid version of Mischa Barton .
Jeff Kent -- tragic sufferer of Munchausen syndrome by proxy .
Torre put financial issues aside , benched Juan Pierre and Andruw Jones , and stabilized the outfield - for now and years to come - with Ethier and Matt Kemp .
Somehow , the fact of the existence of Juan Pierre and Andruw Jones on the payroll and the fact that it required one hundred - some - odd games and the addition of a Hall of Fame outfielder to compel Torre to bench Messrs .
Pierre and Jones are now points in Colletti's and Torre 's favor ?
This is the equivalent of two gardeners driving to your house , digging a twenty - foot hole in your front yard with a backhoe , buying two bags of sand , pouring the bags into the hole , and then getting lavished with praise for the sand part of the whole operation .
Arizona 's problem is n't so much the standings .
That deficit could disappear in a week .
Well , actually , the standings are a huge problem for Arizona .
They 're 4.5 back with 14 to play .
That 's an enormous deficit .
Of course it could " disappear in a week , " but that 's incredibly unlikely .
BP has them at 2.05397 % to win the division .
That sounds like a problem to me .
It 's the club 's desultory reaction to a crisis .
Virtually all of the fire and inspiration from last year 's team - Eric Byrnes , Jose Valverde , Orlando Hudson , Carlos Quentin when healthy - has vanished .
You heard it here first : the reason Brandon Webb and Dan Haren pitched four shockingly , horrifyingly grotesque abominations of games against the Dodgers was the absence of Eric Byrnes and Eric Byrnes ' Motivational Hair™ .
Eric Byrnes ' Motivational Hair™ , winning division races since 2007 .
( Eric Byrnes ' Motivational Hair™ comes with seventeen free instances of Eric Byrnes Inspirationally Falling Down While Throwing The Ball©® ( patent pending ) . )
I know it 's early , but I do n't think it 's too early to make that call .
After all , the Dodgers have a winning percentage of .
Think about it .
51.7 % of the time , the boys in blue have vanquished their opponents and bathed in their blood .
If you ask Bruce Jenkins , for this Colletti deserves nothing less than the Executive of the Year Award .
If you ask me , we should stop kidding ourselves and just give Colletti the MVP , the Cy Young , the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award and the Latin Grammy for Record of the Year .

A cloned human embryo has been produced for the first time from a skin cell , raising the prospect that such embryos could be made to provide stem cells tailored to any patient .
Only one cloned human embryo has been made before , reported by a team at Newcastle University , UK , in 2005 .
But it was made by cloning human embryonic stem cells that are not routinely available from patients , and so would not be practical .
The embryo newly created from a skin cell potentially gets round this problem .
The ultimate aim is to make temporary embryos from which human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) could be extracted – these are the cells in embryos from which all tissues of the body originate .
Once obtained , these could be turned into tissue for treating the patient without any fear of rejection , as the cells originated from the patient .

Emptied eggs
But Stemagen , the company in La Jolla , California , US , which reported the breakthrough on Thursday , says its researchers did not manage to extract any stem cells from their cloned embryos .
“ We are currently pursuing the generation of embryonic stem cell lines from embryos generated using [ our ] protocols , ” say the researchers .
Starting with skin cells donated by two men and eggs donated by three young women undergoing fertility treatment , they made each embryo by fusing the nuclear DNA from a skin cell with an egg emptied of its own nuclear DNA .
Of the 21 embryos created through this process , called somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) , five survived and grew into blastocysts containing between 40 and 72 cells .
Proof of cloning
And of these five , three turned out to contain DNA from the skin cell of the man , proving it had been reprogrammed to become an embryo .
Even more crucial , one of these three was proved to contain mitochondrial DNA from the woman who donated the egg , the only remaining female DNA in the clone .
This is taken to provide definitive evidence that the technique worked .
Mitochondrial DNA is found in the egg lining , and is vital for cloning because it contains the instructions for reprogramming the skin cell back to an embryo .
So finding the male nuclear DNA and the female mitochondrial DNA in the same embryo proved it was cloned .
“ This study demonstrates , for the first time , that SCNT can be utilised to generate cloned human blastocysts using differentiated adult donor nuclei remodelled and reprogrammed by human oocytes , ” say the researchers .
But they acknowledge that the most important objective remains to prove that such embryos yield hESCs .
“ The data we present are not in any way the final word on the topic , ” says team leader , Andrew French .
DNA fingerprinting
A team led by Woo Suk Hwang at Seoul National University in South Korea claimed to have produced hESCs in this way , but the research turned out to be fraudulent .
To avoid similar accusations , the Stemagen team went to great lengths to have their findings validated using DNA fingerprinting .
“ The results verified , for the first time through DNA and mitochondrial DNA fingerprinting , that of the five blastocysts , only one had the donor cell genomic DNA and the oocyte mitochondrial DNA , ” says Miodrag Stojkovic at the Prince Felipe Investigation Centre in Valencia , Spain , in commentary accompanying the paper in the journal Stem Cells .
Stojkovic , a member of the Newcastle team that produced the previous cloned human embryo , says the breakthrough is a key advance towards patient - specific treatments .
“ Although these results are preliminary , since no stem cell lines have been derived from the cloned embryos , this may now be attempted . ”
Hybrid clones
In the UK , meanwhile , two research teams received licences from the government ’s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to try reprogramming human skin and other adult cells by fusing them with cow or rabbit eggs .
“ Cow eggs seem to be every bit as good at doing this job as human eggs , so it makes sense to use them since they are much more readily available , ” says Lyle Armstrong of the International Centre for Life at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne .
The aim is to just use them as a scientific tool to find out how to reprogramme cells without using human eggs , which are in short supply .
Armstrong , also part of the Newcastle team which produced the only other cloned human embryo , commends the Stemagen breakthrough .
“ It ’s very significant that they ’ve done it with skin cells , ” he says .
But Armstrong feels the Stemagen breakthrough will be important for research , not treatment , because hundreds of thousands of eggs would be needed for the technique to be useful clinically .
“ I think the tiny number of eggs from women would preclude medical use , ” he told New Scientist .
“ Our ultimate aim is to replicate the reprogramming the egg does , but without the egg , ” he says .
A team led by Shinyu Yamanaka of Kyoto University reported doing precisely this last November , reprogramming skin cells by exposing them to four natural growth factors .
But the technique , which generated “ induced pluripotent stem cells ” similar to hESCs , required viruses that would make it too dangerous to apply clinically .

Canada and Australia feature the most attractive destinations in the Economist Intelligence Unit 's ranking of cities ' liveability worldwide ( see full report ) .
Cities with the best scores benefit from relatively low crime rates , little threat from instability or terrorism and well - developed infrastructures .
Vancouver comes out on top , as it has done in previous surveys , with an index rating of just 1.3 % .
Economic , political and social instability tends to foster hardship .
This is highlighted in particular in Harare , which ranks as the least attractive destination of those surveyed owing to ongoing economic and political uncertainty in Zimbabwe .
The threat of terrorism or conflict plays a large part in the rankings of cities that score poorly for liveability , as other indicators such as infrastructure and recreational availability often suffer where violence occurs .
While liveability considers factors of recreational and cultural availability , the " big city buzz " can also hamper scores .
From this perspective , global centres such as New York , Tokyo , London and Paris have become victims of their own success .
Financial opportunities and a strong cultural offering can attract visitors on a scale that can exacerbate congestion and crime levels .
This has also been compounded by the targeting of terror attacks on large centres such as London and New York .
Despite this , most major centres do not present any significant challenges to liveability .
Over one - half of the cities surveyed ( 66 ) fall into the top bracket of liveability , where there are few , if any , challenges to the quality of living .
Most of these are based in Western Europe and North America .
Latin America and Eastern Europe are experiencing improvements as infrastructure and related stability improves .
These regions have three locations each in the top tier of liveability , but no city in either the Middle East or Africa falls into the top bracket .
The Economist Intelligence Unit's Liveability Index quantifies the challenges that might be presented to an individual 's lifestyle in any given location , and allows for direct comparison between locations .
There are five categories in the index : stability ; healthcare ; culture and environment ; education ; and infrastructure .
Across the survey a combination of quantitative and qualitative data is used to give an overall Quality of Life Index rating .

Houston scientists see hope in cocaine vaccine Baylor doctors say shots block the drug 's high
The needle may be one of addiction 's enduring symbols , but two Houston researchers hope injections of modified cocaine actually provide the first - ever medication for people hooked on the destructive drug .
The Baylor College of Medicine scientists have developed a cocaine vaccine , currently in clinical trials , that stimulates the immune system to attack the real thing when it 's taken .
As a result , cocaine no longer provides a kick .
" For people who have a desire to stop using , the vaccine should be very useful , " said Dr. Tom Kosten , a psychiatry professor who was assisted in the research by his wife , Therese , a psychologist and neuroscientist .
" At some point , most users will give in to temptation and relapse , but those for whom the vaccine is effective wo n't get high and will lose interest . "
Kosten , who joined Baylor 18 months ago , asked the Food and Drug Administration in December to green - light a multi-institutional trial to begin in the spring .
It presumably would be the final clinical hurdle before the vaccine might be approved for treatment .
Approval would mark a breakthrough in the treatment of cocaine addiction , which now mostly involves psychiatric counseling and 12 - step programs .
Over the years , Kosten notes , more than 50 pharmaceutical options have been investigated and found wanting .
The vaccine also could raise interesting ethical questions involving who should get inoculated and what happens if confidential information about those receiving it becomes known .
Although developed for therapeutic purposes — the number of cocaine addicts in this country is estimated at more than 2 million — the vaccine eventually is expected to be used for prevention , as well .
The questions include whether parents would be allowed to have their children inoculated ; whether it would amount to coercion to make it a condition for lighter criminal sentences ; whether employers might happen upon such information and use it discriminatorily ; and whether to use it on pregnant addicts to protect the fetuses .
The questions do n't just reverberate about this vaccine : Tom Kosten also is at work on vaccines for methamphetamine , heroin and nicotine .
Two other nicotine vaccines are being investigated by other scientists .
" Anti-drug vaccines may provide an important weapon against addiction , " said Frank Vocci , director of treatment research and development at the National Institute of Drug Abuse , which funded much of the research .
" We 're starting to see progress .
We just need to see more . "
Concept called ' clever idea '
No one denies the extent of the problem .
Federal estimates put the number of Americans classified with substance abuse or dependence at 22.2 million and the cost to the country at $ 484 billion a year — almost three times the cost of cancer .
The Kostens ' cocaine vaccine has been more than a decade in the making .
In concept , the idea seems simple .
Cocaine ( and many other drug ) molecules are so small the immune system fails to recognize them and make the antibodies necessary to mount an attack .
To help the immune system , Kosten attached inactivated cocaine to the outside of inactivated cholera proteins .
In response , the immune system not only makes antibodies to the combination , which is harmless , but also recognizes the potent naked drug when it 's ingested .
The antibodies bind to the cocaine and prevent it from reaching the brain , where it normally would generate the highs that are so addictive .
" It 's a very clever idea , " says David Eagleman , a Baylor neuroscientist .
" Scientists have spent the last few decades figuring out reward pathways in the brain and how drugs like cocaine hijack the system .
It turns out those pathways are difficult to rewire once they 've seen the drug .
But the vaccine just circumvents all that . "
Kosten says the idea goes back to the 1950s , when scientists devised a vaccine to treat potentially fatal overdoses of the then - popular heart medication digitalis , and the 1970s , when researchers experimented with a heroin vaccine before abandoning it .
Kosten took up the idea in the mid-1990s , figuring cocaine was a better candidate because the enzyme for breaking it down is in the bloodstream , not the liver , like most drugs .
While they were at Yale , he led the clinical trials and his wife conducted the animal experiments .
The most impressive result involved a study at Columbia University in New York , where users who had no interest in being treated were paid to be vaccinated .
Those who got a low dose saw little change .
Those who got a high dose reduced their drug use by more than 50 percent .
In Kosten 's words , " it did n't do what it used to do . "
But one expert warns against expecting too much .
" Addiction vaccines are a promising advance , but it 's unlikely any treatment in this field will work for everyone , " said Dr. David Gorelick , a senior investigator at the National Institute on Drug Abuse .
" Still , if they prove successful , they will give those working in drug addiction an important option . "
To be sure , the vaccine is still a work in progress .
There also are questions about dedicated users ' ability to overcome the vaccine if they ingest more cocaine than the immune system can fight off , and whether they 'll simply switch drugs once they stop getting a high from cocaine .
FDA may act in a few years
Kosten acknowledges those are concerns .
But he also notes that most users would have a hard time affording the amount of cocaine necessary to override the immune response , and that study participants did n't switch drugs when the cocaine lost its effect .
Vaccines also could be combined — as is done with mumps , measles and rubella — if the concept pans out .
Vaccines ' ethical concerns have occasioned academic papers , committee investigations and conferences .
In a 2004 report , the National Academy of Sciences ' Center for Studies of Behavior and Development lauded the new method 's promise , but cautioned that it " poses distinct behavioral , ethical , legal and social challenges that require careful scrutiny . "
" There are certainly important issues there , but I do n't think any are insurmountable , " said Dr. Peter Cohen , a Georgetown law professor and chairman of the District of Columbia Medical Society 's physician health committee .
" Overall , the benefits to society of such vaccines would outweigh the risks . "
Addicts also will benefit from other treatment at the same time , such as behavioral therapies or counseling , says Kosten .
Emphasizing that there was a reason drugs were used in the first place , he says the vaccine is not meant as " a stand - alone treatment . "
Still , FDA approval could come within a few years , Kosten speculates , if he gets the go - ahead to conduct the Phase III trial next year and it succeeds .
The trial would enroll about 300 patients at six sites around the country , one in Houston .
So , what will it mean to Kosten if and when that approval comes down ?
" It 'll be great , " he said .
" It 'll also mean a new opportunity to make more vaccines and move on to more addiction problems . "

Empowered Patient , a regular feature from CNN Medical News correspondent Elizabeth Cohen , helps put you in the driver 's seat when it comes to health care .
You can be an informed , empowered patient without alienating your doctor by remembering common courtesy .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
A few months ago , Dr. David Golden says , he had to fire a patient for being obnoxious .
The patient had a cough .
After examining him , Golden recommended a medication .
But then the patient did his own research and became worried about side effects .
" He said , ' But I read about this on the Internet , and I know this and I know that , and I know I 'm right , ' " remembered Golden , an allergist in Baltimore , Maryland .
Golden says he tried to explain why the side effects were n't as bad as the patient thought , and why the medicine would take care of his cough .
" But he was n't open to discussing anything .
He countermanded everything I said .
So I told him , ' You know it all , so go take care of yourself .
I 'm not your doctor anymore . ' "
Golden says he's all for empowered and educated patients , but some patients have become so empowered , they 're actually putting their care in jeopardy .
" I 've been doing this for 28 years , and unquestionably it 's gotten much worse , " Golden says .
But wait a second .
Is n't it good to question your doctor ?
You do n't want to passively accept everything they say , right ?
Absolutely , say Golden and other physicians .
The doctors we interviewed agreed that getting the best care means being empowered but not obnoxious .
Here are tips from a few of them , plus some from a patient .
1 . Do n't demand medications over the phone
Let 's say you get sinus infections several times a year .
You know what they feel like .
The same medicine helps you each and every time .
You want your doctor 's office to call the prescription in to the pharmacy .
Why should you go in and get examined when you know what 's wrong with you ?
Sounds reasonable , right ?
This issue rankles doctors like none other .
Doctors do n't like prescribing medicine without first seeing the patient , period .
" When my staff asks them to come in , they say they 're too busy and they know what 's wrong with them .
It 's a very common thing , " says Dr. Jeff Hurwitz , an internist in Hagerstown , Maryland .
" But health care is n't just saying , ' These are my symptoms .
I know what 's wrong with me . '
Medicine is an art .
You need to go see your doctor . "
Hurwitz remembers one patient who demanded medicine for a urinary tract infection over the phone ; she'd had them before , and she was having one again .
Hurwitz insisted she come in to be seen .
She insisted she would n't .
He won , and it's a good thing for her :
It turned out her symptoms were caused by kidney cancer , not a urinary tract infection .
2 . Do n't come in loaded with Internet printouts
Trisha Torrey , the moderator of about .com 's Patient Empowerment section , recommends making bullet points after reading information on the Internet .
" Do n't bother printing copies of your research for [ your doctor . ]
She does n't have time to read them , " she says .
( Click here for Torrey 's advice about using the Internet for your health care .
Another piece of advice :
Be careful how you bring up Internet information .
Sounding like you know more than the doctor does could result in alienating your doctor and getting less than optimal care .
Let 's say , for example , you 've been having horrible headaches .
Your doctor thinks it 's nothing serious and you just need a good over - the - counter pain medication , but you 're worried the pain in your head might be something more serious .
You go online and read all about what a headache could be ( a brain tumor , for example ) , and now you want to talk to your physician .
Dr. Delia Chiaramonte , a patient advocate in Baltimore , has these do's and don'ts :
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
Do n't say , '" Please look at these printouts .
They say I should have a CT scan to rule out a tumor .
You really need to read these -- when doctors do n't listen to patients , the patients die . "
So what should you say ?
" Acknowledge the slight discomfort of the situation out loud , " advises Chiaramonte .
" Say , ' I know doctors may not love patients coming in with Internet printouts .
But would you mind looking at these ?
I 'd love to hear your thoughts , ' " Chiaramonte says , adding that you should ask your doctor for Web sites he or she recommends .
Dr. Scott Haig , an orthopedist in New York , agrees .
He says he does n't mind when patients come in with Internet information -- it 's all about how they ask about it .
He says do n't make your doctor feel like his back is up against the wall .
" Permit for an exchange of ideas , " he says .
( To read a Time magazine column that Dr. Haig wrote about one of his obnoxious patients , click here . )
3. Arrive organized
Christine Miserandino has learned a thing or two from her frequent doctor 's appointments for lupus .
Miserandino , who writes about her illness on her Web site , says that before each appointment , she fills out three index cards : one with any new problems she needs to tell her doctor about , one describing her current symptoms , and a third with specific questions for the doctor .
Miserandino says this gets her better care .
" My doctor is busy , and I have to respect that he has 40 patients in one day , " she says .
" If I do n't go in with all my questions written down , I 'd be rambling all over the place .
4 . Need a lot of time ?
Ask first .
Doctors often schedule appointments in 15 - minute increments .
Sometimes you 'll need much more than that .
Miserandino says she always warns the appointment secretary when she 'll need extra time , and asks whether a certain time of day ( such as the last appointment ) would be better .
Chiaramonte also suggests asking whether certain days of the week are bad ( perhaps your doctor has several surgeries scheduled on certain days ) , and says you can also request two appointments back to back .
5. Exercise basic human kindness
Remember , your doctor is a human being , and we all respond better when we 're treated well .
" Show human courtesy and respect who they are .
I 'm talking basic human interaction 101 , " Haig says .
Miserandino says she does n't shy away from asking tough questions -- on the contrary , she asks lots of them and sometimes questions her doctor 's recommendations -- but she always does it politely .
Plus , she fosters a relationship with her doctor because she knows that to a great extent , her health depends on him .
" I do care , because I want him to care about me .
I do bring cookies at Christmastime .
It 's a relationship you have to foster like any other . "
Once , when her doctor went above and beyond what he had to do by visiting her in the hospital twice in one day , she wrote him a thank - you note .
" He said to me , in the 20 - odd years I 've been doing this , I 've never received a thank - you note .
I always hear the negative , never the positive , " she says .

You know from experience ( and morning coffee consumption ) whether you ’re a night owl or an early bird , but what do you know about your body ’s more subtle rhythms ?
According to chronobiologists ( that is , scientists who study the effects of time on life processes ) , most of us are mentally sharpest some three hours after waking , when concentration and problem - solving abilities may be up to 30 percent better than at other times of day .
This makes late morning the best time to puzzle through a complex decision or absorb new information .
The best time to brave the dentist ’s chair , by contrast , is in the afternoon , when the pain threshold in teeth is highest .
To set a personal speed record , try scheduling your run or swim for early evening , when your perception of exertion is low and your muscles are at their most powerful .
And the next time you ’re winding down at happy hour , be thankful that the liver best detoxifies booze between 5 and 6 p.m .
In “ Sex Sleep Eat Drink Dream , ” Jennifer Ackerman gives us an enthusiastic tour through 24 hours in the life of a typical human body .
She demystifies our internal “ clocks ” and the genes that wind them , but also goes far beyond  revealing what science has to say about everything from whether you can catch a cold from being cold to the hows and whys of the orgasm .
Such wide - ranging material has the potential to get out of hand , but here it is nicely tamed by the book ’s lucid structure  with section headings that take us from “ Morning ” through “ Afternoon ” and into “ Night . ”
An imaginary drive to work provides an opportunity to talk about multitasking behind the wheel ( and why we are so very bad at it ) .
An after - work party raises the topic of how our brains recognize faces , and how wafting pheromones may help to inflame sexual attraction .
Neophytes , and even science - phobes , will find Ackerman ’s approach to biology welcoming .
Her language is accessible , and she focuses heavily on “ news you can use . ”
Studies show , for instance , that giving cancer drugs at carefully determined times of day can maximize their benefits and minimize their side effects , profoundly influencing a patient ’s chances of survival .
Even testing for asthma or hypertension too early in the day can yield false results .

There are definite hazards , though , to writing about the biological basics , for the simple reason that each and every one of us owns and operates a body .
It ’s no surprise that “ if you consume alcohol before the onset of a stressful event , the drink may reduce its impact , ” as one expert reveals .
Nor do we need a sleep researcher to confirm that the 10 extra minutes of sleep you get after hitting the snooze button “ are not restorative or restful . ”
Ackerman even pays earnest attention to the mechanics of chewing ( “ mechanoreceptors on your tongue sort the pieces of your mouthful by size ” ) .
Google Ads
seems to place the most obnoxious ads at the top of my blog .
When I write a few posts about how acupuncture has been demonstrated not to work , it places an advertisement for acupuncture .
When I write about creationist frauds , it puts up ads for creationist books ( or more recently , for creationist movies ) .
I do n't endorse these products .
In many cases , I think it likely that the marketers are not only mistaken , but frauds .
I thought about taking these ads down , but instead , I 'm leaving them there .
I 'm considering them an anthropology experiment for me , and my readers .
It 's a fascinating world out there .

The Sabhnanis were accused of " modern day slavery "
Indian - born Mahender Murlidhar Sabhnani , 51 , and his wife , Varsha Mahender Sabhnani , 45 , could face up to 40 years in prison .
They were found guilty on 12 charges , which included involuntary servitude , harbouring aliens and forced labour .
The couple 's lawyer said he would appeal against the verdict .
The wealthy couple , who run a perfume business and have four children , had brought the women to their large house to work as housekeepers , and forced them to work up to 18 hours per day .
The couple were arrested after one of the women was found wandering the streets dressed in only trousers and a towel .
Regular beatings
Prosecutors described the case as " modern - day slavery " .
They described how the two Indonesian women had been punished for misbehaviour such as sleeping late and stealing food from the dustbin to supplement their meagre meals .
Varsha Sabhnani and her husband had pleaded not guilty
One said she had been forced to eat several hot chillies and then her own vomit .
" Apparently , the jury was taken by the histrionics ( of the Indonesian women ) , " defence lawyer Jeffrey Hoffmann told AP .
Lawyers for the accused had argued that the housekeepers practised witchcraft and may have abused themselves .
They had said the couple spent a lot of time abroad and that the two Indonesian women would have been free to leave whenever they wanted .
The pair were described as " model citizens " who wanted only to clear their names .
The women , identified as Nona and Samirah , arrived in the US legally in 2002 but had their passports confiscated by the Sabhnanis , officials said .
Their visas have since expired .

IRAQ WITHOUT WAR / Would things be better , or worse , in Baghdad four years later if the United States had not invaded ?
Iraq Without War. Chronicle graphic by Lance Jackson Iraq Without War. Chronicle graphic by Lance Jackson Image 1 of / 7 Caption Close IRAQ WITHOUT WAR / Would things be better , or worse , in Baghdad four years later if the United States had not invaded ?
1 / 7 Back to Gallery
As a Shiite living in Saddam Hussein 's Iraq , Thanaa al - Taee eked out an existence in a totalitarian state that oppressed her religious sect , cracked down on ethnic minorities , and silenced dissent by torturing and executing opponents who dared criticize the despotic regime .
Now , watching sectarian bloodshed rip apart her country , al - Taee wonders if the war that toppled Hussein 's dictatorship was worth it .
" I have a conflict with myself about what happened to us , Iraqis , " al - Taee , 38 , who had worked at a Baghdad art gallery before fleeing to Bahrain in 2004 , wrote in a recent e-mail after visiting her parents in Baghdad .
" Do you think this is better for us ? "
It is also the question on the minds of scholars and military experts in the United States , including the architect of the " shock and awe " campaign that helped bring down Hussein 's regime .
Four years after the United States invaded Iraq , these observers contemplate what Iraq would have looked like today had the Bush administration decided not to go to war .
" How else can you evaluate whether going to war was the sensible thing to do ? " said Larry Diamond , who worked as the senior adviser to the Coalition provisional authority in Baghdad in 2004 .
Not surprisingly , the experts ' answers reflect a range of opinions .
Some of those who favored the war feel that the invasion of Iraq , however bloody its consequences , has staved off a larger conflict by putting a major U.S. fighting force in the heart of the Middle East and preventing Hussein from developing weapons of mass destruction .
But others -- including analysts who opposed the war from the start and even some former supporters of the invasion -- paint a different picture .
Without the war , they also see Hussein still in power , but too weakened by international sanctions to have resumed building weapons of mass destruction .
Iraq , these experts say , would have been drained by political crackdowns and corruption , but not racked by incessant violence .
The United States , whose political and military capital would not have been sapped by the war , would have been in a better position to mediate a workable Israeli - Palestinian peace agreement , rebuild Afghanistan , and possibly even capture Osama bin Laden .
The turbulent Middle East would have been far more stable than it is today .
" Wherever you look , this attack on Iraq has the most potentially catastrophic strategic consequences , " said Harlan Ullman , the military strategist who masterminded the " shock and awe " campaign of targeted aerial bombardment and missile strikes , which helped U.S. troops quickly incapacitate Hussein 's military machine .
" Saddam is gone , " Ullman said .
" I do n't , quite frankly , see any other benefits . "
Since the March 19 , 2003 , invasion , tens or even hundreds of thousands Iraqis have been killed , by some estimates , in bombings , firefights and sectarian execution - style murders .
Two million people have fled the country of about 22 million , according to a recent United Nations report , and the U.N. migration agency expects a million more to flee this year .
Infrastructure in most of the country is in a shambles , oil production is lower than before the war , and electricity is sporadic .
The streets of Baghdad , once flanked with palm trees and neatly pruned hedges , are laden with frequent roadside bombs , rutted by explosions and steeped in stagnant raw sewage .
Had Hussein remained in power , " a very horrible dictatorship would be continuing to reign in that country , " said Diamond , now an expert on democracy - building at the Hoover Institution .
" Of course , there are people that are better off in Iraq now than they were before .
The Shiites , collectively , have an opportunity for power , for resources , for dignity as a group that they did n't have before .
" They also have something of an equal chance to participate in the misery of a destroyed national order .
A somewhat leveled opportunity to be kidnapped , to be forced into exile , to have their daughter abducted or raped , to have their father murdered , families killed in the suicide bombings . "
Supporters of the war say killings of civilians in Iraq today may not surpass the number of lives that would have been taken by Hussein 's Baath Party regime , which had executed tens of thousands Iraqis since 1968 .
Had Hussein remained in power , " you would have seen another set of purges on a scale that would have made what 's going on now look tame , " said Frederick Kagan , a neoconservative expert at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research .
" There 's disorder now but there 's freedom , " agreed Max Singer , a co-founder of the Hudson Institute , a conservative Washington think - tank .
" The Iraqis have not yet given up on making a country for themselves . "
By now , say Singer and Kagan , Hussein would have been revving up his once - dormant nuclear arms program , starting a region - wide race that would have posed a far greater threat to the United States than the dangers its troops currently face in Iraq .
These analysts see the U.S. invasion as an effective deterrent for nations in the region -- other than Iran -- that may have harbored their own nuclear ambitions .
" There 's a good chance that Libya , " which abandoned its nuclear path in 2003 , " would have continued its program to get nuclear weapons , " said Singer .
" We were headed to a point where ... Saddam rearms , starts to become a major regional threat , " Kagan said .
The prospect of a nuclear - armed Iraq would have encouraged Iran , Iraq 's arch - enemy , to pursue its own nuclear arms program at an even greater speed than it is doing now , he said , paving the way for an " apocalyptic scenario " of an Iran - Iraq nuclear race .
" It would have ended up posing a more significant threat than what we have now , " said Kagan , who advocates deploying an additional 30,000 troops for 18 months to quash the violence in Iraq .
" What would have been required for success in the other scenario would have been much greater than the sacrifices we are called to make now . "
But other experts say Hussein 's nuclear program in 2003 was in such disarray that it would have taken Iraq many years before it could pose any significant threat .
By now , " we would have been incrementally losing more control over Saddam 's actions , but ... he would have posed no direct threat to the United States , " said Wayne White , who , as a former senior Middle East analyst for the State Department , saw intelligence on Iraq before the war .
" The Iraqi threat would have been way down the road had we not gone in . "
Instead , argue White , Ullman and other experts , the war in Iraq has exacerbated the terrorist threat to the United States .
It has turned Iraq into a recruiting tool for international jihadists , making the country a training facility for fighters from around the world .
Fighters who have honed their fighting skills in the deserts and shrapnel - scarred city streets of Iraq now export their knowledge to other battlefronts of the war against terror such as Afghanistan , experts on terrorism say .
Without the war , " Iraq would not have been such a training ground for people to be able to get a direct shot at American troops , " White said .
Most analysts agree that international jihad would have existed regardless of the war in Iraq , fueled by the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and the U.S. support of Israel .
But had Washington not spent so many resources on the war , it would have been better equipped to fund and " substantially increase the U.S. border screening , defenses , the numbers of people working on these defenses , in addition to the immigration and naturalization services , " White said .
" There 's a lot of expensive technology " to enhance border security " that has n't been emplaced because of the lack of funding , " White said .
Had it not gone to war with Iraq , Washington also could have spent more effort trying to revive the Israeli - Palestinian peace process , said Ullman , who called that conflict " the real issue . "
Washington could have rallied support from its allies in the Arab world to help resume Israeli - Palestinian negotiations .
This is much harder to achieve today , when the Arab governments are " besieged by constituents outraged at the United States for its perceived anti-Muslim agenda , " White said .
The damage to the U.S. image extends beyond the Arab nations .
In January , half of the 26,000 people polled for the BBC World Service across 25 countries said the United States is playing a mainly negative role in the world .
" The United States in many quarters is considered a much worse threat to the world security than , say , Iran , " White said .
" That just shows the depth of the United States ' loss of credibility and the fear of the United States taking unilateral action . "
Without the enormous strain of the Iraq war depleting the U.S. military , Washington would have been much more capable of building security and statehood in Afghanistan , Diamond said .
" There would not be any resurgence of the Taliban , " he said .
" There would be much more security on the roads and in the countryside .
We might have been able to put in enough troops to actually fully destroy al Qaeda and prevent its evacuation to Pakistan , and might have even found Osama bin Laden . "
And Iran would have been further away from dominating the region , because it would have been deterred by Iraq , said Rashid Khalidi , director of the Middle East Institute of Columbia University .
" By destroying what had formerly been the most powerful Arab country ... we have thrust at Iran an even greater power than it ( would have ) otherwise had , " he said .
The rise of Iran -- a Persian Shiite power in the predominantly Arab Sunni Middle East -- enhanced a centuries - old sectarian rift that is threatening to destabilize the region , Khalidi said .
Many Sunni states have Shiite minorities within their own countries , and their Sunni leaders see as a threat what Jordan 's King Abdullah has called a " Shiite crescent " stretching from Tehran to Beirut .
" We started a particularly poisonous sectarian spiral downwards in the Middle East , " Khalidi said .
The Bush administration 's push to promote democracy across the Middle East ?
This , too , would have worked much better had the region not been radicalized by " the Sunni resistance to the occupation by the United States of yet another Arab land , " said Diamond .
Instead , anti-Western forces gained more power in Lebanon , Egypt and the Palestinian territories .
So , was it worth it ?
" There were no human rights , Saddam was a son of a bitch and life was terrible , " Ullman said .
But even with Hussein in power , he said , " we'd be a lot better off , and the world in general ...
At the moment , you'd be hard - pressed to say Iraqis are better off . "

Russian bombers had not " buzzed " a US aircraft carrier since 2004
The unnamed officials told news agencies that the Russian bombers had flown over the USS Nimitz in the western Pacific on Saturday .
Four F - 18 jets escorted the bombers out of the area , they added .
Russia resumed long - range bomber flights last August , in a move regarded as a flexing of military muscle .
Russian officials were not immediately available to comment on Saturday 's incident .
It was the first time a Russian bomber had flown over a US aircraft carrier since July 2004 .
Meanwhile , Japan has lodged a complaint with Moscow over allegations that a Russian bomber , thought to be one of those involved in the Nimitz fly - over , intruded into Japanese airspace on Saturday .
The incident comes amid renewed tensions between Moscow and Washington over American plans for a missile defence system based in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Clinton is similarly risking charges of treachery if she tries to erase Obama 's edge with parliamentary maneuvers , and I wonder whether wavering superdelegates would tilt her way if she did so .
Notwithstanding her ties to these insiders , it 's also true - and often overlooked - that many are not blinded by love for the Clintons .
Some are liberals who disliked Bill 's centrist policies ; others recall the campaign - finance scandal of 1996 and the Lewinsky scandal of 1998 ; others blame the Clintons for the conservative revolution that seized both congressional chambers .
In short , many have been looking for a viable alternative candidate who would give them a valid reason to vote against Restoration .
Filtering all Internet traffic to look for signs of illicit file - swapping has been a hugely controversial idea , criticized on grounds of privacy , efficacy , cost , and long - standing " safe harbor " principles that apply to network operators such as ISPs and phone companies .
But a new study out from UK media lawyers Wiggin suggests that , if it works , such filtering could actually curtail " digital piracy " by 70 percent .
The finding is of special relevance in the UK , where some form of ISP filtering is currently being considered as a way to deal with the illegal trading of copyrighted material .
ISPs and content owners are engaged in a voluntary negotiation over how to address the problem , but the UK government has indicated that it will legislate in April 2009 if no agreement is reached by then .
The government appears to be planning something similar to the French system , which is developing a " three strikes " approach to notifying and then blocking offenders .
Wiggin commissioned the 2008 Digital Entertainment Survey , which found that 70 percent of all people polled said they would stop illegally sharing files if their ISP notified them in some way that it had detected the practice .
When broken down by age group , an unexpected trend emerges : teenagers are generally more likely to change their behavior than older Internet users .
The survey showed that people would also stop sharing files if they felt that the chance of being prosecuted was higher , but that 68 percent of all users think it is " very unlikely I will be caught . "
Even if more stories about P2P prosecutions find their way into the mainstream press , half of all users said they would continue to share files because they perceive the total risk to be quite small .
A notice system that required only a letter or a phone call instead of a full - blown legal proceeding could clearly operate more quickly and more widely , and seems to have the best chance of altering behavior .
Whether ISP filtering can work , and can do so while avoiding false positives and maintaining user privacy , remains an open question , and there 's still debate over the idea that ISPs should ( as a matter of policy ) become enforcers of the copyrights for a specific industry segment .
Still , the new survey suggests that if these problems can somehow be overcome , ISP notification might well have a better chance of changing behavior than legal action alone .

Johnny Depp has donated $ 2.2 million to a London children 's hospital for saving his daughter 's life .
The Hollywood actor secretly visited Great Ormond Street Hospital , where his eight - year - old girl Lily - Rose was treated last March after her kidneys failed , to personally hand over the sum as a thank you yesterday .
Johnny , who kept a bedside vigil with long - term partner Vanessa Paradis when their daughter was treated for E.Coli poisoning , has revealed Lily - Rose 's health scare put the family through " hell " .
Australia 's newly elected Labor government is to apologise next month to the " stolen generation " of Aborigines forcibly removed from their families .
The formal apology , a measure that previous conservative administrations refused to countenance , will take place on February 13 when parliament resumes after a seasonal break .
Indigenous affairs minister , Jenny Macklin , called the apology " a bridge to the future " and confirmed yesterday that the wording of the statement would be made after widespread consultation with indigenous leaders .
But she added that the government would not accede to longstanding demands for a $ 1bn ( £ 447 m ) fund to compensate those affected by the policy , which was based on race .
She said that the act of contrition given by prime minister , Kevin Rudd , on behalf of the government would not attribute guilt to the current generation of Australians , because they were not to blame for the actions of past governments .
The " stolen generation " refers to Aboriginal children - mainly those of mixed race - who were removed from their families and sent to institutions run by churches or the state or who were adopted into white families during the last century .
Some were snatched from their mother 's arms .
Others were taken under the guise of court orders or were removed by stealth .
The removals were intended to integrate mixed - race children into white society .
The practice was formally abandoned in 1969 .
Christine King , from the Stolen Generations Alliance , said February 13 would be a historic and emotional day .
" Older people thought they would never live to see it , so it 's very important , " she said .
Opposition Liberal party leader , Brendan Nelson , said he was concerned the government was putting an apology ahead of rising petrol and food prices .

Do n't believe Cary Sherman , the president of the Recording Industry Association of America , when he told a National Public Radio audience that Sony BMG 's anti-piracy chief had misspoken during her testimony in the copyright infringement trial against Jammie Thomas .
And if Sherman was telling the truth during that NPR interview , Thomas was the victim of a miscarriage of justice – despite the mountain of evidence against her .
Here 's the skinny :
In October , a Minnesota federal jury found Thomas liable for copyright infringement and dinged her $ 222,000 for unlawfully sharing 24 songs on the Kazaa file - sharing network in what was and still is the nation 's first and only RIAA case against an individual to go to trial .
Most of the RIAA 's 20,000 or more lawsuits have settled out of court .
During Thomas ' trial in Duluth , RIAA attorney Richard Gabriel asked Sony 's Jennifer Pariser if it was OK for a consumer to make one copy of a track that was legally purchased .
No , she replied , saying that 's " a nice way of saying , steals just one copy . "
On Thursday , while debating a Washington Post reporter , Sherman told an NPR audience that Pariser " actually misspoke in that trial . "
" I know because I asked her after stories started appearing .
It turns out that she had misheard the question .
She thought that this was a question about illegal downloading when it was actually a question about ripping CDs , " Sherman said .
" That is not the position of Sony BMG .
That is not the position of that spokesperson .
That is not the position of the industry . "
One of the reasons jurors dinged Thomas was because she forked over to RIAA investigators a different hard drive than the one industry snoops detected her using on Kazaa in 2005 .
On the hard drive she did turn over were thousands of songs Thomas said she ripped from her CDs .
The RIAA 's Gabriel suggested to jurors that copying one 's purchased music was a violation of the Copyright Act .
Gabriel , for example , asked Thomaswhether she had ever burned CDs , either for herself , or to give away to friends .
" Did you get permission from the copyright owners to do that ? " Gabriel asked .
" No , " Thomas responded .
Gabriel , the RIAA 's lead attorney , apparently misspoke too – prejudicing jurors along the way .
U.S. District Judge Michael Davis is weighing a motionfrom Thomas to lower the award or grant a new trial .
She claims the Copyright Act , and the maximum $ 150,000 fine for each violation , is unconstitutionally excessive .
THREAT LEVEL wonders what are the odds the RIAA would file papers with Davis explaining the misstatements ?
UPDATE : RIAA spokeswoman Cara Duckworth said in an e-mail message that Pariser " was quoted out of context and believed the question referred to downloads , not physical copies . "
THREAT LEVEL rests its case .

Passing the Torch : Kennedy 's Touch on Obama 's Words JFK speechwriter says he 's given " phrase or suggestion " to Obama 's writers .
Feb. 8 , 2008  --
It 's no accident the Kennedy magic has infused itself into the campaign of Barack Obama .
Theodore " Ted " Sorensen , the adviser whom John F. Kennedy once called his " intellectual blood bank , " is lending his unabashed support -- and eloquence -- to the Obama campaign .
The Kennedy Connection
Oprah , another gushing Obama supporter , may have star power , but Sorensen has brain power .
At the age of 24 , he joined the staff of the newly elected Sen. John F. Kennedy and later helped him win the presidency , calling on Americans to pass the torch to a new generation .
The legendary speechwriter helped Kennedy craft the now - famous 1961 Inaugural address in which the new president proclaimed , " Ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country . "
At the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis -- when Sorensen was 34 -- he penned the letter to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev that historians say saved the world from nuclear destruction .
Today , at 79 years old and blind , Sorensen has a new mission : to resurrect Camelot .
And it seems the Obama campaign is listening .
" I 've given them a phrase or suggestion or two , " Sorensen admits .
As for all the comparisons that have been drawn between Obama and Kennedy , " I probably started it , " he told ABCNEWS.com
Torch Passed to Obama 's Speechwriters
Sorensen has not only given his support and advice to the Obama camp , he 's grown close to the senator 's young speechwriters as well .
The candidate 's deputy writer -- Adam Frankel -- assisted Sorensen with his memoirs , which Harper Collins will publish in time for his 80th birthday in May .
" We 've become close friends , " Sorensen said of Frankel , 26 , one of Obama 's wordsmiths .
" He knows me and my style and JFK 's style and his speeches .
It 's surprising the little touches that creep in to whatever he writes for Obama . "
Even Obama 's Democratic rival , Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , has acknowledged Obama 's rhetorical skills .
" You campaign in poetry , but you govern in prose , " Clinton said in a bit of a backhanded compliment delivered before Super Tuesday .
Youth vs. Experience
Sorensen said he was impressed with Obama when he met the senator in 2006 .
But all he heard was Obama was too young and inexperienced .
" That 's what they said about Kennedy , " he said .
" Everyone said Kennedy had no chance because he was baptized a Roman Catholic .
They say it about Obama because he 's black . "
Clinton captured the endorsements of several of Robert F. Kennedy 's kin , including Kennedy 's son Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , an environmental lawyer , and daughter Kathleen Kennedy Townsend , the former lieutenant governor of Maryland .
But Obama is largely ahead in the Kennedy endorsement race , earning a seal of approval from Sen .
Ted Kennedy , D - Mass. , Ethel Kennedy , Robert F. Kennedy 's widow , and Caroline Kennedy ,
SLIDESHOW : KENNEDY VS .
KENNEDY IN THE OBAMA - CLINTON RACE
" Kennedy , like Obama , was one of those extraordinary individuals who was completely authentic , at home with himself and in his skin , " said Sorensen .
" He knew who he was , unlike so many in politics who are putting on an act all the time . "
Looking Back , Looking Forward
Seemingly frail , Sorensen suffered a stroke seven years ago that took his sight , but he still remains active and agreed to talk about the Cuban Missile Crisis -- a topic he re-examines in his new book -- to students at the Peddie School in New Jersey this week .
Sorensen confides he 's never heard of IM or Facebook , and as he shuffled to the podium on a student 's arm , it seemed unlikely he would connect with the teenagers , whose parents were being born as Kennedy arrived at the White House .
But that impression soon dissipated .
" I do n't see much , but I have more vision than the president of the United States , " Sorensen joked to loud applause .
He had plenty more to say about President Bush , including his " lack of judgment " and diplomacy in handling the threats after 9/11 .
Speech writers wield untold power among voters , and Sorensen is considered one of the modern day best .
George Washington got help from Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , and Alexander Hamilton .
Franklin Roosevelt often turned to playwright Robert Sherwood , and Dwight Eisenhower used journalist Emmet Hughes .
But Sorensen was more than a speechwriter , and his closeness and access to Kennedy was " unique " in U.S. history , say presidential scholars .
Graduating first in his class at University of Nebraska Law School , Sorensen -- at the advice of his college adviser -- took one year off his age to get a job as a legal aide in Kennedy 's Senate office .
" The rest is history , " he said .
He helped Kennedy draft the Pulitzer - Prize winning " Profiles in Courage , " though he consistently denied charges that he had been its author .
After Kennedy 's assassination , he wrote Lyndon B. Johnson 's State of the Union , before publishing " Kennedy , " the 1965 biography .
He stayed active in politics , campaigning for Robert F. Kennedy , then later joining the New York law firm Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton & Garrison , where he still works today .
" I think the television era has been hard on eloquence , " said Sorensen .
" Most politicians think that talking like JFK sounds old - fashioned today .
And we have a president who does n't round out the " ings " at the end of his words . "
Like Kennedy , Sorensen retains a keen wit .
Bill Clinton was a great communicator , he said , but the one sentence best remembered is , " I did not have sexual relations with that woman . "
" His mind is as sharp as ever , " said Russell Riley , presidential scholar at the University of Virginia 's Miller Center of Public Affairs .
" I think it 's an understatement to call him a mere speechwriter . "
Indeed , Sorensen helped guide foreign policy .
He was part of the inner circle of advisers who for six days agonized over how to respond to the threat when U2 planes spotted Soviet missiles 90 miles off the Florida coast in Cuba .
Kennedy even entrusted Sorensen to deliver a " back door " message to Khrushchev , meeting a KGB courier on a Washington , D.C. , street corner and exchanging a newspaper that contained an important message for the president .
But it is Sorensen 's role as a writer -- reflected in the Kennedy speeches -- that still resonates .
" It 's such a change from the current president who has only of late indicated that he has an interest in books , " said Riley .
" [ Bush 's ] 2000 campaign practically made a virtue out of the fact he was uninterested in the written word . "
As for Obama , " It 's not just the words , " said Riley , " but the person saying the words , with his youthful vigor and enthusiasm and his ability to impart that to the crowds . "
Still , Riley struggles to understand how Obama has catapulted himself to the national stage .
In 2004 , when Obama gave the convention speech , Riley was overseas and missed what he called the candidate 's " coming out party . "
" It 's been difficult for me to grasp how he managed to do what he has done , " said Riley .
" But the power of his rhetoric has largely captured people 's attentions -- that 's not an uncommon occurrence in politics , going back to the Greeks . "
At nearly 80 , Sorensen managed to work his charismatic magic with a new generation .
At a dinner before his speech , he fielded questions from students , such as 16 - year - old Jackie Wang .
" I was n't prepared to meet such an extraordinary man , " said Wang .
" Mr. Sorensen never had the opportunity to thank or part ways with former President Kennedy .
The emotions I imagined he experienced when hearing about his death moved me to tears . "
And what was amazing to him ?
Here 's his conclusions : [ the bold is mine ... as if it needs it ]
To give you an example of what I read , I have gotten three legal propositions from these OLC opinions declassified .
Here they are , as accurately as my note taking could reproduce them from the classified documents .
Listen for yourself .
I will read all three , and then discuss each one .
1 . An executive order cannot limit a President .
There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order .
Rather than violate an executive order , the President has instead modified or waived it .
2 . The President , exercising his constitutional authority under Article II , can determine whether an action is a lawful exercise of the President 's authority under Article II .
3 . The Department of Justice is bound by the President 's legal determinations .
As Emptywheel ( who has the full speech -- also find it on Whitehouse 's website here ) calls it , this is something of a smoking gun pointing to the administration 's willingness to put itself above the law .
Here 's the penultimate paragraph of his speech :
When the Congress of the United States is willing to roll over for an unprincipled President , this is where you end up .
We should not even be having this discussion .
But here we are .
I implore my colleagues : reject these feverish legal theories .
I understand political loyalty , trust me , I do .
But let us also be loyal to this great institution we serve in the legislative branch of our government .
Let us also be loyal to the Constitution we took an oath to defend , from enemies foreign and domestic .
And let us be loyal to the American people who live each day under our Constitution 's principles and protections .
How about contacting those congress critters ?
Update [ 2007 - 12-7 14:1:50 by MLDB ] : Some clarification :
The OLC docs were from the warrantless wiretapping opinions ( IMO the best case for impeachment ) ... video is available at Think Progress
I used to find it hard to fully imagine the mind - set of a terrorist .
That is , until I played Halo 3 online , where I found myself adopting – with great success – terrorist tactics .
Including a form of suicide bombing .
This probably bears some explanation .
I 'll begin by pointing out a basic fact : A lot of teenage kids out there play dozens of hours of multiplayer Halo a week .
They thus become insanely good at the game :
They can kill me with a single head shot from halfway across a map – or expertly circle me while jumping around , making it impossible for me to land a shot , while they pulverize me with bullets .
I can't do those things .
I have n't got enough time to practice as they do : I 'm an adult , with a job and wife and kid , so I get maybe an hour with Halo on a good day .
I wind up sucking far , far more than most other Halo 3 players , and despite the best attempts of Xbox Live to match me up with similarly lame players , I usually wind up at the bottom of my group 's rankings – stumbling haplessly about while getting slaughtered over and over again .
So after a few weeks of this ritual humiliation , I got sick of it .
And I devised a simple technique for revenge .
Whenever I find myself under attack by a wildly superior player , I stop trying to duck and avoid their fire .
Instead , I turn around and run straight at them .
I know that by doing so , I 'm only making it easier for them to shoot me – and thus I 'm marching straight into the jaws of death .
Indeed , I can usually see my health meter rapidly shrinking to zero .
But at the last second , before I die , I 'll whip out a sticky plasma grenade – and throw it at them .
Because I 've run up so close , I almost always hit my opponent successfully .
I 'll die – but he 'll die too , a few seconds later when the grenade goes off .
( When you pull off the trick , the game pops up a little dialog box noting that you killed someone " from beyond the grave . " )
It was after pulling this maneuver a couple of dozen times that it suddenly hit me : I had , quite unconsciously , adopted the tactics of a suicide bomber – or a kamikaze pilot .
It 's not just that I 'm willing to sacrifice my life to kill someone else .
It 's that I 'm exploiting the psychology of asymmetrical warfare .
Because after all , the really elite Halo players do n't want to die .
If they die too often , they wo n't win the round , and if they do n't win the round , they wo n't advance up the Xbox Live rankings .
And for the elite players , it 's all about bragging rights .
I , however , have a completely different psychology .
I know I 'm the underdog ; I know I 'm probably going to get killed anyway .
I am never going to advance up the Halo 3 rankings , because in the political economy of Halo , I 'm poor .
Specifically , I 'm poor in time .
The best players have dozens of free hours a week to hone their talents , and I do n't have that luxury .
This changes the relative meaning of death for the two of us .
For me , dying will not penalize me in the way it penalizes them , because I have almost no chance of improving my state .
I might as well take people down with me .
Or to put it another way :
The structure of Xbox Live creates a world composed of two classes – haves and have - nots .
And , just as in the real world , some of the disgruntled have - nots are all too willing to toss their lives away – just for the satisfaction of momentarily halting the progress of the haves .
Since the game instantly resurrects me , I have no real dread of death in Halo 3 .
I do not mean , of course , to trivialize the ghastly , horrific impact of real - life suicide bombing .
Nor do I mean to gloss over the incredible complexity of the real - life personal , geopolitical and spiritual reasons why suicide bombers are willing to kill themselves .
These are all impossibly more nuanced and perverse than what 's happening inside a trifling , low - stakes videogame .
But the fact remains that something quite interesting happened to me because of Halo .
Even though I 've read scores of articles , white papers and books on the psychology of terrorists in recent years , and even though I have ( I think ) a strong intellectual grasp of the roots of suicide terrorism , something about playing the game gave me an " aha " moment that I 'd never had before : an ability to feel , in whatever tiny fashion , the strategic logic and emotional calculus behind the act .
And the truth is , I 'm probably going to keep doing it .
Because when it comes to online Halo – I still suck .

Put this in your pipe and smoke it :
A new study published in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine says that teens who smoke marijuana probably are n't gonna drop out of high school , have conversations with their dogs or run over little girls on bikes when leaving drive thrus .
In fact , the research found that kids who smoke weed are " more socially driven ... significantly more likely to practice sports and they have a better relationship with their peers " than kids who do n't .
The study also stated that even though stoner kids are " more likely to skip class , they have the same level of good grades ; and although they have a worse relationship with their parents , they are not more likely to be depressed . "
Seriously this research hits so close to home ( well , except for the part about sports ) that it practically gives us a contact high .

George Calvarescu
George Calvarescu , a man from the San Fernando Valley triumphs over gridlock freeway traffic by kayaking to work in Long Beach -- 52 miles ( 84 km ) downstream on the L.A. River .
" I saw the ' Kayak For Sale ' sign , then I saw a sign that said " Los Angeles River , " and just then the song " Rollin ' on the River " came over the radio !
I did n't even know there was any water in the river -- it was an act of faith .
I never even looked back at my car .
I shelled out fifty bucks on the spot and dragged that kayak somehow down to actual water , put the yellow beast in , and it 's been smooth paddling ever since .
" Calvarescu admits that he 's pretty wet and dirty by the time he gets to work in downtown Long Beach , but manages to sneak into work before his colleagues and make use of a company shower .
Calvarescu also claims that his unconventional commute has helped him lose 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) - not too many L.A. highway commuters can claim that .

Corporate social responsibility , once a do - gooding sideshow , is now seen as mainstream .
But as yet too few companies are doing it well , says Daniel Franklin ( interviewed here )
Illustration by Ian Whadcock
IN THE lobby at the London headquarters of Marks & Spencer , one of Britain 's leading retailers , the words scroll relentlessly across a giant electronic ticker .
They describe progress against “ Plan A ” , a set of 100 worthy targets over five years .
The company will help to give 15,000 children in Uganda a better education ; it is saving 55,000 tonnes of CO 2 in a year ; it has recycled 48 m clothes hangers ; it is tripling sales of organic food ; it aims to convert over 20 m garments to Fairtrade cotton ; every store has a dedicated “ Plan A ” champion .
The M&S ticker says a lot about the current state of what is commonly known as corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) .
First , nobody much likes the CSR label .
A year ago M&S launched not a CSR plan but Plan A ( “ because there is no Plan B ” ) .
The chief executive 's committee that monitors this plan is called the “ How We Do Business Committee ” .
Other companies prefer to describe this kind of thing as “ corporate responsibility ” ( dropping the “ social ” as too narrow ) , or “ corporate citizenship ” , or “ building a sustainable business ” .
One Nordic executive glories in the job title of director , accountability and triple - bottom - line leadership .
All this is convoluted code for something simple : companies meaning ( or seeming ) to be good .
Second , the scrolling list shows what a vast range of activities now comes under the doing - good umbrella .
It spans everything from volunteering in the local community to looking after employees properly , from helping the poor to saving the planet .
With such a fuzzy , wide - ranging subject , many companies find it hard to know what to focus on .
Third , the M&S ticker demonstrates that CSR is booming .
Whether through electronic screens , posters or glossy reports , big companies want to tell the world about their good citizenship .
They are pushing out the message on their websites and in advertising campaigns .
Their chief executives queue up to speak at conferences to explain their passion for the community or their new - found commitment to making their company carbon - neutral .
A survey carried out for this report by the Economist Intelligence Unit , a sister company of The Economist , shows corporate responsibility rising sharply in global executives ' priorities ( see chart 1 ) .
None of this means that CSR has suddenly become a great idea .
This newspaper has argued that it is often misguided , or worse .
But in practice few big companies can now afford to ignore it .
Beyond the corporate world , CSR is providing fertile ground for think - tanks and consultancies .
Governments are taking an ever keener interest : in Britain , for example , the 2006 Companies Act introduced a requirement for public companies to report on social and environmental matters .
And the United Nations promotes corporate responsibility around the world through a New York - based group called the Global Compact .
Business schools , for their part , are adding courses and specialised departments to keep their MBA students happy .
“ Demand for CSR activities has just soared in the past three years , ” says Thomas Cooley , the dean of New York University 's Stern Business School .
Bookshelves groan with titles such as “ Corporation Be Good ” , “ Beyond Good Company ” and “ The A to Z of Corporate Responsibility ” .
Why the boom ?
For a number of reasons , companies are having to work harder to protect their reputation — and , by extension , the environment in which they do business .
Scandals at Enron , WorldCom and elsewhere undermined trust in big business and led to heavy - handed government regulation .
An ever - expanding army of non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) stands ready to do battle with multinational companies at the slightest sign of misbehaviour .
Myriad rankings and ratings put pressure on companies to report on their non-financial performance as well as on their financial results .
And , more than ever , companies are being watched .
Embarrassing news anywhere in the world — a child working on a piece of clothing with your company 's brand on it , say — can be captured on camera and published everywhere in an instant , thanks to the internet .
Now comes concern over climate change , probably the biggest single driver of growth in the CSR industry of late .
The great green awakening is making company after company take a serious look at its own impact on the environment .
It is no surprise , therefore , that 95 % of CEOs surveyed last year by McKinsey , a consultancy , said that society now has higher expectations of business taking on public responsibilities than it did five years ago .
Investors too are starting to show more interest .
For example , $ 1 out of every $ 9 under professional management in America now involves an element of “ socially responsible investment ” , according to Geoffrey Heal of Columbia Business School .
Some of the big banks , including Goldman Sachs and UBS , have started to integrate environmental , social and governance issues in some of their equity research .
True , the finance industry sends mixed signals : it demands good financial results above all else , and in parts of the financial world — notably the private - equity part — scepticism on CSR still runs deep .
But private equity itself is having to respond to public pressure by agreeing to voluntary codes of transparency .
As well as these external pressures , firms are also facing strong demand for CSR from their employees , so much so that it has become a serious part of the competition for talent .
Ask almost any large company about the business rationale for its CSR efforts and you will be told that they help to motivate , attract and retain staff .
“ People want to work at a company where they share the values and the ethos , ” says Mike Kelly , head of CSR at the European arm of KPMG , an accounting firm .
Too much of a good thing ?
Since there is so much CSR about , you might think big companies would by now be getting rather good at it .
A few are , but most are struggling .
CSR is now made up of three broad layers , one on top of the other .
The most basic is traditional corporate philanthropy .
Companies typically allocate about 1 % of pre-tax profits to worthy causes because giving something back to the community seems “ the right thing to do ” .
But many companies now feel that arm 's - length philanthropy — simply writing cheques to charities — is no longer enough .
Shareholders want to know that their money is being put to good use , and employees want to be actively involved in good works .
Money alone is not the answer when companies come under attack for their behaviour .
Hence the second layer of CSR , which is a branch of risk management .
Starting in the 1980s , with environmental disasters such as the explosion at the Bhopal pesticide factory and the Exxon Valdez oil spill , industry after industry has suffered blows to its reputation .
Big pharma was hit by its refusal to make antiretroviral drugs available cheaply for HIV / AIDS sufferers in developing countries .
In the clothing industry , companies like Nike and Gap came under attack for use of child labour .
Food companies face a backlash over growing obesity .
And “ Do n't be evil ” as a corporate motto offers no immunity : Google was one of several American technology titans hauled before Congress to be grilled about their behaviour in China .
So , often belatedly , companies respond by trying to manage the risks .
They talk to NGOs and to governments , create codes of conduct and commit themselves to more transparency in their operations .
Increasingly , too , they get together with their competitors in the same industry in an effort to set common rules , spread the risk and shape opinion .
All this is largely defensive , but companies like to stress that there are also opportunities to be had for those that get ahead of the game .
The emphasis on opportunity is the third and trendiest layer of CSR : the idea that it can help to create value .
In December 2006 the Harvard Business Review published a paper by Michael Porter and Mark Kramer on how , if approached in a strategic way , CSR could become part of a company 's competitive advantage .
That is just the sort of thing chief executives like to hear .
“ Doing well by doing good ” has become a fashionable mantra .
Businesses have eagerly adopted the jargon of “ embedding ” CSR in the core of their operations , making it “ part of the corporate DNA ” so that it influences decisions across the company .
With a few interesting exceptions , the rhetoric falls well short of the reality .
“ It does n't go very deep yet , ” says Bradley Googins , executive director of the Boston College Centre for Corporate Citizenship .
His centre 's latest survey on the state of play in America is called “ Time to Get Real ” .
There is , to be fair , some evidence that companies ' efforts are moving in a more strategic direction .
The Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy , a New York - based business association , reports that the share of corporate giving with a “ strategic ” motivation jumped from 38 % in 2004 to 48 % in 2006 .
But too often corporate strategy is not properly joined up .
In the car industry , Toyota has led the way in championing green , responsible motoring with its Prius hybrid model , but it has lobbied with others in the industry against a tough fuel - economy standard in America .
Surveys point to a big gap between companies ' aspirations and their actions ( see chart 2 ) .
And even corporate aspirations in the rich world lag far behind how much the public expects business to contribute to society .
According to Mr Porter , despite a surge of interest in CSR , in most cases it remains “ too unfocused , too shotgun , too many supporting someone 's pet project with no real connection to the business ” .
Dutch Leonard , like Mr Porter at Harvard Business School , describes the value - building type of CSR as “ an act of faith , almost a fantasy .
There are very few examples . ”
Perhaps that is not surprising .
The business of trying to be good is confronting executives with difficult questions .
Can you measure CSR performance ?
Should you be co-operating with NGOs , and with your competitors ?
Is there really competitive advantage to be had from a green strategy ?
How will the rise of companies from China , India and other emerging markets change the game ?
This special report will look in detail at how companies are implementing CSR .
It will conclude that , done badly , it is often just a figleaf and can be positively harmful .
Done well , though , it is not some separate activity that companies do on the side , a corner of corporate life reserved for virtue : it is just good business .
I do n't think I 've ever seen a kid , or anyone for that matter , react this way after receiving a gift .
Have a great weekend everyone !

After two intense failed relationships , {both which , in retrospect , were almost completely my fault but I was able to successfully manipulate things so as to make each man believe they were in the wrong} I have spent a lot of time thinking about who I am and I have isolated several personality traits that make it somewhat difficult for a normal person to have a relationship with me .
I am looking for a man who is secure enough in himself to tolerate our exciting lifestyle {a background or degree in psychology is a plus .}
I am determined to find a healthier way of approaching things , as I never want to ruin anyone 's life ever again .
I have decided to be completely honest right off the bat , therefor eliminating the time it takes to ' get to know one another ' {i.e. time it takes for you to realize I am a complete psycho - but by then you are completely helpless to resist my allure and charisma and are unable to wrench yourself from me , your beautiful demise .
}Some things you should know : *I have a major ' Daddy ' complex .
My father , whom I adored as a god , left when I was young .
No matter how well you treat me , you will never be as good of a man as my Daddy .
* I will never trust you .
The first of two men I thought I loved and slept with cheated on me time and time again , and impregnated other women and paid for their abortions with my money .
I did not find any of this out until two years into our relationship when we had a home and a life together and I was pregnant with a child of my own .
These indiscretions , and my tendency to be rash and impulsive led to me having an abortion .
I am prone to bouts of melancholy and self - hatred because of the guilt I still feel over this decision .
*I have no communication skills .
I will never tell you what is wrong with me , nor will I share any of my secrets , fears , hopes or dreams with you .
{ I do have several of these - one of them is to someday not be so crazy . }
You will have to pry information out of me .
I feel like if I confide in you , when I ultimately drive you away - which I am bound to do - you will have these personal pieces of me and that makes me feel vulnerable and I am terrified of being vulnerable .
*I have an addictive personality .
I was a crack addict when I was 15 - 16 , and relapsed again when I was 18 .
I like to think I have conquered these addictions but it would n't surprise me if I relapsed again .
*I am a cold and unemotional bitch .
This , of course , is all a facade , but you will constantly wonder if I truly care about you or not .
If you do not pay me 100 % of your attention , I will feel rejected and inwardly wonder why you do not love me .
Then I will pretend that you are nothing more to me than a mote of dust - which of course I do not notice .
If you pay me too much attention I will feel cagey and suffocated and walk out the door without telling you where I am going and may not return for several days .
No matter how long we are together , you will never see me cry .
I am a brick wall .** CLARIFICATION **-
About once every five months I will cry over my vacuumed fetus but when this happens I will lock myself in the smallest possible space I can find so you can not see me .
This is usually a closet or a bathroom , although I was partial to a large trunk I owned until someone confiscated it with my best interests in mind .
* Although I will always be completely faithful to you , I will have no less than five men in line who are able and willing to keep me platonic company if you ever need to leave for any reason .
This is because I cannot bear to be alone , even though I pretend that that is all I want .
*I am terrified of commitment .
Know that I will never marry you , or if in a moment of confusion I do agree to marry you , I will not show up on our wedding day .
* I have some sexual preferences that some people may not be able to handle .
I want sex several times a day and I like to be hit , choked , and called nasty names .
Please be comfortable with such abuse .*
I am incredibly indecisive .
I do not know what I want to eat , wear , or do at any given time .
Once we have reached a decision I will change my mind .
I am also extremely scatterbrained and lose my keys , phone , wallet , etc. on a regular basis .
I will expect you to be able to locate these items .
I am also very impatient and want what I want when I want it , with no regards to your feelings .
* I throw punches when I feel cornered .
I kickbox , so they are good punches .
Now that that is out of the way , I do have some redeeming qualities !*I am beautiful , intelligent , educated and articulate .
You can be assured that all of your family and friends will envy you for having such a wonderful girlfriend .
I am definitely the girl you can bring home to mom .
You and only you will know of my dichonomy and my psychotic antics when we are alone .
*I can cook a mean steak .
* When I am happy , { which is a good portion of the time} you will feel like the most amazing man alive and the center of my universe .
*I am artistically gifted .
*I have a stable and lucrative career .
*I make friends with everyone , including homeless people and vicious dogs .
I take bugs out of my house and let them go .
As mentioned , I am extremely charismatic and you will be unable to resist my charms .
I guarantee you will fall in madly and twistedly love with me , and although you know that I will ultimately leave you in an emotional bloody shredded heap in pursuit of my own needs , you will be unwilling and unable to exorcise me from your life , so serious replies only , please .
P.S. - Please be an animal lover .
If you are not , then I am not the girl for you .

The family dinner has become a thing of the past in millions of homes .
Only a fifth of families sit down for a meal together at least once or twice a week , a survey has found .
Three - quarters of 1,000 families surveyed said they were so busy they hardly ever found the time to talk through their problems .
Scroll down for more ...
Psychologist Dr Pat Spungin , a parenting expert , said a family should aim to spend at least 20 minutes at the table to help foster meaningful conversations .
She said there were three phases to a meal , all equally important .
In the first , communication is mostly practical as the cooking is finished and everyone sits down .
Then comes settling in , where the family members exchange small talk .
The final phase is " sweet talk " , which Dr Spungin says is crucial to building relationships .
Families need to spend significant time together to enjoy in - depth conversations and share their experiences , stories and worries .
The survey by Heinz showed this time is being eroded - not just by TV but by mobile phones , games consoles and computers , said Dr Spungin .

She added : " Conversation is the glue of family life .
So when families do sit down at the table , it 's important they make the most of the time .
Talking through family issues is the key to family bonding . "

Just when you thought the War Party was down , and nearly out , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did them the favor of paying a visit to New York , the town that trademarked rudeness .
This gave the usual suspects an opportunity to rehearse , so to speak , for the coming war with Iran .
Every symphony has a prelude , and this one  Götterdämmerung II ?
 has as its central theme the villainous caricature of an Iranian president who denies the Holocaust and threatens to " wipe Israel off the map . "
The opening act was Ahmadinejad ’s Columbia University performance , preceded by a long , hectoring introduction by university president Lee Bollinger , who took the opportunity to assuage his critics by preparing what he doubtless thought would be an ambush .
Except it did n’t turn out that way .
Instead , Ahmadinejad came out looking rather more sympathetic than he appeared going into that lion ’s den .
The Iranian president , Bollinger barked , " exhibits all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator . "
He declared his guest “ ridiculous , ” and questioned whether Ahmadinejad would " have the intellectual courage to answer my questions . "
As is typical of war propaganda , the axis of AIPAC and its allies in the sensationalist media have cherry - picked choice quotes from Ahmadinejad ’s long presentation .
The Iranian country bumpkin’s denial that homosexuality exists in Iran was of particular interest  after all , this is America  and subject to widespread ridicule .
It ’s funny , if your taste in humor is rather dark  who ’s in the mood for jokes with all those war clouds gathering on the horizon ?
 because of the apparent misunderstanding underlying his curious statement .
As I ’ve written elsewhere , " homosexuality " does n’t mean the same thing in the Middle East and North Africa as it does in the Anglosphere , and so this is a matter of cultures in collision , and has more to do with differences in language than anything else .
In any case , the usual allowances we make for foreigners , who might not understand our customs and mores , were not made for the university ’s distinctly dishonored guest .
However , if you actually go and read the transcript of Ahmadinejad ’s remarks , what quickly becomes apparent is that he rose to meet Bollinger ’s challenge and did indeed answer the questions posed to him .
Whether this required " intellectual courage , " or merely a desperate desire to somehow avert what seems to be an imminent attack on his country by the mightiest military machine on earth , is open to speculation , and I ’ll leave that to others .
Suffice to say that the Iranian president ’s faltering political fortunes at home  where the economy is on the downtick , in spite of the rising price of oil  were certainly given a much - needed lift by the extraordinary display of vitriolic self - righteousness with which he was greeted in the Big Bad Apple .
The Iranian response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks was among the most demonstratively sympathetic : Tehran saw candlelight vigils and official expressions of mourning and grief .
Yet Ahmadinejad ’s simple request to pay his respects at Ground Zero in lower Manhattan was denied and roundly denounced : how dare he imagine he’d be allowed to make a simple human gesture !
In answering Bollinger ’s accusation that he denies the Holocaust and calls for the destruction of Israel , Ahmadinejad denied his denialism and , instead of regaling his audience with the theories of the Holocaust " revisionists " he invited to Tehran last year , made a point of emphasizing the political and ideological uses of the Holocaust :
" Given this historical event , if it is a reality , we need to still question whether the Palestinian people should be paying for it or not .
After all , it happened in Europe .
The Palestinian people had no role to play in it .
So why is it that the Palestinian people are paying the price of an event they had nothing to do with ?
" The Palestinian people did n’t commit any crime .
They had no role to play in World War II .
They were living with the Jewish communities and the Christian communities in peace at the time .
They did n’t have any problems .
" And today , too , Jews , Christians , and Muslims live in brotherhood all over the world in many parts of the world .
They do n’t have any serious problems .
" But why is it that the Palestinians should pay a price , innocent Palestinians , for 5 million people to remain displaced or refugees abroad for 60 years .
Is this not a crime ?
Is asking about these crimes a crime by itself ? "
In America , and much of the English - speaking world , the answer to this last is " apparently so . "
Bollinger aspired to be the Gen. Petraeus of academia , averring that Iran is " funding terrorism " and supplying arms and other support for a " proxy war " against U.S. soldiers , including " providing safe transit to insurgent leaders like Moqtada al - Sadr and his forces . "
Except that Sadr is hardly an " insurgent , " or else how does the learned Bollinger explain the news that the 32 elected representatives of the Sadrist movement in the Iraqi parliament have only recently withdrawn their support for the government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ?
The Shi’ite cleric who rules Sadr City is the leader of a legal organization , one of four major components of the ruling United Iraqi Alliance that swept into power in the wake of the famous purple - finger elections .
Is it too much to expect a leading academic authority figure to do his homework before he gets up in front of the class and makes a fool out of himself ?
Answering the Bush - Bollinger canard that he ’s funding terrorism , the Iranian president turned the tables on his interlocutors , pointing to the toll taken by terrorists in his own nation , and referring to if not actually naming the Mujahideen - e - Khalq , a group that has committed terrorist acts against both Iranians and Americans , and which is being harbored in Iraq by U.S. forces .
This is not to mention the insurgent groups aided by the U.S. in Iranian Kurdistan and among the Sunni tribes to the east .
Said Ahmadinejad :
" We do n’t need to resort to terrorism .
We ’ve been victims of terrorism , ourselves .
And it ’s regrettable that people who argue they ’re fighting terrorism , instead of supporting the Iranian people and nation , instead of fighting the terrorists that are attacking them , they ’re supporting the terrorists and then turn the fingers to us . "
Touché .
The interrogation of Ahmadinejad by the moderator varied a bit from Bollinger ’s indictment .
On the question of Israel , for example , the latter merely accused him of calling for Israel ’s physical destruction  a contention effectively debunked , I think , by the estimable Juan Cole  while the moderator opened the proceedings with : " The first question is :
Do you or your government seek the destruction of the state of Israel as a Jewish state ? "
In other words , what we ’re talking about is not a threat to drive the Jews into the Mediterranean , as is typically claimed by the Lobby , but the threat of a popular referendum , with one option being a binational Palestinian state , as Ahmadinejad described the official Iranian position .
Tony Judt takes a similar position , as do many other liberal Westerners .
Are they to be burned in effigy , too ?
What ’s notable , however , is Ahmadinejad ’s point that Jews live in peace in Iran , with representation in the elected parliament  which is more than can be said for the plight of Jews in Iraq , where , last we heard , there were eight left in Baghdad , once a thriving center of Jewish culture .
Ahmadinejad is no worse than any number of U.S. - supported despots in the region , including Hosni Mubarak : at least he is n’t grooming his son to succeed him in office .
Iran is hardly a Jeffersonian republic , yet its electoral process  which involves a real contest  is a lot freer than Egypt’s .
What is particularly galling is to witness the sad spectacle of a university president being used by this administration to stage its carefully choreographed pro-war morality play .
Bollinger acted as an echo chamber for the neoconservative ideologues who are playing the same deceptive game they did so well at in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
Yet there is no concrete evidence that the Iranians are arming Sadr or any of the other militias , which are all funded and operated by the parties of the ruling UIA coalition .
These militias were given safe haven and succored by Tehran during Saddam ’s reign , and good relations no doubt persist .
What else did the Americans expect would happen after they " liberated " the Shi’ite majority from the depredations of a Sunni dictatorship ?
It ’s notable that the various Iranian diplomats arrested by the U.S. occupation forces have all been defended by the Iraqi government as legitimate .
The irony of the debate around whether Columbia should have invited Ahmadinejad is that it ’s raging in a country whose chief executive has announced that that he ’s exporting " freedom " around the world .
The real meaning of this " freedom , " however , was aptly expressed by Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres , who declared :
" I think that Columbia University made a mistake .
With Hitler there was a dialogue .
[ British Prime Minister Neville ] Chamberlain went to talk to him .
What did it help ?
It helped cover the fact that Hitler prepared concentration camps and death camps .
I do n’t accept the university ’s explanations , because if a university is a platform where lies are permissible , then it is not academic .
So all of yesterday ’s show was wretched . "
The Republican candidates for president with one exception took the Israeli position , and no wonder : in his Columbia peroration , the supposed madman who wants to nuke Israel and the U.S. denounced politicians who seek nuclear weapons as " retarded . "
No doubt we ’ll see an alliance between AIPAC and the mentally handicapped in denouncing these insensitive remarks .
It ’s notable that Hillary Clinton , along with the usual lineup of GOP warmongers , joined the chorus of derision that greeted Ahmadinejad ’s desire to pay his respects to those who fell on 9/11 .
“ If I were the president of a university , I would not have invited him , but I did not express an opinion about the decision made by Columbia , ” Clinton said .
“ Obviously I was very much against his desire to go to Ground Zero .
I thought that was absolutely out of bounds and unacceptable and thankfully it was not permitted . ”
It ’s typical that the cold , cold Hillary , ice goddess  and potential war goddess  would fail to understand the typically human desire to sympathize with and honor the victims of a tragedy .
This does not bode well for a future Democratic administration that will come under immediate pressure from the Lobby to confront Tehran .
The extraordinary din of catcalls and pure hatred that greeted Ahmadinejad upon his arrival in our country is like the Two - Minutes Hate in George Orwell ’s 1984 , a novel that continues to remind us of the author ’s preternatural prescience .
As a prelude to the bombing of Iran and the commencement of the Third Gulf War , this week ’s orgy of vitriol sets the tone for what is to come .
We ’ve been hearing a lot about “ Saturday Night Live ” and the fun it has been having with the presidential race .
But hardly a whisper has been heard about a Congressional hearing in Washington last week on a topic that could have been drawn , in all its tragic monstrosity , from the theater of the absurd .
The war in Iraq will ultimately cost U.S. taxpayers not hundreds of billions of dollars , but an astonishing $ 2 trillion , and perhaps more .
There has been very little in the way of public conversation , even in the presidential campaigns , about the consequences of these costs , which are like a cancer inside the American economy .
On Thursday , the Joint Economic Committee , chaired by Senator Chuck Schumer , conducted a public examination of the costs of the war .
The witnesses included the Nobel Prize - winning economist , Joseph Stiglitz ( who believes the overall costs of the war  not just the cost to taxpayers  will reach $ 3 trillion ) , and Robert Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International .
Both men talked about large opportunities lost because of the money poured into the war .
“ For a fraction of the cost of this war , ” said Mr. Stiglitz , “ we could have put Social Security on a sound footing for the next half - century or more . ”
This news is discouraging , but hardly unexpected .
According to a Marketplace report , a survey by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies ( pdf here ) finds that the share of workers borrowing from their 401 ( k ) retirement funds increased from 11 % in 2006 to 18 % in 2007 .
Nearly half of those taking out such loans in 2007 cited the need to pay off debt , compared to a quarter in 2006 .
Stagnant wages and salaries , most spouses already employed , rising health care and college tuition costs , higher mortgage debt loads , and falling home values mean lots of American households — including many middle - income ones — are pinched financially .
The late 1990s economic boom lessened the strain for a while .
Then home equity loans helped .
More recently , credit card usage has jumped .
Borrowing against retirement savings is the logical next step .

Dartmouth College researchers and colleagues from the University of Bristol in the U.K. have traced the beginnings of complex life , i.e. vertebrates , to microRNA , sometimes referred to as ' junk DNA . '
The researchers argue that the evolution of microRNAs , which regulate gene expression , are behind the origin of early vertebrates .
Vertebrates - animals such as humans that possess a backbone - are the most anatomically and genetically complex of all organisms , but explaining how they achieved this complexity has vexed scientists since the conception of evolutionary theory .
The team studied the genomics of primitive living fishes , such as sharks and lampreys , and their spineless relatives , like the sea squirt .
By reconstructing the acquisition history of microRNAs shared between human and mice , the researchers determined that the highest rate of microRNA innovation in the vertebrate lineage occurred before the divergence between the living jawless fishes like the lamprey and the jawed fishes like the shark , but after the divergence of vertebrates from their invertebrate chordate relatives , such as the sea squirt .
Alysha Heimberg of Dartmouth College and her colleagues showed that microRNAs , a class of tiny molecules only recently discovered residing within what has usually been considered ' junk DNA ' , are hugely diverse in even the most lowly of vertebrates , but relatively few are found in the genomes of our invertebrate relatives .
She explained : " There was an explosive increase in the number of new microRNAs added to the genome of vertebrates and this is unparalleled in evolutionary history . "
Co-author , Dr Philip Donoghue of Bristol University 's Department of Earth Sciences continued : " Most of these new genes are required for the growth of organs that are unique to vertebrates , such as the liver , pancreas and brain .
Therefore , the origin of vertebrates and the origin of these genes is no coincidence . "
Dr Kevin Peterson of Dartmouth College said : " This study not only points the way to understanding the evolutionary origin of our own lineage , but it also helps us to understand how our own genome was assembled in deep time . "
Journal reference : MicroRNAs and the advent of vertebrate morphological complexity by Alysha M. Heimberg , Lorenzo F. Sempere , Vanessa N. Moy , Philip C. J. Donoghue and Kevin J. Peterson will be published online on February 11 - 15 in PNAS .

Riddle Me This
Several prominent liberal writers are arguing that 9/11 is a distraction from the fight for liberal causes .
Are they right ?
Before I address that question , let me ask another one : Q : What do Daniel Ellsberg , William Blum , Daniel Berrigan , David Swanson , Elizabeth Kucinich , Lewis Lapham , Michael Moore , Cindy Sheehan , Amy Goodman , Thom Hartmann , Rabbi Michael Lerner , Marc Crispin Miller , Howard Zinn , Ray McGovern , Robert McChesney , Gore Vidal , Chris Floyd , Robert Fisk , Medea Benjamin , Doris " Granny D " Haddock , Paul Hawken , David Cobb , Randy Hayes , Ernest Callenbach , Dennis Bernstein , Paul H. Ray , Michael Franti , Janeane Garafalo and Ed Asner all have in common ?
A : All of these leading liberal voices question the Bush administration 's account of what happened on 9/11 .

Other Liberal Causes
" [ failing to fully address what really happened on 9/11 ] will only serve to undermine all they would otherwise hope to accomplish -- in terms of the environment and social equity -- and for one fundamental reason : ... it is the war on terror that is the primary " displacement activity " burying progressive causes , not 911 skepticism .
The war on terror is such a potent metanarrative that it is driving a host of policy decisions -- even in an otherwise progressive nation as Canada -- that are sucking resources away from human needs , ecological conservation , climate change prevention and adaptation , poverty alleviation and peacemaking .
Until this metanarrative is dismantled and revealed for the lethal and cynical fraud it is and always has been , causes supported by progressives will never be properly addressed .
9/11 may not have changed everything , but until this controversy can be openly addressed in the media and through a more objective investigation , we may be unable to change anything .
"
( See this article and video this review , and this one ) .
Moreover , Noam Chomsky is calling for the declassification of 9/11 - related documents .
Former ambassador to Iraq Joseph Wilson is dissatisfied with the government 's explanation for 9/11 .
And the former president of the National Lawyers Guild and many other prominent progressive legal scholars question 9/11
So before you go " representing " the liberal position on 9/11 , take a look at what these prominent progressives have said .
Okay , now let 's get down to substance .
The administration 's false claims linking Iraq and 9/11 helped convince a large portion of the American public to invade Iraq .
While the focus now may be on false WMD claims , it is important to remember that , Moreover , the trauma of September 11 , 2001 is what galvanized many Americans to rally around the Bush administration in general , to close ranks in time of peril , and to give Bush his " mandate " ( putting questions of election fraud to the side ) .
Ever since 9/11 , the American people have been terrified -- and thus irrational -- based upon the trauma of the vicious attacks .
Since most Americans believe that the bad guys are " out there " and are about to get us unless we have a strong leader to fight them , they will not and CANNOT make any logical decisions about any other foreign or domestic issues -- including withdrawal from Iraq -- until " we get the bad guys " .
Indeed , the WMD hoax probably would not have worked if it was n't for the anti-Arab hysteria after September 11th .
And the government policy of torture would not have been tolerated if we were n't misled into thinking that Saddam and Al - Qaeda had formed an unholy , all - powerful alliance on 9/11 , and had to be stopped at any costs .
Thus , the Saddam - 911 deception was necessarily a precursor to the administration 's WMD lies and torture policies .
Indeed , the Bush administration is now using 9/11 as an excuse for domestic spying without warrant , and will use 9/11 as an excuse for every other unconstitutional , undemocratic , unAmerican destruction of civil liberties which it takes .
How about war with Iran ?
That 's an important issue for liberals , is n't it ?
Well , Americans are still terrified about Arabs with weapons .
Moreover , since Americans are still largely ignorant about the use of " false flag operations " by governments to justify wars , Americans will fall for a faked provocation .
What am I talking about ?
Well , the National Security Adviser for President Carter recently told the Senate that a terrorist act might be carried out in the U.S. and falsely blamed on Iran to justify war against that nation .
Similarly , a current Congressman has said " a contrived Gulf of Tonkin - type incident may occur to gain popular support for an attack on Iran " .
And a progressive member of the British Parliament stated that " there is a very real danger " that the American government will stage a false flag terror attack in order to justify war against Iran and to gain complete control domestically
In other words , if 9/11 was , in fact , a false flag operation , and that fact is not exposed by the left , then that willthe neoconservatives to usefaked terror incident in order to justify a war against Iran .
Thus , 9/11 is central for those interested in peace .
Liberals proudly proclaim the superiority of rationality over propaganda , blind passion and illogic .
Right ?
If you spend even 5 minutes looking at how completely the government investigations into 9/11 have failed to meet even basic tests of rationality , you will realize that liberals must demand a new , investigation .
What about other traditional liberal causes ?
What about global warming ?
Women 's rights ?
Gay rights ?
Helping the poor ?
Other liberal causes ?
Well , as a blogger from the University of Winnipeg in Canada says :
Imagine , if you would , that you were a citizen in Germany right after the Reichstag fire had occurred .
As you might know , the Reichstag fire was the burning down of the German parliament building by Hitler 's men , which was then blamed on the communists in order to justify wars against neighboring countries .
Do you believe you could have stopped the government from torturing communists after the Reichstag fire , by convincing people that Germans were a generous and good people who do not torture others ?
Do you think that you could have prevented the spread of disinformation about the hostile intentions and military capabilities of other countries by reminding Germans that war is bad and peace is good ?
Do you imagine you could have stopped the brownshirts and loss of domestic rights by writing about the desirability of civil liberties ?
Of course not !
The German people were whipped up into a state of hysteria and fear , because they thought they were under attack by communists , and Poles , and " bad guys " in general .
The German 's were in shock , and rallied around their " strong " leader .
Without first exposing that the Reichstag fire and Operation Himmler - the two things which were theof the German people 's fears , and which allowed the German parliament and other institutions to hand Hitler total power -- the sweeping away of liberal causes by the wave of fear could not be stopped .
Similarly , Americans are crazed by the fear of Arab terrorists just like Germans were terrified of communist and Polish terrorists .
Both peoples have handed over all of their power to their leaders in order to buy an imaginary security .
The Nazis might have been brought to justice well before the Nuremberg trials if the Reichstag hoax had been exposed at the time .
The German people could have been spared from the horrors inflicted on their nation and the world by the Nazis .
And sanity and liberal values could have been saved in 1940 's - era Germany .
As stated by a well - known liberal , George Santayana , " Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . "
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an update last week to its investigation of an outbreak of a paralysing condition that is affecting certain meat processing plant workers who use compressed air to remove the brains from the heads of pig carcases .
The illness is called Progressive Inflammatory Neuropathy ( PIN ) and its symptoms range from acute paralysis to gradual increase of weakness on both sides of the body , which in some cases happens over 8 days and in others over 213 days .
The symptoms vary in severity from slight weakness and numbness to paralysis that affects mobility , mostly in the lower extremities .
The current thinking , which is yet to be proved , is that the meat workers are being exposed to splatter and aerosol droplets of pig brain tissue created by the compressed air blast , which liquefies the tissue before expelling it from the pig skull .
Once inhaled , small particles of pig brain tissue are then is attacked by the worker ’s immune system which uses antibodies that also attack the body ’s own almost identical human nerve tissue .
Following the PIN outbreak in a Minnesota meat processing plant , the CDC launched a nationwide survey of large slaughterhouses and found two more meat plants that had used the compressed air system recently .
One of the plants was also reporting cases of a neurologic illness among its meat processing workers .
The outbreak came to the attention of the Minnesota Department of Health ( MDH ) in October last year , when it started getting reports of an unexplained neurologic illness among meat processing workers in a swine slaughterhouse in Southeast Minnesota , and which the CDC calls “ plant A ” .
The MDH conducted a full and detailed investigation of the plant , which employs some 1,200 workers and processes 18,000 pigs a day .
They interviewed workers and looked at health records , and found a total of 12 employees who have either been confirmed as having PIN ( 8 so far ) , probably have it ( 2 ) , or possibly have it ( 2 ) .
The 12 workers , six of whom are female , started having symptoms between November 2006 and November 2007 and reported being healthy beforehand .
They ranged in age from 21 to 51 years .
According to the MDH , 11 of the 12 workers affected showed evidence of axonal or demyelinating peripheral neuropathy ( damage to nerve fibres and surrounding protective tissue ) .
Spinal fluid taken from 7 of the workers showed they had high protein levels with little or no rise in pleocytosis or white blood cell count .
A raised white blood cell count is usually evidence of inflammation .
However , five patients showed evidence of inflammation when examined by spinal MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , four of them in peripheral nerves or roots and one in the anteorior spinal cord .
All 12 affected workers said they either worked at or had contact with the area of the plant where pig heads were processed ( called the “ head table ” ) .
The head table was in an area of the plant known as the “ warm room ” .
The MDH conducted a case - controlled study that included 10 of the 12 workers ( the 8 confirmed and the 2 probable cases of PIN ) , and two control groups : a random selection of 48 healthy workers from the warm room , and all 65 healthy workers from the head table .
After examining throat swabs and blood samples from the consenting participants , the MDH to date has not found any infectious agent that could explain the PIN symptoms .
Futher results from the case - control study showed that 7 of the 10 workers with PIN ( 70 per cent of the case patients ) were seven times more likely to have worked at the head table than the controls from the warm room ( 25 per cent , or 12 of 48 ) .
Case patients were also more likely to have handled brains and muscle from pigs ’ heads than members of either control group .
Travel outside the US or inside the US , exposure to chemicals , including fertilizers and insecticides , or having had vaccinations , were also not found to be causes of the PIN illness .
The health authorities then investigated the processing methods and safety equipment in the warm room and the head table in particular , and concluded , for now , that the compressed air method used to liquefy and remove the brain tissue from the pigs ’ heads could be causing the PIN through creating aerosol droplets of brain tissue that is then inhaled by the workers .
The plant operator has suspended use of the compressed air equipment voluntarily and stepped up use of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) , including face shields and long sleeves for the head table workers and any other workers who want to use additional PPE , said the CDC report .
Following the Minnesota plant A outbreak report , the CDC surveyed all 25 federally inspected swine slaughterhouses in the US with more than 500 employees .
They found three plants , including Minnesota plant A , using the compressed air method to remove pigs ’ brains .
The other two are in Nebraska and Indiana .
Of those , only the Indiana plant has reported cases of suspected PIN , which are currently being further assessed .
In the meantime , all three plants have stopped using the compressed air method to remove brain tissue , said the CDC .
The CDC said that :
“ Whether compressed - air devices are being used for pig- brain extraction in other slaughterhouses or processing facilities , in the United States or internationally , is unknown . ”
“ Clinicians should provide CDC with information regarding swine slaughterhouse workers who might have illnesses similar to PIN , including patients with peripheral neuropathy , myelopathy , or features of both . ”
If doctors se any patients who work in slaughterhouses with these symptoms , they should report them to their state health department and also let the CDC know on 770-488-7100 .
A puzzling feature of this outbreak was raised by the plant owner at one of the affected plants , who started as a floor walker in 1970 .
He told the Washington Post that they had been “ harvesting pig brains since 1998 , using the same method and the same 70 - pound pressure air hose . ”
So why did the outbreak not take place ten years ago , when they started using the method ?
The plant owner said that was the “ million - dollar question ” .

Teen dies after insurance nixes transplant funds
UPDATE : Family planning lawsuit against insurance company ; nurse says CIGNA 'has blood on their hands
A 17 - year old died just hours after her health insurance company reversed its decision not to pay for a liver transplant that doctors said the girl needed .
Nataline Sarkisyan died Thursday night at about 6 p.m. at University of California , Los Angeles Medical Center .
She had been in a vegetative state for weeks , said her mother , Hilda .
" She passed away , and the insurance ( company ) is responsible for this , " she said .
Nataline had been battling leukemia and received a bone marrow transplant from her brother .
She developed a complication , however , that caused her liver to fail .
Doctors at UCLA determined she needed a transplant and sent a letter to CIGNA Healthcare on Dec. 11 .
The Philadelphia - based health insurance company denied payment for the transplant .
On Thursday , about 150 teenagers and nurses protested outside CIGNA 's office in Glendale .
As the protesters rallied , the company reversed its decision and said it would approve the transplant .
Despite the reversal , CIGNA said in an e-mail statement before she died that there was a lack of medical evidence showing the procedure would work in Nataline 's case .
" Our hearts go out to Nataline and her family , as they endure this terrible ordeal , " the company said . " ... CIGNA HealthCare has decided to make an exception in this rare and unusual case and we will provide coverage should she proceed with the requested liver transplant . "
Officials with CIGNA could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday night .

Although improvised explosive devices have until now been responsible for the majority of US casualties in Iraq , a new , armor - piercing hand grenade may pose an even greater threat .
CBS
News reports that the Russian - made device is light enough to be thrown by a single insurgent standing alongside a road and is equipped with a parachute so that it falls vertically on its target and can take out even armored vehicles .
Al - Qaeda in Iraq has been eager to take credit for the use of these grenades , but the US Army is now confirming losses to the weapons as well .
The following video is from CBS 's Evening News , broadcast on September 5 .
news Scientology ’s Legion of Doom
If you passed the Church of Scientology ’s Toronto chapter at Yonge & St. Mary on Sunday , you may have momentarily entertained a dark fantasy that Tom Cruise would emerge from the masked masses amid gales of manic laughter , igniting the dissenting throng with bolts of righteous lightning .
Sadly , no such fun .
Rumour has it that Mr. Cruise was under lockdown during Anonymous ’ global day of action against L. Ron Hubbard ’s brainchild .
As the Toronto campaign got underway , Sunday commuters voiced solidarity with the placard - waving Vs and Vaders through their horns .
“ Honk for Xenu ” read one such sign ; “ Honk if you think Scientology is silly ” read another .
On the other side of the street , police wedged themselves between Scientology ’s Toronto headquarters and a crowd that was only getting louder .
The war Anonymous wants is over ten years old , fought on a digital battleground .
Many of the demonstrators gathered on Yonge Street were rallied through Facebook or YouTube , new recruits in a struggle that , in this city , can be traced at least as far back as a guy named Gregg Hagglund ( pictured above ) and “ The Great Internet Wars ” of the late nineties .
“ I started picketing because Scientology attacked me for criticizing them on the Internet , ” he said .
Referring to a Usenet newsgroup on the subject , he says , “ Some of it was wild , but a lot of the posters were very , very educated in their information about Scientology .
So I made the comment that if what they were saying was true , Scientology should be investigated . ”
As exchanges and e-mail bombings escalated , things got ugly .
Before long , Hagglund and his compatriots were embroiled in a struggle which , at its heart , was about freedom of speech , information , and challenging a “ culture of surveillance . ”
That was something like ten years ago .
And while Anonymous is a new movement , it is fighting the same war .
Watching the swelling crowd across the street , Hagglund reminisced .
“ We never had this many .
The most we ever had was fifty people from all over North America , ” he said .
“ This is incredible . ”
Surrounded by watchful shutters , Rev. Yvette Shank , president of Scientology ’s Toronto chapter , dismissed Hagglund ’s and Anonymous ’ allegations of harassment , suppression of dissent , and even stalking .
“ Bushwash , ” she responded .
“ That is such bushwash .
I have never , ever had that happen .
If we did , we would be very busy .
We would n’t be doing anything else . ”
“ Anything else ” probably refers to Scientology ’s outreach campaigns , many of which are youth - targeted .
“ We have a drug- education campaign where we get kids from the age of 6 on up to pledge to be drug - free . ”
“ Anything else ” also refers to Scientology ’s infamous stress tests .
“ All that does is help us locate where the person is having the most difficulty , ” Shank said , “ and then you can start working on improving that . ”
When asked to elaborate further on the methods involved , Shank declined .
( An invitation to “ show us how it works ” through participation , but that ’s about it , and no mention of Thetans . )
Such details of the Scientology mythos have remained tightly - guarded for years , available only to the Church ’s ladder - climbing members .
With the advent of the Internet , the conflict between Anonymous and Scientology has become an information war , one that ’s rapidly approaching critical mass .
“ We ’ve always said that the Internet is Scientology ’s Vietnam , ” Hagglund continued .
“ Now , years later , so many people between the ages of 18 and 25 are on YouTube or Facebook .
When I stopped picketing , YouTube was just starting .
Facebook did n’t exist .
And they want to attack that ? ”
Hagglund chuckled a little , remarking , “ It ’ll be like throwing a hand grenade into an African Bees ’ nest . ”
Since Anonymous ’ first video appeared on YouTube , Scientology has been vigilant in defending itself and its interests , profiling Anonymous as an “ Internet hate machine . ”
In its reporting , FOX News echoed the accusation .
“ I think FOX News did a good job at exposing the intent of these guys , honestly , ” Shank asserted .
“ The hate crimes of Anonymous should be condemned .
This is a country that is free , and I do n’t want people that believe and follow Mein Kampf and The Communist Manifesto as their Bible . ”
Pressed for her source , she said , “ It comes from Anonymous .
That ’s the source .
You have to look at … ” as an aide whispered in her ear : “ It ’s on YouTube . ”
“ Yes , ” she confirmed .
“ On YouTube . ”
Outside , a masked demonstrator offered his answer .
“ Anonymous likes to think of itself as a school of all literature , ” he said .
“ So , likewise , we also educate ourselves through 1984 and Brave New World , which I ’m sure they ’d love their followers to read .
Or not . ”
If this is an information war , Anonymous ’ outrage concerns a lack of transparency on the Scientology side .
“ We just like to raise attention on certain matters .
If the church wanted to debunk some of [ Anonymous ’ ] claims , then they could make more of their information available and not be so secretive .
If people knew all that they were getting into , they might have a different opinion . ”
When asked for his name , the masked demonstrator simply answered , “ My name is Legion . ”

If you ’ve just been cornered by Martha Stewart at an interdisciplinary science conference and chastised for being a wimp , you could only be at one event : Sci Foo , an experimental , invitation - only , wikilike annual conference that takes place at Google headquarters in Mountain View , California .
There is almost no preplanned agenda .
Instead , there ’s a moment early on when the crowd of scientists rushes up to blank poster - size calendars and scrawls on them to reserve rooms and times for talks on whatever topic comes to mind .
For instance , physicist Lee Smolin , sci - fi author Neal Stephenson , and I talked about the relationship between time and math ( touching on ideas presented in my October 2006 column ) .
The wimp comment was directed at me , and Martha was right .
I had n’t stood up for myself in a group interaction .
I ’ve always been the shy one in the schoolyard .
Back in the 1980s , I was drawn to the possibility that virtual reality would help extend the magical , creative qualities of childhood into adulthood .
Indeed , the effect of digital technology on culture has been exactly that , but childhood is not entirely easy .
If Lee had n’t forged through the crowd to create our session , I never would have done it .
What made Martha ’s critique particularly memorable , though , is that her observation was directly relevant to what emerged from Sci Foo as the big idea about the future of science .
It was n’t official , of course , but the big idea kept popping up : Science as a whole should consider adopting the ideals of “ Web 2.0 , ” becoming more like the community process behind Wikipedia or the open - source operating system Linux .
And that goes double for synthetic biology , the current buzzword for a superambitious type of biotechnology that draws on the techniques of computer science .
There were more sessions devoted to ideas along these lines than to any other topic , and the presenters of those sessions tended to be the younger ones , indicating that the notion is ascendant .
It ’s a trend that seems ill - founded to me , and to explain why , I ’ll tell a story from my early twenties .
Visualize , if you will , the most transcendentally messy , hirsute , and otherwise eccentric pair of young nerds on the planet .
One was me ; the other was Richard Stallman .
Richard was distraught to the point of tears .
He had poured his energies into a celebrated project to build a radically new kind of computer called the LISP Machine .
It was n’t just a regular computer running LISP , a programming language beloved by artificial intelligence researchers .
Instead it was a machine patterned on LISP from the bottom up , making a radical statement about what computing could be like at every level , from the underlying architecture to the user interface .
For a brief period , every hot computer - science department had to own some of these refrigerator - size gadgets .
It came to pass that a company called Symbolics became the sole seller of LISP machines .
Richard realized that a whole experimental subculture of computer science risked being dragged into the toilet if anything happened to that little company — and of course everything bad happened to it in short order .
So Richard hatched a plan .
Never again would computer code , and the culture that grew up with it , be trapped inside a wall of commerce and legality .
He would instigate a free version of an ascendant , if rather dull , program : the Unix operating system .
That simple act would blast apart the idea that lawyers and companies could control software culture .
Eventually a kid named Linus Torvalds followed in Richard ’s footsteps and did something related , but using the popular Intel chips instead .
His effort yielded Linux , the basis for a vastly expanded open - software movement .
But back to that dingy bachelor pad near MIT .
When Richard told me his plan , I was intrigued but sad .
I thought that code was important in more ways than politics can ever be .
If politically correct code was going to amount to endless replays of dull stuff like Unix instead of bold projects like the LISP Machine , what was the point ?
Would mere humans have enough energy to carry both kinds of idealism ?
Twenty - five years later , that concern seems to have been justified .
Open wisdom - of - crowds software movements have become influential , but they have n’t promoted the kind of radical creativity I love most in computer science .
If anything , they ’ve been hindrances .
Some of the youngest , brightest minds have been trapped in a 1970s intellectual framework because they are hypnotized into accepting old software designs as if they were facts of nature .
Linux is a superbly polished copy of an antique , shinier than the original , perhaps , but still defined by it .
Before you write me that angry e-mail , please know I ’m not anti–open source .
I frequently argue for it in various specific projects .
But a politically correct dogma holds that open source is automatically the best path to creativity and innovation , and that claim is not borne out by the facts .
Why are so many of the more sophisticated examples of code in the online world — like the page - rank algorithms in the top search engines or like Adobe ’s Flash — the results of proprietary development ?
Why did the adored iPhone come out of what many regard as the most closed , tyrannically managed software - development shop on Earth ?
An honest empiricist must conclude that while the open approach has been able to create lovely , polished copies , it has n’t been so good at creating notable originals .
Even though the open - source movement has a stinging countercultural rhetoric , it has in practice been a conservative force .
There were plenty of calls at Sci Foo for developing synthetic biology along open - source lines .
Under such a scheme , DNA sequences might float around from garage experimenter to garage experimenter via the Internet , following the trajectories of pirated music downloads and being recombined in endless ways .
A quintessential example of the open ideal showed up in Freeman Dyson ’s otherwise wonderful piece about the future of synthetic biology in a recent issue of The New York Review of Books .
MIT bioengineer Drew Endy , one of the enfants terribles of synthetic biology , opened his spectacular talk at Sci Foo with a slide of Freeman ’s article .
I ca n’t express the degree to which I admire Freeman .
Among other things , he was the one who turned me on to an amazing 11 - sided geometric figure ( see Jaron ’s World , April 2007 ) .
In this case , though , we see things differently .
Freeman equates the beginnings of life on Earth with the Eden of Linux .
Back when life first took hold , genes flowed around freely ; genetic sequences skipped around from organism to organism in much the way they may soon on the Internet .
In his article , Freeman derides the first organism that hoarded its genes as “ evil , ” like the nemesis of the open - ­software movement , Bill Gates .
Once organisms became encapsulated , they isolated themselves into distinct species , trading genes only with others of their kind .
Freeman suggests that the coming era of synthetic biology will be a return to Eden .
Species boundaries will be defunct , and genes will fly about , resulting in an orgy of creativity .
But the alternative to open development is not necessarily evil .
My guess is that a poorly encapsulated , communal gloop of organisms lost out to closely guarded species for the same reason that the Linux community did n’t come up with the iPhone : Encapsulation serves a purpose .
Let ’s say you have something complicated like a biological cell , or even something much less complicated , like a computer design or a scientific model .
You put it through tests , and the results of the tests influence how the design will be changed .
That can happen either in natural evolution or in a lab .
The universe wo n’t last long enough to test every possible combination of elements in a complicated construction like a cell .
Therefore , the only option is to tie down as much as possible from test to test and proceed incrementally .
After a series of encapsulated tests , it might seem as though a result appears magically , as if it could n’t have been approached incrementally .
Fortunately , encapsulation in human affairs does n’t need lawyers or a tyrant ; it can be achieved within a wide variety of political structures .
Academic efforts are usually well encapsulated , for instance .
Scientists do n’t publish until they are ready , but publish they must .
So science as it is already practiced is open , but in a punctuated way , not a continuous way .
The interval of nonopenness — the time before publication — functions like the walls of a cell .
It allows a complicated stream of elements to be defined well enough to be explored , tested , and then improved .
The open - source software community is simply too turbulent to focus its tests and maintain its criteria over an extended duration , and that is a prerequisite to evolving highly original things .
There is only one iPhone , but there are hundreds of Linux releases .
A closed - software team is a human construction that can tie down enough variables so that software becomes just a little more like a hardware chip — and note that chips , the most encapsulated objects made by humans , get better and better following an exponential pattern of improvement known as Moore ’s law .
The politically incorrect critique of Freeman ’s point of view is that the restrictions created by species boundaries have similarly made billions of years of natural biology more like hardware than like software .
To put it another way :
There wo n’t be an orgy of creativity in an overly open version of synthetic biology because there have to be species for sex to make sense .
I seem to hold a minority opinion .
I ’ve taken a lot of heat for it !
I ca n’t hire Martha Stewart as a life coach , so the one thing I hope synthetic biology wo n’t import from the open - software world is the cultlike mania that seems to grip so many open - source enthusiasts .

The neighbours arrived after dusk .
Armed with machetes , clubs and iron bars , they surrounded Monica Mutaba 's house in a Kenyan slum .
She was in bed with her husband and baby when the front door was kicked down .
Monica recognised some of her attackers as they burst in .
They shopped at the same local market ; their children played together .
She had grown up with some of them .
But , as blood - lust gripped the former British colony this week , the mob was not going to let old friendships stand in the way .
Scroll down for more
Realising she was in mortal danger , Monica grabbed her son and sprinted for the back door .
As she ran out , she looked over her shoulder .
Her husband had rushed at the men to try to protect her .
But he had been overwhelmed and knocked to the floor .
The mob surrounded him .
Chanting tribal oaths and yelling " Kikuyus out " , the neighbours hacked at her husband with machetes .
He put his arms up to try to protect himself from the blows .
It was futile .
There was blood everywhere .
Barefoot and wearing the nightdress she escaped in , Monica stood sobbing by the roadside with her baby on her back and told me how she watched as the mob poured petrol over her house and set it ablaze with her husband still inside .
" I hope he is still alive , " she whispered , desperately clinging to hope .
" This is my baby 's father .
These men were shouting about my tribe while they cut my husband with their weapons .
There were more than 20 of them .
They burned down our home and many of the other homes around us .
I can not go back now . "
Scroll down for more
Monica's " crime " ?
She 's from the wrong tribe .
Mwai Kibaki , the leader of the Kikuyu , was " re-elected " president last month in what is widely regarded as a rigged election , sparking scenes of violence throughout Kenya as rival tribes reacted with fury at the result .
More than 1,000 people have been killed as ethnic hatred sweeps a country previously regarded as a model African state .
Until now , Kenya seemed to have been spared the bloodshed that scars much of the continent 's post - colonial history .
No longer .
The tension that has led to the fighting goes back to Britain 's legacy in Kenya .
When the British arrived in the late 19th and early 20th century , they took over large areas of fertile land , developing productive farms .
Then came the Mau Mau uprising from 1952 - 1958 , when thousands of Kenya 's largest ethnic group , the Kikuyus , died during the battle for black majority rule .
With independence in 1963 under Kikuyu President Jomo Kenyatta , many British settlers were bought out from their picturesque farms by the government .
Scroll down for more
And instead of redistributing the land to the people who had lived there for centuries , like the Kalenjin and Luo tribes , the new president gave much of it to his own Kikuyu tribe .
Resentment over this land has built up over the past four decades .
The Luos , who make up 12 per cent of the population , have long complained not only about the land but also that the best jobs have gone to Kikuyus .
And with Kibaki 's election as President in 2002 - he , too , is a Kikuyu - that process accelerated .
The Kikuyus have become Kenya 's elite , with prominent - and lucrative - jobs in medicine , law , politics and business .
And now , the grievance of the other tribes - encouraged by political opposition - has spilt over into bloody violence .
Amid warnings that the country is sliding into tribal anarchy and even civil war , what happens next in Kenya is crucial for Africa 's future .
U.S. and British diplomats fear that chronic instability will lead to Kenya becoming a bigger base for terrorists , as well as a burgeoning centre for drug and people smuggling to the West .
Scroll down for more
With Sudan and Somalia in turmoil to the north , and the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe in ruins to the south and west , the loss of Kenya would prove a devastating blow to the safety and prosperity of the continent , bringing chaos to a huge swathe of East Africa .
The signs are not encouraging .
More than 300,000 people have been driven from their homes .
Much of the country is under siege .
Roads have been blocked by mobs hunting tribal enemies .
Some victims have been beheaded .
Others have been hacked to death with machetes .
Gangs are roaming the streets , stopping vehicles and killing people suspected of being members of an enemy tribe .
Unable to get troops into affected areas , army helicopters have resorted to strafing gangs with machine - gun fire to protect women and children from attack .
In the past five days , at least 100 people have died , although the true death toll is undoubtedly higher .
Much of the killing has been in outlying areas , away from the eyes of aid workers and journalists .
I watched one night as a Kikuyu man was abducted by a gang armed with clubs and hustled away to deserted wasteland .
I do n't know what became of him as the group was lost in the darkness .
Rape is used as an instrument of terror .
In one township , a gang of thugs , high on drink and drugs , seized eight women and held them in a burned - out building , raping them time and again .
Doctors say victims are being sexually assaulted and made to hack members of their own families with machetes .
The situation has chilling overtones of Rwanda .
In the worst genocide since the Holocaust , up to one million Tutsis were murdered by Hutu neighbours in the tiny , mountainous country during a four - month period in 1994 .
The Tutsis , favoured and promoted by Belgian colonialists , were hated by Hutus for holding the most lucrative posts .
Now , more than a decade later , Kenya 's Kikuyu and Luo tribes have become involved in deadly clashes that have left many fearing Kenya could be heading for a similar fate .
As Britain and the U.S. voiced their alarm about the scale of the Kenyan crisis this week , unconfirmed rumours swept Nairobi , the capital , that the United Nations was poised to start evacuating staff from Kenya if the violence continued .
There are no UN troops on the ground in Kenya , but there are 800 international staff working on " humanitarian " projects who may be evacuated , while 1,200 local staff will be left to " fend for themselves " if the collapse in law and order continues .
In one of the worst incidents , more than 70 women and children were locked inside a church and burned to death .
Both the ruling Kikuyus as well as Luo opposition leaders in Kenya have been accused of using newspapers and radio to stir up hatred .
With death threats being made against local editors , millions of sinister leaflets are being distributed in Kenya 's slums , where 90 per cent of the 40 million population lived in grinding poverty - surviving on less than £ 1 a day .
In Juja , a township on the outskirts of Nairobi , dozens have been killed and thousands driven from their ramshackle homes .
A group of men armed with machetes stood at one entrance to the maze of alleyways that lead through the slum , handing out pieces of paper urging people to take up arms .
Written in Kikuyu , the leaflets state : ' Kenya , for how long must our blood pour out ?
For how long must we die ?
Hear it from the horse 's mouth .
If the clashes are not over in seven days , we declare war . '
Luo enemies are circulating similar pamphlets , urging death to Kikuyus .
On the streets of Kibera , Nairobi 's biggest slum , I met Teddy , a Kikuyu , who sells stolen mobile phones and drugs to impoverished slum residents .
Sweeping his machete through the air in an arc he claimed his Luo enemies were " dirty " because they were not circumcised .
" Luos deserve to die , " he told me .
" They are unclean and lazy .
We can not let them kill us .
If there is no political settlement , we must cut them with our weapons .
They are trying to take everything from us .
They must die . "
The violence has sent tremors through the white community , dubbed the " Happy Valley Set " in the 1930s on account of their decadent lifestyles .
At the Nairobi Sports Club , a favourite expat haunt , one white landowner said many wives and children and have been sent away to London and South Africa .
" It has never been this bad , " he said .
The government is trying to hide the scale of the conflict .
At the Kenyatta hospital in Nairobi , I was threatened with arrest by government police as dozens of victims of the latest clashes were brought in for treatment .
Yet the pitiful scenes in the hospital were not the complete picture .
At a clandestine meeting , senior medical figures revealed that doctors and nurses have been told to hide the true nature of the bloodshed , keeping the worst cases in private wards patrolled by security guards .
One of the men produced a list of the ' real ' casualties , which revealed horrific injuries and deaths caused by gunshot wounds and machetes .
" You must tell people what is happening here , " the source said .
" We are desperate . "
In a macabre twist , doctors and nurses are also deciding who should live or die according to which tribe they are from .
Kikuyus are not being treated when Luo doctors are on duty ; Luos have had life - support machines tampered with by Kikuyu staff .
The crisis erupted after elections last month , when Mwai Kibaki , a Kikuyu , was re-elected president for a second term following a ballot condemned by international monitors as rigged .
Desperate to keep control of the finances of a country ranked one of the most corrupt in the world , he ignored international condemnation and formed a cabinet , sparking outrage last month among Luos .
Raila Odinga , the Luo candidate , refused to accept the result .
An aloof figure rarely seen among his people , Kibaki 's desire to remain president was understandable .
He has spent much of his life " feeding off Kenya 's carcass " , says one diplomat .
During a career stretching back to the earliest days of independence , he first served under Jomo Kenyatta , the country 's founding president , before becoming deputy to Daniel Arap Moi , whose portrait was ordered to be hung in every building in the country during his 24 - year rule .
Despite billions in Western aid , the country was undermined by staggering government - orchestrated corruption .
Investigators believe Moi and his allies plundered more than £ 3 billion from Kenya 's coffers .
When Kibaki was elected , vowing to " clean up the country " , he proved himself a natural as Moi 's successor , promptly spending £ 12 million on 57 Mercedes limousines - more than the entire budget to fight malaria , the country 's biggest killer .
Kenya 's state airline has been used for drug - smuggling .
Five crew members , with links to politicians , were forced to quit after journalists uncovered the scandal .
Mombasa , on the Indian Ocean coast , has been identified as a key staging point in the route for drugs from Asia to the West .
The Kenyan media is also under assault .
Offices of a newspaper were attacked by masked gunmen carrying AK - 47s after they revealed how Armenian gangsters were being allowed by the government to smuggle drugs from Pakistan through Kenya .
The ministers , of course , were in line for a huge cut .
After denying any involvement in the raid , during which three journalists were arrested and are still being held without charge , the government later confessed that it had taken action to " safeguard " state security .
" If you rattle a snake , you must be prepared to be bitten by it , " said John Michuki , the minister for internal security .
Frustrated with the ever - widening gap between rich and poor , many Luos believe Kibaki has favoured Kikuyus .
Seen as shrewd and clever businessmen , the Kikuyus hold the prominent positions in the country .
They were also promoted by British military leaders who colonised Kenya .
Odinga , who claims he won December 's elections , was seen as the saviour of the Luos , promising to sweep away corruption .
Married with four children - a son is called Fidel after the Cuban revolutionary , while a daughter is called Winnie in honour of Nelson Mandela 's murderous ex-wife - Odinga was jailed twice in the 1990s for ' treason ' amid claims he plotted to overthrow Moi .
He fled to Norway and likes to boast that he is related to Barack Obama , the U.S. presidential candidate , whose father was a Luo.
Odinga has also been probed over dubious commercial deals .
Corruption now permeates all levels of life in Kenya .
One study showed each Kenyan offers a minimum of 16 bribes a month .
Police lurk on roads , stopping vehicles and letting them go in return for " kitu kidogo " - Swahili for " something small , " meaning large sums of money often change hands .
The scale of the problem has exasperated Britain .
Edward Clay , the British high commissioner to Kenya in 2004 , incensed the ruling elite by stating that the number of honest Kenyan ministers could be " fitted on the back of a postage stamp " .
The sad fact is that , Kibaki and Odinga are as bad as each other .
All they want is Kenya 's money .
Both are guilty of stirring racial hatred , hoping the victor can plunder the country 's remaining riches .
Isolated conflicts between the tribes are not new .
In 1997 , while a correspondent based in Africa , I witnessed Kikuyus , Luos and Kalenjins fighting each other in Nakuru , a town where 7,000 are this weekend hiding from the mob in a local church .
This is different .
The trouble has spread throughout the country .
Fear is widespread ; the killing apparently organised .
Neither the Kikuyu nor the Luo leader is prepared to back down .
With a temporary lull in the mayhem , diplomats were last night desperately trying to broker a deal .
But the machetes are out .
It is not too late to save Kenya , though there is little time .
The twin curses of Africa - corrupt leaders and tribal hatreds - are blighting this nation .
We must never forget the lessons of Rwanda - testament to the fact that , in Africa , unimaginable terror can swiftly become real .
It is an enduring tragedy for the Kenyan people - and millions of others throughout Africa - that they are constantly denied the leaders they so desperately deserve .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Google Inc is releasing a new application for Apple Inc ’s iPhone that combines the Web leader ’s services such as e-mail , search and calendar into a single interface .
Google , which aims to replicate its success in desktop computer
Web use on mobile phones , said on Wednesday the new application would make it easier to find , use and switch between its services on the iPhone .
The company is also working to develop new mobile technologies that are faster , easier to use , and available on more devices but Google did not give details .
Other efforts to expand in wireless include the announcement last week that Google would bid in an upcoming U.S. wireless airwaves auction to launch a wireless network , pitting it against established providers Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc. AT&T is the exclusive U.S. carrier for iPhone .
In a separate project , Google is also developing an operating system for mobile phones known as Android and based on open source Linux technology .
It has about 30 partners including carriers and phone makers supporting the project .
The iPhone , with its touch - screen and full Web browser , became the most talked about cell phone this year when it went on sale in the United States in late June .
It has since launched in countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom .
Google Maps and YouTube were among the first applications available on iPhone .
Apple said last month that it would allow outside developers to create software for iPhone and that it planned to make a developers kit available in February .
WARNING : The story and video below are unbelievably disturbing , on many , many levels .
But , it is just too important an issue to ignore .
John Ehrenfeld has written the following very upseting post , but one that is very important in understanding .
After you tuck your kids in tonight , say a prayer and give thanks that George Bush and his intrepid band of warriors are tirelessly fighting the war on terror and defending our homeland .
For thanks to their efforts , another dangerous terrorist no longer walks the streets among us .
For months the FBI clandestinely tracked the dangerous suspect , watching his every move and those of his friends .
They tapped his phone , intercepting and recording more than eight thousand calls .
They read his e-mails , they bagged his garbage , and they followed him everywhere he went .
Finally , in May of 2004 , the authorities felt they had enough and the suspect was indicted by a grand jury on federal charges of orchestrating an interstate campaign of terrorism and intimidation .
A conviction would mean a $ 1,250,000 in fines and 23 years in prison .
Warrants were issued , clips were loaded , and soon it was go time .
One cold , foggy morning a squad of hardened agents in black moved in on the terror suspect ’s hideout near San Francisco as an agency helicopter flew cover overhead .
Equipped with a battering ram and heavily armed , the agents easily secured the premises , the terror suspect was taken into custody and the country exhaled a collective sigh of relief .
Then the questions started .
Who was this terrorist that the government spent so many millions of dollars pursuing ?
In what country was he trained ?
How did he get here ?
What God does such an evil man worship ?
The average American would be shocked to know the answer .
It turns out that the suspect was not a terrorist at all .
His name was Kevin Kjonaas , a born in the USA , twenty - something , Catholic school grad who worked at a doggy daycare .
His crime ?
Being president of SHAC USA , Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty an animal rights group dedicated to shutting down Huntingdon Life Sciences , the New Jersey based British company who tests products on animals .
Every year HLS kills about 180,000 beagle dogs , mice , primates , rabbits , cats , farm animals like goats , chickens , sheep , guinea pigs , and rats to test a range of products from diet drugs , toothpastes , tanning lotions , food supplements like Splenda , adhesives and pesticides .
The animals in the testing process , endure weeks , months , and sometimes years of isolation , poisoning , and violently invasive experiments .
What were the specifics that warranted Kjonaas to be labeled a terrorist ?
Surely to be labeled a terrorist and to be facing most of his life in prison , he must have done something pretty evil .
Not even close .
Kjonaas , and six other animal rights activists were convicted on March 2 , 2006 , under the controversial Federal Animal Enterprise Protection Act .
The Act punishes anyone who “ physically disrupts ” an animal enterprise .
Kjonaas and his colleagues fought to stop the torturing and live dissection of animals , many of which were household pets .
He posted the home addresses and telephone numbers of Huntingdon employees on the group ’s website and sometimes Kjonaas helped organize protests in front of workers ’ homes .
When he could n’t make it to a demonstration , he posted other people ’s accounts of the event , seeing himself as a conduit for information .
The bottom - line , these activists are alleged to have operated a website that reported on and expressed ideological support for protest activity against Huntingdon .
That was it .
Support the SHAC 7 !
Their prosecution and incarceration is just another example of the Bush administration ’s relentless pursuit of their corporate agenda and their defense of those pursuing wealth at the expense of others .
Let no one be fooled , this is not fighting terrorism ; this is an assault on freedoms accorded all Americans by the constitution and a way to silence them using the fraudulent war on terror as an excuse .
Kevin Kjonaas is not only not a terrorist , he is an American hero and it ’s critical that all social and political progressives and activists support people like Kevin .
Please spread the word , contribute to his defense fund and take a moment to send him a letter in prison .
Huntingdon Life Sciences ( HLS ) is one of the world ’s largest animal - testing labs .
It operates two facilities in England and one in East Millstone , NJ .
Animals are forced to inhale and ingest excessive amounts of chemicals such as pesticides , coffee sweeteners , diet pills and genetically modified organisms ( GMO ’s ) , for weeks or months on end .
Then they are killed and dissected .
Products known to have been tested at HLS include Splenda , Viagra , Olestra , and Baycol .
Every day an average of 500 animals – including dogs , cats , mice , primates and rabbits – die inside HLS
HLS has been exposed in five undercover investigations revealing vicious animal cruelty and sloppy , fraudulent science .
Among other atrocities , workers were exposed punching 4 - month - old beagle puppies in the face , dissecting a live monkey , falsifying scientific data , and violating Good Laboratory Practice laws over 600 times .
Besides the fact that HLS tests frivolous products such as tanning lotion and weed killers , many M.D.s and scientists are speaking out against animal research as an outdated and dangerous form of pseudo - science ( driven primarily by tradition and financial incentives ) .
They argue that enormous physiological variations exist between species , making it impossible to extrapolate experimental results from one species ( i.e. a rat or a monkey ) to another ( i.e. humans ) .
They cite examples like Thalidomide , which was deemed “ safe ” in animal tests , but caused horrendous birth defects in humans .
Animal research wastes limited research funds , which could instead be directed towards more reliable forms of research such as cell cultures , non-invasive imaging , and epidemiological studies .
Jonas Salk , inventor of the Polio vaccine , stated that his efforts were held up for 20 years due to misleading results in studies of non-human primates .
HLS researchers themselves have been caught by investigators stating that their research is “ only reliable 5 - 25 % of the time . ”
What about the other 75 - 95 % of the time ?
When a worker was questioned as to whether an experimental procedure was done correctly he replied , “ Nope .
Not supposed to , never saw it , never did it , ca n’t prove it . ”
Vivisection in its truest form .
The SHAC7 are 6 activists and a corporation , Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA Inc. , that have been found guilty of multiple federal felonies for their alleged role in simply campaigning to close down the notorious animal testing lab , Huntingdon Life Sciences .
Five of the individuals are currently in federal prison ( the sixth , Darius Fullmer , has been released , after completing his one year sentence ) .
They are not accused of actually smashing windows , liberating animals or even attending demonstrations , rather reporting on and encouraging others to engage in legal demonstrations and supporting the ideology of direct action .
After being found guilty , they are beginning their appeal .
Unfortunately this appeal will be done from prison .
During their stay they need your support !
Finances , spreading the word about their case , books , letters or just a friendly ‘ hello ’ !
It just takes a few minutes to brighten the lives of political prisoners !

Medical correspondent , BBC News
If you want to look at obesity trends , then the US is the place to visit .
Because apart from a few Pacific islands , the US is the world leader in obesity .
It has the most obese population in the developed world , and the rate of increase is alarming .
So where to go in the US ?
You could choose any state .
But one stands out more than most .
Mississippi in the Deep South is proud of its hospitality and of being the home of Blues music .
But one thing it is not proud of is being the fattest state in the union .
The figures come from an annual survey by the Trust for America 's Health .
Figures probably worse
Three in 10 ( 30.6 % ) of adults in Mississippi are obese , more than in any other state .
Many of the poorest residents rely on small convenience stores where everything is pre-packed
Dig a little deeper and the real level of obesity is probably even higher .
The Trust figures are based on a huge phone survey across the US and rely on people owning up to their weight .
More reliable national data comes from the NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ) , where individuals are actually measured and weighed .
That shows that whereas in 1994 , 22.9 % of American adults were obese , it rose to 32.2 % in 2004 and 34.3 % in 2006 .
Now if that 's the average across America , it means the figure in Mississippi is probably far higher .
Some estimates suggest that by 2015 half the adult population in Mississippi will be obese .
So how does one state get to be the fattest in America ?
There are many factors .
Poverty key
The Trust for America 's Health survey found that adults in Mississippi are the least physically active of any state .
The climate in Mississippi does n't help according to the locals : hot , humid conditions for most of the year can make outdoor exercise unpleasant .
The overwhelming feeling I had in Mississippi was that this is a place where - for too many people - food is about convenience and quantity more than fresh ingredients and quality
I visited there in December when the weather was mild , but that still was n't enough to attract joggers onto the streets .
Poverty is a key factor .
Many obesity studies have shown that , in developed countries , the less educated you are , the more likely you are to become obese .
That is partly to do with food choices .
In the US the relative price of fresh fruit and vegetables has risen dramatically in the past 20 years , while the price of high calorie , high fat foods has fallen .
Mississippi does have supermarkets awash with healthy products , but these can be as much 40 m ( 64 km ) apart .
That means many of the poorest residents rely on small convenience stores where everything is pre-packed .
I bought a doughnut from a gas station for 50 cents - about 25 p .
That one doughnut contained 65 % of my daily recommended allowance of saturated fat - much higher than you 'd find in most UK snacks .
In restaurants it was often hard to find food that did n't have cheese on top .
The portions are huge and much of the food is deep fried .
What about home - cooked food ?
Interestingly , Mississippi has some of the richest , most fertile soil in the United States .
Yet I was told few people grow their own vegetables any more .
Soaring costs
Mississippi also has one of the highest and poorest black populations in the US .
There may be genetic factors that put African Americans at greater risk of obesity .
But social and living conditions are crucial .
If the US and Mississippi are to do anything about their obesity problem then they will have to do two things - tackle their addiction to fast food and get out of their cars and walk
The town of Belzoni , in the Mississippi Delta , calls itself the catfish capital of the world .
It 's a quiet poor town with a large black population .
The local clinic is run by father and son doctors Mack and Carlton Gorton .
Like many of his staff Dr Mack needs to lose a lot of weight .
A doctor in the town for more than 30 years , he told me how his patients are getting heavier each year , and obesity is affecting younger and younger children .
They now have some as young as 10 with obesity - induced type - 2 diabetes .
Scared of surgery
I went to the home of Shillese Hazelwood , a patient at the clinic .
She weighs nearly 500 pounds ( 220 kg ) .
She is so disabled by obesity that she can't work .
Shillese has been offered a stomach bypass but she is scared of the surgery .
She could n't explain why her weight had got to this extreme point , but suggested to me that being born premature may have been a factor .
She takes a range of tablets for diabetes , high blood pressure and other ailments .
Shillese lives with her brother and sister who are also obese and unable to work .
The cost of treating obesity - related health problems is soaring .
There are predictions that the state health - care budget could be bankrupted by obesity in a decade or so unless urgent preventative action is taken .
There are some positive steps being taken .
Some schools in the Mississippi Delta are running obesity prevention programmes .
Children are encouraged to eat breakfast so they stay more alert at school .
Deep fat fryers are being ripped out of the canteens , and healthy choices being included on the menu .
High calorie soft drinks have been banned from vending machines .
More physical activity is on the curriculum .
Action needed
Incredibly , some American schools have abolished recess - break - time - where children usually run around outside and play .
Now it is being re-introduced in the Delta region .
But the overwhelming feeling I had in Mississippi was that this is a place where - for too many people - food is about convenience and quantity more than fresh ingredients and quality .
If the US and Mississippi are to do anything about their obesity problem then they will have to do two things - tackle their addiction to fast food and get out of their cars and walk .
Neither seems remotely likely , and as a result most Americans will continue to get fatter .
AUSTIN , Minn . 
If you have to come down with a strange disease , this town of 23,000 on the wide - open prairie in southeastern Minnesota is a pretty good place to be .
The Mayo Clinic , famous for diagnosing exotic ailments , owns the local medical center and shares some staff with it .
Mayo itself is just 40 miles east in Rochester .
And when it comes to investigating mysterious outbreaks , Minnesota has one of the strongest health departments and best - equipped laboratories in the country .
And the disease that confronted doctors at the Austin Medical Center here last fall was strange indeed .
Three patients had the same highly unusual set of symptoms : fatigue , pain , weakness , numbness and tingling in the legs and feet .
The patients had something else in common , too : all worked at Quality Pork Processors , a local meatpacking plant .
The disorder seemed to involve nerve damage , but doctors had no idea what was causing it .
At the plant , nurses in the medical department had also begun to notice the same ominous pattern .
The three workers had complained to them of “ heavy legs , ” and the nurses had urged them to see doctors .
The nurses knew of a fourth case , too , and they feared that more workers would get sick , that a serious disease might be spreading through the plant .
The Führer Myth How Hitler Won Over the German People
There were still many Germans who were skeptical of Hitler when he became chancellor in 1933 .
But Führer propaganda and military success soon turned him into an idol .
The adulation helped make the Third Reich catastrophe possible .

Sure would be easier to use paper ballots .
FedEX is n't federal .
Could have shipped the damn thing UPS , or Greyhound and have the same thing happen .
That 's a serious security problem .
EPROMS are easy to copy .
And easy to replace .
There can be no trust with this system .
you could plug an eprom in there or any other chip that fit in the slot for the DIP riser .
Could be a damn digital delay loop chip .
You would n't know .
This gets back to what I said about " specially crafted chips "
Who 's to say an RF receiver is n't built into the logic as a logic bomb ( at the doping level . )
Drive by with a transmitter and boom the vote logic flips .
You could burn any hypothetical logic in that circuit , and the receiver could XOR the output .
To find it you 'd need to destructively reverse engineer it .
This is exactly why electronic tabulation should be banned globally .
Note that I did n't say electronic PRINTING .
If they want to PRINT a ballot electronically that 's one thing , we can see the output because it 's physically a piece of paper .
This gives the disabled a way to input information and yet leave a real paper ballot to be counted .
For this we'd only need a few crappy 80286's running DOS 5 , Word Perfect and printers .
This nightmare never ends .
Got to wonder who knows the logic inside now .

When Black Box Voting took the Diebold op - scam machine that we bought in for a checkup , we learned that the chip inside is basically plug and play reprogrammable from any laptop with a common clip - on device .
The significance of the lost chips is that someone can now examine or reverse engineer the upgrades to see if they can find new ways to defeat the new security problems .
Round and round we go .
My understanding is that it's not so significant from the standpoint of being able to replace chips --- they do n't need to be replaced to reprogram them , just clip - on the laptop connector and have your way with them .
But I 'm sure it is very nice for someone to learn the most recent defenses .
We 're heading the wrong direction when we keep trying to find better locks for all the windows , vents , doors , and crawl spaces .
It 's a lot easier just to let the public see what 's going in and out of the machine .
There are various ways to do this , but we need a shift in thinking .
Stop thinking " security " and start thinking " let the public capture evidence of what went into the machine to compare what came out of it . "
Sorry I could n't make it more complicated .

I could n't be more disgusted .
There 's been huge lack of attention to the voting problems of the past with these damn machines and the caging of voters around the country .
I thought that we would have had enough of it by the time the 2008 elections were held and that we'd have come up with a national standardized way of voting for the country .
As soon as the Dems won the Congress , all was forgotten as if everything was OK now .
When the next presidential election takes place and everything starts all over again with vote flipping , teerrorist plots on precincts during the counting stage ( Ohio ) and the skewed numbers that end up electing Tom Tancredo or something like that , will the politians once again wonder what the hell happened ?
No wonder we could n't convince Al Gore to run again .

Bev 's point is well taken .
You can never make these voting systems safe from fraud or manipulation .
No more than you can make any computer system safe .
Using computers to record and count votes is inherently insecure , and every computer security expert , and most of us that use computers , know that .
Worse , these systems were never designed with security in mind but were patched together over multiple election cycles as problems arose .
The latest Ohio reports confirm every other previous independent study of these systems .
What is disgusting , and criminal , is the fact that counties and states are willing to endanger the citizens ' right to elect our representatives in exchange for convenience .
It is certainly not to save money , for these systems have proven themselves to be financial blackholes .
The California election code mandates that the Secretary find that these voting systems are secure from fraud or manipulation prior to approving them .
Not one Secretary has made that finding , because no manufacturer has produced such a voting system .
Yet the onus for implementing and paying for the multiple mitigations in trying patch these defective products is placed upon the citizens of this state , while also endangering the conduct of elections and the citizens ' confidence in the outcomes .
It is time the law was followed by our elected officials .
No more compromises , no more convenience trumping security and accuracy , no more hiding from the citizens our electoral processes .
Election officials who continue to thwart public oversight by obfuscation , lawsuits , outright lies or distortions , are beneath contempt , for they are betrayers of the public trust and the law .
For those election officials who might read this the answer is rather simple .
If you have nothing to hide , quit hiding .

Update !
Due to some complaints from the nice gentlemen over at Reddit , I have rewritten parts of the article to clarify that I do not in any way promote sloppy use of cryptography .
By " casual cryptography " , I refer to the mindset of which this very basic introductory article is written .
Cryptography is serious business , and should not be taken lightly when implemented .
But a basic understanding of the concepts , if even so shallow , is valuable .
By writing this article , I wish to awaken your interest in security , so if you find yourself intrigued , just continue learning .
Casual cryptography for web developers
Cryptography is for most web developers like a vast and endless ocean of intimidating un-absorb - able information .
Which is sad , since cryptography is so useful and in many situations absolutely necessary .
I will not even try to explain why , since I consider developers that do n't care about the security , and integrity of their end users a lost case .
For the rest of you , who do care , read on .
Difficult stuff
To begin with , I will try to give you a hint of the more difficult aspects of cryptography .
I feel this is important for the general understanding of the kind of things that are possible to do with the mathematics involved .
But do n't worry !
It is just a brief overview .
Secret communication
To pass a secret message from a sender to a recipient , the message should be encrypted before it is sent , and decrypted in the other end .
The encryption / decryption is done using " keys " .
A key is basically a few more or less random bytes .
A single key
In the most simple case , a single key is used for both encryption and decryption .
This creates a problem , since the key has to be passed around to whomever might need to read the message .
That creates a greater risk of the wrong persons to get access to the key .
Public / private key pairs
By exploiting some weird mathematical properties of prime numbers , the concept of public / private key pairs was developed .
The idea is to use one key for the encryption of a message , and another key for the decryption .
Let 's call them A and B .
Those keys always comes in pairs , and are selected carefully to match each other .
When a message is encrypted with key A , the message can only be decrypted with key B , and vice - versa .
As the name implies , a public / private key pair is divided into a public key and a private key .
The private key is kept strictly secret by it's owner .
The public key , on the other hand , is openly shared with anyone who might want it .
When someone wants to send a secret message , they would therefore encrypt the message with the recipients public key .
The message is then only accessible with the private key from the same pair , which means only the intended recipient can decrypt it .
Pretty good authentication
Let 's say someone is sending a message where it is very important that the receiver can be sure it comes from the expected sender .
The sender can then " sign " the message by encrypting it with his private key .
The recipient will then decrypt the message using the senders public key .
If the decryption is successful , the recipient can be sure that the message was indeed encrypted with the senders private key , and therefore has not been altered after it was signed by the sender .
An interesting property of this kind of encryption is that a message can be encrypted with any number of keys and later decrypted , regardless of in which order the keys are applied .
This means a message can be both signed with the senders private key , and encrypted with the recipients public key , or signed by several different persons , or encrypted with multiple keys , or encrypted and signed in any imaginable combination .
Public / private key pairs are implemented by SSL which is commonly used by the HTTPS protocol , and by PGP .
Easy stuff
This article is intended for web developers , and as such we rarely have much use for public / private key pairs .
But do n't despair !
There is another class of much simpler one - way encryption you can start using today .
Digestion
The concept of digestion focuses on reducing any stream of data do a fixed size , unintelligible but deterministic " hash " .
There are a number of algorithms that do this .
Their goal is to produce a hash that is as unpredictable as possible , with regards to the original input .
In other words , given the hash , it should be as difficult as possible to find the original input .
With a perfect digestion algorithm there should be no other way to find the original input , than a simple brute force search , where you feed the digestion algorithm different input values until a matching hash is found .
With long enough hashes , that could easily take thousands of years even on the worlds fastest supercomputers .
Two commonly used algorithms :
md5
This is a very commonly used algorithm .
It has a number of flaws that makes it easier than it should be to calculate the original input .
sha1 A much better algorithm .
It is not flawless , but it is generally easy to find an implementation for your favorite programming language .
( I found one written in JavaScript ! )
It should be " good enough " , since it is used by SSH , SSL and PGP .
There are many other stronger digestion algorithms , so you might want to put some more research into this , to find out which ones are available for your current programming environment .
Just remember that even md5 is infinitely better than nothing .
Passwords
The hash of a password ( or any other data ) is usually thought of as the fingerprint of that password .
Any two distinct passwords should always give different hashes .
This is of course impossible to guarantee , since there might be more possible passwords than there are possible hash values .
However , finding two distinct passwords with the same hash is extremely unlikely .
To protect the integrity of your end users , it is wise to never store any passwords in plain text , but to digest them into a hash before they are stored .
When the user enter his password , it is therefore not compared to a password stored in the database , but digested into a hash and compared to the stored hash .
This means that if the hashes match , we can be sure the original passwords also match .
Plain wrong :
<? php if ( $ EnteredPassword == $ StoredPassword ) LogIn ( ) ; ?>
Slightly better :
<? php if ( sha1 ( $ EnteredPassword ) == $ StoredHash ) LogIn ( ) ; ?>
Since you no longer store any actual plain text passwords in you database , you can worry a bit less about what would happen to the passwords if your server gets hacked , or stolen or abducted by aliens .
But are the passwords really safe now ?
Not really .
Dictionary attacks
Let 's assume the unthinkable happens and your database gets stolen .
The thief do n't have the actual passwords in there , so he can't simply read the username / password and log in .
Let 's also assume that you used some super efficient hashing algorithm forcing the thief to test potential passwords one by one until a matching hash is found .
What does this mean ?
If all users had chosen strong random passwords , they would be fine , but this is not a fairy tale , so they have n't .
The passwords are full of " steve123 " , " password " and obscenities .
Trust me , I 've worked with passwords stored in plain text ( my client made me do it ) , and I 've seen it all .
This means that the thief can take a dictionary of common words , digest it word - by - word into a dictionary of hashes and start comparing it to the stolen hashes .
He will easily find lots of matches .
He might even just do a Google search for the hash and find it listed together with the original password .
Enter password salt
A password salt is a random string that is unique for each user .
It is stored in plain text , but instead of the password hash , we now store the hash of the password + the salt .
Much better :
<? php if ( sha1 ( $ EnteredPassword . $ StoredSalt ) == $ StoredHash ) LogIn ( ) ; ?>
We can still do the same kind of dictionary attack if we again digest each word in the dictionary , but this time together with the stored salt .
But a dictionary attack is now impractical , because the whole dictionary has to be digested individually for each single password + salt hash .
With n users that is n times more work .
The thief might be happy to wait for a few hours , but not 100 000 hours .
We cannot solve the problem completely , but we can easily cause the thief a lot of trouble , until it becomes impractical to use a dictionary .
When blackmailing or social engineering becomes more feasible than actually cracking the password , you can feel reasonably safe .

A Speech by George H. W. Bush , President of the U.S.A. Given to a joint session of the United States Congress , Washington D.C. on 11 September 1990 .
25654 Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the Persian Gulf Crisis and the Federal Budget Deficit George H. W. Bush 1990
Mr. President , Mr. Speaker , members of the Congress , distinguished guests , fellow Americans , thank very much for that warm welcome .
We gather tonight , witness to events in the Persian Gulf as significant as they are tragic .
In the early morning hours of August 2 , following negotiations and promises by Iraq 's dictator Saddam Hussein not to use force , a powerful Iraqi Army invaded its trusting and much weaker neighbor , Kuwait .
Within three days , 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia .
It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression .
At this moment , our brave servicemen and women stand watch in that distant desert and on distant seas , side by side with the forces of more than 20 other distant nations .
They are some of the finest men and women of the United States of America .
And they 're doing one terrific job .
These valiant Americans were ready at a moment 's notice to leave their spouses and their children , to serve on the front line halfway around the world .
They remind us who keeps America strong .
They do .
In the trying circumstances of the gulf , the morale of our servicemen and women is excellent .
In the face of danger , they are brave , they 're well - trained and dedicated .
A soldier , Pfc. Wade Merritt of Knoxville , Tennessee , now stationed in Saudi Arabia , wrote his parents of his worries , his love of family , and his hope for peace .
But Wade also wrote : " I am proud of my country and its firm stance against inhumane aggression .
I am proud of my Army and its men . . . . I am proud to serve my country . "
Let me just say , Wade , America is proud of you and is grateful to every soldier , sailor , Marine and airman serving the cause of peace in the Persian Gulf .
I also want to thank the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General [ Colin L. ]
Powell , the Chiefs , here tonight , our commander in the Persian Gulf , General H. Norman Schwarzkopf , and the men and women of the Department of Defense .
What a magnificent job you all are doing and thank you very very much .
I wish I could say their work is done .
But we all know it 's not .
So if ever there was a time to put country before self and patriotism before party , the time is now .
And let me thank all Americans , especially those in this chamber tonight , for your support for our armed forces and for their mission .
That support will be even more important in the days to come .
So tonight , I want to talk to you about what 's at stake — what we must do together to defend civilized values around the world and maintain our economic strength at home .
U.S. Objectives in Persian Gulf [ edit ]
Our objectives in the Persian Gulf are clear , our goals defined and familiar :
Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely , immediately and without condition .
Kuwait 's legitimate government must be restored .
The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured .
And American citizens abroad must be protected .
These goals are not ours alone .
They 've been endorsed by the U.N. Security Council five times in as many weeks .
Most countries share our concern for principle , and many have a stake in the stability of the Persian Gulf .
This is not , as Saddam Hussein would have it , the United States against Iraq .
It is Iraq against the world .
As you know , I 've just returned from a very productive meeting with Soviet President [ Mikhail ] Gorbachev , and I am pleased that we are working together to build a new relationship .
In Helsinki , our joint statement affirmed to the world our shared resolve to counter Iraq 's threat to peace .
Let me quote : " We are united in the belief that Iraq 's aggression must not be tolerated .
No peaceful international order is possible if larger states can devour their smaller neighbors . "
Clearly , no longer can a dictator count on East - West confrontation to stymie concerted United Nations action against aggression .
A new partnership of nations has begun , and we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment .
The crisis in the Persian Gulf , as grave as it is , also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation .
Out of these troubled times , our fifth objective — a new world order — can emerge :
A new era — freer from the threat of terror , stronger in the pursuit of justice and more secure in the quest for peace .
An era in which the nations of the world , east and west , north and south , can prosper and live in harmony .
A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace , while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor , and today that new world is struggling to be born .
A world quite different from the one we 've known .
A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle .
A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice .
A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak .
This is the vision that I shared with President Gorbachev in Helsinki .
He and the other leaders from Europe , the gulf and around the world understand that how we manage this crisis today could shape the future for generations to come .
' The Test We Face Is Great ' [ edit ]
The test we face is great and so are the stakes .
This is the first assault on the new world that we seek , the first test of our mettle .
Had we not responded to this first provocation with clarity of purpose ; if we do not continue to demonstrate our determination , it would be a signal to actual and potential despots around the world .
America and the world must defend common vital interests .
And we will .
America and the world must support the rule of law .
And we will .
America and the world must stand up to aggression .
And we will .
And one thing more : in the pursuit of these goals , America will not be intimidated .
Vital issues of principle are at stake .
Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face of the Earth .
We do not exaggerate .
Nor do we exaggerate when we say : Saddam Hussein will fail .
Vital economic interests are at risk as well .
Iraq itself controls some 10 percent of the world 's proven oil reserves .
Iraq plus Kuwait controls twice that .
An Iraq permitted to swallow Kuwait would have the economic and military power , as well as the arrogance , to intimidate and coerce its neighbors — neighbors who control the lion 's share of the world 's remaining oil reserves .
We cannot permit a resource so vital to be dominated by one so ruthless .
And we wo n't .
Recent events have surely proven that there is no substitute for American leadership .
In the face of tyranny , let no one doubt American credibility and reliability .
Let no one doubt our staying power .
We will stand by our friends .
One way or another , the leader of Iraq must learn this fundamental truth .
From the outset , acting hand - in - hand with others , we 've sought to fashion the broadest possible international response to Iraq 's aggression .
The level of world cooperation and condemnation of Iraq is unprecedented .
Armed forces from countries spanning four continents are there at the request of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to deter and , if need be , to defend against attack .
Muslims and non-Muslims , Arabs and non-Arabs , soldiers from many nations , stand shoulder - to - shoulder , resolute against Saddam Hussein 's ambitions .
And we can now point to five United Nations Security Council resolutions that condemn Iraq 's aggression .
They call for Iraq 's immediate and unconditional withdrawal , the restoration of Kuwait 's legitimate government and categorically reject Iraq 's cynical and self - serving attempt to annex Kuwait .
Finally , the United Nations has demanded the release of all foreign nationals held hostage against their will and in contravention of international law .
It 's a mockery of human decency to call these people " guests . "
They are hostages , and the whole world knows it .
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher , a dependable ally , said it all : " We do not bargain over hostages .
We will not stoop to the level of using human beings as bargaining [ chips ] .
Ever . "
' Our Hearts Go Out to the Hostages ' [ edit ]
Of course , of course , our hearts go out to the hostages , to their families .
But our policy cannot change .
And it will not change .
America and the world will not be blackmailed by this ruthless policy .
We 're now in sight of a United Nations that performs as envisioned by its founders .
We owe much to the outstanding leadership of Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar .
The United Nations is backing up its words with action .
The Security Council has imposed mandatory economic sanctions on Iraq , designed to force Iraq to relinquish the spoils of its illegal conquest .
The Security Council has also taken the decisive step of authorizing the use of all means necessary to ensure compliance with these sanctions .
Together with our friends and allies , ships of the United States Navy are today patrolling Mideast waters , and they 've already intercepted more than 700 ships to enforce the sanctions .
Three regional leaders I spoke with just yesterday told me that these sanctions are working .
Iraq is feeling the heat .
We continue to hope that Iraq 's leaders will recalculate just what their aggression has cost them .
They are cut off from world trade , unable to sell their oil , and only a tiny fraction of goods gets through .
The communique with President Gorbachev made mention of what happens when the embargo is so effective that children of Iraq literally need milk , or the sick truly need medicine .
Then , under strict international supervision that guarantees the proper destination , then — food will be permitted .
At home , the material cost of our leadership can be steep .
And that 's why Secretary of State [ James A. ] Baker and Treasury Secretary [ Nicholas F. ]
Brady have met with many world leaders to underscore that the burden of this collective effort must be shared .
We 're prepared to do our share and more to help carry that load ; we insist that others do their share as well .
The response of most of our friends and allies has been good .
To help defray costs , the leaders of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and the U.A.E. , the United Arab Emirates have pledged to provide our deployed troops with all the food and fuel they need .
Generous assistance will also be provided to stalwart front - line nations , such as Turkey and Egypt .
And I 'm also heartened to report that this international response extends to the neediest victims of this conflict — those refugees .
For our part , we have contributed $ 28 million for relief efforts .
This is but a portion of what is needed .
I commend , in particular , Saudi Arabia , Japan and several European nations who have joined us in this purely humanitarian effort .
' Let No One Even Contemplate Profiteering ' [ edit ]
There 's an energy - related cost to be borne as well .
Oil - producing nations are already replacing lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti output .
More than half of what was lost has been made up , and we 're getting superb cooperation .
If producers , including the United States , continue steps to expand oil and gas production , we can stabilize prices and guarantee against hardship .
Additionally , we and several of our allies always have the option to extract oil from our strategic petroleum reserves , if conditions warrant .
As I 've pointed out before , conservation efforts are essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible .
We must then take advantage of our energy sources across the board : coal , natural gas , hydro and nuclear .
Our failure , our failure to do these things has made us more dependent on foreign oil than ever before .
And finally , let no one even contemplate profiteering from this crisis .
We will not have it .
I cannot predict just how long it'll take to convince Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait .
Sanctions will take time to have their full intended effect .
We will continue to review all options with our allies , but let it be clear :
We will not let this aggression stand .
Our interest , our involvement in the gulf , is not transitory .
It pre-dated Saddam Hussein 's aggression and will survive it .
Long after all our troops come home , and we all hope it 's soon , very soon , there will be a lasting role for the United States in assisting the nations of the Persian Gulf .
Our role then is to deter future aggression .
Our role is to help our friends in their own self - defense .
And something else : to curb the proliferation of chemical , biological , ballistic missile and , above all , nuclear technologies .
And let me also make clear that the United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people .
Our quarrel is with Iraq 's dictator and with his aggression .
Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait .
And that 's not a threat .
It 's not a boast .
That 's just the way it 's going to be .
Addressing the Federal Deficit [ edit ]
Our ability to function effectively as a great power abroad depends on how we conduct ourselves at home .
Our economy , our armed forces , our energy dependence and our cohesion all determine whether we can help our friends and stand up to our foes .
For America to lead , America must remain strong and vital .
Our world leadership and domestic strength are mutual and reinforcing ; a woven piece , as strongly bound as Old Glory .
To revitalize our leadership — our leadership capacity , we must address our budget deficit — not after Election Day , or next year , but now .
Higher oil prices slow our growth , and higher defense costs would only make our fiscal deficit problem worse .
That deficit was already greater than it should have been — a projected $ 232 billion for the coming year .
It must — it will — be reduced .
To my friends in Congress , together we must act this very month — before the next fiscal year begins on October 1 — to get America 's economic house in order .
The Gulf situation helps us realize we are more economically vulnerable than we ever should be .
Americans must never again enter any crisis — economic or military — with an excessive dependence on foreign oil and an excessive burden of federal debt .
Most Americans are sick and tired of endless battles in the Congress and between the branches over budget matters .
And it 's high time we pulled together — and get the job done right .
It is up to us to straighten this out .
Four - Part Budget Agenda [ edit ]
The job has four basic parts .
First : The Congress should , this month , within a budget agreement , enact growth - oriented tax measures — to help avoid recession in the short term ; and to increase savings , investment , productivity and competitiveness for the longer term .
These measures include extending incentives for research and experimentation ; expanding the use of IRAs for new homeowners ; establishing tax - deferred family savings accounts ; creating incentives for the creation of enterprise zones and initiatives to encourage more domestic drilling ; and , yes , reducing the tax rate on capital gains .
And second : The Congress should , this month , enact a prudent multi- year defense program — one that reflects not only the improvement in East - West relations , but our broader responsibilities to deal with the continuing risks of outlaw action and regional conflict .
Even with our obligations in the gulf , a sound defense budget can have some reduction in real terms , and we are prepared to accept that .
But to go beyond such levels , where cutting defense would threaten our vital margin of safety , is something I will never accept .
The world is still dangerous , and surely that is now clear .
Stability is not secure .
American interests are far - reaching .
Interdependence has increased .
The consequences of regional instability can be global .
This is no time to risk America 's capacity to protect her vital interests .
Third :
The Congress should , this month , enact measures to increase domestic energy production and energy conservation — in order to reduce dependence on foreign oil .
These measure should include my proposals to increase incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration , fuel - switching , and to accelerate the development of Alaskan energy resources , without damage to wildlife .
As you know , when the oil embargo was imposed in the early 1970s , the United States imported almost 6 million barrels of oil per day .
This year , before the Iraqi invasion , U.S. imports had risen to nearly 8 million barrels per day .
We had moved in the wrong direction .
Now we must act to correct that trend .
Fourth : The Congress should , this month , enact a five - year program to reduce the projected debt and deficits by $ 500 billion — that is , by half a trillion dollars .
If , with the Congress , we can develop a satisfactory program by the end of the month , we can avoid the axe of " sequester " — deep across - the - board cuts that would threaten our military capacity and risk substantial domestic disruption .
Requirements of Fiscal Agreement [ edit ]
I want to be able to tell the American people we have truly solved the deficit problem .
For me to do that , a budget agreement must meet these tests :
It must include the measures I 've recommended to increase economic growth and reduce dependence on foreign oil .
It must be fair .
All should contribute , but the burden should not be excessive for any one group of programs or people .
It must address the growth of government 's hidden liabilities .
It must reform the budget process , and further , it must be real .
I urge Congress to provide a comprehensive five - year deficit reduction program to me as a complete legislative package — with measures to assure that it can be fully enforced .
America is tired of phony deficit reduction , or promise - now , save - later plans .
Enough is enough .
It is time for a program that is credible and real .
Finally , to the extent that the deficit - reduction program includes new revenue measures , it must avoid any measure that would threaten economic growth or turn us back toward the days of punishing income tax rates .
That is one path we should not head down again .
I have been pleased with recent progress , although it has not always seemed so smooth .
But now it is time to produce .
I hope we can work out a responsible plan .
But with or without agreement from the budget summit , I ask both houses of the Congress to allow a straight up - or - down vote on a complete $ 500 billion deficit - reduction package — not later than September 28 .
If the Congress can not get me a budget , then Americans will have to face a tough , mandated sequester .
I am hopeful — in fact , I am confident — the Congress will do what it should .
And I can assure you that we in the executive branch will do our part .
In the final analysis , our ability to meet our responsibilities abroad depends upon political will and consensus at home .
It 's never easy in democracies , for we govern only with the consent of the governed .
And although free people in a free society are bound to have their differences , Americans traditionally come together in times of adversity and challenge .
Once again , Americans have stepped forward to share a tearful goodbye with their families before leaving for a strange and distant shore .
At this very moment , they serve together with Arabs , Europeans , Asians and Africans in defense of principle and the dream of a new world order .
That is why they sweat and toil in the sand and the heat and the sun .
If they can come together under such adversity ; if old adversaries like the Soviet Union and the United States can work in common cause , then surely we who are so fortunate to be in this great chamber — Democrats , Republicans , liberals , conservatives — can come together to fulfill our responsibilities here .
Thank you .
Good night .
And God bless the United States of America .
Parents ordered to court for kids ' shots UPPER MARLBORO , Md.  Scores of grumbling parents facing a threat of jail lined up at a courthouse Saturday to either prove that their school - age kids already had their required vaccinations or see that the youngsters submitted to the needle .
The get - tough policy in the Washington suburbs of Prince George 's County was one of the strongest efforts made by any U.S. school system to ensure its youngsters receive their required immunizations .
Two months into the school year , school officials realized that more than 2,000 students in the county still did n't have the vaccinations they were supposed to have before attending class .
So Circuit Court Judge C. Philip Nichols ordered parents in a letter to appear at the courthouse Saturday and either get their children vaccinated on the spot or risk up to 10 days in jail .
They could also provide proof of vaccination or an explanation why their kids did n't have them .
By about 8:30 a.m. , the line of parents stretched outside the courthouse in the county on the east side of Washington .
Many of them complained that their children already were properly immunized but the school system had misplaced the records .
They said efforts to get the paperwork straightened out had been futile .
" It was very intimidating , " Territa Wooden of Largo said of the letter .
She said she presented the paperwork at the courthouse Saturday and resolved the matter .
" I could be home asleep .
My son had his shots , " said Veinell Dickens of Upper Marlboro , who also blamed errant paperwork .
Aloma Martin of Fort Washington brought her children , Delontay and Taron , in 10th and 6th grade , for their hepatitis shots .
She said she had been trying to get the vaccinations for more than a month , since the school system sent a warning letter .
She had an appointment for Monday , but came to the courthouse to be safe .
" It was very heavy handed , " she said of the county 's action .
" From that letter , it sounded like they were going to start putting us in jail . "
School officials deemed the court action a success .
School system spokesman John
White said the number of children lacking vaccinations dropped from 2,300 at the time the judge sent the letter to about 1,100 Friday .
After Saturday 's session , 172 more students were brought into compliance , including 101 students who received vaccinations at the courthouse and 71 whose records were updated .
That still left more than 900 students out of compliance with vaccination requirements ,
White said .
" Obviously , we still have some more work to do , " he said .
Any children who still lack immunizations could be expelled .
Their parents could then be brought up on truancy charges , which can result in a 10 - day jail sentence for a first offense and 30 days for a second .
Prince George 's State 's Attorney Glenn
Ivey could n't say Saturday whether he would prosecute parents who fail to comply .
" We have to sit down with school and health services , " he said .
" We have n't ruled anything out .
We need to figure out where we stand . "
White said the school system , with about 132,000 students , has been trying for two years to get parents to comply with state law .
That law allows children to skip vaccines if they have a medical or religious exemption .
It was unclear how many medical or religious exemptions were involved .
Maryland , like all states , requires children to be immunized against several childhood illnesses including polio , mumps and measles .
In recent years , it also has required that students up to high school age be vaccinated against hepatitis B and chicken pox .
Nichols said nobody actually came before him Saturday , but he was there if any parent asked to see him .
The judge noted the unhappy looks of some of the kids in line waiting for vaccinations .
" It 's cute .
It looks like their parents are dragging them to church , " Nichols said .
Several organizations opposed to mass vaccinations demonstrated outside the courthouse .
While the medical consensus is that vaccines are safe and effective , some people blame immunizations for a rise in autism and other medical problems .
" People should have a choice " in getting their children immunized , said Charles Frohman , representing a physicians ' group opposed to vaccines .

iptables is the packet filtering technology that ’s built into the 2.4 Linux kernel .
It ’s what allows one to do firewalling , nating , and other cool stuff to packets from within Linux .
Actually , that ’s not quite right — iptables is just the command used to control netfilter , which is the real underlying technology .
We ’ll just call it iptables though , since that ’s how the whole system is usually referred to .
Stateful Packet Inspection
First off , many have heard a number of different definitions of “ stateful ” firewalls and / or “ SPI ” protection , and I think it ’s worth the time to take a stab at clearing up the ambiguity .
“ Stateful Inspection ” actually gives its true definition away in its name ; it ’s nothing more and nothing less than attempting to ensure that traffic moving through the firewall is legitimate by determining whether or not it ’s part of ( or related to ) an existing , accepted connection .
When you hear that this firewall or that firewall does “ SPI ” , it could really mean anything ; it ’s a big buzzword right now , so every company out there wants to add it to their sales pitch .
Remember , the definition is broad , so there can be ( and is ) a big difference between so - called SPI protection on a $ 50 SOHO router as compared to what ’s offered on something like Check Point FW - 1 .
The former could do a couple TCP - flag checks and call it SPI , while the latter does a full battery of tests .
Just keep that in mind ; not all SPI is created equal .
Netfilter Basics
iptables is made up of some basic structures , as seen below :
TABLES
CHAINS
TARGETS
TABLES
TABLES are the major pieces of the packet processing system , and they consist of FILTER , NAT , and MANGLE .
FILTER is used for the standard processing of packets , and it ’s the default table if none other is specified .
NAT is used to rewrite the source and / or destination of packets and / or track connections .
MANGLE is used to otherwise modify packets , i.e. modifying various portions of a TCP header , etc .
CHAINS
CHAINS are then associated with each table .
Chains are lists of rules within a table , and they are associated with “ hook points ” on the system , i.e. places where you can intercept traffic and take action .
Here are the default table / chain combinations :
FILTER : Input , Output , Forward
NAT : Prerouting , Postrouting , Output
MANGLE : Prerouting , Postrouting , Input , Output , Forward
And here ’s when the different chains do their thing :
PREROUTING : Immediately after being received by an interface .
Immediately after being received by an interface .
POSTROUTING : Right before leaving an interface .
Right before leaving an interface .
INPUT : Right before being handed to a local process .
Right before being handed to a local process .
OUTPUT : Right after being created by a local process .
Right after being created by a local process .
FORWARD : For any packets coming in one interface and leaving out another .
In other words , if you want to process packets as they leave your system , but without doing any NAT or MANGLE ( ing ) , you ’ll look to the OUTPUT chain within the FILTER table .
If you want to process packets coming from the outside destined for your local machine , you ’ll want to use the same FILTER table , but the INPUT chain .
See the image below for a visual representation of this .
TARGETS
TARGETS determine what will happen to a packet within a chain if a match is found with one of its rules .
A two most common ones are DROP and ACCEPT .
So if you want to drop a packet on the floor , you write a rule that matches the particular traffic and then jump to the DROP target .
Conversely , if you want to allow something , you jump to the ACCEPT target — simple enough .
How Packets Move
Packets move through netfilter by traversing chains .
Each non-empty chain has a list of rules in it , which packets are checked against one after another .
If a match is found , the packet is processed .
If no match is found , the default action is taken .
The default action for a chain is also called its policy .
By default , chain policies are to jump to the ACCEPT target , but this can be set to DROP if so desired ( I suggest it ) .
Digging In
So , with that inadequate short intro out of the way , let ’s dig into it with some diagrams and a couple of cookbook - style examples :
Figure 1 . How Traffic Moves Through Netfilter
Allow Outgoing ( Stateful ) Web Browsing
iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p TCP –dport 80 -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT - i eth0 -p TCP -m state –state ESTABLISHED , RELATED –sport 80 -j ACCEPT
In the first rule , we ’re simply adding ( appending ) a rule to the OUTPUT chain for protocol TCP and destination port 80 to be allowed .
We are also specifying that the incoming packets will need to exit the machine over interface eth0 ( - o is for “ output ” ) in order to trigger this rule ; this interface designation is important when you start dealing with machines with multiple interfaces .
You can also add additional checks beyond those seen here , such as what source ports are allowed , etc. , but we ’ll keep it simple for the examples here .
The second rule allows the web traffic to come back ( an important part of browsing ) .
Notice the “ state ” stuff ; that ’s what makes netfilter a “ stateful ” firewalling technology .
Packets are not able to move through this rule and get back to the client unless they were created via the rule above it , i.e. they have to be part of an established or related connection , and be coming from a source port of 80 — which is usually a web server .
Again , you can add more checks here , but you get the point .
Allowing Outgoing Pings
iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 - p icmp –icmp - type echo - request -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT - i eth0 -p icmp –icmp - type echo- reply -j ACCEPT
Here , we ’re appending ( - A ) to the output ( OUTPUT ) chain , using the icmp ( - p ) protocol , of type echo - request ( –icmp - type echo request ) , and jumping ( - j ) to the ACCEPT target ( which means ACCEPT it , strangely enough ) .
That ’s for the outgoing piece .
For the return packet , we append to the INPUT chain instead of OUTPUT , and allow echo - reply instead of echo - request .
This , of course , means that incoming echo - requests to your box will be dropped , as will outgoing replies .
“ Passing Ports ” Into A NATd Network
One of the most commonly - used functions of firewall devices is “ passing ports ” inside to other private , hidden machines on your network running services such as web and mail .
In corporate environments this is out of necessity , and at home it ’s often for gaming or in a hobbyist context .
Either way , here ’s how you do it with Netfilter / IPTABLES :
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING - i eth0 - p tcp -d 1.2.3.4 –dport 25 -j DNAT –to 192.168.0.2:25
If we break this down , we see that we ’re actually using the nat table here rather than not specifying one .
Remember , if nothing is mentioned as far as tables are concerned , you ’re using the filter table by default .
So in this case we ’re using the nat table and appending a rule to the PREROUTING chain .
If you recall from the diagram above , the PREROUTING chain takes effect right after being received by an interface from the outside .
This is where DNAT occurs .
This means that destination translation happens before routing , which is good to know .
So , we then see that the rule will apply to the TCP protocol for all packets destined for port 25 on the public IP .
From there , we jump to the DNAT target ( Destination NAT ) , and “ jump to ” ( –to ) our internal IP on port 25 .
Notice that the syntax of the internal destination is IP : PORT .
Ah , but this is only half of the work .
If you have any experience with corporate - class firewalls such as Check Point or Astaro , you know there are two parts to enabling connectivity like this — the NAT portion , and the rules portion .
Below is what we need to get the traffic through the firewall :
iptables -A FORWARD - i eth0 -o eth1 - p tcp –dport 25 -d 192.168.0.2 -j ACCEPT
In other words , if you just NAT the traffic , it ’s not ever going to make it through your firewall ; you have to pass it through the rulebase as well .
Notice that we ’re accepting the packets in from the first interface , and allowing them out the second .
Finally , we ’re specifying that only traffic to destination port ( –dport ) 25 ( TCP ) is allowed — which matches our NAT rule .
The key here is that you need two things in order to pass traffic inside to your hidden servers — NAT and rules .
Conclusion
Ok , so that about does it for now .
I have obviously only scratched the surface here , but hopefully I ’ve covered the very basics in a way that can help someone .
I intend to keep adding to this as time goes on , both for the sake of being thorough and to clarify things as needed .
If , however , I have missed something major , or made some sort of error , do feel free to contact me and set me straight .

Last night I got an email from a company called " ApplyYourself " informing me that one of my former students was applying to grad school , and could I go to their site and fill in a letter of reference for her ?
Apply Yourself appears to be a web - based reference - letter - management system that contracts with a number of universities , which seems like a sensible enough idea —
I 've been on all three sides of the reference - letter headache ( writing them , evaluating them , and soliciting them ) and that 's definitely a part of the process that could stand to have some automation .
And ApplyYourself did a perfectly fine job of managing this process , except for one gigantic turd in the punchbowl : in order to leave a letter of recommendation for my former student , I had to enter into an end user license agreement in which I waived a bunch of my rights :
Limitation of Liability .
In no event will ApplyYourself or other third parties mentioned at this site be liable for any damages whatsoever ( including , without limitation , those resulting from lost profits , lost data or business interruption ) arising out of the use , inability to use , or the results of use of this site , any web sites linked to this site , or the materials or information contained at any or all such sites .
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages , so the above limitation and exclusion may not apply to you .
This is the standard ridiculous EULA junk ( we can be as negligent as we want and you can't ever sue us , no matter what ) , so after I sent in the letter for my student , I immediately fired off an email to the address listed , explaining that I did n't agree to this non-negotiated " agreement " and closing with my standard anti-EULA :
READ CAREFULLY .
By reading this email , you agree , on behalf of your employer , to release me from all obligations and waivers arising from any and all NON - NEGOTIATED agreements , licenses , terms - of - service , shrinkwrap , clickwrap , browsewrap , confidentiality , non-disclosure , non-compete and acceptable use policies ( " BOGUS AGREEMENTS " ) that I have entered into with your employer , its partners , licensors , agents and assigns , in perpetuity , without prejudice to my ongoing rights and privileges .
You further represent that you have the authority to release me from any BOGUS AGREEMENTS on behalf of your employer .
Since then , I 've been having an hilarious , robotic exchange with some nameless person(s ) at the other end of the email bank , where they keep sending me this :
Thanks for your message .
I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced .
We are not able to release you from the term and conditions via this email .
The purpose of the Terms is to protect you , the institution and ApplyYourself ( as their partner ) in the event a user inappropriately uses the Recommendation form .
If you are using the form as intended , none of the offending items are relevant .
Many websites that collect important information have these types of statements primarily as a protection of their users , such as yourself .
Our intent is not to make you uncomfortable and we tried to reflect that in the language that is being used .
And I keep answering back , " No , you do n't understand — you 've already released me , just by reading my email !
And that 's also for your protection as well as mine , OK ? "
I know it 's tilting at windmills , but this is insanity .
It 's a matter of principle .
You should n't have to agree to three screens ' worth of legal junk in order to send a letter of reference to a university .

A researcher working for the National Institute of Standards and Technology has demonstrated an optical technique for identifying tiny amounts of a broad range of molecules in the breath , potentially enabling a fast , low - cost screening tool for disease .
In this approach , NIST researchers analyze human breath with " frequency combs , " which are generated by a laser specially designed to produce a series of very short , equally spaced pulses of light .
Each pulse may be only a few millionth billionths of a second long .
The laser generates light as a series of very narrow frequency peaks equally spaced , like the teeth of a comb , across a broad spectrum .
The tool sounds like yet another example of a Star Trek - like device making its reality debut .
On Star Trek , Tricorders had multiple functions but the medical version used by Bones McCoy could scan a body and help diagnose and heal injured or sick patients .
To test frequency combs , student volunteers exhaled breath that entered an optical cavity where it was " combed " by the light pulses .
By detecting which colors of light were absorbed and in what amounts - essentially looking for light absorbed near the " teeth " of the comb - the researchers could detect specific molecules and their concentrations , NIST said .
According to researchers over 1000 different compounds contained in human breath have already been identified .
For example , a student smoker who participated in the experiment had a level of carbon monoxide that was five times greater than a nonsmoker in the experiment , NIST said .
The optical comb approach allows the researchers to simultaneously analyze a very broad spectrum , covering many possible molecular compounds , with high precision , frequency resolution and sensitivity .
The technique is in early phases , and would require clinical trials before it could become available at a doctor 's office , but it could lead to one of the first widespread applications of frequency combs , NIST said in a release .
" For example , nitric oxide can indicate asthma , but it also appears in breath with many other lung diseases , including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis .
However , if we simultaneously monitor nitric oxide , carbon monoxide , hydro - peroxide , nitrites , nitrates , pentane , and ethane , all important biomarkers for asthma , we can be much more certain for a definitive diagnosis of this important disease , " said Jun Ye , a physicist at JILA who cowrote the research .
JILA is a joint institute of the NIST and the University of Colorado at Boulder .
Existing methods for detecting trace amounts of molecules from the breath are either bulky , slow , limited to specific molecules , unable to distinguish very well between multiple compounds or inaccurate at measuring their concentrations , NIST said .

Norway 's " Doomsday Vault " will open tomorrow , just in time to safeguard our biodiversity against the apocalypse .
Carved into the permafrost of a remote Arctic mountain , about 620 miles from the North Pole , the vault has been built to withstand nuclear missiles or a plane crash on top of it , but it 's also far enough above sea level that it wo n't be flooded by melting icecaps .

The vault will hold up to 4.5 million batches of seeds for the world 's main food crops , allowing humanity to re-establish agriculture if our main food plants disappear due to a catastrophe .
Already , " gene vaults " from Iraq and Afghanistan were destroyed due to the wars in those countries .

The popular market is always crowded
Attack aftermath
" The al - Qaeda terrorists and criminals are proud of this method , " Brig Qassem Ata al - Moussawi told the BBC .
The death toll in Friday morning 's attacks at two animal markets was the highest in months in Baghdad .
Correspondents say a fragile sense of normality had returned to the capital following an influx of US troops .
Security has improved significantly since the US implemented its troop " surge " in the second half of 2007 .
A ceasefire announced in August by the Mehdi Army militia of Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr , as well as the emergence of local Sunni militia armed by the US military that took on al - Qaeda in Iraq , have also contributed to the sense of security .
Figures released by Iraqi ministries on Friday suggested that the number of civilians and security forces killed across Iraq in January - 541 - was the lowest monthly total for nearly two years .
Confidence shattered
But that renewed confidence could be shattered by Friday 's deadly bombings , the worst to hit the Iraqi capital since three car bombs killed 80 people last 1 August .
The operation was carried out by two booby - trapped mentally disabled women
Brig Qassem Ata al - Moussawi
Iraqi security forces spokesman
The blasts came shortly before the call to Friday prayers when many Iraqis were out shopping or meeting friends .
The first device was detonated by a female suicide bomber at around 1020 local time ( 0720 GMT ) in the popular Ghazil animal market , killing at least 46 people and injuring a further 80 .
A popular spectacle for Baghdadis , the animal market only opens on Fridays and regularly draws large crowds , despite having been targeted by bombers twice in 2007 .
Just 20 minutes after the first explosion , a second bomb tore through another crowded market in the Jadida area of east Baghdad , killing at least 27 people and injuring 67 .
PREVIOUS GHAZIL MARKET BOMBS June 2006 - Four killed by two bombs left in bags Dec 2006 - Three killed in mortar attack 26 Jan 2007 - 15 killed by bomb hidden in box of birds 23 Nov 2007 - 13 killed in attack blamed on Iranian - backed Shia militants

Iraqi security forces spokesman Brig Moussawi told the BBC : " The operation was carried out by two booby - trapped mentally disabled women .
[ The bombs ] were detonated remotely .
" Forensic and bomb squad experts as well as the people and traders of al - Shorja area of the carpet market have confirmed that the woman who was blown - up there today was often in the area and was mentally disabled ...
" In the New Baghdad area the shop owners and customers of the pet market confirmed that the woman who was blown - up there was mentally disabled as well . "
The US ambassador to Iraq , Ryan Crocker , said al - Qaeda had found a " different , deadly " technique .
" There is nothing they wo n't do if they think it will work in creating carnage and the political fallout that comes from that , " he said .
Police and medical officials piled the dead and injured into wheelbarrows , cars and the back of pick - up trucks to be transported to five hospitals across the city .
An official at the capital 's Kindi hospital said at least 30 bodies had been received .
" We have a disaster here , " he said .
" There are too many bodies to count . "
There !
I said it , and I feel better already .
I have waited a really long time to do this , and I am happy that Bill Kristol finally gave me an opportunity with his column in today 's New York Times .
More on what he wrote below , but first let me explain why I take great pleasure in pointing out his boo - boo .
No , it 's not because we probably disagree on everything nowadays .
It 's that he was my dreaded instructor long ago in two of the classes that I took as a Harvard undergraduate .
He was a doctoral student at the time in the Government Department ( no relation to the HKS ) , and I was a freshman and sophomore in the college .
The first course was Harvey Mansfield 's political theory course ( for which Kristol served as teaching fellow ) , and the second was a sophomore tutorial ( a required course for government concentrators ) .
In each course , we had to write short papers once every couple of weeks .
I can say that my performance on these papers , which Kristol graded , was fairly consistent .
The essay on Machiavelli ?
Here is a C - .
The essay on the Federalist Papers ?
Here is a C. John Stuart Mill ?
Well , how about , yes you guessed it , another C .
You can say that Kristol did his best to discourage me from pursuing a career in political science ...
I remember well the very first time I saw him .
It was the first meeting of the discussion session in Mansfield 's course , and I had been assigned to Kristol 's section .
He walked into the classroom and his first words were : " Hello , my name is Mr. Kristol . "
To underscore the point that he was that , and not Bill or any other friendly appellations by which we students may have chosen to address him , he went to the board and wrote " Mr. Kristol . "
I may have been a poorly adjusted Turk in my first year in the U.S. , but this still struck me as odd .
He was certainly the only graduate student I met in my four years as an undergraduate who insisted on being called by his last name .
Well , Mr. Kristol 's column today takes aim at Barack ( and Michelle ) Obama , and does so quite unfairly in my view .
But I will leave a detailed exegesis of his argument to others .
What caught my attention was this passage :
Michelle Obama , in the course of a stump speech , remarked , “ For the first time in my adult lifetime , I ’m really proud of my country .
And not just because Barack has done well , but because I think people are hungry for change . ”
Michelle Obama ’s adult life goes back to the mid-1980s .
Can it really be the case that nothing the U.S. achieved since then has made her proud ?
Apparently .
For , as she said later in the same appearance : “ Life for regular folks has gotten worse over the course of my lifetime , through Republican and Democratic administrations .
It has n’t gotten much better . ”
Now in almost every empirical respect , American lives have in fact gotten better over the last quarter - century .
Really ?
Look at the chart below , which comes from Frank Levy , my authority on such matters .
It shows the median compensation since 1980 of different groups of prime - aged men , alongside productivity .
People like me with graduate degrees have done great .
But the median compensation ( that includes fringe benefits , by the way ) of high school graduate men has declined by about 10 percent since 1980 !
Mr. Kristol : that means that for a high - school graduate , the odds that his compensation would have fallen by more than 10 % is 50 - 50 .
Note that even college graduates have not seen any income gains since around 2000 .
The increase in labor productivity has outpaced the earnings of all these groups , including that of workers with graduate degrees .
( The outcomes for women have been much better . )
What is special about the last quarter century , as Frank Levy makes clear , is that it followed a period when productivity increases were broadly shared by different groups in society .
That is no longer the case , and some groups have definitely been left worse off -- not just in relative but also in absolute terms .
So statistics aside , who do you think has a better sense of what has happened to " regular folk " since 1980 ?
Michelle Obama or Mr. Kristol ?

Of course , Dr. Marks said , medical conditions can lead to cramps , including narrowed blood vessels , usually from atherosclerosis , or compression of a nerve , as happens in spinal stenosis .
Cramps also can arise from hypothyroidism .
And they can be a side effect of medications like diuretics , used to lower blood pressure , which can lead to a potassium deficiency that can cause cramps .
But , he and others said , those conditions do not explain the vast majority of cramps .
“ You are left with the fact that cramping usually occurs in healthy people without any underlying disease , ” Dr. Marks said .
There are three leading hypotheses about how to treat cramps and how to prevent them .
There ’s the dehydration proposal : you just need more fluid .
But , Dr. Schwellnus said , he studied athletes who cramped and found that they were no more dehydrated before or after a race than those who did not have cramps .
Then there ’s the electrolyte hypothesis : what you really need is sodium and potassium .
Michael F. Bergeron , who directs the environmental physiology laboratory at the Medical College of Georgia , said the electrolyte hypothesis applies to a specific type of cramp that is related to excessive sweating .
It occurs , he said , when the fluid that bathes the connection between muscle and nerve is depleted of sodium and potassium , which was lost through sweat .
The nerve then becomes hypersensitive , Dr. Bergeron said .
“ Usually you feel little twitches first , ” he explained .
“ They last for 20 to 30 minutes and if you do n’t do anything you can be in full - blown cramps . ”
Those cramps , he continued can move from place to place on your body , from one leg to the next , to your arms , stomach , even your fingers or your face .
The solution , Dr. Bergeron said , is to drink salty fluids like Gatorade ( the company sponsors his research ) .
He said he had prevented cramps in tennis players this way .
The 8 Worst Sitcom Character Names Dec. 3 by OMGLists Team
Today 's list comes from reader '' Floyd Gondoli ' ' .
Want to contribute to OMGLists ?
Then drop us a line , and your list idea , and we 'll make magic !
Before they died in the wake of reality shows and cop dramas , comedies ruled the TV landscape .
In fact , there was such a surplus of sitcoms in the eighties and nineties that writers would do anything to get their show notices , including giving their characters nonsensical names that would never fly in today 's society ... or at least today 's society outside of San Francisco .
Below , we list the nine stupidest names in sitcom history , and the annoying characters they were bestowed upon .
8- Arvid Engen , '' Head of the Class ' '
Picture Brad Pitt .
Now , change the hair to greasy ( unwashed greasy , not cool greasy ) black .
Change the nose so it 's larger and less appealing .
Take about 60 lbs of muscle away .
Add gold - rimmed glasses that are thicker and more awful - looking than your grandmother's .
Then you 've got Arvid , a nerd who manages to be the most uncool kid in an honors class .
7- Ralph Malph and Potsie , '' Happy Days ' '
Garry Marshall hit gold with annoying character names .
Unlike Arthur " The Fonz " Fonzarelli , who set the standard for coolness , the duo of Ralph Malph and Potsie were completely inept and often annoying .
Malph is a perfect example of how little thought can go into the name of a character .
Potsie 's great because he managed to go almost exclusively by one nonsensical name .
Long before Madonna , Prince , and Cher made the practice acceptable , Potsie blazed a trail of single - name adversity .
Still does n't make up for the fact that he was a complete loser , though .
6- Blossom Russo , '' Blossom ' '
The liberal daughter of a liberal piano - playing musician , Blossom was a little hippy a whole lot of annoying .
If her name was Julie or Jessica , the show would have never made it past the pilot .
Of course , they teamed her up with an even more annoying and oddly named best friend named Six , and the show reached critical mass levels of aggrivating .
Due to the overload of annoying , Blossom 's awfulness had to be siphoned into another form of media , and thus , Joey Lawrence 's music career was born .
5- Topanga , '' Boy Meets World ' '
While she made have been the object of lust for every horny loser that watched '' Boy Meets World ' ' , Topanga could n't mask her annoyingness with modest beauty .
She was a hippie in a suburban Philadelphia school , who later shed her faux - idealism to date ( and then wed ) a character played by the uglier Savage brother .
She should have just stuck with that nerdy kid they dropped after the first season .
At least he stuck to his roots and did n't fuck Ben Savage
4- Doogie Howser , '' Doogie Howser , M.D ' '
If you 're young , a doctor , and not getting laid constistenly , something is extremely wrong .
And while the " he 's only 14 ! " argument is valid , it can't last forever .
I 'm guessing that if we caught up with 32 - year - old Doogie , we 'd find he'd still have trouble getting any .
Why ?
Because his name is Doogie .
I 'm pretty sure his parents named him that to ensure he would be a M.D.
That may have failed , but it succeeded in another way ... a child named Doogie cannot become an adult .
3- Steve Urkel , '' Family Matters ' '
Meant to be an exceedingly annoying guest character , Urkel was n't supposed to become a national sensation .
Then you realize that this nation has a large contingent of morons , and it all starts to make sense .
I 'm sure the producers were skeptical at first when they chose this name .
But after watching Jaleel
White hike his pants up and attach his suspenders , there was no doubt that " Urkel " aptly described the unique brand of hell that we would suffer through from that point on .
In case you needed more proof of his awfulness , Urkel managed to have both a dance move and a breakfast cereal named after him .
Of course , like Blossom , Urkel too had an annoyingly named friend , Waldo Geraldo Faldo , who covered a different spectrum of grating , so anyone watching Family Matters would have reason to contemplate suicide .
2- Balki Bartokomous , '' Perfect Strangers "
Balki emigrated from Mypos to live with his cousin Larry in Chicago , creating stupid situations due to his lack of American knowledge .
This went on for eight seasons .
If you 're still making moronic translation jokes after eight years , you 're either the world 's biggest dumbass , or the creation of a writing staff that did n't expect your schtick to last longer than a season .
Either one sounds appropriate for Balki .
1- Boner Stabone , '' Growing Pains ' '
Boner Stabone ...
It works on so many levels -- and it's only two words .
It 's the kind of name that you would think would n't fly on network television .
Or be utterable in a suburban Long Island home like the Seavers ' .
Then you see his face , and you realize that if anyone could pull off a name that serves as a euphemism for an erection , it'd be him .
His character was borderline retarded and would help Kirk Cameron make crappy decisions that Kirk could learn from in the end of the show .
Oddly enough , Kirk Cameron went Christian - crazy and wanted to maintain a " family " element to the show , Boner still stuck around .
I 'm still not quite sure why they did n't name him Richard P. McLarge .
( Check out our complete collection of Underwater and Oceanic Oddities . )
Whether a luxury habitat or humble floating home , do you ever dream of sailing off into the sunset in your very own houseboat ?
Some of these are dreamy but completely out of reach while others you may be able to afford but would n’t want for the world .
This collection spans the extremes of design and brute - force ingenuity : from the obscenely luxurious to the absurdly simple ( and click here for more underwater and oceanic oddities ) .
The Trilobis 65 is a semi- submerged masterpiece of cutting - edge design and ecological engineering .
These modular living spaces are designed to be plugged into a network of docks , free to roam or to aggregate as desired .
Residents enter into a common space on a main floor before moving into a lower observation deck with 365 - degree views of the surrounding underwater environment or private cabin spaces above .
For some a floating home is a luxury or a hobby , but for others it may soon be ( or already is ) an absolute necessity .
Take residents of Amsterdam for example : 20 % of the country is already underwater and concerns about life on land have prompted some creative designs for future living .
Necessity is the mother of invention and this case is no exception with Dutch designers stepping up to the challenge of creating modern floating homes suitable to more permanent living .
The German firm of Floating Homes GMBH has developed a number of sleek models , designs and real - life prototypes that take cutting edge German architectural design out onto the water .
Some of their designs look like normal residences floating on flat modernist planes in oceanic space while others seem adapted to their dual purpose of resting and as well as gliding along the surface of the water .
The Jelly - Fish 45 is arguably the most ambitious approach to marine living yet devised .
At 33 feet high and 45 feet wide , this structure blows most houseboats out of the water .
Like the Trilobis the Jelly - Fish submerged lower deck for dining , drinking and viewing ocean life .
Of course , at $ 2.5 million per unit one would expect only the best .
A spiral staircase joins the five stories of the floating habitat and ample windows accommodate views in all directions from all levels .
At the entire opposite end of the spectrum , these represent the ultimate in budget floating accommodations .
What does one really need to live on the water after all ?
Just a platform and a shelter , right ?
Well , one simple way is to combine the two necessary elements using the cheapest and easiest objects available : a simple floating surface and a ready - made trailer or mobile home .
Prefer something upscale but ca n’t afford to buy it ?
Try one of these amazing underwater and ocean - going hotels instead !

Listen , Michelle , you sad , pathetic shrew , leave comedy and music to professionals like me and other creative people on the Left .
We own you guys on this stuff .
Conservatives are just not creative people .
You people spend your lives like baby birds ; heads back , mouths gaping , passively awaiting the next set of talking points and marching orders from your corporate and political masters .
This is not how art is made , even satirical art .
To create something moving , or funny , or even engagingly nasty ( a specialty of my own ) requires a certain amount of soul , of individuality , of spark .

Political Issues that Matter for 2008
Remember , these issues represent the tip of the political iceberg .
But they are indicative of the corporate domination of the Democratic and Republican parties .
Click on any of the issues in the table below for more information the issues that matter for 2008 , or find out more about the Nader / Gonzalez position on other important issues , including the environment , social , fiscal , market , labor , political and foreign policy .
Ralph Nader on the Political Issues that Matter
Shift the Power
To illustrate how little has changed in four years , other than conditions becoming worse , the 2008 Nader / Gonzalez campaign is posting these policy positions on various injustices , necessities , and redirections that were prepared initially for the 2004 Nader / Camejo campaign .
Such a short historical context should give our supporters and viewers an even greater sense of urgency to stop the corporate interests ' and the corporate governments ' autocratic control -- and the resulting deterioration -- of our society and country .
Affirmative action
After more than 300 years of de facto affirmative action to benefit white males , we definitely need affirmative action for people of color and women to offset enduring historic wrongs as well as present day inequalities .

Agriculture American agriculture is being dominated by two contrary trends in the 21st Century .
First , conventional family farm agricultural production is being destroyed by low prices and lack of market access due to mergers , acquisitions by big agribusinesses and their monopsony power over farmers .
Second , there is a boom in more sustainable agricultural production and consumption due to increased consumer awareness and demand for healthy , fresh , and nutritious food .

Corporate Crime
The US needs to crackdown on corporate crime , fraud and abuse that have just in the last four years looted and drained trillions of dollars from workers , investors , pension holders and consumers .
Among the reforms needed are resources to prosecute and convict the corporate executive crooks and to democratize corporate governance so shareholders have real power ; pay back ill - gotten gains ; rein in executive pay ; and enact corporate sunshine laws , among others .

Electoral Reform
Our democracy is in a descending crisis .
Voter turnout is among the lowest in the western world , and America ranks in the bottom three of countries that hold free elections .
The reasons for this democracy crisis are many : Redistricting ensures very few incumbents are at risk in one - party districts , and paperless voting machines call into question whether every vote is being counted .
Barriers to full participation of candidates proliferate , making it very obstructive for third party and Independent candidates to run .
These problems silence alternative viewpoints and decrease voter confidence .

Whether it is the 65,000 Americans who die every year from air pollution , or the 80,000 estimated annual fatalities from hospital malpractice , or the 100,000 Americans whose demise comes from occupational toxic exposures , or the cruel environmental racism where the poor and their often asthmatic children live in pollution sinks located near toxic hot spots ( that are never situated in shrubbered suburbs ) , preventable , harmful , situations abound .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Former England football manager Steve McClaren fought off tough competition from U.S. President George W. Bush to win a dreaded “ Foot in Mouth ” award on Tuesday from the Plain English campaign .
U.S. President George W. Bush delivers remarks during the television taping of " Christmas in Washington " at the National Building Museum in Washington , December 9 , 2007 .
Former England football manager Steve McClaren fought off tough competition from Bush to win a dreaded " Foot in Mouth " award on Tuesday from the Plain English campaign .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
He was hailed for a supreme example of gobbledegook in talking about star player Wayne Rooney : “ He is inexperienced but he ’s experienced in terms of what he ’s been through . ”
George W. Bush came second for “ All I can tell you is that when the governor calls , I answer his phone . ”
Plain English Campaign spokesman Ben Beer told Reuters : “ We thought it was a bit obvious to honour Bush as he comes up with them every day . ”
Every year , the pressure group hands out a raft of awards mocking incomprehensible jargon in a battle to clear the linguistic fog that so often envelops the English language .
McClaren , fired as manager after the team failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 championships , is in distinguished company - past winners include model Naomi Campbell , actor Richard Gere and former U.S. Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
There is never a shortage of entrants sent in by people baffled by bureaucratic language and befuddled legalese .
“ We get 40 to 50 examples a week , mostly from British documents .
The media , including advertising and marketing , is riddled with insider jargon , ” Beer told Reuters .
Offering the best way to obliterate meaningless verbosity , Beer said : “ Thinking before you write is the main thing and then re-reading what you have written . ”
That message clearly fell on deaf ears at Coleraine railway station in Northern Ireland .
The station sign read : “ Every autumn a combination of leaves on the line , atmospheric conditions and prevailing damp conditions lead to a low adhesion between the rail head and the wheel which causes services to be delayed or even cancelled . ”
London ’s Gatwick Airport got 10 out of 10 for brevity but came bottom of the class for clarity for one of its signs : “ Passenger shoe repatriation area only . ”
The campaign was founded in 1979 by Chrissie Maher who only learned to read and write at the age of 14 .
Her jargon watchers now pounce on verbal excesses by officialdom and stage classes for bureaucrats , bankers and lawyers .
Campaign organisers even sent two “ language policemen ” on a global tour from India to South Africa and the United States to teach officialdom the best way to abandon the gobbledegook .
Beer does not despair .
“ There has been an improvement over the years but there is a long way to go .
This is the 29th year of the campaign .
There is no chance of us being extinct anytime soon . ”
The husband said he could only afford to give five roses a day
The woman said she was claiming the dowry because her " very stingy husband " would not even pay for a cup of coffee , according to the E'temad newspaper .
The court has seized the man 's flat until he produces all of the roses .
Under Iranian law , a woman can claim her dowry , or mahr , at any time during a marriage or when getting divorced .
The gift becomes the property of the wife to do whatever she likes with .
It is required in order for the marriage contract and the marriage itself to be valid .
' Billionaire friends '
According to E'temad , the woman , identified as Hengameh , decided to claim her entire dowry of 124,000 red roses after 10 years of marriage to " punish her very stingy husband " .
Shortly after marriage , I realised that Shahin was very cheap
Hengameh
" Shortly after marriage , I realised that Shahin was very cheap , " she told the newspaper .
" He even refused to pay for my coffee if we went to a cafe or restaurant . "
Shahin told the court he could only afford to give her five roses a day and complained that it was his wife 's " billionaire friends who had put such ideas in her head " .
But the judge rejected Shahin 's pleas and ordered his $ 64,000 ( £ 33,000 ) flat to be confiscated until he has bought them all .
A long - stemmed rose costs about $ 2 ( £ 1.09 ) in the Iranian capital , Tehran .
It is common in Iran to offer gold coins or property as mahr .
An Iranian man can end up in jail for dowry debts .
Flames were reported leaping up to 30ft in the air
The fire was reportedly centred on Camden Canal Market , to the east of Chalk Farm Road .
Police closed off several roads and the Hawley Arms pub , near the source of the fire , suffered severe damage .
London Fire Brigade has said the blaze is being brought under control and there are no reports of casualties .
LFB station manager Guy Foster said the fire was centred around Camden Canal Market , where a number of market stalls had caught fire .
He said the train line between Camden Road and Kentish Town West had been shut down .
Residents have also been evacuated from some houses and flats .
Firefighters were alerted at about 7.20 pm on Saturday to the blaze which has reportedly consumed part of the Hawley Arms , a popular Camden pub which is frequented by celebrities including singer Amy Winehouse .
There were unconfirmed reports that some people were trapped , but London Fire Brigade spokesman Nick Comery said he had heard nothing to support that .
He told BBC News 24 : " It 's an ongoing job and we are doing our best to bring it under control and to stop it spreading .
" It involves currently some market storage properties , shops and dwellings .
" It is a large area that is involved .
It is a severe fire , there is a lot of smoke going up into the sky . "
BBC News reporter James Cooke said the fire appeared to have broken out in a row of shops .
Revellers from local pubs and bars were moved away from the danger area , where flames were leaping up to 30ft in the air .
Conservative mayoral candidate Boris Johnson said : " This will come as a terrible blow to their livelihoods and the area generally .
My thoughts are with the traders , local residents and the emergency services who are , as usual , performing brilliantly under pressure . "
London Ambulance Service said it has ambulances and a hazardous response team at the scene .
Seth Owuadey , 48 , who lives in Kentish Town , was in a bar opposite the Hawley Arms and saw the first flames as they grew stronger .
Firefighters concentrated much of their effort on the Hawley Arms pub
" A fire engine arrived but it took about 40 minutes for more to come , even though by then the flames were the height of a house .
" We thought it started in the Hawley Arms , but it started in an alleyway behind there . "
Moira Smith , 46 , also of Kentish Town , saw the flames out of the window of her home " and the next minute , it was on the news " .
Sitting on a bar stool in the middle of the road at the edge of the cordon in Chalk Farm Road , she said : " You could tell it was serious .
The smoke was black .
" I 'm just shocked by it all .
Please God , there 'll be no casualties . "
The markets area is a major tourist attraction attracting up to 300,000 visitors each weekend to its six open - air and indoor markets and vibrant mix of bars , clubs , shops and restaurants .
The World from Berlin America 's Failure in Afghanistan
US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has been putting pressure on Germany to up its commitment to the NATO mission in Afghanistan .
But some in Germany say it is America 's violence , not Berlin 's reluctance , that is the problem .
Valentine ’s Eve
The phone rings .
I already know what the person on the other end wants .
I already know what my answer is going to be .
It seems pointless to even answer .
But I must .
It ’s my job .
“ Hello the Bistro , ” I say cheerily , “ How may I help you ? ”
“ Yeah , ” a male voice answers , “ I ’d like a table for two tomorrow night . ”
“ I ’m sorry sir , ” I reply , putting the proper amount of contrition into my voice , “ But we have no reservations available . ”
“ You ’re kidding . ”
“ I ’m afraid I ’m not sir . ”
“ You have nothing for Valentine�s Day ? ”
“ We filled up the last time slot Friday . ”
“ That sucks , ” the man says angrily .
“ Sorry sir . ”
The man slams the receiver down .
Ouch , my ears .
I stare at the phone .
I ’ve gotten ten calls like that in as many minutes .
That was my third enraged hang up .
Can I help it if you ’re a poor planner buddy ?
All the good Valentine ’s Day slots booked up months in advance .
If you loved her pal , I think to myself , You ’d have planned earlier .
The phone rings again .
“ Hello , The Bistro , ” I answer warily , “ Can I help you ? ”
“ I ’d like to make a reservation for tomorrow night , ” a woman ’s voice says .
“ I ’m sorry Madam , ” I say , holding the receiver away from my ear , “ We have no reservations available . ”
“ Really ? ” the woman says .
“ Sorry Madam . ”
“ OK , ” the woman says , “ Thank you anyway . ”
“ Good night Madam . ”
The woman hangs up normally .
Some people understand limitation .
The kitchen bell rings furiously .
Instinctively I know I have food up .
I rush towards the back , desperately trying to look like I ’m not rushing .
Tonight is Valentine ’s Eve .
All the people who do n’t have a reservation for the 14th are out this evening as a consolation prize .
My section ’s packed with two tops .
I ’m in serious danger of going into the weeds .
“ Hey asshole , ” Armando , the chef says as I enter the kitchen , “ Your food ’s getting cold . ”
“ Sorry man , ” I reply , “ The phone ’s driving me nuts . ”
“ Do n’t tell me your problems , ” Armando grunts feverishly , “ I ’ve got plenty of my own . ”
I look at my order .
I ’m missing a Pasta Bolognese .
“ Where�s my Bolognese for 23 ? ”
“ What ? ”
“ The fucking Bolognese Armando ! ” I bellow .
“ You did n’t order a Bolognese for 23 ! ” he yells back .
“ Yes I did ! ” I say , waving the ticket .
“ Shit ! ” Armando exclaims .
Now , I ’ve screwed up plenty of orders in my time , so Armando is n’t off base thinking I messed up .
But he likes to think he never makes a mistake .
“ How long ? ” I yell .
“ Five minutes . ”
I grab the incomplete order and run to table 23 .
I tell the customer with the Bolognese that we made a mistake and his order will be out shortly .
Honesty is , tactically , the best policy .
The man starts to protest but calms down when I offer him a free glass of wine .
Booze is the great lubricant of customer service .
The door chimes .
Two people without a reservation .
I shoehorn them into a table near the bathroom .
The girl looks like she ’s about to cry .
“ Sorry Miss , ” I say , noting her distress , “ When a nicer table opens up I ’ll move you . ”
“ She ’ll be OK , ” her date replies .
“ Do n’t worry about it . ”
“ I ’ll be ok , ” the girl parrots .
“ The best table in the house is the table you ’re sitting at , ” I say automatically .
Tonight seems to be the night for customer service cliches .
The bell rings .
I run the Pasta Bolognese to 23 .
The phone rings .
I run to answer it .
I need to clone myself now .
“ Hello , the Bistro .
How may I help you ? ”
“ I want a table for two tomorrow night , ” a gruff male voice demands .
“ I ’m sorry sir .
We have no reservations available . ”
“ And I want the table by the window , ” the man continues , oblivious .
“ I ’m sorry sir , ” I repeat , “ We have no availability tomorrow night . ”
‘ Huh ? ” What is this guy , retarded ?
“ Regretfully sir , I have nothing open . ”
“ That ’s ridiculous , “ the man says .
“ Tomorrow ’s Valentine ’s Day sir , ” I say , approximating a verbal shrug .
“ I ’m friends with the owner , ” the man blurts .
Sure you are pal .
“ Even so sir , ” I reply , “ I have nothing available . ”
I ’m beginning to hate the word “ available . ”
“ Put Fluvio on the phone , ” the man demands .
“ He ’s not in sir , ” I say , “ Would you like to leave a message ? ”
“ What I ’d like is table for tomorrow night . ”
“ I ’m afraid that ’s impossible sir . ”
“ Nothing�s impossible . ”
I sigh inwardly .
I want to give this “ No Limits ! ” Yuppie a lesson in physics .
Two pieces of matter , or in this case , two asses , cannot occupy the same place at the same time .
I have a delightful vision of two Yuppies trying to cram into the same chair , morphing into a shimmering globule of entitlement , annihilating each other at sub atomic level .
The resultant quantum release of hot air could easily power a small city .
“ Sorry sir , ” I reply , moving the phone away from my ear , “ It ’s impossible . ”
“ BANG ! ” Ha !
I was prepared this time .
I return to the floor .
A regular customer waves me over .
“ Happy Valenswine ’s Day ! ” she announces .
“ Madam ? ”
“ Happy Valenswine ’s Day ! ”
“ I ca n’t say I ’ve heard that one , I reply , befuddled . ”
“ The woman laughs .
“ Valenswine ’s Day is the day before Valentine ’s Day , ” she explains .
“ It ’s when cheating husbands take their mistresses out to dinner . ”
I laugh heartily .
“ Thanks , ” I say , “ I ’ll remember that one . ”
“ Thought you ’d get a kick out of it , ” the woman chuckles .
“ You married to this lady ? ” I ask the woman�s husband .
“ Maybe , ” he says with a sly smile .
Finally , some cool customers .
Thank God .
I was really hating people there for a moment .
“ You ’re smart to come out tonight , ” I say .
“ Tomorrow ’s gonna be a zoo . ”
“ We never go out on Valentine ’s Day , ” the woman says , waving her hands , “ Too crazy .
Too overpriced . ”
“ Well have a Happy Valenswine ’s Day , ” I say , winking .
“ You too , ” the woman says , winking back .
I dive back into the madness .
The customers keep coming .
The phone rings with a constant knowing malevolence .
I somehow manage to stay out of the weeds .
When I stumble out of the Bistro , battered and exhausted , I remember that tonight was just a dress rehearsal for tomorrow .
Valentine ’s Day , with all its heightened expectations and pressure , ranks just below Mother ’s Day on the Waiter Pain Meter .
Its amateur night and the tips are for shit .
But I ’ll be there , happy smile glued to my face , ready to make your evening special .
Why ?
Because it ’s my job .
Pray for me .
Everyone has heard of Charles Darwin .
Yet it is a sad fact that a good part of what most people think and believe about the man is wrong .
So many myths and legends have cropped up since his death that it is difficult to disentangle fact from fiction .
Here are some of the most common misconceptions .
Darwin and the Galapagos
There are , as always , multiple versions of this legend .
One of the most pervasive is the idea that Darwin and the Beagle set sail straight to the Galapagos so that Darwin could discover evolution there .
The Galapagos was ground zero for Darwin 's eureka moment .
But there was no eureka moment .
Darwin did n't become an evolutionist while in the Galapagos .
In fact , three classes of facts gradually convinced him that evolution was true , but only after his return .
For example in this passage from his autobiography : " During the voyage of the Beagle I had been deeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil animals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos ; secondly , by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one another in proceeding southwards over the continent ; and thirdly , by the South American character of most of the productions of the Galapagos archipelago , and more especially by the manner in which they differ slightly on each island ; none of these islands appearing to be very ancient in a geological sense . "
The Origin
The title of Darwin 's most famous book is often given incorrectly as " Origin of the Species " , as if it was about the origin of our species .
But the title is actually On the Origin of Species , meaning " where do species come from ? "
The short answer is they are descended from common ancestors , winnowed by natural selection - and not independently created .
The Origin is about the general process of the evolution of all species .
It does not trace the origin of any particular species , including humans .
Another common misconception is that the " origin of species " means " origin of life " , and in this it utterly fails .
But again , this is not what the book is about .
Darwin , although himself convinced that life had perfectly natural origins , thought the science of his day was unable to answer that question , and he left it for future generations to investigate .
He was in a position , however , to demonstrate that the various kinds of living and fossilised things we find in the world are related to one another genealogically by descent - they evolve .
Monkeys
Darwin said we come from monkeys .
Nope .
He never said that .
This common misconception belies a profound misunderstanding of evolution .
This is not unlike the popular illustrations of mankind as the pinnacle of the tree of life .
Saying we come from monkeys is like saying you are the child of your cousin .
Darwin said that monkeys , apes and humans must have a common ancestor because of our great similarities compared to other species .
Even in his day it could be shown that we are more similar to apes than apes are to monkeys .
Another common shorthand misconception is , " It 's all just survival of the fittest is n't it ? "
No it is n't .
" Survival of the fittest " is a misleading phrase , and it was not coined by Darwin but by the philosopher Herbert Spencer .
Alfred Russel Wallace later convinced Darwin to adopt the phrase .
Any shorthand summary of Darwin 's theory needs three elements : variation between individuals , natural selection based on differences in survival , and heritability of traits .
Darwin was an atheist
Nope .
As far as we know Darwin was never an atheist .
He was baptised in the Church of England , taken to Unitarian chapel as a child and at one time intended to become a country clergyman .
But Darwin was never a particularly religious person .
When in his late 20s and early 30s he began to think more carefully about nature and the meaning of life , he gradually came to disbelieve in Christianity , miracles or divine revelations .
One of the most important factors in this gradual - and as he recalled it distress - free transformation - was his awareness that humans are animals too and are derived from less human - like ancestors .
Secondly , other religions , which had repeatedly swept over vast parts of the globe , were considered utterly groundless myths by Victorian Christians .
Darwin could see that almost all peoples in all times had contradictory mythical stories and supernatural beings , and Christianity could boast of no evidence to support its own version .
Other pernicious myths claim that Darwin repented of evolution or converted to Christianity on his deathbed .
To the former I can only think , so what ?
Although it is quite untrue , whatever Darwin could have said on his deathbed could not erase the mountains of scientific evidence which confirms Darwin 's views .
The latter myth is also entirely untrue and was forcibly denied by his sons in print when it first surfaced in 1915 and in the following decades .
Darwin remained an agnostic , though he always retained a lingering suspicion that some intelligence had set up the laws of nature in the first place .
These fixed natural laws could be identified by science .
He believed he had discovered a new such law in natural selection .
False quotations
There are many attributed to Darwin .
Probably the most common is : " It is not the strongest species that survive , nor the most intelligent , but the ones most responsive to change . "
Versions of this catchy phrase adorn many a book and website .
But it was never written by Darwin .
There is no longer any excuse for taking someone else 's word about or misquoting Darwin , because all of his publications are available for free at darwin-online.org.uk /.

Milky
Way twice as thick as we think
Our home galaxy , the Milky Way , is twice as thick as we thought it was , Australian astrophysicists discover .
Professor Bryan Gaensler from the University of Sydney and his team found that the enormous spiral - shaped collection gas and stars is 12,000 light - years thick when seen edge - on , not 6000 as scientists previously thought .
" This was quite a stunning result , " Gaensler says .
" It was a bit of a shock to us .
It 's like walking out into your backyard and finding your tree is twice the size you remembered . "
The researchers made their discovery without high - tech equipment or powerful telescopes .
Instead , they downloaded publicly available data from the internet and carefully analysed it .
" It took us just a few hours to calculate this for ourselves , " Gaensler says .
" We thought we had to be wrong , so we checked and rechecked and could n't find any mistakes . "
The surprising new result came about because the researchers were discerning about the data they used to make their calculations .
Choosing the right pulsars
To measure the size of the Milky Way , researchers study light coming from a pulsar , a type of star that sends beams of light through space like a searchlight .
" As light from these pulsars travels to us , it interacts with electrons scattered between the stars , which slows the light down , " Gaensler says .
Scientists refer to those electrons as the Warm Ionised Medium , or WIM .
The WIM has a bigger effect on longer wavelengths of light , which are redder , than on the shorter , bluer , light .
" So by seeing how far the red lags behind the blue we can calculate how much of the WIM the pulse has travelled through , " he says .
By comparing this effect on the light from stars different distances away from us , researchers can find where the WIM stops ; in other words , the galaxy 's edge .
The trick for getting a more accurate figure lay in choosing the right pulsars to include in that analysis , Gaensler says .
" What we did in terms of picking better data was picking pulsars that are either high above the galaxy or underneath it , and not the ones sitting inside the galaxy , which is what nobody had bothered to do before . "
Doing the sums
The researchers presented their results recently at the world 's biggest annual conference of stargazers , the 211th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin , Texas .
" Overall , most people were accepting because they agreed that our analysis was a better approach than had been done in the past .
What 's more , it fixes a lot of things that had n't made sense in our galaxy , " he says .
" By making the galaxy twice as thick , dozens of other seemingly unrelated calculations ... all of a sudden work now . "
For example , it helps make sense of how magnetic the galaxy is , he says .
The new figure could also lead to a rethink about the wider universe .
" Many of detailed calculations people do on galaxies across the universe - how gas is converted to stars , and stars are converted into gas , and how gravity and pressure balance to stop the galaxy flying apart - use that number , " Gaensler says .

BBC News
Major General Doron Almog refused to leave the plane at Heathrow
Documents seen by BBC News reveal how Major General Doron Almog managed to fly back to Israel when police failed to board his plane in September 2005 .
He stayed on board for two hours after a tip - off that he was facing detention .
Police were concerned about a potential clash with Israeli air marshals or armed personal security on the plane .
Maj Gen Almog had flown to the UK for social and charitable visits to Jewish communities in Solihull , in the West Midlands , and Manchester .
Lawyers acting for Palestinian campaigners lobbied the Metropolitan Police to act over allegations he had ordered the destruction in 2002 of more than 50 Palestinian homes in the Gaza Strip .
Campaigners say the homes were destroyed by the Israeli army as retribution for a Palestinian militant attack , in contravention of the laws of war protecting civilian property .
Israel says destruction of Palestinian houses is among the necessary measures it takes to protect its citizens .
The Met initially refused to get involved , citing massive pressures on counter - terrorism teams in the wake of the London bombings .
But the legal representatives successfully applied to a judge for an arrest warrant for a private prosecution .
Decisions log
A decisions log prepared for the Independent Police Complaints Commission , which has investigated the incident , shows officers decided to detain the general at Heathrow 's immigration control .
Destroyed : Palestinians accused Maj Gen Almog of an attack on homes
They then planned to take him to a police station to consider executing the warrant .
However , news of the warrant leaked to the Israeli Embassy .
Officials tipped off the general and he and his wife refused to leave the El Al flight for the two hours it sat at the London airport 's terminal .
The documents now show Det Supt John MacBrayne , a senior counter - terrorism officer who was responsible for the operation , could not get confirmation that his team had the right to board the plane .
El Al , Israel 's national airline , had refused permission .
In his log , he wrote : " Another consideration [ was ] that El Al flights carried armed air marshals , which raised issues around public safety .
" There was also no intelligence as to whether Mr Almog would have been travelling with personal security as befitted his status , armed or otherwise . "
The officer concluded there were real risks to the police and public and also had concerns about the " international impact of a potentially armed police operation at an airport " .
Apology to Israel
When Maj Gen Almog arrived back in Israel , the planned arrest caused a minor diplomatic storm , with Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom describing the incident as an " outrage " .
In turn , the then UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw apologised to his counterpart for any embarrassment caused .
Hickman and Rose , lawyers for the Palestinians , demanded an inquiry .
A spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission said its review had not identified the source who leaked details of the planned arrest .
It also concluded police had not broken rules by failing to board the aircraft to execute the warrant .
John O' Connor , a former head of Scotland Yard 's flying squad , told BBC One 's Breakfast programme : " All they needed to do was to stop the plane from taking off and negotiate through the Foreign Office . "
He said he felt the arrest had been " written off " , putting " British justice is in the dock . "
The lawyer could face up to a year in jail for her vigorous handshake
Kathy Brewer Rentas , 49 , shook the hand of Assistant US Attorney Jennifer Keene so hard her arm was nearly ripped out of its socket , a court official said .
Moments before , Ms Keene successfully prosecuted Ms Brewer Rentas ' husband .
Anthony Rentas was accused of violating the terms of a probation order for supplying cocaine , and sentenced to 90 days of house arrest .
After the hearing in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , Mrs Brewer Rentas insisted on shaking the prosecuting lawyer 's hand .
In shaking it , she nearly floored Ms Keene with the vigour of her hand - action .
The strong arm of the lawyer
" With Keene in hand , Brewer made an upward , then a quick downward motion and pulled Keene toward the ground moving her forward , almost causing Keene to fall to the ground , " said a court security officer .
Alicia Valle , a spokeswoman for the US Attorney 's Office , said assaulting a federal officer was a serious matter and that Mrs Brewer Rentas would be prosecuted " vigorously " .
" As a member of the bar , she should know better , " she said .
Mrs Brewer Rentas was freed on Friday on $ 100,000 ( £ 50,000 ) bail , after spending a night in solitary confinement , and ordered to undergo psychological examination .
She was also ordered to stay away from Mrs Keene , and faces up to a year in prison if convicted of assault .
Mrs Brewer Rentas says she did not intend to cause any harm .
A few minutes ago I pushed the gems for Merb 0.9.0 “ All you need , none you do n’t ” to merbivore.com .
Before you run off to “ gem update ” there ’s some things you should know .
As wycats explained earlier we ’ve chopped Merb up a little bit .
merb - core is small , fast and just the stuff you need to build a basic web application .
merb - more is a collection of things that make it cooler and more useful , like mailers and generators and template engines .
Together , merb - core and merb - more make up “ merb ” .
You ’ll still be able to gem install merb and have it work , or you can cherrypick just the pieces you want for your application .
We ’ve also got a decent collection of “ official ” plugins , including all the ORM plugins , and some additional rspec and test / unit support .
Anytime you gut a codebase like we did with Merb after 0.5 , there ’s stuff that does n’t shake out properly .
We had planned to release 0.9.0 last weekend during acts_as_conference , but there ’s still some little stuff that needs shaking .
Normally , we ’d just get people to use trunk and see what needed doing , and then call it a release .
This time , we do n’t really have a good sense of exactly where the rough spots are between all the moving parts .
We need your help .
Here ’s 0.9.0 , and it ’s a real release .
It ’s official .
It ’s just not on the Rubyforge gem repository yet .
We ’re calling it a “ developer release ” and it ’s like a release candidate , except we do n’t think we ’ll actually release it .
Once people use it , and we oil some of those squeaky spots , we ’ll push an 0.9.1 .
We may do a few of these developer releases before we decide we ’re ready to push it to Rubyforge for general consumption .
These developer releases are here to make sure that Merb 1.0 is as good as it can be , so if you want to see an awesome Merb 1.0 , please use these 0.9.0 gems , and future dev releases , and give us feedback .
If you have RubyGems 1.0.1 , and want to always use these developer releases whenever they ’re available :
$ gem sources -a http://merbivore.com
$ gem install merb
If you do n’t , or you do n’t :
$ gem install -- source http://merbivore.com merb
As always , put your bugs and patches in Lighthouse and join the discussion on #merb .

Israeli officials say Hezbollah also provides Hamas with training and logistical support .
They add that Hamas has also adopted other Hezbollah tactics , operating in civilian areas and in some cases storing weapons in homes , creating similar quandaries for the army that it faced in its war in Lebanon in 2006 .
Soon after the forces left northern Gaza on Monday , two more of the imported rockets struck Ashkelon , an Israeli coastal city of 120,000 people about 10 miles north of the strip .
One rocket hit an apartment block , causing damage but no serious injuries .
Hamas has claimed responsibility for most of the rocket fire .
Hamas took over Gaza last June after routing forces loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah .
Mr. Abbas , who is based in the West Bank , suspended peace talks with Israel as the death toll rose in Gaza , and on Monday he called on all sides to agree to a cease - fire and to allow him to act as a mediator , a day before Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was expected to arrive in the region for talks .
There was a second day of unrest in the West Bank on Monday , with Palestinians protesting the Israeli actions in Gaza and throwing stones at soldiers and Israeli cars in various locations .
An Israeli settler shot and killed a 17 - year - old Palestinian on a road west of Ramallah .
According to Israel Radio , the settler said he had gone out for a walk and was confronted by a group of Palestinians , some masked , who threw stones .
In what was apparently a bid to remain relevant in Gaza , and in an echo of the actions of the Lebanese government in southern Beirut after the war in 2006 , Mr. Abbas also instructed his government to allocate $ 5 million to compensate Gaza residents whose properties were damaged in the Israeli campaign .

Israel says its ground and air forces have been aiming only at rocket squads and weapons storage and production facilities in Gaza .
Israel ’s army chief of staff , Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi , and its chief of military intelligence , Maj. Gen. Amos Yadlin , described 90 percent of those killed in Gaza in the last few days as terrorists .

Senator Lindsey Graham on why he and 47 other senators voted against the Levin bill to bing US toops home from Iraq in 9 months :
" It would be a very overt rejection of Gen. Petraeus ' leadership , " said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) .
The military commanders " have earned the ability to carry on their mission , " he said at another point .
Bite me .
In a " very overt " kind of way .
First off , withdrawing the troops would be a rejection of Bush 's leadership , and the GOP 's leadership , and neither has " earned " anything except the disgust and hatred of the vast majority of the American people .
Second , " we must not ever hut the General 's feelings ! " as a rationale for anything is puerile and idiotic and a load of shit .
General Petreaus is not our leader , and this is not his war .
Nobody voted for him .
And nobody 's going to vote for anyone who wants to cower behind his uniform , either .
Americans apparently know basic civics a doucheload better than Senator Graham , and his party is going to learn this in 2008 .
And I hope to Christ certain Democrats learn this in certain key primaries , also .
Supreme Court author : Justice Souter wept when he thought of Bush v. Gore Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday September 21 , 2007
Print This Email This When Jeffrey Toobin , author of The Nine : Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court , appeared on Thursday 's Colbert Report , Stephen Colbert grilled him about the meaning of the book 's title .
" Do they have secret handshakes ?
Is it like the Da Vinci Code ?
Are there bizarre sexual rites going on there ? "
Toobin had to admit he was n't aware of any secrets of that kind , but did confide that " Justice Souter was so upset about the result in Bush v.
Gore that not only did he almost resign the Court because he was so upset , but there were times when he thought about the case and he wept . "
" You say the justices have tried to put the decision of Bush v. Gore behind them and move on , " Colbert said .
" That sounds like one of those movies where a bunch of frat brothers inadvertently kill a prostitute and then later she comes back and haunts them and kills them one by one .
Is that it ?
Are they haunted by that decision ? "
" I think some of them are , " Toobin responded .
" Some of them , I think , the Bush presidency has n't quite worked out as they had hoped . "
" But they were n't making the decision based on wanting Bush .
They were making the decision based upon the clear law , " suggested Colbert .
" Well , that 's that they said , " replied Toobin .
" Are you calling them liars ? " asked Colbert .
" Not liars , but I think sometimes political motivations do play a part , " Toobin conceded .

Prairie Dog Language ?

The ability to formulate and use language has long been considered to be a key differentiating characteristic that distinguishes man from animals .
Although that argument has been used by creationists to counter evolutionary theories , the entire conjecture may be without scriptural foundation .
That is , the scriptures do not tell us that animals do n't communicate , and there are indications that they might have sufficient intelligence to do so ( Gen. 3:1 , 7:9 , Num. 22:28 ) .
Do animals really communicate to each other with the variety of sounds they can produce ?
Gunnison 's Prairie Dog on guard .
1. Is Language Unique to Man ?
Black - tailed Prairie Dog stretches to see predator .
2. The Prairie Dog 's Warning Barks
Prairie Dog Sentinel .
Figure 1 . Sonogram of prairie dog bark for " dog , " divided into 45 time segments .
The two points for each segment indicate the two most dominant frequencies .
Figure 1 shows the sonogram for the warning bark for a dog predator approaching the colony as reported in the journal Behavioural Processes in 2004 . [ 8 ]
The two dominant frequencies are plotted and the short barks of about one tenth second duration are divided into 45 time segments .
Frequency corresponds to the " pitch " of the sound , that is , high frequency means high pitch .
Each of those 45 parts is analyzed to create acoustic unit symbols based on the two frequencies , derived from statistical studies of prairie dog calls over a period of over 10 years .
In the journal article describing the computational process of recognition of basic classes of predators , 85 acoustic symbols were identified .
This string of 45 symbols is then matched against standardized dictionary values for each prairie dog word .
Even among different prairie dogs from a wide area and over a period of ten years , new calls were able to be correctly analyzed up to 100 % of the time for many of the predators . [ 9 ]
Those are amazing results for the low quality audio recordings , which often were taped over 100 yards away .
2.1 Nouns
Figure 2 . Sonogram of one prairie dog bark for " coyote . "
Note the very steady low frequency combined with the quick large variations in the high frequency .
The coyote , principal prairie dog predator .
After recognizing different bark names for predators such as red - tailed hawks , coyotes , dogs , skunks and badgers , other words were also found for non-predators such as deer , elk , antelope and cows .
Clearly the prairie dog vocabulary includes a variety of nouns as names of various types of animals .
2.2 Adjectives
Prairie dogs fear the red - tailed hawk .
The research has shown at least 20 different basic prairie dog words describing predators , with many more variations to account for modifiers , totaling about 100 words . [ 10 ]
That does not mean their vocabulary is limited to that number of words , but rather it indicates the current state of our knowledge .
It takes many experiments to verify each new word .
The test environment of predators and the resulting sentry bark responses allow the researchers to actually understand the topic of conversation , a subject not easily controlled in scientific experiments .
At this time we have no idea what prairie dogs might talk about over breakfast .
2.3 Coining New Words
Prairie dogs barked a word for the European Ferret .
Later , to see just how far this unique coining ability extended , totally new test objects were shown to the colonies .
The researchers made plywood cutouts with silhouettes of a coyote , a skunk and even a black oval . [ 11 ]
As they pulled these silhouettes through the prairie dog town with a rope , once again without hesitation the prairie dogs came up with new words for each , and again these same words were used by all prairie dogs tested .
The use of non-living objects as these seems to weaken any explanation that the prairie dogs were discerning a universal spiritual name emitted by the living predator itself .
How could all prairie dogs instantly know the word for " black oval " ?
Prairie dogs have a word for badger .
The amazing aspect of the prairie dogs ' coining of new words is that they always came up with the same new word .
This ability to coin identical new words between separated groups does not occur in human languages .
A new word for a new unfamiliar object is not the same from one group of people to the next .
But the prairie dog bark for " black oval " is the same from one prairie dog to the next , even with one isolated from the other in remote colonies .
" ' There are no black ovals running around out there and yet they all had the same word for black oval , ' Slobodchikoff said .
He guesses the prairie dogs are genetically programmed with some vocabulary and the ability to describe things . " [ 13 ]
3. Artificial Intelligence
3.1 The SHRDLU Program
Person : PICK UP A BIG RED BLOCK .
Computer : OK .
Person : GRASP THE PYRAMID .
Computer : I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHICH PYRAMID YOU MEAN .
Person ( changing their mind ) : FIND A BLOCK WHICH IS TALLER THAN THE ONE YOU ARE HOLDING AND PUT IT INTO THE BOX .
Computer : BY " IT " , I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE BLOCK WHICH IS TALLER THAN THE ONE I AM HOLDING .
Computer : OK .
Person : WHAT DOES THE BOX CONTAIN ?
Computer : THE BLUE PYRAMID AND THE BLUE BLOCK .
Figure 3 . SHRDLU program developed in 1970 by Terry Winograd interactions showing interactive language analysis , semantic understanding and language synthesis for its small basic shape world .
Figure 4 . Graphical representation of the SHRDLU world .
If we are amazed at the complexity of chromosomes being able to correctly repair copying errors in themselves , then what about a starter basic language ability that is fantastically more difficult to program ?
How would one go about " evolving " a language ability written directly in the DNA code of every cell by the creature itself ?
3.2 Incredibly more complex
For example , in one Star Trek show , the script contains this interaction with the Enterprise 's computer :
Kirk : Computer .
Computer : Ready .
Kirk :
This is the captain .
Record security research , to be classified under my voice print or Mr. Scott's .
Computer : Recorded .
Kirk : Produce all data relevant to the recent ion storm .
Correlate following hypothesis : Could a storm of such magnitude cause a power surge in the transporter circuits creating a momentary interdimensional contact with a parallel universe ?
Computer : Affirmative .
Kirk :
At such a moment , could persons in each universe , in the act of beaming , transpose with their counterparts in the other universe ?
Computer : Affirmative .
Kirk : Could conditions necessary to such an event be created artificially using the ship 's power ?
Computer : Affirmative . [ 17 ]
In our minds we almost effortlessly understand the questions in this exchange and we may have some idea of how a scientific team might go about answering those questions .
But for a computer to really understand it in a general sense and in such a general context ?
That leaps a gulf so wide that it would almost certainly take centuries to achieve .
Do prairie dogs think ?
4. Believe in God
To us authors , our best posture to explain these results is to simply believe the Book of Mormon admonition :
Believe in God ; believe that he is , and that he created all things , both in heaven and in earth ; believe that he has all wisdom , and all power , both in heaven and in earth ; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend .
( Mosiah 4:9 )
5. Conclusion
Notes
It occurred to me that if 86 percent of adolescent suicides were girls , there would be a national commission to find out why .
There 'd be front - page stories and Oprah shows and nonprofit foundations throwing money at sociologists and psychologists to study female self - destruction .
My feminist sisters and I would be asking , rightly , " What 's wrong with a culture that drives girls , much more than boys , to take their own lives ? "
So why are n't we asking what 's wrong with a culture that drives boys , much more than girls , to take their own lives ?
Even in academia , where you can find studies on the most obscure topics , there is little research explaining why boys are disproportionately killing themselves .
The Center for Adolescence at Stanford , a nationally recognized clearinghouse on teen behavior , has no one on its long roster of experts who can speak on the topic .
Neither does the American Association of Suicidology , an organization dedicated to suicide prevention since 1968 .
If fathers say openly and repeatedly that acknowledging depression and sadness is not a sign of personal weakness but of superior judgment , if they say that getting help is their obligation as men so they can be good partners and providers , then maybe we have a chance at changing the centuries of hard - wiring that makes boys and men so much more violent than women -- whether toward others or toward themselves .
Did you know that 86 % of all adolescent suicides in the U.S.are comitted by boys ?
And the real problem ?
Nobody gives a damn .
A reporter at The San Franciso Chronicle is puzzled by this apathy as well : Unfortunately , the solution for this reporter to boy 's suicide is to treat them more like girls or to tie their seeking help to what they can do for women : I am not exactly sure of all the complex psychological reasons that boys are taking their lives more now than in the past , but I do know that without studying the reasons for the increase , we will not be on our way to finding a solution .
Update : JW Wells has similar thoughts on males and suicide .
Update II : If suicide is just about men's natural predisposition of violence towards others or themselves , as some commenters and emailers stated , why do more women than men kill themselves in China ?
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Stocks plunged Tuesday , with the Dow industrials tumbling to their biggest drop in nearly a year , after a key service sector gauge contracted in January possibly signaling that the U.S. economy is already in recession .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % tumbled 370 points , or 2.9 % , to 12,265 , with all of its 30 component stocks in negative territory .
It was the worst percentage decline for the Dow since February 2007 , when the index fell 3.3 % .
It was also its worst point drop since August .
" The ISM index fell off a cliff , " said Peter Cardillo , chief market economist at Avalon Partners .
" It 's one more piece of bad news on the economy , adding to the credit woes , the downgrades , and the political arena heating up . "
The Institute for Supply Management ( ISM ) said its nonmanufacturing index fell to 41.9 % in January from 54.4 % in December , well below the 53.0 % expected by economists .
Readings below 50 % indicate most firms are contracting .
See full story .
The ' R ' word
In a speech Tuesday , Richmond Federal Reverse President Jeffrey Lacker became the first Fed official to say publicly that the economy faces the risk of a recession .
The ISM report came on the heels of a drop in employment in January and a much weaker - than - expected estimate of fourth - quarter economic growth .
" ( The ISM data ) raised additional concerns that the slow - down which was being partially supported by the service sector is quickly sliding into a full blown recession , " said Robert Pavlik , chief investment officer at Oaktree Asset Management .
" Adding to the selling pressure are money managers who are scared that they might have gotten into some of the financials and retailers over the past two weeks a bit too early and they 're moving back to cash , " Pavlik said in a note .
Stocks had rallied over the past two weeks as the Federal Reserve aggressively cut interest rates down to 3 % to help stave off a recession and ease an ongoing credit crisis in financial markets .
But after rallying 6.5 % in the past 10 days of January , the broad S&P 500 Index SPX , - 0.48 % fell on Monday , and slid another 3.2 % , or 44 points , to 1,336 on Tuesday .
The S&P 500 , which is heavily influenced by financial stocks , is down 8.9 % for the year so far , the worst year - to - date decline ever in the history of the index , topping a 7.95 % drop in 1939 , according to Standard & Poor's .
The tech - heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , - 0.29 % fell 73 points to 2,309 .
Trading volumes showed 1.6 billion shares exchanging hands on the New York Stock Exchange , with declining issues topping gainers by a ratio of 4 to 1 .
On the Nasdaq , 2.5 billion shares traded , with decliners topping gainers by nearly 4 to 1 .
Financial woes
Among Dow components , insurance giant AIG AIG , - 1.23 % along with financials stocks American Express AXP , - 1.08 % , Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % and J.P. Morgan Chase JPM , - 0.84 % , fell the most .
The outlook for stocks of many financial firms remains clouded by uncertainty over charges linked to bad home loans .
At the same time , the insurers of bonds tied to those loans are also coming under heavy pressure , threatening to worsen an ongoing credit crisis in global financial markets .
Wall Street firms and regulators are said to be working on a plan to bail out these insurers .
" The real problem is not just the sour economic problems but the bond insurers -- and not knowing whether that rescue plan is going to come into place , " said Avalon 's Cardillo .
Meanwhile , shares of bond insurers Ambac Inc. ABK , and MBIA Inc. MBI , - 4.41 % were on the rise Tuesday .
Downbeat Yahoo
Among technology shares , Yahoo YHOO fell 1.2 % after Banc of America Securities analysts downgraded prospective Yahoo buyer Microsoft MSFT , - 1.04 % to neutral from buy .
" Even if Yahoo shareholders approve a deal with Microsoft , we believe the acquisition could face significant regulatory hurdles in the U.S. and particularly in the EU , which could delay the acquisition from closing for quite some time , " the analysts said .
Also hitting tech shares , National Semiconductor NSM , - 3.29 % fell 7 % after warning of lower quarterly sales .
Other markets
Following the ISM data , market odds that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by another 50 basis points at its next meeting jumped to 100 % , according to Action Economics .
Treasury bonds rallied -- as they often do when inflation pressures abate and when the odds of a rate cut increase -- with the benchmark 10 - year Treasury bond up 25/32 at 105 22/32 , yielding 3.556 % .

The event hopes to make people aware of how energy is wasted
During E - Day , which begins on 27 February , people will be asked to switch off electrical items not in use .
The National Grid will assess what difference it makes to electricity consumption , and power companies will offer support for home insulation .
E - Day builds on the Planet Relief idea developed but later dropped by the BBC .
" We 're all using electricity , but we tend to have very little idea about how the amount we 're using goes up and down , " said Matt Prescott , the scientist and climate campaigner who developed Planet Relief and then E - Day .
" There are a million - and - one things you could be thinking about in relation to curbing climate change ; but let 's focus here on how the choices we make affect energy use , and try to take some small basic steps in everyday life , " he told BBC News .
Disrupted planet
Planet Relief was first developed as an awareness - raising , comedy - led BBC TV programme .
We have 70 % of the public saying they accept climate change and wanting to do something about it ; but almost everybody feels powerless
Dr Matt Prescott ,
E - Day founder
The BBC justified the decision to drop it after 18 months of development by saying viewers preferred factual or documentary programmes about climate change .
The decision came after poor audiences for Live Earth , and public debate over whether it was the corporation 's role to " save the planet " .
After having worked with the BBC on Planet Relief , Dr Prescott then elected to see whether he could run the project as a stand - alone entity .
Energy companies , charities involved in climate change , other corporate backers and the National Grid decided to continue their support .
The grid 's involvement is crucial .
Initially it had been concerned that abrupt changes in demand could overload or disrupt supplies around the country .
The National Grid will be able to see if the campaign affects demand
Now , it will measure consumption during the 24 hours against a " business as usual " forecast , and report back what savings have been achieved .
" We are supporting E - Day because everyone can play their part , and also help to reduce their bills by only using the energy they need , " said Joe Kwasnik , global head of the grid 's climate change policy .
Supermarket giant Tesco is using the event to offer information and services that could help customers reduce energy use .
Major energy retailers are offering simplified access to the programmes they are obliged to operate under the government 's Energy Efficiency Commitment ( EEC ) and Carbon Emissions Reduction Target ( Cert ) .
People will be able to register their interest in measures such as loft or wall insulation through the E - Day website , and the companies will assess whether registrants are eligible for subsidies , which can be up to 100 % .
The event is also backed by the Stop Climate Chaos coalition of charities , whose 50 members include such diverse groups as Christian Aid , Greenpeace and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) .
Small beginnings
The E - Day campaign hopes to achieve relatively modest cuts in electricity consumption of 1 - 3 % .
How smart meters monitor households ' energy usage
In detail
" You have to start from somewhere , " commented Matt Prescott , who has been in the vanguard of the campaign to ban incandescent lightbulbs .
" And I thought that if businesses and the government are going to make different decisions ( about energy and climate issues ) in future , then they need to know there 's public support .
" We have 70 % of the public saying they accept climate change and wanting to do something about it ; but almost everybody feels powerless , and I wanted to find a way of making people feel powerful and that they could change something . "
Government policy is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 % by the year 2050 , and there is debate over whether this target is strict enough , with some scientists urging tougher targets , in the order of 80 % , for developed countries .
There is general acknowledgement that individual actions alone cannot bring cuts of anything like this scale .
" E - day is useful in itself , " observed Lord Robert May , a former chair of the Royal Society , who is supporting the event .
" But it is even more useful for its potential to engage people in the larger tasks ahead of us if we are to avoid catastrophic levels of climate change . "
E - Day will run for 24 hours from 1800 GMT on 27 February .

Heather Howland looks at the floor as Andy , her husband of 15 years , tries to work out how many men she has had inappropriate relations with in the past two years .
" We were going through it all the other night and I said I reckoned there have been about 50 , " he says , quite matter - of - factly .
Scroll down for more ...
" Heather said ' Never ! ' but I started to list them all and , yes , it is that many .
I think she 's only had full sexual intercourse with five or six , but let 's just say that things have gone on that should n't have gone on , with many more . "
Incredibly , they start to discuss some of these illicit " dalliances " , in the way that any couple might discuss holidays taken , or restaurants visited .
" There was the builder , that bloke in the graveyard , the guy in your work , " Andy begins , and his voice trails off .
His 35 - year - old wife , who is pretty and articulate , takes over : " Do n't forget the man at the centre .
And the young boy doing community service .
Oh God , that was a bad one .
I tried to drag him into the toilets . "
In any other circumstances , the only response to such jaw - dropping openness about marital indiscretions would be " yuck " .
Surely such dysfunctional marriages only exist on the Jeremy Kyle Show ?
But the Howlands are n't Jeremy Kyle 's sort of people .
Before " all this " started , they were the happily married parents of a seven - year - old boy .
Andy worked in a children 's home , helping youngsters with behavioural problems ;
Heather was an advertising executive .
They had been teenage sweethearts , together since the age of 17 , and had strident views about the sanctity of marriage .
Heather was from a particularly church - going family , and had n't as much as looked at another man since her wedding day .
" I 'd never even kissed anyone else , or even considered it , " she is at pains to point out .
" When people in the office where I worked had affairs , I was always the one tutting . "
So why on earth are we now talking about the fact that she has cheated on her husband with up to 50 other men ?
The answer is that Heather is ill .
In May 2005 , she suffered a massive brain haemorrhage while gardening .
Andy was told she was not expected to live .
He even signed the consent forms that would allow her organs to be donated .
When she pulled through , the doctors warned Andy that brain injuries were complex things .
He was not to be alarmed if Heather 's personality changed .
What no one could have predicted is the manner in which Heather 's personality would change .
" The medical explanation is that she suffers from hypersexuality .
It 's a convoluted way of saying she 's a nymphomaniac , " explains Andy .
Heather looks suitably mortified as she sums up her plight , which is that her life has been reduced to sex , sex and more sex .
It would be funny , if her face was n't so serious .
" One day I was this ordinary mum , in an ordinary marriage .
Sex was there - but it was n't a big deal .
Well , it is n't once you have children , is it ?
" Then I woke up in hospital and was just consumed by the need to have sex all the time .
And it did n't matter who with .
I turned into someone I did n't recognise .
I still do n't .
I 'm not the sort of person who propositions men in the street and invites them home for sex . "
And yet that 's exactly what she has done .
She has put her marriage under unfathomable pressure , and played Russian roulette with her own health and her husband's .
" It got to the point where we were both tested for sexually transmitted diseases , which is unforgivable of me , " she admits quietly .
" I put the man I love in danger , to the point where my counsellors said the only solution would be for me to take condoms with me every time I left the house . "
What has happened to this couple is simply incredible .
But perhaps the most surprising - and touching - part is that they are as united as ever .
Andy sits by Heather 's side as she admits to behaviour that would have any other woman condemned as a cheap slut .
" I can't say this is easy , " he says , " and I still get churned up every time I think about her with another man , but when we got married I promised to stick by her in sickness and in health .
I know we can get through this .
People laugh at this sort of thing , and I know why .
" I 've made my fair share of jokes about getting hold of Viagra so I can satisfy Heather 's urges .
But it is n't remotely funny .
It 's turned my wife into someone she just is n't .
And I want her back . "
Heather was in a coma for ten days after the haemorrhage , during which time she suffered two major bleeds in the brain .
Eventually , she opened her eyes and gave Andy a weak smile .
If he felt euphoric , his mood improved even more a few days later when Heather asked him to help her to the bathroom - then pulled him into the toilet cubicle with him .
There , they had the sort of sex that couples who have been married for 13 years tend not to have .
Andy was bemused , but not complaining .
" I thought it was some sort of big reaction to this near death experience , " he recalls .
" It was n't Heather at all but , hey , look at what she had been through .
I went along with it - what husband would n't ?
She was my wife and I 'd nearly lost her .
Of course we were going to seize the day . "
So they continued seizing the days .
And weeks .
And months .
For the first three months of her recovery , Heather did not really leave the house .
Andy stopped work to care for her every need and was only too happy - if quite bewildered - when most of those needs seemed to be sexual .
Three months into her recovery , however , Heather said she felt well enough to pop to the local shop .
Andy was worried .
Her short - term memory was , as he puts it , " shot to pieces " and he was concerned she would forget where the shop was or what she had gone there to buy .
But as he watched her cross the road - waving up at him as he stood at the window - he failed to realise where the real danger lay .
" She was fully aware that I was watching her , " he recalls now , shaking his head at how improbable the situation now sounds .
" Then I noticed that she was heading towards this builder who was working on a house opposite .
He called something to her - she went over and they started talking .
" They went into the hallway of this house .
The door shut .
I thought : ' What the hell is going on here ? '
" Then I could see figures moving inside the frosted glass .
My heart just fell to the floor .
They were kissing , it was obvious .
I could not believe what I was seeing .
My wife was supposed to be going to the shop - but she was kissing this builder in front of me .
" I ran across the road .
I 'm afraid I was n't thinking very logically at this stage .
I hit the guy , and dragged her back home .
" She was protesting all the way , saying : ' What is wrong with you ?
I have n't done anything . '
She just would n't listen to reason .
When I told her that she could n't go around kissing other men , she just shrugged . "
In the weeks and months to come , Heather 's behaviour would worsen .
" It went into freefall , " Andy admits .
" The builder was just the start .
The house started to fill up , mostly with my friends coming to see how she was .
She revelled in the attention .
She was flirty , forward .
It was painful , but even I did n't realise how far she would go .
" One day a friend called me up , horrified , saying : " Andy , I 've been getting these texts from Heather .
They are quite explicit . '
" Another said quite clearly : ' Andy , if Heather goes on like this , she is going to get herself raped . '
" It was true .
She was so forward , even with me there .
If we were in a pub , I 'd have to keep an eye on her .
I lost count of the number of times she 'd come on to some man at the bar and I 'd have to go up and say : ' Sorry , she 's not well . '
" I went to the doctors , asking for help .
The counsellor said she had heard of such things , but was n't experienced enough to know what to do .
She said I should just make sure Heather always carried condoms .
What sort of answer was that ? "
Six months after her brain surgery , Heather went back to work .
Andy made sure that her bosses knew about her unusual " condition " but somehow the message did not reach her colleagues .
Within weeks she had embarked on a passionate affair with a startled co-worker .
" I confronted her after I read one of her emails to him .
I was upset , crying , asking why .
She tried to deny it all , then just said she could n't understand what all the fuss was about . '
Heather struggles to explain what was going on in her head at the time .
She admits that she was ruled by her libido , pure and simple .
Nothing else mattered .
" I once sat on this bench in a graveyard and put my hand on this old man 's knee .
Once I started attending a support group for people with brain injuries at a community centre and started this relationship with a man .
" But the one I 'm most ashamed of was with this lad who was at the centre .
He was doing community service .
He was only about 18 or 19 , and I was caught nipping into the toilets with him .
" I did n't care .
The staff called Andy because they said they could n't keep me in the group . "
In fact , Andy admits it became quite commonplace for him to receive a call at work telling him to " come out quickly " as Heather was in a compromising position .
" I had to tell all our friends what was going on , and neighbours knew .
One day the local barber called me at work and said that Heather was with some bloke in the driveway .
" It was another friend who spotted her in the graveyard , coming on to this poor man .
I had to pitch up and say : " Come on , darling .
Let 's go home . "
" There have been many times I 've walked into the kitchen to find some man there , or Heather in a position she should n't be . "
What 's particularly sad is that the couple 's beloved son , whom they ask us not to name , has been exposed to all this .
" He has had to know about things that no boy his age should need to know , " admits Andy .
" I had to sit him down and tell him that Mummy is n't well and that was why she was bringing strange men home .
Sometimes he calls me at work and tells me that I have to come home . "
Sadder still is that even men who know Heather is ill have been prepared to indulge her advances .
" I think we 've found out who our friends are , " is how Andy puts it .
" Some of my friends have taken advantage of Heather . "
Heather admits her experience has shaken her faith in human nature .
" There 's only the odd bloke who has turned me down , " she says , sounding a little surprised .
" It kind of makes you realise that any man will go for it if it's on a plate .
What all this has taught me is that men are quite shallow . "
Andy , though , seems anything but .
It takes a special sort of man to put up with the inevitable giggling and finger - pointing that goes with such an affliction .
In the early days he laughed along with the best of them , joking about Viagra and his wife 's seventimesa - night demands .
But he admits his life has been turned upside down by Heather 's injury .
After all , what man could cope knowing his wife might bring home a sexually transmitted infection or an unwanted pregnancy ?
" It 's not just the sex .
It 's changed everything between us , " he says .
" Before , I was the sort of bloke who went out to work and left everything else - cooking , cleaning , looking after our son , our finances , our whole lives - to Heather .
" She was so good at it all .
My friends used to joke that even when they were at our house , she'd be running round with a duster .
Her standards were so high .
" Now ?
It 's different .
I have to do everything .
Heather will start doing some chore , then walk into the hallway and forget what she was doing .
It 's hard , and that 's before I have to deal with finding my wife in some other man 's arms . "
So why is he still around ?
He seems puzzled to even be asked .
" Because she is my wife and my best friend and because I love her more than life itself .
When they told me she was going to die , I stood by her bed willing it not to be so .
I said I could cope with anything , if only she would live .
And I can , even this . "
The couple are clinging to the fact that the human brain , complex though it is , is capable of near miracles .
The couple are seeing a specialist who is convinced that Heather 's brain can be retrained to recognise how it is appropriate to behave .
At the moment , Heather has agreed not to leave the house alone , to ensure her own safety and Andy 's peace of mind .
Medication is also helping .
She currently takes two kinds - an antidepressant and a birth control pill .
Both are proven to reduce libido - and there has indeed been something of a breakthrough in the bedroom department .
" She even turned me down the other day , " says Andy , laughing .
" I wanted to sleep with her , but she was the one who said she did n't feel like it .
I could have whooped with delight . "

Seen above is a topographic map made by the author , from Venera and Magellan altimetry data .
It shows the continent - sized highlands of Ishtar Terra , near the north pole of Venus .
Venus From Space
In 1965 , Venera - 2 made the first attempt to photograph Venus from space .
It probably did so , but the final telemetry contact to download its experimental data was never established .
After that , the only Soviet cameras to study Venus from space were on the first artificial satellites of Venus , Venera - 9 and 10 .
They did long - term high resolution cloud - dynamics studies , combined with linear photometric and spectrometric measurements .
The results of that analysis and a few pictures have been published , but the original data has never been seen by westerners .
linear camera was similar to the Venera - 9 lander 's cycloramic camera , but with twice the resolution .
The best images of Venus ever taken were by Mariner - 10 in 1973 , during its gravity - assist flyby on the way to Mercury .
Galileo also photographed the planet during a flyby , and low - resolution cloud scans were taken over a long period of time by Pioneer - 12 .
Surprisingly , images of Venus taken from space are almost never colored or tone mapped accurately .
Close to the Sun and reflecting 70 % of its light , Venus would be a dazzling sight to the naked eye , with subtle yellowish patterns and two white polar collars .
Patterns of circulating currents are most visible at violet and ultraviolet wavelengths .
If a spectrum is known , an accurate color value can be computed .
This is accomplished by converting to CIE XYZ and then into standard sRGB which modern monitors are designed to display correctly .
On the left is the spectrum of Venus as seen from space , measured by the Cassini probe .
On the right is the spectrum of the zenith sky , measured by V.I. Moroz from the Venera 11 lander .
Wavelengths plotted are 360 to 830 nm .
Full spectral data is rarely available , and instead we must use views through color filters .
Above , the Galileo probe captured Venus through a clear filter ( left ) and through a 410 nm violet filter , which reveals the subtle yellow and white clouds .
Unfortunately , many different color images could result in the same two clear and violet signals above .
Even when so - called red , green and blue filters are used , the problem is just as difficult , because the filters are not really the right red green and blue to just plug into the channels of a color display .
Theoretically , information from the two images above and from the Cassini spectrum could be combined using Bayesian decision theory , to compute the most probable color image .
If colors are estimated correctly , there is a final issue of tone mapping .
How bright does the image appear to the eye in a given context .
The image above is the best color image of Venus I 've found , showing the planet as it would likely appear to a human observer in space .
It was made by Turkish astronomer A. Tayfun Oner , using the two color channels from the Galileo camera , and a third interpolated channel .
The images above , by the talented amateur astronomer Damian Peach , show the appearance of Venus through a high - quality telescope , at various points in its orbit .
When Venus is close , its diameter is almost visible to the naked eye ( one minute of arc ) , but it is then lit from behind .
