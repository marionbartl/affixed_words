It seems to be a race to see which Cbank will have Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœzeroÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ interest rates first .
Governor King surprised everyone yesterday , and NFP is expected to surprise us this morning .
Employment and growth destruction is morphing at a phenomenal rate .
The real economy is yet to feel the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœtrue pinchÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ of the credit debacle , but the signs are there and the next few months will be an eye opener to many .
Policy makers will have to continue to force rates lower for the foreseeable future .
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 12 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Policy makers are answering the call .
European Cbanks collectively slashed lending rates to try and head off a deeper recession .
The BOE reduced its key rate by the most in 16 - years to 3 % .
Trichet and his policy makers lowered by 50 bp to 3.25 % , while at an unscheduled meeting the Swiss matched by the same margin to 2 % .
With respect to the BOE , market expectations were for a 50 bp cut , not a bold a move as the one we witnessed .
No one expected 150 bp because of the possibility of spreading panic into the market .
Analysts continue to predict further cuts over the coming months , but the next cut will probably be delivered in the 1st Q of next year .
Cbanks are perfectly aware that it takes a few quarters to see the first effects of more accommodative policy on the real economy .
One should expect the timing of the next rate move to be led by confidence indicators and expectations surveys , along with the usual credit and market conditions .
Governor King sounds very downbeat on the prospects for growth and he reiterated that inflation risks have receded .
UK growth points to one of the most severe recessions in half a century and justifies KingÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s action and views .
Trichet is already leaning towards further rate cuts after yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s decision .
He said he cannot rule it out because the global financial crisis may lead to an extended economic slump .
His following statement was dovish and expects prices to stabilize next year .
Risks to growth remain skewed to the downside .
It has been difficult for the ECB to back peddle from its hawkish tone 2 months ago ; they really could not cut deeper this time , if they had done so they would have lost a lot of credibility .
But , they have finally deviated from their inflation stance and not a moment too soon .
No ray of sunshine from US data again yesterday , we registered the highest continuing jobless claims in a quarter a century .
US job markets are showing signs of deteriorating at a faster pace than either of the two previous recessions .
Continuing claims surged to 3.84 m from an upwardly revised previous weeks reading of 3.7 m .
Analysts note that continuing claims remain highly correlated with the unemployment rate and now anticipate an Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœuglyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ NFP number this morning ( - 250 k ) .
Other data does not bode well for this am .
The deterioration in US productivity growth strengthens the risks of Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœaggressive job shedding in the months aheadÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Digging deeper , economy - wide output per hour worked grew by +1.1 % in 3rd Q. Stronger or faster than anticipated , but downward revisions to previous quarters negate this .
A bit of an eye open was that hours worked fell - 2.7 % , which is the fastest pace of shedding to date .
As a result , productivity adjusted labor costs rose sharply ( +3.6 % ) , and analysts point out that this will be dealt with going forward by employers .
The US$ currently is lower against the EUR +0.78 % , GBP +1.10 % , CHF +0.48 % and JPY +0.35 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.37 % and AUD +0.78 % .
Surprisingly stronger than expected Canadian building permits ( +13.4 % ) gave the loonie a temporary boost in the morning session yesterday , but alas , like all commodity currencies pared most of the weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s earlier gains as both equities and commodities slumped .
A lower PMI reading ( 52.2 vs. 61 ) obviously did not help the situation .
The market is trying to decipher the depth of the BOE and ECB cuts ; will it have any impact in the medium term ?
Traders are waiting patiently for this morningÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s North American employment numbers .
Any further downside for the black - stuff and we will be revisiting the highs of the week once again .
The AUD $ found some traction in the O/N session as global equities rebounded and the perception that the Fed will need to slash interest rates again soon to combat a deepening recession Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœstate sideÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
In recessionary times , commodity currencies trade under pressure and the AUD is no different .
Despite having a weekly advance , traders remain better sellers on rallies for now ( 0.6708 ) .
Crude is higher O/N ( $ 62.37 up +160c ) .
No surprises yesterday , Crude prices mirrored the fall of global equities .
The erosion of future demand continues to have a chokehold on the black stuff pricing .
The trading range has been Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœto and froÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ all week settling close to a new 19 - month low .
Oil and equity markets continue to trade under pressure in the course of a deepening concern that the economic slowdown is hurting corporate earnings .
From its highs at the beginning of the summer oil has managed to retreat close to 60 % and is threatening to break further on the downside .
Some traders see the black stuff retreating back to the $ 50 level once again .
This will only heighten the urgency amongst OPEC members .
Weaker US fundamental data and this weeks unexpected EIA report remains bearish in the short term for crude .
All this despite the IEA saying yesterday that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœoil - import prices will rebound to an average of $ 100 a barrel between 2008 and 2015 and that the threat of a supply crunchÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ remains .
The market is basically digesting the borrowing rate cuts this week and trying to comprehend what this will do to demand in the medium term .
The weekly EIA report showed that US gas supplies rose + 1.12 m barrels to 196.1 m w/w vs. an expected +650 k .
Inventories of crude rose +54 k barrels to 311.9 m .
Analysts had forecasted a rise of +1 m barrels .
Euro - land has already declared the region ’s economy has entered a recession and will stagnate next year .
Rate cuts last week by the three biggest oil users , the US , China and Japan , has so far failed to inspire confidence that a recession can be avoided .
Global equities and OPEC wanting to meet again next month has provided little support .
OPEC indicated that they may call a new meeting if prices fail to react to the - 1.5 m barrel - a - day output cut it announced last month .
LetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s see how investors will interpret a surprising NFP .
Same theme but a different day , Gold found no traction yesterday after weaker US data had convinced investors that due to the state of the US economy , it will eventually reduce demand for commodities .
In this mornings session with the greenback under pressure , traders have been happy to own the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as an alternative investment .
The Nikkei closed 8,583 down - 316 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,846 up +32 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,325 up +53 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year Treasury yields eased 1 bp yesterday ( 3.70 % ) and are little changed O/N. Traders main focus this week was to unwind the steepener .
There was very little action ahead of this mornings NFP numbers .
But , the long end of the curve remains better offered as traders prepared for the US government ’s auctions of $ 55 b of debt next week .
All bets are off , until after 8.30 am .

Moscow is to give 10 MiG - 29 fighter jets to Lebanon free of charge , says Russia 's state news agency Interfax .
The head of the Russia 's defence co-operation body , Mikhail Dmitriyev , said the consignment was " a form of military and technical assistance " .
" We view the Lebanese army as the main guarantor of this nation 's stability , therefore the armed forces of this country must be strengthened , " he said .
Delivery of the jets to Lebanon will also be paid for by the Russians .
Mr Dmitriyev said the jets would be fully repaired and upgraded before being delivered .
He added that the two countries were also discussing a possible sale of Russian armour to Beirut , reported Reuters .
He said this was possible because of Lebanon 's recent stability .
Lebanon 's military capability is greatly outweighed by Arab neighbour Syria , with which is has a history of sometimes strained relations , and the Israel which lies to the south .
Lebanon and Israel have never signed a peace treaty and Israeli fighter jets continually violate Lebanese airspace in what the Israeli military describes as reconnaissance missions , but which are condemned by the United Nations .
Jeph 's Top 10 Records of 2008 !
Yep , it 's techno .
It 's good techno !
And I refuse to ever , EVER use the term " blog house . "
I have no idea what El Guincho is singing about and I do n't care .
Simple yet cunningly arranged , delightfully loose in a way that most sample - based music is n't , and catchy as all hell .
It 's what Animal Collective would sound like if they were interested in having a good time at shows .
This Will Destroy
You 's earlier records , while pretty , always struck me as a little derivative , a little too close to their sonic cousins Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky .
But on their self - titled album they 've not only found their own voice , they 're using it to put out their best material yet .
It 's a lovely union of post - rocky guitar lines and glitchy electronics that never gets overly bombastic and features plenty of timbral variation ( two things Explosions in the Sky could really stand to learn ) .
TWDY have proven that there 's still life in instrumental post -rock .
I gotta admit , I miss the harsh , trash - can reverb they put on the guitars for From Mars to Sirius .
And " A Sight To Behold " is , to put it kindly , rather incongruous .
But on the whole this is another Gojira record - vicious , pummeling , and epic .
" The Art of Dying " has the best guitar riff I 've heard all year , and that one track is worth the price of the entire album .
Did I mention they have the best vocalist in metal right now ?
Dude 's voice SLAYS .
Antony Hegarty 's voice is liquid gold .
Put him in front of a classically - minded ( I 'm talking Detroit and Chicago here , not Bach and Wagner ) techno producer and you have a really , REALLY sexy vocal house album that should appeal to indie rock fans and dance music enthusiasts alike .
Album opener " Time Will " is the entire record in a nutshell .
If that track does n't kill you , I do n't know what will .
Credit to Marnie Stern for getting me interested in indie rock again .
I like to think of this record as the spiritual successor to Don Caballero - Don Cab 's technical fireworks and prickly melodies are still there , but Stern 's sing - song , motivational - speaker lyrics add a warmth and personality that Don Cab never had .
It 's math - rock for the Deerhoof kids , or Deerhoof for the math - rock kids , or indie - rock for people like me who are sick of skinny white dudes playing Telecasters badly .
A sincerely loving homage to the 1980s , the newest M83 album finds the band fine - tuning their synths - meets - guitars sound to bring a new level of personality and texture to each track .
Where previous efforts sometimes fell flat , every track on this record evokes its own distinct personality - chilly , inviting , reflective , anthemic , they 're all unique .
Although the fake toms on " Skin of the Night " still weird me out a little .
A true techno long - player in the same vein as LCD Soundsystem 's 45:33 , Where You Go I Go Too is perhaps the ultimate expression of the Lindstrom headspace - gorgeous , cavernous ambient passages intertwining between heady space - techno anthems that on their own would be wonderful tracks , but work even better woven into the whole of this album .
There 's a lot more melody to be found here than in your average click - clack minimal techno track or bleepy - bloopy space - disco wankfest - the delay - ridden marimba line that forms the background of track 1 would be the centerpiece of a lesser song .
Here it 's just another section of the gorgeous , immersive whole .
Holy GOD what a metal record .
I hardly even know where to begin describing this one .
It 's cut from a black metal template , sure , but it goes so far beyond that .
The arrangements are huge , complex , and refreshingly inventive .
I have n't ever heard the bass play such a key role in the harmonic movement of a metal song , and the twin guitars create cascading sheets of sheets that most black metal bands only aspire to .
The drumming 's fantastic , too- intense , technically impressive , and always tasteful .
And I do n't have enough praise for the recording quality - like my OTHER favorite black metal band Wolves in the Throne Room , Krallice prove that a well - recorded black metal band is infinitely more enjoyable than some dude trying to be " authentic " by using a broken four - track in his bathroom .
Tracks " Wretched Wisdom " and " Cnestorial " seem to get most of the press , but for my money " Energy Chasms " is the best metal song I 've heard all year and an album standout .
I can only imagine how hard these guys slay live .
Easily the most accessible , instantly enjoyable album of 2008 , In Ghost Colors sounds like an 80s synth - pop record dragged and dropped ( notice I avoided the obvious pun on the band 's name there ) into the new millenium .
Standout tracks " Hearts on Fire " and " Lights and Music " have yet to get old for me ( the breakdown and subsequent buildup on the latter track kills me every time ) .
In Ghost Colours is strong from start to finish and reflects a band supremely comfortable and confident in the songs and the sound they 're putting forth .
Dunno if they 'll ever top this one .
Honorable mentions , in no particular order :
On the bumpy lane that passes for the main shopping street on the tiny island of Sark , the Barclay twins ' man is pinning up an election poster .
It features a positive message about the economy , but Kevin Delaney is worried the poster will be torn down by political opponents as soon as night falls .
Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay , the multimillionaire owners of the Telegraph and the Ritz , are not everyone 's favourite tycoons on this picturesque chunk of rock 80 miles off the British mainland .
For the last 450 years , Sark has been a feudal state , the last in the western world .
But the law has changed , mainly at the prompting of the Barclay brothers , who live in a castle on an even smaller island called Brecqhou a few hundred metres off Sark .
The reform means Sark's " seigneur " , the feudal lord , is being stripped of many powers and rights and for the first time a largely elected parliament is being formed .
Nominations for " conseillers " , the MPs , close this week and Sark 's 473 electors go to the polls early next month .
But two bitterly opposed factions have emerged .
Broadly , one supports the Barclay twins , DB and FB as their loyalists call them .
They are ploughing millions of pounds into the main island , refurbishing that bumpy main drag and buying up most of Sark 's hotels .
The twins argue that this investment is creating jobs and protecting Sark 's future .
A second faction favours the seigneur , Michael Beaumont , and is worried that the Barclay twins are trying to seize control of the island and will change its character for ever .
This split is causing terrible tension amongst Sark 's 600 souls as election day nears .
On street corners and in smoky backrooms - they still smoke in pubs here - plots are being hatched and alliances formed as the factions fight for control of " chief pleas , " the island 's parliament .
It is easy to poke fun at the traditions of Sark , where cars and lorries are banned and street lights non-existent .
Such as the insistence of some landowners on keeping muskets to defend the place should it come under attack , as their ancestors were required to do .
And the bargain fee the seigneur has always been required to hand over to the Queen for his fiefdom - " one 20th part of a knight 's fee " - or £ 1.79 in modern money .
But for the Sarkees the move to democracy is absolutely serious , and proving more than a little painful .
More than one had tears in their eyes as they told the Guardian how friends and neighbours had fallen out with each other .
Candidate Sandra Williams , manager of the island hall and community centre and a critic of the Barclays , says she has been shunned by lifelong friends .
" I 've lived here since I was five , " she said .
" People I went to school with will walk on the other side to avoid having to speak to me . "
The publicity - shy Barclays are not standing .
Instead , their man on Sark , Kevin Delaney , has put his name forward and is campaigning on the boost to the economy from the Barclays ' millions .
That poster he was pinning up contrasted Sark 's jobless figure - zero - with the rather less cheerful UK statistics .
Though the Barclays are not putting themselves forward , they did see fit this weekend to publish a glossy manifesto .
It detailed their vision for the island , including controversial schemes such as the building of a helipad and a funicular railway .
They also want further constitutional reform , believing the seigneur and the seneschal - the island 's judge - will still have too much power even after democracy kicks in .
In their manifesto the Barclays say they have not invested to make money but because they love Brecqhou and Sark .
They encourage Sarkees to stand - and align themselves with their manifesto .
" We urge you not to vote for those who disagree fundamentally .
They will ruin its economy , its independence , indeed the future of Sark , " the twins write .
The manifesto's tone is positively conciliatory compared with that of the Sark News , a bulletin published with the approval of the twins that is abrasively critical of their opponents .
In its November issue , for instance , it brands seigneur loyalist Edric Baker a " feudal talibanist " .
Baker , one of those who admits to still keeping a musket close at hand , is hurt but is putting himself forward for election .
" I 'm not going to be put off by anyone , " he said .
The deep worry is that if the twins ' supporters do not win power , the brothers may be tempted to stop investing .
As they own so much , it could be disastrous if they pull out .
At the seigneur 's beautiful 17th century home , complete with watch tower for signalling to Guernsey , Michael Beaumont , now 81 , admits the last few years have " not been pleasant politically " .
He is upset that he will lose so much of his power in chief pleas but hopes that once the election has taken place , the fighting will die down .
So is democracy a good thing ?
He chuckles .
" It 's a very broad question , " he
says , diplomatically .
" With reservations - yes . "
The new order
In the 16th century Elizabeth I made Sark a fiefdom to be held in perpetuity by Helier De Carteret , the first seigneur .
In return he had to maintain 40 households and " men with arms " to protect a strategically important outpost .
The seigneur presided over the island 's parliament , the chief pleas , and seats were allocated to the heads of the 40 households .
Changes have been made over the years , with some " deputies " elected to chief pleas , but in recent times it became clear the parliament was not compliant with European human rights legislation .
The law was reformed and the first elections will take place on December 10 .
Twenty - eight representatives - " conseillers " - will be elected in a secret ballot .
They will run the island through committees .
At midnight on January 8 the historic old chief pleas will die and at 9 am next day the first democratically elected politicians will swear their oaths of allegiance .
There are only two hard things in Computer Science : cache invalidation and naming things .
— Phil Karlton
Karlton ’s quote is n’t just for techies .
Interface designers are in the business of naming things too .
We ’re copywriters .
It matters if we call something an Event or a Milestone or a Deadline .
And it also goes deeper than that .
The names we choose shape our software .
They define the way we think about it and the way our customers interact with it .
To understand why this all matters , you should meet two important ideas from the programming world : domains and domain languages .
When you ’re working on software , the domain is the life situation your software is involved with .
Basecamp ’s domain is the life situation where people are trying to collaborate together on a project .
i Photo ’s domain is that situation where someone has a collection of photos and they want to look at those photos and share the photos with others .
Now here ’s where it gets interesting .
Each application has a way of approaching its domain .
Software designers think of a domain like a big cake and cut it into slices .
Basecamp cuts project management into Messages , Files , Milestones , To - Dos .
Photo organizers before iPhoto ‘ 08 always sliced their domain into Photos and Albums .
In both cases , the software designers take a complicated life situation and boil it down to a few easy pieces with names .
No domain comes pre-sliced — unless you ’re blindly copying someone else ’s software .
It ’s up to the designer to cut the pieces and give them names .
This process results in a domain language .
A domain language is the set of words that reflect the way you cut up a domain .
It consists of the pieces you sliced and the names you chose to give them .
This language defines an application and makes it special .
And for the last couple years Apple has been innovating iPhoto ’s domain language very intentionally .

In many places throughout the world , gasoline ( or petrol , as it's also called ) has always been expensive , ( consider roughly five American dollars to the gallon in the UK , for example ) but in the United States , we 've been relatively fortunate , enjoying prices in the mid to high two dollar range and , even just a few years before that , just less than two dollars for every gallon we pumped into our gas - guzzling road hogs .
Lately , though , that 's changed , and with prices climbing past the three dollar range , the on - the - road American is finally feeling the pinch , and he / she 's not the only one who 's suffering !
Consider for a moment all the industries effected by the increase in gasoline costs .
Practically everybody has to drive to get to work , so cutting down on non-essential driving puts less miles on the car and cuts into the number of cars popping into the lube shop or repair garage for oil changes and maintenance .
A rise is gas prices translates into a rise in the cost of everything , and I do mean everything , that gets shipped , carted , or otherwise shuffled from point A to point B , whether it be through the use of your local delivery service , a cross-country semi burning rubber across several states , or a jumbo jet flying packages and cheap plastic knickknacks from China to Los Angeles .
The computer this article was written on is a perfect example ; while made up of a handful of different materials , a good deal of it is still plastic , a petroleum product .
It was shipped in plastic , ( with a couple plastic compact discs ) on a truck ( which burns gas ) from a warehouse full of all kinds of plastic components that were all shipped from different factories using a variety of means ( all requiring gas ) and utilizing machines that require oil or grease to stay lubricated and , in some cases , even to operate their hydraulic components .
And the power to operate these machines has to come from somewhere too , right ?
Oh sure , between nuclear , solar , hydroelectric , coal and a host of other means of generating electricity , the chances that a powerplant burning petroleum products might be powering that factory are slim ( especially these days ) but consider all the plastic components , all the grease and oil used to build and maintain the machines that generate our power , sending it shooting down power lines that also have their fair share of components that originally started out as crude oil in some form or another .
But it does n't end there , oh no !
Those same lines that power the factory , the warehouse , and even my computer have to be manufactured somewhere , shipped , etcetera , not to mention the petroleum products used when something in the loop needs maintenance , between the fuel used to get the workers to their jobs , the plastic parts they haul with them , the gasoline pumped into the service vehicle , and a dozen other things , it quickly becomes clear that not only are we completely and totally dependent on this black goo that we 're pumping out of the ground at an exponential ( and yet strangely inefficient ) rate , but that we 're locked in a vicious cycle of dependence that 's going to prove to be a hard habit to break .
David Letterman may not be the greatest late night host ever ( sorry , nobody 's ever going to top Craig Ferguson ) , but thereâs one type of interaction in which Letterman absolutely shines : dealing with people he has no respect for .
If Letterman thinks the guest is n't worth his time ( and he 'll let you know within the first thirty seconds ) , you 'd be well advised to set the Tivo and microwave a bowl of popcorn , because shit is about to get hilariously awkward .
I used to think it was his becoming old , crotchety and possibly senile that gave rise to this bizarre streak of gut - busting faux pax , but the videos gathered below prove without a doubt that Letterman 's been a dismissive prick since the very beginning .
Well played , sir .

The simpering sarcasm that passes for Simmonsâ anger , like a dandelion head bursting in your face on a crisp Spring morning .
The fact that Letterman mocks Simmonsâ clothes is made all the more poignant when Simmons stands up a second later to reveal a lovingly sequined glitter shirt handmade in Daveâs honor .
The explosion .
Itâs an excellent enough moment to make me wish all TV segments ended with minor appliance fires .
It would sure liven up the local news .

Simmons isnât the kind of guy who demands a lot of respect to begin with .
Itâs like how in nature , animals sometimes display bright colors as a warning that theyâre dangerous .
But , you know , the opposite .
At the beginning , you can almost tell yourself Daveâs genuinely faking interest .
Sure thereâs some sort of dangling tray fouling up the segment , but heâs not about to let that ruffle him .
Unfortunately Simmons use of the phrase â go - go kartâ is an offense he apparently canât let slide by without comment .
I think I summed up my thoughts on Bill OâReilly fairly well by spending a week making
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Justice Department on Monday plans to unveil charges against five former Blackwater Worldwide security guards stemming from a 2007 shooting that killed 17 Iraqis in Baghdad , according to several sources with knowledge of the investigation .
An Iraqi woman looks at a blood - stained car of two women killed in the 2007 Nisoor Square shooting .
The five former guards will turn themselves in to FBI authorities in Utah on Monday , according to two other sources close to the case .
One of the guards is from Utah .
One of the sources said defense attorneys decided to have all of them surrender in one location rather than in their various home states , or in Washington , where the federal grand jury handed up the charges last week .
Both sources said the guards ' surrender in Utah is a matter of convenience , and is likely to be followed by an aggressive legal defense .
One of the sources said defense attorneys plan to fight " over venue first , " then argue that U.S. law does not pertain to the actions of these guards .
" Why in the world would the government manufacture a venue in Washington , D.C. , when they know none of the men had been there or lived there ? " the source told CNN .
The Justice Department refused comment on the case because the charges are under seal .
The Justice Department was considering manslaughter , assault and weapons charges , sources with knowledge of the case previously told CNN .
The State Department , which employed Blackwater to protect U.S. diplomats and other employees , also had no comment .
Blackwater declined comment until an official announcement is made .
The men were identified as Donald Ball , 26 , of West Valley City , Utah ; Dustin Heard , 27 , of Knoxville , Tennessee ; Evan Liberty , 26 , of Rochester , New Hampshire ; Nick Slatten , 25 , of Sparta , Tennessee ; and Paul Slough , 29 , of Keller , Texas .
Two people with knowledge of the case said Friday that a sixth security guard is in plea negotiations .
Blackwater has been told by the government the company will not face charges , according to several sources with knowledge of the case .
Iraqi authorities accused Blackwater guards of killing 17 civilians and wounding nearly 30 in the September 2007 shootings in Nisoor Square in western Baghdad .
Blackwater said its guards were protecting a U.S. diplomatic convoy when they came under attack from armed insurgents .
The guards returned fire , Blackwater said .
But an Iraqi investigation called the killings " premeditated murder " and accused the guards of firing on civilians indiscriminately .
The first U.S. soldiers to arrive on the scene told military investigators they found no evidence the contractors were fired upon , a source familiar with a preliminary U.S. military report told CNN .
The FBI also investigated the incident and determined the shootings were unprovoked and Blackwater personnel used excessive force , according to a senior Justice Department source speaking on background because the case remains sealed until Monday .
None of the guards has worked for Blackwater since 2007 , said company spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell .
An attorney for Ball said Sunday his client " committed no crime " but would turn himself in Monday .
" We are confident that any jury will see this for what it is -- a politically motivated prosecution to appease the Iraqi government , " attorney Steve McCool said .
" It has been reported that Mr. Ball will be charged with firearms offenses that carry mandatory penalties of up to life imprisonment .
It would be outrageous to charge my client with offenses relating to guns issued by the State Department . "
In a statement , attorney David Schertler said : " We strongly disagree with the Department of Justice 's decision to bring charges against Dustin Heard .
Any charges brought against Mr. Heard are wrong and unjust . "
Slough 's attorney , Mark Hulkower , said he is " an honorable young man who served this country with distinction for many years . "
Hulkower said Slough " should not face criminal charges for defending himself and others from insurgents in Iraq , and we are disappointed that federal prosecutors have taken it on themselves to second - guess how these brave young men fought for their lives .
" We are confident Mr. Slough will be exonerated , " Hulkower said .
The complex legal case has been dogged by difficulties and may present a major challenge to federal prosecutors .
Among the potential problems is that the law under which the charges are expected to be brought covers contractors working for the U.S. military , but the Blackwater guards were contracted by the State Department .
Some independent legal experts question whether U.S. courts have jurisdiction in this case .
Also muddying the waters are alleged assurances of immunity given to the guards by State Department Diplomatic Security Agents investigating the incident before the FBI got involved .
The State Department says its agents did not offer blanket immunity from criminal prosecution but only promised statements the guards made on the scene could not be used against them in any prosecution .
But when the investigation was turned over to the Justice Department to examine possible criminal activity , FBI agents discovered some guards believed they were immune from prosecution and therefore refused to be interviewed again , complicating the FBI investigation .
The incident heightened tensions between U.S. and Iraqi government officials and contributed to a protracted debate over the extent of immunity that U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors have from Iraqi laws .
Security contractors had immunity from Iraqi law under a provision put in place in the early days of the U.S. - led occupation of Iraq .
But starting next year , under a U.S. - Iraq security agreement that Iraq approved Thursday , Iraq will have the " primary right to exercise jurisdiction " over U.S. contractors and their employees .
The State Department , which employed Blackwater to protect U.S. diplomats and other employees , renewed Blackwater 's contract this year over strong objections from the Iraqi government .

All About Iraq • Blackwater Worldwide
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. military operations , including the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , have cost $ 904 billion since 2001 and could top $ 1.7 trillion by 2018 , even with big cuts in overseas troop deployments , a report said on Monday .
A new study released by the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , or CSBA , said the Iraq conflict ’s $ 687 billion price tag alone now exceeds the cost of every past U.S. war except for World War II , when expenditures are adjusted for inflation .
With another $ 184 billion in spending for Afghanistan included , the two conflicts surpass the cost of the Vietnam War by about 50 percent , the report said .
CSBA said U.S. military operations have already reached $ 904 billion since 2001 , including the two wars as well as stepped - up military security activities at home and the payout in war - related veterans ’ benefits .
The estimate includes allocated spending into 2009 .
In contrast , a separate Government Accountability Office study released on Monday said Congress has provided the Pentagon with $ 808 billion for the Bush administration ’s global war on terrorism from 2001 through September 30 , 2008 , including $ 508 billion for Iraq and $ 118 billion for Afghanistan , the Philippines and the Horn of Africa .
The CSBA study said U.S. taxpayers could pay another $ 416 billion to $ 817 billion over the next decade , even if the combined troop deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan were slashed to between 30,000 and 75,000 .
That would bring the cost for both wars to between $ 1.3 trillion and $ 1.72 trillion for 2001 through 2018 , and even higher when federal borrowing costs are included , CSBA said .
The United States has 143,000 troops in Iraq and 31,000 in Afghanistan .
Washington has agreed to withdraw its forces from Iraq by the end of 2011 , under a newly signed agreement with the Iraqi government .
But U.S. officials are planning to add more than 20,000 forces in Afghanistan within 12 to 18 months .
One reason for the ballooning costs is the Bush administration ’s habit of funding the wars through supplemental budget requests , a practice that CSBA said has eroded congressional oversight and weakened the Pentagon ’s long - term planning and budgeting processes .
The Bush administration and Congress have also pursued significant tax cuts since 2001 and robust spending increases , rather than following the established approach of funding war costs by combining tax increases with curbs on domestic spending and borrowing .
“ The Bush administration has taken a starkly different approach to financing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” the CSBA study said in its executive summary .
In fact , CSBA said war cost projections rise significantly when interest payments on the federal debt are included in the calculations .
Overall costs would reach $ 1.4 trillion to $ 1.8 trillion from 2001 through 2018 if borrowing were assumed to cover 10 percent of underlying military operations .
CSBA said war cost projections would climb to between $ 2 trillion and $ 2.5 trillion , if all costs were covered by borrowing .

When listening to the claims of creationists on the Texas State Board of Education , a political thesaurus would be helpful .
The board ’s far - right bloc has asked the people of Texas to have a little faith .
Its members are not , they claim , interested in having public school science classes teach students about creationism , “ intelligent design ” or any other religious concepts .
At a November 19 hearing on proposed public school science curriculum standards , Chairman Don McLeroy , R - Bryan , proclaimed that he did n’t know of any board members who want science classes to do so .
McLeroy and fellow creationists on the board say they ’re interested only in exposing students to “ scientific weaknesses of the theory of evolution . ”
But that ’s not what they ’ve said in voter guides from the Free Market Foundation ( the Texas affiliate of the far - right pressure group Focus on the Family ) and , in some cases , when they were running for office .
Let ’s work backward in time , shall we ?
Click on the thumbnail image below to see a 2008 Free Market Foundation Voter Guide for the State Board of Education :
So far so good .
The far - right bloc ’s members who were up for re-election were all on message – Terri Leo , R - Spring ; David Bradley , R- Beaumont ; Barbara Cargill , R- The Woodlands ; and Gail Lowe , R - Lampasas , all said they “ Strongly Favor ” forcing publishers to include “ strengths and weaknesses of the theory of evolution ” in biology textbooks .
“ Intelligent design ” / creationism is n’t even mentioned .
But if you go back to a 2006 Free Market Foundation Voter Guide , you will find that candidates were asked whether they support teaching “ intelligent design ” alongside evolution in public schools :
Maybe news of the Kitzmiller v. Dover ruling in 2005 had not yet reached some board members , so three key current members of the far - right bloc — Ken Mercer , R - San Antonio ; McLeroy ; and Cynthia Dunbar , R - Richmond — all said they “ Strongly Favor ” the teaching of “ intelligent design ” as a “ viable ” theory in public school science classrooms .
That same year , Dunbar told the Austin American - Statesman that she supported teaching “ intelligent design ” in public schools .
The concept , she said , is “ at least as viable , if not more so , than evolution . ”
( “ Five from GOP gun for 2 state education seats , ” Austin American - Statesman , Feb. 20 , 2006 .
A link apparently is no longer available , but Burnt Orange Report noted the same story at the time here . )
In the same American - Statesman pre-primary election article , Mercer said he also supported teaching “ intelligent design ” alongside evolution in public schools : “ We should let kids hear both sides of the story . ”
If we keep following the trail , however , we go back to those heady days of creationism in 2002 – when politicians did n’t have to soft - peddle their rejection of science and support for a 6,000 - year - old Earth with code words like “ weaknesses ” or “ intelligent design . ”
A 2002 Free Market Foundation Voter Guide prefaced a question about “ intelligent design ” with the label “ Creationism ” :
Surprise !
( Or not . )
Leo , Bradley , McLeroy and Lowe all indicated that they “ Strongly Favor ” teaching creationism in public schools — not “ weaknesses of evolution , ” but creationism , the real deal .
So what happened ?
Did these board members change their minds about teaching creationism sometime between the 2002 and 2008 elections ?
Of course not .
This is a time - lapsed visual history of the political evolution of modern creationism .
Bottom line :
An “ intelligent design ” supporter today is a creationist with a thesaurus .
And a backer of “ weaknesses of evolution ” is an “ intelligent design ” supporter who has read the Kitzmiller v. Dover decision .
Same motives .
Same end game .
Same politicians who “ Strongly Favor . ”
It ’s hard , then , to take the McLeroy bloc seriously when its members raise their hands and pledge that they just want to make sure students get all the facts about evolution .
Who do they think they ’re fooling ?
The reality is that they are trying to dumb down our schoolchildren ’s science curriculum in an effort to promote their own personal and ideological agendas .
Do n’t let them get away with it .
And by the way , TFN sends a big “ thank you ” to the Free Market Foundation for documenting the positions of these creationist chameleons so thoroughly over the years .
Anyone want to guess what the group ’s 2010 Voter Guide is going to say ?
Early money is on :
ACADEMIC FREEDOM : Support the right of teachers to express their personal views on scientific theories on the origins of life .
Any guesses which state board members will “ Strongly Favor ” that ?

Adding a simple view to CouchDB
CouchDB views are sort of like scripts that run inside CouchDB which manipulate and massage the documents inside the database into a ( key , value ) pair , then return those pairs which contain keys that match a query you run against the view .
When I started playing with CouchDB I could n't work out how to add views , thinking that there was something I was missing .
To show how to create a view and add it to the database let 's take an example problem .
Say you have several documents that describe articles in your database .
{ " _id " : " monkeys-are - awesome " , " _rev " : " 1534115156 " , " type " : " article " , " title " : " Monkeys are awesome " , " posted_at " : " 2008-09-14T20:45:14Z " , " tags " : [ " monkeys " , " awesome " ] , " status " : " Live " , " author_id " : " craig@barkingiguana.com " , " updated_at " : " 2008-09-14T21:23:59 Z " , " body " : " The article body would go here ... " }
You might create a view that would give you the id and title of all documents in the database .
To do this you would ask CouchDB to map each existing document to a new document containing the document id and the document title .
This takes the form of a method which accepts each document as an argument and returns the document or result that you 'd like to get back from the view .
function ( doc ) { emit ( null , { ' id ' : doc._id , ' title ' : doc.title } ) ; }
For just now ignore that the first argument to emit is null .
It 's for emitting the key that will be used to sort and filter results .
I 'll cover it in my next post .
While writing a view it can be useful to filter documents so that you only get the desired types emitted - in this case I only want the id and title of article documents .
Documents that represent , for example , comments , may not have a title attribute .
function ( doc ) { if ( doc.type == ' article ' ) { emit ( null , { ' id ' : doc._id , ' title ' : doc.title } ) ; } }
Adding this view to the database it pretty simple : just add a design document to the database .
Design documents are just the same as any another document you 'd add to CouchDB except they must have an identifier that starts _design / for example _design / articles .
To insert the document you can use the built - in admin client , Futon , which is available at http://localhost:5984/_utils/ .
The full JSON document for a view which gives back the id and title for all documents in the database is shown below .
{ " _id " : " _design / articles " , " _rev " : " 42351258 " , " language " : " javascript " , " views " : { " titles " : { " map " : " function ( doc ) { emit ( null , { ' id ' : doc._id , ' title ' : doc.title } ) ; } " } } }
Fire up Futon , access your database , add a new document and paste the view in .
Once installed you can easily see the results of a view by clicking the drop - down that Futon shows when viewing a database .
It 's in the top right and it 's labelled " select view " .
To get the raw JSON documents returned by your view you 'll need to access your database directly .
If your database was called " blog " then you could access the above view at http://localhost:5984/blog/_view/articles/titles .
There can be many views in one design documents , each with a different name , and each returning different kinds of results .
Here 's one that 's got that a few views that use the soon - to - be discussed " key " emitted .
COMMENTARY :
President - elect Barack Obama ’s plan to pass the Freedom of Choice Act is setting up a showdown with the Vatican .
“ The first thing I will do as president is sign the Freedom of Choice Act , ” he said at an address before Planned Parenthood on July 17 , 2007 .
And if he does , it will trigger a harsh response from Pope Benedict XVI , as well as a political revolt among practicing American Catholics .
Mr. Obama signing the Freedom of Choice Act ( FOCA ) “ would be the equivalent of a war , ” a senior Vatican official told Time magazine last week .
“ It would be like saying , ‘ We ’ve heard the Catholic Church and we have no interest in their concerns . ’ ” At a recent Baltimore meeting , the U.S. Catholic bishops pledged to challenge Mr. Obama on his defense of abortion rights .
FOCA seeks to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law .
It would remove all restrictions on abortion in state statutes - including restraints on late - term abortions and parental notification laws .
It would also entrench taxpayer funding of abortion .
Moreover , it would compel Catholic health - care facilities to provide the heinous procedure .
In short , it constitutes a fundamental assault on basic Catholic doctrine .
Mr. Obama is a radical on abortion .
He is vehemently pro-choice , even opposing the ban on partial - birth abortion .
While in the Illinois state legislature , Mr. Obama voted against legislation protecting babies born in botched abortions .
Many liberal Catholics insist abortion is a single issue , a strange obsession of traditionalist diehards .
Besides , they argue there is so much more to Catholic social thought .
There is poverty , social justice , the environment and Iraq .
Abortion is only one among many concerns shared by Catholics .
They believe the church would be better served by focusing on creating a society based on communitarian values , the redistribution of power and wealth along more equitable lines , and an antiwar foreign policy .
Yet , abortion is the seminal moral issue of our time .
Nearly 50 million unborn babies have been murdered since Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in 1973 .
If one includes Europe , the number of dead fetuses is staggering .
Abortion has claimed more victims than either of the two great totalitarian ideologies of the 20th century , communism and Nazism .
Both Pope Benedict and the late Pope John Paul II have not only decried abortion as state - sanctioned infanticide , but explicitly - and repeatedly - said it must be outlawed :
There can be no compromise with such monstrous barbarism .
Abortion is akin to the Jewish question in Europe during the 1930s : Should an entire class of people be denied their essential humanity ?
Catholic supporters of Mr. Obama insist it is sufficient to reduce the number of abortions .
They say it ’s time to put the polarizing debate over Roe v.
Wade in the past , accept legalized abortion as a reality , and work toward compromise solutions such as promoting adoption .
This is like saying Western democracies should have come to terms with the Aryan racial laws of Nazi Germany , and sought to minimize the number of Jews sent to the gas ovens .
The argument is morally repugnant and politically naïve .
Ultimately , accommodation with evil never works .
We learned that with Nazi Germany and with slavery in this country .
Pro-Obama Catholics fail to recognize abortion is the centerpiece of the 1960s sexual revolution .
The secular left spearheaded this frontal assault on Christianity and traditional bourgeois civilization .
The result has been the proliferation of pornography , rampant permissiveness , the loss of innocence among many of our teens , the coarsening of our culture , sky - rocketing divorce rates , countless children raised in broken homes , and the deaths of millions due to sexually transmitted diseases .
Rather than a hedonistic utopia , liberal progressives have engendered a social nightmare .
They must defend abortion at all costs because their goal is to make sex consequence free , forging a revolutionary order characterized by moral relativism and unlimited sexual gratification .
But sex is never consequence free : it is laden with moral choices .
The Vatican is the last line of defense against the new Dark Age .
It is time for the Holy Father to personally speak out against FOCA and warn pro-choice Catholics in the Obama administration they will not only be refused communion at Mass but face excommunication .
No self - respecting , principled Catholic can or should support murder - regardless of who occupies the White House .

DAVOS , Switzerland ( Reuters ) - Germany and Britain called on Friday for a global economic watchdog with strengthened powers to prevent rather than react to financial crises that can spiral into worldwide recession .

Cooperation amongst international financial institutions has failed to ward off the worst financial crisis in decades and a new charter should be forged , German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the World Economic Forum in this Swiss ski resort .
“ This may even lead to a U.N. Economic Council , just as the Security Council was created after the Second World War , ” she said .
While she spoke , business leaders and financial policymakers met behind closed doors at Davos to lay the groundwork for new regulatory structures and seek consensus on shaping a global response to the economic and financial shocks .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , who is spearheading global financial reform as chairman of the Group of 20 leading developed and emerging economies , said bold action was needed to get banks lending again and repair the financial damage .
“ We are prepared to consider radical options .
The old ways have not worked .
We ’ve got to rebuild the financial system , ” he said .
The International Monetary Fund , set up by the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 , was outdated and focuses on cleaning up the mess when a country faces currency and debt crises .
A different approach was needed , he said .
“ What you ’ve got to do is have a preventative facility which deals with crisis prevention rather than crisis resolution , ” said Brown , who will host a G20 leaders summit in April .
Missing from the Davos debate over reshaping the international financial architecture for a globalize world , however , was the United States -- the world ’s largest power .
No officials from the newly installed Obama administration attended .
Yet U.S. President Barack Obama ’s rallying call for change was reflected in the words of political leaders at the four - day Davos gathering as they urged cooperation in solving problems .
“ What we are seeing at the moment is thousands of people in every country of the world losing their jobs , thousands in fear of losing their homes , thousands of businesses going under .
“ We can -- yes , your slogan -- yes we can do something about it .
And we ought to be working together , ” said UK ’s Brown .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon said Obama ’s election was
cause for optimism over global cooperation .
“ Now there is strong leadership in the United States , and people around the world need leadership , ” Calderon said .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has been making introductory telephone calls to fellow finance ministers .
In a discussion with UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling , the U.S. Treasury said : “ They agreed that significant international action is necessary for global growth to regain its footing . ”
SHOCK STATISTICS
The scope and cost of the crisis is huge -- $ 700 billion already spent to recapitalize banks and guarantees on banking borrowing and lending to the tune of a staggering $ 7 trillion .
The fiscal stimulus from governments is the largest in history at some $ 1.5 trillion , Brown said .
The newly rich economies are suffering too .
Global lending and investment to emerging markets has collapsed since 2007 , shrinking by $ 800 billion as investors and foreign banks repatriate money and retreat from global finance , he said .
Testimony to the problem is Russia , whose currency fell to fresh record lows on Friday forcing the central bank to raise some interest rates despite economic stagnation .
Brown warned against a protectionist retreat into “ financial mercantilism ” which would leave the world poorer and ultimately lead to more traditional forms of trade barriers .
For all the political rhetoric on the need to avoid protectionism , there was little sign that trade ministers attending Davos were approaching a breakthrough in the long - stalled Doha Round of world trade talks .
They were due to meet again Friday evening and into the weekend .
The United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon outlined multiple shocks absorbed by the world ’s poorest over the past year -- soaring energy and food prices and now a credit freeze .
He urged world leaders not to forget the world ’s poorest , whom he called the “ bottom billion . ”
“ We must stand by those who are most vulnerable , ” Ban said , flagging the risk that the crisis deflects attention away from climate change , water shortages , poverty and underdevelopment .
Gov. Paterson did n’t see the humor in a “ Saturday Night Live ” bit that mocked his blindness .
During the “ Weekend Update ” segment of NBC ’s irreverent comedy show , actor Fred Armisen played Paterson , imitating his wandering eye , gravelly voice and blunt , self - effacing demeanor .
But Paterson and advocates for the visually impaired did n’t appreciate stock blind jokes that had Armisen pretending to be disoriented and wandering aimlessly .
“ The governor engages in humor all the time , and he can certainly take a joke , ” Paterson ’s spokesman , Errol Cockfield , said today .
“ However , this particular ‘ Saturday Night Live ’ skit unfortunately chose to ridicule people with physical disabilities and imply that disabled people are incapable of having jobs with serious responsibilities . ”
Although Paterson is legally blind and has aides help him with some tasks , the governor is rarely out of step with his surroundings and seems comfortable in virtually every setting .
After Armisen ’s sketch with “ Weekend Update ” co-anchor Seth Meyers , the “ joke ” continued .
As longtime “ SNL ” player Amy Poehler was announcing her departure from the show to the audience , Armisen ’s Paterson started wandering , as if lost , in front of the camera .
“ Gov. Paterson . . . you ’re in the shot ! ” a chuckling Poehler said .
The skit could leave viewers with the impression that blind Americans cannot be competent employees , advocates for the disabled said .
“ When you have a perception problem like we have , you take these things a little more seriously , ” said Chris Danielsen , spokesman for the National Federation of the Blind .
“ We have 70 percent unemployment – and it ’s not because we ca n’t work .
Obviously , the governor of New York is blind , and he ’s doing the job .
Whenever you have a portrayal that calls the basic capacity of [ blind people ] into question , that ’s a potential problem . ”
Danielsen claims “ SNL ” has a long history of mocking the blind – going back to Eddie Murphy ’s Stevie Wonder impression and , more recently , a “ Weekend Update ” one - liner that hybrid cars are dangerous to blind people because they can’t hear the engine .
Paterson said through his spokesman that “ SNL ” writers can do better than taking pot shots at the blind .
“ The governor is sure that ‘ Saturday Night Live , ’ with all of its talent , can find a way to be funny without being offensive , ” Cockfield said .
“ Knowing the governor , he might even have some suggestions himself . ”
An NBC spokesman could not be reached for comment today .

John McCain unveiled a feisty new campaign speech Monday , but the talk of change and promise of a fist - shaking fight to November failed to allay Republican concerns that the presidential race may be slipping beyond his grasp .
With 21 days to the election , there was widespread agreement that Wednesday night ’s third and final presidential debate would be a crucial opportunity -- and perhaps the last one -- for the Arizona senator to change the course of a race that appears to be moving strongly in Democrat Barack Obama ’s direction .
But the consensus ended there .
For just about every Republican urging McCain to focus relentlessly on the economy , there was another who said McCain should continue questioning Obama ’s character by citing his association with William Ayers , a Vietnam - era radical .
Some said the GOP nominee needed to do both , and also bring up the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , Obama ’s controversial former pastor ; others called that a mistake and said that a mix of messages was part of McCain ’s problem .
“ This has been a very tactically oriented campaign that responds to the previous night ’s evening news , ” said David Winston , a Republican pollster who advises the GOP leadership in the House and Senate .
“ As a result , they ’ve gone tactical decision to tactical decision without any strategy to tie that together . ”
Advertisement
Republican Sen. John Ensign of Nevada , head of the party ’s senatorial campaign committee , said that McCain had to “ start getting a very clear , simple message on the economy .
Their team has not put that together so far . ”
Neither Ensign nor Winston ruled out a McCain victory .
But their unusually open criticism reflected a nervousness that is growing within party ranks as McCain seemingly shifts strategies on almost a daily basis .
He spent several days last week criticizing Obama ’s relationship with Ayers ( though he never brought up the matter in last Tuesday night ’s debate ) .
McCain then abruptly halted the criticism and even defended his Democratic rival when some of his own supporters responded with slurs .
Campaigning Monday in Virginia and North Carolina , states Republicans once took for granted , McCain made no mention of Ayers at his rallies and largely avoided the character questions he had raised previously .
Instead , he returned to the promise of change -- a major theme of last month ’s successful GOP convention -- and distanced himself not so subtly from the Bush administration .

“ We cannot spend the next four years as we have spent much of the last eight , ” McCain told a boisterous crowd of about 12,000 supporters in Virginia Beach .
“ The hour is late .
Our troubles are getting worse .
Our enemies watch .
We have to act immediately .
We have to change direction now . ”
McCain acknowledged his difficult position .
Surveys show Obama holding a solid lead in national polls and ahead in enough states to easily capture the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House , assuming nothing changes before Nov. 4 . McCain , who has staged repeated comebacks in the presidential race , embraced the familiar role of underdog , saying he came from a long line of scrappers .
“ Sen . Obama is measuring the drapes and planning with Speaker [ Nancy ] Pelosi and Sen . [ Harry ]
Reid to raise taxes , increase spending , take away your right to vote by secret ballot in labor elections and concede defeat in Iraq , ” McCain said , offering his slant on the Illinois senator ’s positions .
“ But you know what they forgot ?
They forgot to let you decide .
My friends , we ’ve got them just where we want them . ”
Many Republicans , however , seem less sanguine .
“ I do n’t want to be the first Republican out there to say it ’s a disaster , but it ’s a . . . disaster , ” said a GOP strategist in a key state both sides are targeting .
He did not want to be identified criticizing the party ’s nominee .
“ I do n’t see the issue that ’s going to turn this race around , unless there ’s a scandal , a terrorist act -- almost an act of God . ”
Advertisement
Others were more optimistic .
“ Frankly , he ’s running a better campaign in this environment under difficult circumstances than we have any right to expect , ” said Rep .
Tom Cole of Oklahoma , who heads the GOP ’s congressional campaign committee .
Cole suggested that there was plenty of time for McCain to turn the race around : “ I think it ’s a mistake for our members to disconnect from McCain . ”
But even as they held out hope for a reversal of fortunes , Republicans differed over how best to make it happen , reflecting a dissonance within party ranks .
Todd Harris , a spokesman for McCain ’s 2000 presidential run , said there was nothing wrong with McCain talking about Ayers -- who took part in a domestic bombing campaign as co-founder of the Weather Underground -- and Wright , so long as he kept his main focus on the economy .
“ I think that the Ayers stuff is important in that it ’s illustrative of who Obama is , ” said Harris , adding that Wright ’s incendiary comments about race and other matters make him a legitimate topic .
But Don Sipple , a GOP strategist sitting out the campaign , said the attacks on Obama for his ties to Ayers had been “ trite and petty ” and had diminished McCain .
“ Instead of the statesman he seemed at one time , he ’s seeming like a desperate politician who ’s throwing out stuff that is so irrelevant to the American people at this stage , ” Sipple said .

Even when he pivots to the economy , McCain has seemed less than sure - footed , veering between a laissez - faire approach and a call for more government intervention .
On Sunday , one of McCain ’s closest advisors , Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , said McCain was considering a “ very comprehensive ” plan that might include cutting the tax rates for capital gains and dividends to help “ jump - start ” the economy .
But within hours , the campaign backed away from that .
After Obama delivered a speech on the economy Monday , McCain aides said the Arizona senator would lay out his own set of economic proposals today .
Pressed for details , McCain ’s chief economic advisor , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , said McCain would “ both sketch out a vision that has been in the process of being fully depicted since the beginning of the campaign and also [ offer ] new specific measures . ”

McCain was no more enlightening when asked about his plan on CNN .
“ I ’ll let you know tomorrow , ” he said .

Mitt Romney was wanking forth on MTP Sunday about the horrendous disadvantage American automakers have because of labor costs , only briefly mentioning the 800 - pound gorilla in the room -- namely , health - care costs -- as " benefits . "
Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan set him straight :
One of the reasons there is a cost disadvantage is that other countries provide health care for their citizens .
In America , we put that entire burden on business .
Mittens nonetheless tries to regurgitate the " $ 70 - an - hour " lie :
Romney :
The companies across the ocean have come here , made plants in the U.S. -- Nissan , Toyota , and Honda -- they 're able to make cars at $ 45 an hour labor costs plus benefits and legacy costs , our cost is $ 73 an hour -- Granholm :
It is not !
That has been totally debunked -- now , you know , Mitt Romney , that this is not -- Romney : Labor costs and legacy costs and benefits is $ 73 an hour .
Maybe Romney should ask those companies where they stand on national subsidization of their industry .
Because back in Japan , they understand that underwriting their manufacturing capacity is the key to a competitive economy ... which is why they keep the yen artificially low .
This subsidization is part of why those same automakers can operate at lower cost here .
Romney and the Republicans have made it clear that Detroit can go suck eggs .
They just do n't want to say it on TV .

MANILA ( Reuters ) - Four more people in the Philippines have been discovered infected by the Ebola - Reston virus and the possibility of pig - to - human transmission cannot be dismissed , the government said Friday .
It was not a major health risk , Health Secretary Francisco Duque told a news conference , adding that the government was however widening testing of people who might have been in contact with sick pigs at hog farms placed under quarantine since October 2008 .
“ The Ebola - Reston virus is both an animal and human health issue , but we still consider this as a low risk situation to human health , ” Duque said .
He said experts from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) and World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) had been asked to determine the source and risk of the Ebola - Reston virus in pigs and impact on food security .
It is the first time the virus has been found outside monkeys and the first time it has been found in pigs .
The virus had previously jumped from monkeys to humans but it is the first case of a jump from hogs .
Ebola -Reston virus was found in the Philippines as early as the late 1980s and 25 people were found infected after contact with sick monkeys .
But only one developed flu - like symptoms and later recovered .
Last week , the government said at least 50 workers in the two farms were exposed to the virus but only one person tested positive .
This person has not shown any symptoms and has remained healthy .
Duque said four new cases had been found and these people possibly had direct contact with sick pigs .
Three of them were farm workers while one was a butcher , he added .
“ At this time , the possibility of pig - to - human transmission cannot be dismissed , ” Duque said .

“ Contact tracing of all five positive individuals is ongoing .
It is a standard procedure to determine health risks to humans who are in close contract with positive individuals . ”
He said all the four men who were found positive remain healthy and have not been seriously ill in the past 12 months .

FARM PRACTICES
Davinio Catbagan , director of the bureau of animal industry , said tissue samples from 140 pigs from the two quarantined farms had been sent abroad for tests .
Earlier tests on more than 1,000 blood samples from pigs in the two affected farms had yielded negative results .
“ No current unusual pig illness has been detected in these two farms , ” Catbagan said , adding only two pigs died when the Ebola - Reston virus was discovered in October 2008 .
The country has more than 13 million heads of swine and the discovery of Ebola - Reston in two farms was isolated , the government said .
The government has called on the public to report unusual pig deaths or illness , cautioning consumers from buying cheap pork and to fully cook meat bought from reputable sources .
Duque said they also asked commercial and backyard farms to practice safe farming and biosecurity measures to prevent and contain any future outbreaks .
It has been quite some time that people have been coming out with statements of Java 's demise .
But to see Elliotte Rusty Harold in his post Java is Dead !
Long Live Python !
do it caused me consternation to no end .
You may want to check out his web page to get a sense of his contributions .
He has written at least four books on Java including those related to XML Processing , IO , network programming .
Incidentally he has also written a book on Beautiful Code ( more on that later ) .
I would suggest you read the post first , if the remainder of this post is to make any sense .
I must confess that after having spent years in Java , I like Python more .
But I like Python more because of the nature of language that it is .
It is natural in its flow ( I like the mandatory indentations ) , its ultra slick programming constructs ( ruby actually is a tad slicker but I dont find myself comfortable with its syntax / style and the special characters in the variable names ) , and its ability to really get a lot of work done with very little code .
But having said that , I have no reason to believe or assume that Java is getting threatened in any particularly significant manner from these upstarts such as PHP , Python and Ruby .
They are collectively not strong enough as java and are unlikely to pose a threat to Java in the market the matters the most ( at least yet ) - corporate enterprise software development .
Corporates need comfort , and they need comfort that stems from a strong support and promise that they can count on .
And they especially need that for enterprise ( non workgroup / non department level ) applications , and enterprise level application development hires most of the programmers ( I can almost hear others starting to yell - buts its true ) .
I do n't intend to suggest that the newer languages cannot take on the challenges of enterprise software development .
But choice of language and platforms in this context is a rather complex process - a process that involves far more than syntax and aesthetics of coding .
Backward compatibility is a big deal .
A very big deal in this world .
You can ( and I do ) blame Microsoft for all its sloppy software and bloated code base but the fact remains - they made sure that they maintained backward compatibility .
In fact , I believe maintaining backward compatibility and compatibility across a large number of devices is what definitely bleeds Microsoft of a lot of time and attention that they could have spent elsewhere .
So we find the academics sitting on large campuses , joined by many people in the web 2.0 / cloud computing environment and some from the workgroup / department application development space , getting gung ho about the newer languages and their cuter syntax , the brevity and the sheer power of productivity ( I am one of them ) .
But what they miss is that java solves important plumbing problems .
They will realise it even more if they had attempted to deal with distributed cross platform computing in the years of yore with tools such as RPC / DCE / Encina / the various CORBA servers and services etc. etc , and deliver on the same across a whole range of platforms .
Through 1996 - 2005
I believe Java solved the problem of platform independence , distribution and binary portability .
And that too in an extremely impressive and credible way .
You have to realise that the strength of Java is its inclusivity .
It attempts to work with everyone and everybody who may want to work with it .
Including those who long since adopted it in its early versions and continue to use those versions today .
While many language communities attempt to crowd the etherspace with pro-my - language messages , java stands out in the fact that it does n't attract deliberately but it does not turn anybody away .
Ever .
Sure Python 3.0 made some very welcome changes , and sure many of the changes make the code become much more intutive , but make no mistake if java generics had broken backward compatibility , its economic impact would 've been far in excess of that triggered by all the version upgrades of Python , Ruby and PHP put together .
I do believe that this approach will eventually lead to substantial subobtimisation but thats still some time away .
Moreover Java needs new features and enhancements like Yul Bryner required a hair cut .
Java already has so many features and capabilities , new features wont matter much in the overall scheme of things for quite some time .
Java is fine , it does n't particularly need to grow .
Whenever I write a new application for myself , Python shall always have the first right of refusal ( ie if Python does n't meet the requirements adequately , only then will I evaluate other languages ) .
However when required to build an application for a customer , who wants the comfort that his application will continue to run for another 10 years at least without him having to make any changes or enhancements to the code and be able to move it around from hardware to hardware , you exactly know which language I shall choose - Java .
Thats why despite all the assertions of java being threatened , and even as other languages continue to grow thanks in no small part due to the additional developer productivity promise , I think java shall remain undead for a long long time ( all the versions continue to coexist ) .
For java we shall have to say something of the sort - Java 6 is undead , Long live java 7 .
And 10 years from now just like today , no one is likely to lose his job for having chosen Java .
Thats why I strongly believe Eliotte was so wrong .
“ We have never said and would never say that a pharmaceutical pen or notebook has influenced any prescription , ” Ms. Bieri said .
But some critics said the code did not go far enough to address the influence of drug marketing on the practice of medicine .
The guidelines , for example , still permit drug makers to underwrite free lunches for doctors and their staffs or to sponsor dinners for doctors at restaurants , as long as the meals are accompanied by educational presentations .
Image Just a few of the free pens in Dr. Jeffrey F. Carens collection .

“ Pens or no pens , their influence is not going to be diminished , ” said Dr. Larry M. Greenbaum , a rheumatologist in Greenwood , Ind .
He has made a point of collecting ballpoint pens advertising formerly heavily promoted medications , like the painkiller Vioxx , that were later withdrawn after reports of dangerous side effects .
Last year , besides giving away nearly $ 16 billion in free drug samples to doctors , pharmaceutical companies spent more than $ 6 billion on “ detailing ”  an industry term for the sales activities of drug representatives including office visits to doctors , meal - time presentations and branded pens and other handouts , according to IMS Health , a health care information company .
The industry code also permits drug makers to pay doctors as consultants “ based on fair market value ”  which critics say means that companies can continue to pay individual doctors tens of thousands of dollars or more a year .
“ We have arrived at a point in the history of medicine in America where doctors have deep , deep financial ties with the drug makers and marketers , ” said Allan Coukell , the director of policy for the Prescription Project , a nonprofit group in Boston working to promote evidence - based medicine .
“ Financial entanglements at all the levels have the potential to influence prescribing in a way that is not good . ”
The breadth of corruption laid out in these charges is staggering .
They allege that ( Ill. Gov. Rod )
Blagojevich put a " for sale " sign on the naming of a United States Senator ; involved himself personally in pay - to - play schemes with the urgency of a salesman meeting his annual sales target ; and corruptly used his office in an effort to trample editorial voices of criticism ... U.S. Atty .
Patrick J. Fitzgerald in a news release this morning .
Fitzgerald has prosecuted a lot of political corruption in his years in Chicago , so you really have to go some to find acts that would stagger him .
I find no record in the news archives of Fitzgerald ever before describing corruption charges as " staggering . "
Yet the charges in the criminal complaint ( text version ) are , in fact , staggering .
They are stunning .
Eyepopping .
Gobsmacking .
Jaw - dropping .
Appalling .
Unprecedented in their alleged brazenness .
These charges say that even as his predecessor sat in prison after a corruption conviction , even as his associates and fundraisers were going down , even as it was widely reported that he was at the center of a federal corruption probe ... even then , Blagojevich was selling out his office and otherwise abusing his power .
In a profile of Blagojevich in last February 's Chicago Magazine , writer David Bernstein reported :
Privately , a few people who know the governor describe him as a " sociopath , " and they insist they 're not using hyperbole .
State representative Joe Lyons , a fellow Democrat from Chicago , told reporters that Blagojevich was a " madman " and " insane . "
That struck me at the time , as over the top .
Today it strikes me as brave and prescient .
If these allegations are true , Blagojevich is not just sleazy and venal , he 's also recklessly compulsive .
But an allegedly recklessly compulsive sociopath cannot and does not act alone -- his abetters and enablers included his major donors and his advisers .
They , too , should be called to account .
Comments are limited to one word only -- your adjective or other evocative word to describe today 's indictment .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama could reverse some of President Bush 's most controversial executive orders , including restrictions on embryonic stem cell research , shortly after taking office in January .
President - elect Barack Obama may overturn many of the executive orders that President Bush implemented .
Two other executive orders from Bush -- one dealing with a so - called " gag " order on international aid organizations regarding abortion , the other with oil and gas drilling on federal lands -- also are receiving increased scrutiny .
Obama 's transition team is reviewing hundreds of Bush 's executive orders , according to John Podesta , Obama 's transition co-chair .
New presidents often use executive orders to put their stamp on Washington quickly .
Unlike laws , which require months to complete and the consent of Congress , presidents can use their executive authority to order federal agencies to implement current policies .
" Much of what a president does , he really has to do with the Congress -- for example , budgeting , legislation on policy -- but executive actions are ones where the president can act alone , " said Martha Kumar of the White House Transition Project , a nonpartisan group established to help new presidential administrations .
See what orders Lincoln , Franklin D. Roosevelt , other presidents issued »
Obama is expected to use his executive authority to reverse Bush 's order limiting the types of embryonic stem cell research that can receive federal tax dollars .
Advocates for those suffering from a host of diseases -- including diabetes , Parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries -- are eagerly awaiting the Bush - era restrictions to be lifted .
" We have every reason to believe -- if not on Day One , then in the very near future -- they will be issuing an order rescinding this policy , " said Amy Comstock Rick , president of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research .
Watch how Obama could reverse Bush »
In August 2001 , Bush barred the National Institutes of Health from funding research on embryonic stem cells other than that using 60 cell lines existing when he signed the executive order .
Researchers say the ban has limited their progress and want the opportunity to create new stem cells from human embryos .
Many conservatives , however , object to the destruction of human embryos because they believe it ends a human life .
On his campaign Web site , Obama said he supports the creation of new stem cells from embryos created for in vitro fertilization treatments that would otherwise be discarded .
But White House spokeswoman Dana Perino on Monday suggested that the incoming Obama administration should consider keeping Bush 's policy in place .
" Unfortunately , the president 's position on stem cells has been misconstrued over the years , with the suggestion that President Bush put a ban on research for embryonic stem cell research .
That is not true , " Perino said .
" The president made a very important choice after a lot of careful deliberation . "
Watch Obama 's ambitious agenda »
Other controversial Bush measures Obama is expected to overturn are related to abortion and family planning .
U.S. State Department officials and family planning groups such as Planned Parenthood said they expect Obama to overturn the " Mexico City " policy , first instituted by the Reagan administration .
The policy prevents taxpayer dollars from funding groups that perform or promote abortions overseas .
President Clinton dropped the order , but Bush re-implemented it and expanded the policy to ensure State Department funding does not go to family planning organizations that even counsel about abortion .
An Obama administration also could overturn the Bush administration policy of banning funding to organizations such as the U.N. Population Fund that operate in countries that practice forced sterilization , including China , which adheres to the " one child " policy .
Podesta said his team also is reviewing Bush 's order that lifted restrictions on oil drilling on fragile federal lands in Utah .
Environmental groups decried Bush 's decision when he opened the lands to exploration this month , and Podesta called the decision a " mistake . "
One set of executive orders that may take longer to overturn pertains to detainees at the Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , military prison .
Obama has said he wants to close the prison , but Denis McDonough , a senior adviser to the incoming Democrat , said Monday that no decisions have been made about what to do with the prison 's 255 inmates .
" There is no process in place to make that decision until his national security and legal teams are assembled , " McDonough said .
Reversing Bush 's executive orders would be an immediate way for Obama to show that a new era has begun in Washington , said Jonathan Turley , a George Washington University law professor .
" Until President Obama gets rid of all these executive orders , he 'll be sharing his presidency with his predecessor , " Turley said .
" Now that 's a particularly obnoxious thought for an administration that was elected for change . "
CNN 's Elise Labott , Edvige Jean - Francois , Jim Acosta and Scott J. Anderson contributed to this report .
All About Stem Cell Research • George W. Bush
There 's a rapidly developing consensus among Washington 's Very Serious person set that Obama 's plans to negotiate with Iran should get only one try , and if that fails then the bombing should begin .
Today Iran 's parliamentary Speaker and the Ayatollah 's most trusted negotiator , Ali Larijani , told the press that Iran 's parliament is considering a request from the U.S. Congress to " parliamentary negotiations between the two countries " .
( And just wait till the wingnuts start howlking about a Dem Congress sidelining the Lame Duck In Chief ! )
Also today , France 's President Sarkozy partly walked back his previous confrontational rhetoric on Iran and said that Obama 's statements " reflect our shared views on the necessity of dialogue without concessions with Tehran as the only way to obtain a negotiated end to the crisis . "
It would seem that prospects for an international consensus on negotiations , and prospects for Iran actually taking those negotiations seriously , are quite hopeful .
Yet David Ignatius in today 's WaPo leads the bellicose VSP charge to give Obama a very short timeline to make any diplomatic initiatives work , echoing the tack of more rightwing and neocon thinktanks .
He begins by lamenting the fact that the Bush administration 's hawks appear to have failed in their push to attack Iran and then recapitulates hawkish hype over Iran 's nuclear program , conveniently forgetting that both the IAEA and the last US intelligence community 's NIE say there 's no evidence Iran has a weapons program behind its civilian one .
He then goes on to catalogue repeated Bush administration failures in the diplomatic arena , seemingly without irony , and to say that Obama must have a Plan B if his own venture fails at the first hurdle .
It 's impossible to say whether Iran 's march toward nuclear - weapons capability could have been stopped by diplomacy .
But there has n't yet been a good test .
Because of bitter infighting in the Bush administration , its diplomatic efforts were late in coming and , once launched , have been ineffective .
Bush stayed on the diplomatic sidelines for more than five years .
A 2003 Iranian overture for a " grand bargain " that would address the nuclear issue went unanswered .
Britain , France and Germany ( the so - called EU - 3 ) were left alone to try to negotiate a compromise .
They concluded the Paris agreement of Nov. 14 , 2004 , in which Iran agreed to suspend its enrichment efforts .
But without U.S. support , this deal withered and the Iranians resumed enrichment in August 2005 .
Bush finally agreed to join the nuclear talks in 2006 , but only if Iran agreed as a precondition to halt enrichment .
Not surprisingly , that diktat went nowhere .
The administration effectively dropped that demand this year , sending Undersecretary of State William J. Burns to join an EU - 3 meeting in Geneva with Iranian representatives .
Bush also missed the chance to engage Iran in a constructive dialogue about the future of Iraq .
Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Khamenei , agreed to send his top negotiator , Ali Larijani , to Baghdad for talks with the United States in March 2006 .
That upset Iranian hard - liners , but they need n't have worried .
The administration backed out .
It 's easy to criticize the Bush record on Iran .
But anyone who thinks it will be easy for Obama to make a breakthrough has n't been paying attention .
Iran moves closer every day to becoming a nuclear - weapons power .
It views America as an aggressive adversary that wants regime change , no matter what Washington says .
Dialogue is worth a try , but Obama and his advisers should start thinking about what they will do if negotiations fail .
Two ignored " grand bargains " , in 2003 and 2006 , and a sham of diplomacy in the meantime that set out as a precondition exactly what was to be negotiated .
Is it any wonder , then , that Iranians see America as " an aggressive adversary that wants regime change " after the last eight years of Bush and the neocons , to say nothing off nonsense like this from VSPs ?
Yet despite this , and despite the fact that Bush squandered repeated opportunities over the years since 2003 , Obama should " start thinking " about what happens if Iran is slow to be convinced that an Obama administration is different ?
One gets the distinct impression that a failure at the first hurdle would please Ignatius very much indeed .
Should n't an Obama administration get at least as long to get it right as Bush did to foul it up ?
" What they will do if negotiations fail ? "
How about more negotiations , over the course of years , until we know there 's definitely no hope of resolving issues and differences ?
That 's how diplomacy is supposed to work in the world outside the cloisters of the American - exceptionalist D.C. set .

SAN MIGUEL , El Salvador , Dec. 16 , 2008  -- ICE
Air could be the busiest airline you 've never heard of .
It serves 30 countries , tickets are free and unlike most carriers , it gives each passenger a complimentary meal .
But to secure a flight , you need to be an illegal immigrant .
ICE is a one - way airline operated by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency .
At a time when most airlines are cutting flights and adding fees for aisle seats , extra luggage and snacks , ICE air is growing by about 10 percent a year .
" We 've actually added aircraft to our fleet , and we 're actually seeing an increase in the number of aliens being moved around the country and out of the country , " said Michael Pitts , the chief of flight operations .
ICE has 22 detention facilities all over the country .
When illegal immigrants are caught , they 're flown to one of three hubs in Texas , Arizona or Louisiana .
From there , ICE Air has daily flights to Central American countries such as El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras , and also frequent flights to Nicaragua , Mexico , Ecuador , Colombia and the Caribbean .
When it gets enough immigrants to fill a plane , it also flies to Asia , eastern Europe and Africa .
ICE Air leases nine planes , and sometimes it also charters commercial jets .
It flies six days a week .
A flight starts with a 2 a .m. wake - up .
The illegal immigrants are rousted at a detention center where they eat breakfast , pack and ponder an involuntary trip home .
David Garcia was held at a detention center in Raymondville , Texas , before he was deported to El Salvador after 16 years in the United States .
" I have two kids over here , " said Garcia , who came to the United States illegally and had been working in construction since the age of 19 .
" I left a big part of my life behind , " he said , choking up .
" I have to start all over again .
I do n't know what I 'm going to do over there . …
It 's kind of difficult , you know , but there 's a lot of feelings going on me right now . "
Garcia acknowledges that the United States " is not our country .
We do not have the documents that we need to need to be there . "
Many Illegal Immigrants ICE Air Sends Home Return
Jacqueline Ceciliano , who was working as a hotel housekeeper in New Jersey , was on the same flight as Garcia .
She would see her two children for the first time in four years .
When asked if she was happy to be going home , she suppressed a sob as she said , " Oh , yes , yes … I 'm happy . "
Like many others , she would n't be able to send money home anymore , but she said she did n't care .
" I like this country .
Everybody 's nice .
I like it , but I miss my babies .
I miss my babies too much . "
Security on ICE
Air is , as you might imagine , pretty tough .
Passengers are patted down before they get on a bus to go to the airport , and are then patted down again before getting on the plane .
Unarmed security guards double as flight attendants , but the service is actually quite friendly .
" For most of these folks , they 've had a long journey getting here to the United States .
They 've been in custody anywhere from two days to two weeks to two months , so we want to make sure that once they get onboard they have a favorable impression of the government , " said Pitts .
Last year , ICE flew more than 209,000 illegal immigrants .
Their numbers have increased as the government has cracked down on illegals , and the people at ICE Air say they 're saving the U.S. taxpayers money .
" What it costs us is about $ 680 per alien on a foreign removal flight , " said Pitts .
" So that 's about a third of the cost it would be to get them a commercial ticket . "
Some of the flights are exclusively for people convicted of crimes .
On one flight to Mexico , all the passengers wore handcuffs and leg irons .
Guadelupe Cabarena , who was sentenced to five years for aggravated assault and turned over to ICE after her release , said she expected to come back to the United States .
" As a matter of fact , I was thinking just to rent a hotel room for tonight in Laredo or whatever , and then just to rest .
... I 'm tired ... and then just come back , " she said .
Raul Cornelia Pena , who served six years for solicitation to commit burglary , was being returned to Mexico for the second time .
" I did n't have no choice , because I was n't going to leave my family behind and just say forget it , " he said .
" They sending me with no money , no nothing , I do n't know anybody .
I do n't know what I 'm going to do . "
Deported to Home Country , Planning to ' Start All Over '
Pitts acknowledged that some of those deported return .
" There are going to be some aliens that do return back across the borders , but we 're going to be there for them , if we do n't take them out at the point of entry or between the point of entry , then we will get them in the interior of the United States , " he said .
He said it 's " a given " that some repeat offenders will return , " but by securing our borders and beefing up immigration enforcement we know that they 'll be cut once again and returned . "
Pitts said that those who have entered illegally must be returned home .
" We need to respect the sovereignty of our nation as a whole .
If you want to come in the country ; you need to come in the country legally . "
After the flight to El Salvador landed in the capital city , passengers were served a traditional El Salvadoran meal and offered free employment training .
After a brief interview and a criminal background check , they were allowed to leave .
" I feel kind of weird , you know , everything is going to be new for me , " Garcia said .
Returning home , he had to stop to ask for directions several times and was overwhelmed to see his father and the rest of his family .
The home he returned to was basic , with water coming from a well and animals everywhere .
" I 'm happy , but I 'm sad at the same time , " Garcia said .
" Everything is going to start all over again over here and ... I do n't know how is going to be my life here .
But I am going to try my best to success , you know . "
About the author
( NewsTarget ) According to the American Heart Association ( AHA ) , about 8 million Americans have the most common form of peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) known as peripheral arterial disease , or PAD .
The risk of PAD increases as we get older and , by age 65 , some 12 to 20 percent of the population has the condition .
PAD is caused by deposits of fatty plaques in arteries that interrupts blood flow to the legs .
You may have no symptoms of PAD or you can experience sometimes excruciating leg pain that does n't go away when you finish exercising  the pain , called " intermittent claudication " , is caused when plaque prevents muscles from getting an adequate blood supply during exercise .
Other symptoms of PAD can include leg or foot wounds that heal slowly or not at all , and a marked decrease in the temperature of one leg compared to the rest of your body .
Finding out if you have PAD is crucial because , undiagnosed and untreated , the condition can lead to gangrene and even amputation .
What 's more , AHA statistics reveal people that with PAD have a four to five times higher risk of heart attack or stroke .
But there 's good news : a study just published inconcludes regular , moderate exercise can go a long way to eliminate PAD symptoms by some unexpected mechanisms .
The new research suggests that exercise triggers the body to naturally solve the problem by expanding and multiplying the surrounding smaller blood vessels in a blocked area and also making blood vessels healthier .
In animal experiments , University of Missouri researchers studied rats with blocked femoral arteries .
When the rodents were made to exercise regularly , the scientists found that blood flow increased and was effective in restoring normal muscle function .
This was n't unexpected because , when a major artery in the leg becomes blocked , the body often creates another route for the blood to pass through by expanding and multiplying blood vessels in the area .
This is known as collateral blood flow .
But the scientists found that exercise appeared to spur the collateral vessels to become larger and less likely to contract  and vascular constriction is known to be a problem with PAD .
Dr. Ronald Terjung , of the University of Missouri's Dalton Cardiovascular Research Center , and other authors of the study stated in a media release they believe a regular exercise program would delay the onset of pain and increase mobility for people suffering with PAD .
" Our findings raise the potential that new collateral vessels , that can develop in patients with PAD who are physically active , will function effectively to help minimize the consequences of the original vascular obstruction , " Dr. Terjung said in the press statement .
The AHA points out that smoking , diabetes and high cholesterol increase your risk for the condition .
Bottom line : exercise , smoking cessation , weight control and a healthy diet are all lifestyle factors that can help beat PAD , naturally .

The war of words between Tampa Bay Lightning co-owner Len Barrie and former coach Barry Melrose is continuing , with Barrie disputing Melrose 's claims that he was told whom to play , and calling Melrose 's preseason preparation " total negligence , " according to the St. Petersburg Times .
Barrie , who owns the Lightning along with Oren Koules , said Wednesday that he did not want to continue the verbal feud with Melrose , who was fired on Nov. 14 .
However , Barrie said , " I wanted to stick up for our guys , " according to the report .
In particular , according to the Times , Barrie said he wanted to defend rookie Steven Stamkos , who Melrose has said is not ready for the NHL .
" He did n't want Steven on this team from day one , and it was evident how he played him , " Barrie said , according to the Times .
" Everyone knows this kid is a star player . "
Barrie said he never told Melrose to play Stamkos certain minutes , according to the report .
" But I did say , ' Why not try Steven Stamkos on the point ? '
The kid 's done it [ in juniors ] and played well back there . "
Melrose , a former coach of the Los Angeles Kings , was an ESPN hockey analyst from October 1996 until leaving to join the Lightning in June .
He will return to ESPN 's hockey coverage beginning Jan. 1 .
On Tuesday , Melrose told Toronto radio station The Fan 590 that " [ Stamkos ] is not ready for the NHL . "
" Steven is going to be a good player ... right now he 's just not strong enough physically to play against defensemen who are [ 6 - foot - 3 or 6 - foot - 4 ] that can skate as good as him , " Melrose said .
Melrose also said during the radio interview : " I hope Tampa Bay does n't win a game in the next year . "
Barrie said he and Melrose " were never as close " as Melrose and Koules , who hired him , according to the report .
" But my thing is you 're paid to do a job , and he did n't do it from day one .
How he came in and prepared for this job was total negligence , " Barrie said , according to the Times .
Barrie also challenged Melrose 's assertion that the front office was telling him what to do and whom to play .
" I had guys in Tampa who wanted to run the team and I would n't let them .
I was hired to coach and I coached , " Melrose said on The Fan 590 on Tuesday .
" I was n't playing the right guys .
I was playing certain guys too much , I was n't playing other guys enough .
Every day was a constant battle .
" Finally the guys in charge decided they wanted to coach and they got rid of me .
That 's what it comes down to .
It obviously was n't a hockey decision , because it 's not like they 've set the world on fire since they got rid of me .
Now they 've got guys in charge that let them do what they want and obviously that is n't working out very well either . "
The Lightning have the worst record ( 6 - 14 - 8 ) and fewest points ( 20 ) in the league through Wednesday 's games .
Barrie reacted to Melrose 's comments later on Tuesday on the " In the Slot " program with Mike Ross and Phil Esposito on XM Radio .
" I told Barry Melrose about five or six things in the whole eight weeks I was there and he did n't listen to one , " Barrie said on XM Radio .
" Maybe Barry should have listened every once in a while because he lost the team fast .

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Calculating the Size of the Downadup Outbreak Posted by Toni @ 13:59 GMT
The number of Downadup infections are skyrocketing based on our calculations .
From an estimated 2.4 million infected machines to over 8.9 million during the last four days .
That 's just amazing .
We 've received a number of queries on just how exactly we 're producing our estimates .
There 's been interest from Internet operators , CERTs , and fellow antivirus researchers .
There 's also been several posts to our blog comments , doubting our numbers .
Here 's some sample quotes :
Kitschen : Yeah right !
As if you could " estimate " infection
to a precision of 10 machines .
This is just PR .
Your " special techniques " are at best able to estimate 100000 .
wastedimage :
This number looks like total guesswork .
How did you go from ~ 100 k ip's to 2.4 million boxes ?
I realize * some * might be nat but how many ?
Did you just assume each ip really was some arbitrary number
of vulnerable machines or something ?
Spreading FUD like this is incredibly unprofessional .
wastedimage :
So your trusting the counter built into the bot itself
which may be rigged to indicate larger numbers to entice spammers
to pay more for its use .
Sure that sounds like a solid plan .
So let us explain how we are generating the numbers .
There are several different variants of Downadup out there .
The algorithm to create the domain names vary a bit between the variants .
We 've been tracking the variant we believe to be most common .
It creates 250 possible domains each day .
We 've registered some selected domains out of this pool and are monitoring the connections being made to them .
This is what the connections look like :
As you can see , this is a standard httpd log showing the IP address of the machines connecting our domains , the time stamp ( the queries in the above image all come on the same second : 18:16:05 yesterday ) , actual query ( " GET / search?q=29 HTTP/1.0 " ) , and the User - Agent of the machine .
These are the raw connections coming to our sinkhole systems .
Millions of them every day .
When we sort these connections by source , we see hundreds of thousands of unique IP addresses every day ( over 350,000 today ) .
It 's hard to tell the real number of infections since NAT boxes and proxies tend to spoil the fun and Downadup does n't include a unique identifier within the User - Agent string for us to see .
We first tried to count unique User - Agent headers per IP address , but the results were n't very good as in a standardized corporate network , most machines have identical User - Agents .
So , with a little digging we discovered that in the / search / q=NUMBER query , the number is not random .
It 's basically a global variable in the code , getting incremented ( thread - safely through Interlocked Increment ) every time the malware has successfully exploited a machine via MS08 - 067 .
The incrementation is done in the httpd thread of the malware , after it has exploited a machine successfully .
So this number tells us how many other computers this machine has exploited since it was last restarted .
In the above log you can see one of the machines has exploited 116 computers .
Do bear in mind that this number only shows how many machines got infected via the MS08 - 067 exploit .
Downadup spreads at least as much via network shares and USB sticks .
We wrote a program that parses the logs , extracting the highest " q " value for the IP / User - Agent pairs .
These are then added together to get our figures .
As you can see now , they are very conservative .
And they are showing more than 8 million infected machines right now .
The situation with Downadup is not getting better .
It 's getting worse .
Do all Americans truly have a yearning to fundamentally “ remake ” our nation ?
There must be a subversive minority out there that still believes the United States — even with its imperfections and sporadic recessions — is , in context , still a wildly prosperous and free country worth preserving .
Some of you must still believe that politicians are meant to serve rather than be worshiped .
And there must be someone out there who considers partisanship a healthy , organic reflection of our differences rather than something to be surrendered in the name of so - called unity — which is , after all , untenable , subjective and utterly counterproductive .
How about those who praised dissent for the past eight years ?
Is there anyone who still believes the Constitution was created to ensure each citizen liberty and the ability to pursue happiness rather than a guarantee of happiness — and a retirement fund , health care , a job , an education , a house … ?
Yes , two important historical events transpired Tuesday :
The first was the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected politician to another ( an uninterrupted streak we often take for granted ) .
Then there was the first presidency of an African - American , which proves we can transcend our unsightly past .
After that , what we had was just another election .
We conduct one every four years .
For those of you not shouting hosannas , it might have occurred to you that we are suffering from a rampant sickness in American life that casts government as the author of your dreams and an Illinois politician the linchpin of your hopes .
Tom Brokaw — whose hero , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , corraled thousands of innocent Asian - Americans into internment camps and assaulted the Constitution at every turn — went as far as to compare Obama ’s inauguration to the Czechs ’ fight for freedom over Communist oppression .
George Bush ’s administration , which I have a multitude of problems with , is not comparable to a tyranny , despite the protestations of his emotional detractors .
Liberals rightly recoil at the prospect of conservatives dictating which morals they should live by .
Obama , though , has spent the past year preaching his own brand of morality — with a list of demands .
Everyone , you see , “ must ” sacrifice .
Michelle Obama recently explained , “ Barack Obama will require you to work .
. . .
Barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual , uninvolved , uninformed . ”
Those of us who refuse to buy left - wing orthodoxy will remain “ uninformed ” and , inevitably , “ selfish . ”
To be fair , I ’m uncertain what Obama is going to require of me during these next four to eight years .
I do know , right off the bat , that if he passes his centerpiece trillion - dollar , ideologically driven government expansion ( in the guise of a “ stimulus ” plan ) , he will be demanding my grandchildren work overtime to pay it off — and that ’s after they ’re done paying Bush ’s tab .
Obama challenges Americans to have “ a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves . ”
So if you find massive concentrated power in Washington a turn - on , you ’ve found your higher purpose .
But surely , most of you have found meaning in something greater than yourselves long before some politician demanded it .
To require such fealty to power in the name of patriotism was once repugnant to the left .
Now , with the right guy in charge , apparently it can once again be embraced .
Change , indeed .

When the Internet connection at Public School 29 in Cobble Hill showed signs of trouble more than hour before the inauguration ceremony began , Melanie Raneri-Woods , the Brooklyn elementary school ’s principal , immediately began to hustle .
There was no way , she said , that her 700 students were going to miss out on history .
Parents who lived nearby were enlisted to lend their living rooms and televisions .
A nearby restaurant owner said he could fit up to 50 schoolchildren around his television .
A teacher ran home to get his television , figuring he would have an antenna for reception if need be .
They figured as a last resort , that they would broadcast the speech from the radio over the seldom - used speaker system at the school .
So it was that Stephanie Manske opened up her brownstone a block away from the school for about 25 fourth - grade students , who sat in arc on the floor .
( It was Ms. Manske ’s 40th birthday , and she told another parent , Lisa Trollback , that she could not think of a better way to celebrate . )
“ They were a little stunned , ” said Ms. Trollback , who accompanied the students to Ms. Manske ’s home .
“ But they were just so excited . ”
The original plan had been for students to watch in the gymnasium , the auditorium , and a classroom , but the signals never worked in the auditorium and classroom .
By the time the ceremony was under way at 11:30 a.m. , the roughly 700 students were firmly planted in front of a screen , just as Principal Maneri - Woods had planned .
About 40 had gone to the restaurant , Bocca Lupo , close to 100 students were watching on an old television with the aid of old - fashioned rabbit ears , and another 100 were scattered at homes in the neighborhood .
The rest were able to watch in the school ’s gym .
At both Ms. Manske ’s home and Bocca Lupo , the students mimicked the crowd on TV , standing when they stood , clapping when they clapped .
“ This is so monumental that there was just not conceivable that they would miss it , ” said Ms. Raneri -Woods , who had traveled to Washington to celebrate this weekend , but wanted to be back at school with her students to watch the inauguration .
“ The good news is that they were all able to watch the joyful news for themselves . ”
“ Even if they do n’t remember what was said , they are n’t going to forget this day , ” Ms. Trollback said .
( Schoolchildren gathered for special assemblies across the city .
A spokeswoman for the Education Department said there were reports of problems with the department ’s Web access to the inauguration at roughly a dozen city public schools .
Similar steps were taken at some of those .

Setup ----- git clone < repo > clone the repository specified by < repo > ; this is similar to " checkout " in some other version control systems such as Subversion and CVS Add colors to your ~/.gitconfig file : [ color ] ui = auto [ color " branch " ] current = yellow reverse local = yellow remote = green [ color " diff " ] meta = yellow bold frag = magenta bold old = red bold new = green bold [ color " status " ] added = yellow changed = green untracked = cyan Highlight whitespace in diffs [ color ] ui = true [ color " diff " ] whitespace = red reverse [ core ] whitespace=fix , - indent - with - non - tab , trailing - space , cr-at-eol Add aliases to your ~/.gitconfig file : [ alias ] st = status ci = commit br = branch co = checkout df = diff dc = diff -- cached lg = log -p lol = log -- graph -- decorate -- pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit lola = log -- graph -- decorate -- pretty=oneline --abbrev - commit -- all ls = ls-files #
Show files ignored by git : ign = ls- files -o - i -- exclude - standard Configuration
------------- git config -e [ - - global ] edit the .git/ config [ or ~/.gitconfig ] file in your $ EDITOR git config -- global user.name ' John Doe ' git config -- global user.email johndoe@example.com sets your name and email for commit messages git config branch .
autosetupmerge true tells git - branch and git- checkout to setup new branches so that git- pull ( 1 ) will appropriately merge from that remote branch .
Recommended .
Without this , you will have to add -- track to your branch command or manually merge remote tracking branches with " fetch " and then " merge " .
git config core.autocrlf true
This setting tells git to convert the newlines to the system 's standard when checking out files , and to LF newlines when committing in git config -- list
To view all options git config apply .
whitespace nowarn
To ignore whitespace
You can add " - - global " after " git config " to any of these commands to make it apply to all git repos ( writes to ~/.gitconfig ) .
Info ---- git reflog
Use this to recover from * major* mess ups !
It 's basically a log of the last few actions and you might have luck and find old commits that have been lost by doing a complex merge .
git diff show a diff of the changes made since your last commit to diff one file : " git diff -- < filename > " to show a diff between staging area and HEAD : `git diff -- cached` git status show files added to the staging area , files with changes , and untracked files git log show recent commits , most recent on top .
Useful options : -- color with color -- graph with an ASCII - art commit graph on the left -- decorate with branch and tag names on appropriate commits -- stat with stats ( files changed , insertions , and deletions ) - p with full diffs -- author =foo only by a certain author -- after = " MMM DD YYYY " ex. ( " Jun 20 2008 " ) only commits after a certain date -- before = " MMM DD YYYY " only commits that occur before a certain date -- merge only the commits involved in the current merge conflicts git log < ref > ..< ref > show commits between the specified range .
Useful for seeing changes from remotes : git log HEAD .. origin / master # after git remote update git show < rev > show the changeset ( diff ) of a commit specified by < rev > , which can be any SHA1 commit ID , branch name , or tag ( shows the last commit ( HEAD ) by default ) also to show the contents of a file at a specific revision , use git show < rev > :< filename > this is similar to cat - file but much simpler syntax .
git show - - name - only < rev > show only the names of the files that changed , no diff information .
git blame < file > show who authored each line in < file > git blame < file > < rev > show who authored each line in < file > as of < rev > ( allows blame to go back in time ) git gui blame really nice GUI interface to git blame git whatchanged < file > show only the commits which affected < file > listing the most recent first E.g. view all changes made to a file on a branch : git whatchanged < branch > < file > | grep commit | \ colrm 1 7 | xargs - I % git show % < file > this could be combined with git remote show < remote > to find all changes on all branches to a particular file .
git diff < commit > head path / to / fubar show the diff between a file on the current branch and potentially another branch git diff -- cached [ < file > ] shows diff for staged ( git - add 'ed ) files ( which includes uncommitted git cherry - pick 'ed files ) git ls- files list all files in the index and under version control .
git ls- remote < remote > [ HEAD ] show the current version on the remote repo .
This can be used to check whether a local is required by comparing the local head revision .
Adding / Deleting
----------------- git add < file1 > < file2 > ... add < file1 > , < file2 > , etc ... to the project git add < dir > add all files under directory < dir > to the project , including subdirectories git add .
add all files under the current directory to the project * WARNING * : including untracked files .
git rm < file1 > < file2 > ... remove < file1 > , < file2 > , etc ... from the project git rm $ ( git ls - files -- deleted ) remove all deleted files from the project git rm -- cached < file1 > < file2 > ... commits absence of < file1 > , < file2 > , etc ... from the project Ignoring ---------
Option 1 : Edit $ GIT_DIR/.git/ info/exclude .
See Environment Variables below for explanation on $ GIT_DIR .
Option 2 : Add a file . gitignore to the root of your project .
This file will be checked in .
Either way you need to add patterns to exclude to these files .
Staging ------- git add < file1 > < file2 > ... git stage < file1 > < file2 > ... add changes in < file1 > , < file2 > ... to the staging area ( to be included in the next commit git add -p git stage -- patch interactively walk through the current changes ( hunks ) in the working tree , and decide which changes to add to the staging area .
git add - i git stage -- interactive interactively add files / changes to the staging area .
For a simpler mode ( no menu ) , try `git add -- patch` ( above ) Unstaging --------- git reset HEAD < file1 > < file2 > ... remove the specified files from the next commit Committing ---------- git commit < file1 > < file2 > ... [ - m < msg > ] commit < file1 > , < file2 > , etc... , optionally using commit message < msg > , otherwise opening your editor to let you type a commit message git commit - a commit all files changed since your last commit ( does not include new ( untracked ) files ) git commit -v commit verbosely , i.e. includes the diff of the contents being committed in the commit message screen git commit -- amend edit the commit message of the most recent commit git commit -- amend < file1 > < file2 > ... redo previous commit , including changes made to < file1 > , < file2 > , etc ... Branching --------- git branch list all local branches git branch -r list all remote branches git branch - a list all local and remote branches git branch < branch > create a new branch named < branch > , referencing the same point in history as the current branch git branch < branch > < start - point > create a new branch named < branch > , referencing < start - point > , which may be specified any way you like , including using a branch name or a tag name git push < repo > < start - point > : refs / heads / < branch > create a new remote branch named < branch > , referencing < start - point > on the remote .
Repo is the name of the remote .
Example : git push origin origin : refs / heads / branch - 1
Example : git push origin origin / branch - 1:refs / heads / branch - 2 Example : git push origin branch - 1 ## shortcut git branch -- track < branch > < remote - branch > create a tracking branch .
Will push / pull changes to / from another repository .
Example : git branch -- track experimental origin / experimental git branch -- set - upstream < branch > < remote - branch > ( As of Git 1.7.0 )
Make an existing branch track a remote branch Example : git branch -- set - upstream foo origin / foo git branch -d < branch > delete the branch < branch > ; if the branch you are deleting points to a commit which is not reachable from the current branch , this command will fail with a warning .
git branch -r -d < remote - branch > delete a remote - tracking branch .
Example : git branch -r -d wycats / master git branch - D < branch > even if the branch points to a commit not reachable from the current branch , you may know that that commit is still reachable from some other branch or tag .
In that case it is safe to use this command to force git to delete the branch .
git checkout < branch > make the current branch < branch > , updating the working directory to reflect the version referenced by < branch > git checkout - b < new > < start - point > create a new branch < new > referencing < start - point > , and check it out .
git push < repository > :< branch > removes a branch from a remote repository .
Example : git push origin :old_branch_to_be_deleted git co < branch > < path to new file >
Checkout a file from another branch and add it to this branch .
File will still need to be added to the git branch , but it 's present .
Eg. git co remote_at_origin__tick702_antifraud_blocking ..../...nt_elements_for_iframe_blocked_page.rb git show < branch > -- < path to file that does not exist >
Eg. git show remote_tick702 -- path/to/fubar.txt show the contents of a file that was created on another branch and that does not exist on the current branch .
git show < rev > :< repo path to file >
Show the contents of a file at the specific revision .
Note : path has to be absolute within the repo .
Merging ------- git merge < branch > merge branch < branch > into the current branch ; this command is idempotent and can be run as many times as needed to keep the current branch up - to - date with changes in < branch > git merge < branch > -- no - commit merge branch < branch > into the current branch , but do not autocommit the result ; allows you to make further tweaks git merge < branch > -s ours merge branch < branch > into the current branch , but drops any changes in < branch > , using the current tree as the new tree Cherry - Picking -------------- git cherry - pick [ - - edit ] [ - n ] [ - m parent - number ] [ - s ] [ - x ] < commit > selectively merge a single commit from another local branch Example : git cherry - pick 7300a6130d9447e18a931e898b64eefedea19544 git hash - object < file - path > get the blob of some file whether it is in a repository or not Find the commit in the repository that contains the file blob : obj_blob = " $ 1 " git log -- pretty=format : '
%T %h %s ' \ | while read tree commit subject ; do if git ls - tree -r $ tree | grep -q " $obj_blob " ; then echo $ commit " $ subject " fi done Squashing --------- WARNING : " git rebase " changes history .
Be careful .
Google it .
git rebase -- interactive HEAD~10 ( then change all but the first " pick " to " squash " ) squash the last 10 commits into one big commit Conflicts --------- git mergetool work through conflicted files by opening them in your mergetool ( opendiff , kdiff3 , etc. ) and choosing left / right chunks .
The merged result is staged for commit .
For binary files or if mergetool wo n't do , resolve the conflict (s ) manually and then do : git add < file1 > [ < file2 > ...]
Once all conflicts are resolved and staged , commit the pending merge with : git commit Sharing ------- git fetch < remote > update the remote - tracking branches for < remote > ( defaults to " origin " ) .
Does not initiate a merge into the current branch ( see " git pull " below ) .
git pull fetch changes from the server , and merge them into the current branch .
Note : . git / config must have a [ branch " some_name " ] section for the current branch , to know which remote - tracking branch to merge into the current branch .
Git 1.5.3 and above adds this automatically .
git push update the server with your commits across all branches that are * COMMON * between your local copy and the server .
Local branches that were never pushed to the server in the first place are not shared .
git push origin < branch > update the server with your commits made to < branch > since your last push .
This is always * required * for new branches that you wish to share .
After the first explicit push , " git push " by itself is sufficient .
git push origin < branch >: refs/heads /< branch > E.g. git push origin twitter - experiment : refs / heads / twitter - experiment
Which , in fact , is the same as git push origin < branch > but a little more obvious what is happening .
Reverting --------- git revert < rev > reverse commit specified by < rev > and commit the result .
This does * not * do the same thing as similarly named commands in other VCS 's such as " svn revert " or " bzr revert " , see below git checkout < file > re-checkout < file > , overwriting any local changes git checkout .
re-checkout all files , overwriting any local changes .
This is most similar to " svn revert " if you 're used to Subversion commands
Fix mistakes / Undo -------------------
git reset -- hard abandon everything since your last commit ; this command can be DANGEROUS .
If merging has resulted in conflicts and you 'd like to just forget about the merge , this command will do that .
git reset -- hard ORIG_HEAD or git reset -- hard origin / master undo your most recent * successful * merge * and * any changes that occurred after .
Useful for forgetting about the merge you just did .
If there are conflicts ( the merge was not successful ) , use " git reset -- hard " ( above ) instead .
git reset -- soft HEAD ^ forgot something in your last commit ?
That 's easy to fix .
Undo your last commit , but keep the changes in the staging area for editing .
git commit -- amend redo previous commit , including changes you 've staged in the meantime .
Also used to edit commit message of previous commit .
Plumbing -------- test < sha1 - A> = $ ( git merge - base < sha1 - A > < sha1 - B > ) determine if merging sha1 - B into sha1 - A is achievable as a fast forward ; non -zero exit status is false .
Stashing -------- git stash git stash save < optional - name > save your local modifications to a new stash ( so you can for example " git svn rebase " or " git pull " ) git stash apply restore the changes recorded in the stash on top of the current working tree state git stash pop restore the changes from the most recent stash , and remove it from the stack of stashed changes git stash list list all current stashes git stash show < stash - name > -p show the contents of a stash - accepts all diff args git stash drop [ < stash - name > ] delete the stash git stash clear delete all current stashes Remotes ------- git remote add < remote > < remote_URL > adds a remote repository to your git config .
Can be then fetched locally .
Example : git remote add coreteam git://github.com/wycats/merb-plugins.git git fetch coreteam git push < remote > : refs /heads /< branch > delete a branch in a remote repository git push < remote > < remote >:refs/heads /< remote_branch > create a branch on a remote repository Example : git push origin origin : refs / heads / new_feature_name git push < repository > +< remote > :< new_remote > replace a < remote > branch with < new_remote > think twice before do this Example : git push origin + master : my_branch git remote prune < remote > prune deleted remote - tracking branches from " git branch - r " listing git remote add -t master -m master origin git://example.com/git.git/ add a remote and track its master git remote show < remote > show information about the remote server .
git checkout - b < local branch > < remote >/< remote branch >
Eg. : git checkout - b myfeature origin / myfeature git checkout - b myfeature remotes / < remote >/< branch >
Track a remote branch as a local branch .
It seems that somtimes an extra ' remotes / ' is required , to see the exact branch name , ' git branch - a '. git pull < remote > < branch > git push
For branches that are remotely tracked ( via git push ) but that complain about non-fast forward commits when doing a git push .
The pull synchronizes local and remote , and if all goes well , the result is pushable .
git fetch < remote >
Retrieves all branches from the remote repository .
After this ' git branch -- track ...' can be used to track a branch from the new remote .
Submodules ---------- git submodule add < remote_repository > < path/ to/submodule > add the given repository at the given path .
The addition will be part of the next commit .
git submodule update [ -- init ]
Update the registered submodules ( clone missing submodules , and checkout the commit specified by the super - repo ) .
-- init is needed the first time .
git submodule foreach < command >
Executes the given command within each checked out submodule .
Removing submodules 1 . Delete the relevant line from the .gitmodules file .
2 . Delete the relevant section from .git/config .
3 . Run git rm -- cached path_to_submodule ( no trailing slash ) .
4 . Commit and delete the now untracked submodule files .
Updating submodules
To update a submodule to a new commit : 1 . update submodule : cd < path to submodule > git pull 2 . commit the new version of submodule : cd < path to toplevel > git commit -m " update submodule version " 3 . check that the submodule has the correct version git submodule status
If the update in the submodule is not committed in the main repository , it is lost and doing git submodule update will revert to the previous version .
Patches ------- git format - patch HEAD ^
Generate the last commit as a patch that can be applied on another clone ( or branch ) using ' git am ' .
Format patch can also generate a patch for all commits using ' git format - patch HEAD ^ HEAD '
All page files will be enumerated with a prefix , e.g. 0001 is the first patch .
git format - patch < Revision > ^..< Revision >
Generate a patch for a single commit .
E.g. git format - patch d8efce43099^..d8efce43099
Revision does not need to be fully specified .
git am < patch file >
Applies the patch file generated by format - patch .
git diff -- no - prefix > patchfile Generates a patch file that can be applied using patch : patch - p0 < patchfile Useful for sharing changes without generating a git commit .
Tags ---- git tag -l
Will list all tags defined in the repository .
git co < tag_name >
Will checkout the code for a particular tag .
After this you 'll probably want to do : ' git co - b < some branch name > ' to define a branch .
Any changes you now make can be committed to that branch and later merged .
Archive ------- git archive master | tar -x - C / somewhere / else Will export expanded tree as tar archive at given path git archive master | bzip2 > source - tree.tar.bz2
Will export archive as bz2 git archive -- format zip -- output / full / path master Will export as zip Git Instaweb ------------ git instaweb -- httpd=webrick [-- start | -- stop | -- restart ] Environment Variables
---------------------
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME , GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
Your full name to be recorded in any newly created commits .
Overrides user.name in .git/config GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL , GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
Your email address to be recorded in any newly created commits .
Overrides user.email in .git/ config GIT_DIR
Location of the repository to use ( for out of working directory repositories ) GIT_WORKING_TREE Location of the Working Directory - use with GIT_DIR to specifiy the working directory root or to work without being in the working directory at all .
Changing history ----------------
Change author for all commits with given name git filter - branch -- commit - filter ' if [ " $ GIT_COMMITTER_NAME " = " < Old Name > " ] ; then GIT_COMMITTER_NAME= " < New Name > " ; GIT_AUTHOR_NAME= " < New Name > " ; GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL= " < New Email > " ; GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL= " < New Email > " ; git commit - tree " $@ " ; else git commit - tree " $@ " ; fi' HEAD
Senior Democratic
House Judiciary member confident rule of law will be followed by Dept. of Justice under President Obama
NEWSWEEK : Before leaving office , Bush counsel ordered Rove , others , not to testify to Congress , arguing ' absolute immunity ' from compelled testimony ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/30/2009 , 12:33 pm PT
A senior Democratic Congressman on the U.S. House Judiciary has said that either Karl Rove will testify before the committee , or he will go to jail .
In the meantime , it has also now been learned , legal counsel for George W. Bush issued a letter just days before leaving the White House , claiming Rove , Bush , and other senior staffers have " absolute immunity " from testifying to Congress in the future .
Speaking on MSNBC , Judiciary member Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) said last night that if Rove fails to show , in answer to a subpoena issued earlier this week , he 'll be cited for Contempt of Congress .
Then , he said , " the grand jury indicts him , you arrest him for contempt , and you put him in jail until he is prepared to testify to obey the subpoena . "
( More details , as well as video of the Nadler interview , follow below . )
On Monday , Rep. John Conyers , chair of the committee , issued a subpoena to the former senior Bush operative and current Fox " News " analyst , requiring him to appear to give testimony next Monday , February 2nd , " regarding his role in the Bush Administration ’s politicization of the Department of Justice , including the US Attorney firings and the prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman . "
On Wednesday , Rove told his colleague Bill O'Reilly , on The O'Reilly Factor that he does n't intend to answer the subpoena , on the belief that Bush 's previous claims of Executive Privilege exempted him from having to even show up before the committee .
[ UPDATE : AP reports late Friday that Conyers has rescheduled Rove 's hearing for Feb. 23rd , in order to " give Rove 's lawyer time to consult with the Obama administration and learn whether the new president would uphold Bush 's order against testifying . " ]
Nadler claimed Thursday night that , while a similar dance with Rove ( subpoena , snub , contempt citation , referral to the U.S. Attorney in D.C. ) had happened previously , the Justice Dept. , which did not do its duty in enforcing the citation previously , would be more likely to do so , now that Bush is no longer in charge of the DoJ .
" If he refuses to show up , we vote a contempt citation ... the law then says a contempt citation ... is given to the U.S.
Attorney , quote , this is the law , ' whose duty it shall be ' , unquote , to deliver it to the grand jury , " Nadler explained .
" In otherwords , he must prosecute and enforce the subpoena . "
" President Bush , as in so many other things , simply ignored the law , and instructed the U.S. Attorney not to obey the law , and not to enforce the subpoena , " last time this occurred , the Congressman said .
" I imagine President Obama will not do the same , " he added , with emphasis on the word " not . "
Here 's the video of Nadler 's interview on MSNBC last night , via RAW STORY , in which he describes the legal process at this point , and beyond , as expected by his committee ...
In the meantime , Newsweek is reporting that , just four days before leaving office , Bush 's legal counsel sent a letter on White House stationery instructing Rove " that the President continues to direct him not to provide information ( whether in the form of testimony or documents ) to the Congress in this matter . "
However , while the letter contends that Bush " and his immediate advisers are absolutely immune from testimonial compulsion by a congressional committee , " that argument , as RAW STORY 's John Byrne notes , " is losing the battle in court " and could become " trouble for Rove and [ and WH Counsel Harriet ]
Miers [ who has also snubbed a Congressional subpoena ] --- and ultimately , President Bush . "
" After Rove refused to show up for a subpoena the Judiciary Committee issued last year , the House of Representatives ' lawyers sued to compel testimony , asserting that immunity should not apply in Rove and Miers ' case , " reports Byrne .
" A federal judge agreed , " with the committee , though " the case is now in appeal with a District of Columbia court . "
Nadler contended , in his MSNBC interview , that Rove has no basis for asserting Executive Privilege in this matter , since the White House has previously claimed they know nothing about the unprecedented firings of U.S. Attorneys , and the other related matters .

LA PAZ ( Reuters ) - A Mexican beauty queen arrested in the company of heavily armed , suspected drug traffickers has been stripped of her Hispanic American beauty title , pageant organizers in Bolivia told local media on Saturday .
Laura Zuniga , 23 , and seven men were detained at a military checkpoint in central Mexico on Monday .
Police found assault rifles and $ 55,000 in cash in the luxury vehicles they had been driving .
Zuniga was ordered jailed on Friday for a further 40 days while investigators probe possible ties to violent smuggling gangs .
Police say they suspect the dark - haired model , who won the Miss Sinaloa and Queen of Hispanic America pageants earlier this year , was the girlfriend of one of the men arrested .
Investigators say he is linked to the Juarez cartel , which operates lucrative smuggling routes into the United States .
“ Promociones Gloria , the company that created and is responsible for ( the pageant ) has dismissed Laura Zuniga as the official Hispanic America Queen 2008 , ” the organisation said in a statement , according to La Paz daily La Razon .
She was to compete in the Miss International pageant next year .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon is battling powerful cartels in his country with soldiers and federal police .
A key witness in O.J. Simpson ’s Las Vegas trial acknowledged to a Nevada investigator that the former NFL star paid him off , the investigator told a judge in Santa Monica on Friday .
The investigator from the Clark County district attorney ’s office said Alfred Beardsley , a loquacious collectibles dealer whose credibility was frequently assailed during the trial , claimed Simpson gave him his Hall of Fame ring in exchange for altering his testimony to help the defense .
“ I asked , ‘ What did you get to change your testimony ? ’ ” said Bill Falkner , who worked with prosecutors who built the armed robbery and kidnapping case against Simpson .
The answer , he said , was the Hall of Fame ring .

The allegation came at a civil court hearing in which attorneys for Fred Goldman asked a judge to order Beardsley to turn over the ring to help satisfy a $ 33.5 - million wrongful - death judgment against Simpson .
A jury acquitted Simpson of the 1994 killings of Goldman ’s son , Ron , and Simpson ’s ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson .
A civil jury later found him liable for the deaths .
Beardsley attended the hearing , but when summoned to the witness stand , he invoked his 5th Amendment right against self - incrimination and refused to testify .
His attorney said he had instructed Beardsley not to answer questions because of rumors about a grand jury investigation targeting the memorabilia dealer in Las Vegas .
Simpson was sentenced a week ago to nine to 33 years in prison .
A jury convicted him in October of armed robbery , kidnapping and other charges stemming from a confrontation with Beardsley and another memorabilia dealer in a casino hotel room last year .

Prosecutors had called Beardsley as a witness but were taken aback when he testified that someone had tampered with an audio recording crucial to their case .
After Beardsley testified , Falkner drove him back to the state prison in Chino where he was serving time for a parole violation .
Falkner said that during the trip , he pressed Beardsley about the change in his testimony .
“ My concern in that vehicle was witness tampering by Mr. Simpson , ” Falkner said in court Friday .
Beardsley , sitting in the front row of the spectator ’s gallery , guffawed when the investigator testified that the Hall of Fame ring was payoff .
Falkner said Beardsley told him he planned to sell it for $ 120,000 , but only after wearing it to Simpson ’s sentencing .
Advertisement
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Gerald Rosenberg ordered Beardsley back to court next Friday to hand over the ring .
Outside court , however , his attorney predicted that Beardsley would be empty - handed .
“ You ca n’t turn over what you do n’t have , ” lawyer Jack Swickard said .
An attorney for Simpson dismissed the allegation , saying Beardsley ’s penchant for lying was well known to prosecutors .
“ They know Beardsley ’s credibility .
They do n’t put any more faith in it than anybody else does , ” he said .
The lawyer added that Beardsley , who bragged about his connections to Simpson before and after the arrest , was incapable of participating in any endeavor requiring discretion .

“ The shot of Beardsley ever having that ring is zero .
The minute he would have gotten the ring he would have tried to sell it and tell the world about it , ” he said .

Following only two months behind iPhone 2.0 ( but at a significant installed - base disadvantage ) , Android still has a long way to go .
But there is definitely some early potential .
Here are our favorite apps of the year .

I still think Android , and its openness toward developers , can do some magical things and give iPhone a run for its money .
But as we stated before , a lot needs to happen first - Android devices need to be a lot more numerous in consumers ' hands , numerous enough for third - party developers ( along with Google 's first - party talent as well ) to have a major incentive to drive the platform forward .
It also has some major network power - management issues to overcome ; the G1's battery never makes it through the day for me , and while that may just be because it 's a shitty battery , Android 's always - on approach to network access and background processes surely plays a part .
Why Android Will Soon Kick Ass
When the T - Mobile G1 was shown off in NYC last week , it did n't have the gusto of a Stevenote .

Anycut : Anycut takes advantage of one of Android 's fundamental strengths - the distillation of every possible event your phone can do - send a text message , go to a specific URL in a browser , etc - into a system - wide Intent , which any app can in turn access .
Anycut allows you to take any intent and create a desktop shortcut for it - say , opening all of your Gmail messages labeled with a specific tag , or sending an SMS message to your most - texted contact .

Power Manager : Another necessity that 's both a blessing and a curse , Power Manager lets you take limited control over the things that influence how long your battery will live - turning on / off all the radios , GPS , adjusting screen brightness , etc according to your current power level .
It should n't be a necessary app for G1 owners , but it is ; on the other hand , it shows how easy it is for a developer to fill a need and access hardware directly without having to ask permission .
System - level functions like this , in large part , are not available to iPhone developers , and that 's notable .

Doing some research into the theory of load testing and traffic loads , I read about the Poisson distribution , which led to Agner Krarup Erlang , which led to early phone switches .
It ’s fascinating to realize that the work we do every day with web servers , which seems like a recent modern technology , was predated by guys like Erlang working with early phone switches over 100 years ago .
Phone switches were the first servers : central machines connected to a large number of potential clients .
In building these switches , the early engineers had to figure out from scratch how to anticipate the possible work load , so they could build switches large enough but not too large .
The whole of queueing theory springs from the theories worked out by telephone switch engineers .
And they were clever guys , even adjusting the UI to lighten the load on the switches .
When dialing a rotary phone , the particular digits determined how long the switch was engaged before the call could be routed .
So when they allocated area codes ,
SANTA ANA , Calif. , Dec. 3 ( UPI ) -- A Southern California man has been convicted of killing a blind friend to steal his car and sell it for parts .
Ruben Alejandro Oliveros , 27 , faces a sentence of life in prison with no parole , The Orange County Register reported .
A jury in Santa Ana , Calif. , deliberated for more than two days before reaching its verdict of first - degree murder Tuesday .

The victim , Raffi Yessayan , 26 , owned a car but he depended on others to drive him because of his eyesight .
Prosecutors said that Oliveros , an alleged member of a gang in Santa Ana , was in the car with other young men .
After the driver pulled into a parking lot , Oliveros shot Yessayan in the head , the newspaper said .
Two alleged accomplices face trial on murder charges and others , including Oliveros ' brother , as accessories .
Garry and Svetlana Yessayan , the victim 's parents , held hands as they heard the verdict .
" We 're not happy over this because now somebody else has sorrow in their lives , " Garry Yessayan told the Register .
" The only difference is that they can visit their son in prison , while we only have pictures . "
Obama has yet to attend church services since winning the election , a departure from his two predecessors .
Obama skips church , heads to gym
President - elect Barack Obama has yet to attend church services since winning the White House earlier this month , a departure from the example of his two immediate predecessors .
On the three Sundays since his election , Obama has instead used his free time to get in workouts at a Chicago gym .
Advertisement
Asked about the president - elect 's decision to not attend church , a transition aide noted that the Obamas valued their faith experience in Chicago but were concerned about the impact their large retinue may have on other parishioners .
" Because they have a great deal of respect for places of worship , they do not want to draw unwelcome or inappropriate attention to a church not used to the attention their attendance would draw , " said the aide .
Both President - elect George W. Bush and President - elect Bill Clinton managed to attend church in the weeks after they were elected .
In November of 1992 , Clinton went to services in Little Rock , Ark. , on the three weekends following his election , taking pre-church jogs on the first two and attending on the third weekend a Catholic Mass with the Rev. Jesse Jackson , with whom he was trying to smooth over lingering campaign tensions .
In the weeks after the contested 2000 election , Bush regularly attended services at Tarrytown United Methodist Church in Austin , Texas , and Al Gore was frequently photographed arriving at and leaving church in Virginia .
On his first day as president - elect , following weeks of Florida recounts and court hearings , Bush went to church with his wife , Laura .
They attended an invite - only prayer service on Thursday , Dec. 14 , at Tarrytown United Methodist Church .
About 300 people attended , including top campaign staff and visiting clergy .
During the service , the Rev. Mark Craig , senior pastor at Highland Park United Methodist Church in Dallas , told Bush , " You have been chosen by God to lead the people . "
Obama was an infrequent churchgoer on the campaign trail , though he did make a series of appearances in the pews and pulpits of South Carolina churches ahead of that heavily religious state 's primary .
The issue of where he worships is , of course , fraught .
For about two decades , Obama and his family attended Chicago 's Trinity United Church of Christ .
But , with the public disclosure earlier this year of incendiary sermons at Trinity by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Obama and his wife , Michelle , in June resigned their membership in the large South Side congregation .
At the time , the then - Illinois senator said that he did n't want his " church experience to be a political circus " and expressed regret for the unwanted attention members of the congregation had received , noting that some reporters had taken church bulletins only to call sick members and shut-ins .
During the campaign , Obama returned to Chicago to attend the South Side 's Apostolic Church of God on Father 's Day Sunday to give a speech aimed at the black community on the importance of fatherhood and family .
A number of Washington , D.C. , churches of different denominations and traditions are now competing to become the spiritual home of the new first family .
The Obama aide said the family " look [s ] forward to finding a church community in Washington , D.C. "
I ’ve been watching , with interest , developers create new applications for the iPhone .
Owning one myself – and being knowledgeable in JavaScript – I ’ve been wondering what options there were for creating downloadable JavaScript applications or the iPhone .
In doing some research I found a number of solutions , some simpler than others , some requiring more knowledge of Objective - C than others .
Before looking at the options I should note that given the requirements of the platform if you ’re really serious about getting in to iPhone development you should learn Objective - C. None of the options appear to provide the full range of functionality that a normally - written application would .
JiggyApp
This was an early entry to the JavaScript iPhone application market – arriving back in 2007 .
It requires a Jailbroken iPhone ( likely running version 1.1 of the Operating System ) .
JiggyApp provides a full API for developing an application – apparently separate from most of the typical APIs .
Arguably , though , the code ends up being relatively usable .
Plugins.load( " UIKit " ) ; var window = new UIWindow ( UIHardware.fullScreenApplicationContentRect ) ; window.setHidden ( false ) ; window.orderFront ( ) ; window.makeKey ( ) ; window.backgroundColor = [ 0.8 , 0 , 0 , 1 ] ; var main View = new UIScroller ( ) ; mainView.contentSize = [ window.bounds [ 2 ] * 2 , window.bounds [ 3 ] * 2 ] ; mainView.backgroundColor = [ 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ] ; window.setContentView ( mainView ) ; var hello = new UITextLabel ( [ 20 , 20 , window.bounds [ 2 ] - 40 , 100 ] ) ; hello.text = " Hello World ! " ; hello.backgroundColor = [ 0 , 0 , 0 , 0.25 ] ; hello.setFont ( new Font( " Trebuchet MS " , 2 , 46 ) ) ; hello.color = [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ] ; hello.centersHorizontally = true ; mainView.addSubview ( hello ) ;
The above snippet was from the Getting Started with Jiggy page .
JSCocoa
JSCocoa is a full bridge that maps Cocoa development into JavaScript ( instead of the typical Objective - C/ Cocoa mapping ) .
The result ends up working in both OS X and on the iPhone .
It ’s a pretty - clear port of Objective - C style and mannerisms but with a JavaScript syntax .
Note some of the differences :
Objective - C/Cocoa :
[ [ NSButton alloc ] initWithFrame : NSMakeRect ( 0 , 0 , 100 , 40 ) ] ;
JSCocoa :
NSButton.instance ( { withFrame : NSMakeRect(0 , 0 , 100 , 40 ) } )
Right now it seems like JSCocoa is more usable for developing OS X applications but the progress moving forward is certainly promising .
“ Applications ” in MobileSafari
While it ’s not , technically , a true iPhone application one option is to adapt your existing web applications to be used in a more application - centric manner .
Apple provides a number of tips for improving the style of your web application .
The most important points of which are :
Providing a tray icon for the application ( to be used when the user saves it ) .
Providing a full - screen view of the application ( with no MobileSafari toolbars showing ) .
This will give the full appearance of a regular iPhone application ( after using some more styling and setup from iui , or similar ) .
PhoneGap
The next step to making your iPhone web application more native - like is to tap into some of the underlying native APIs .
One recent release that will help is that of PhoneGap .
PhoneGap is an application that exposes a few JavaScript APIs to pages running MobileSafari .
Right now this includes Geolocation and access to the Accelerometer .
Geolocation :
getLocation ( ) ; function gotLocation ( lat , lon ) { document.body.innerHTML
= " latitude : " + lat + " longitude : " + lon ; }
Accelerometer :
function updateAccel ( ) { document.body.innerHTML
= " accel : " + accelX + " " + accelY + " " + accelZ ; setTimeout ( updateAccel , 100 ) ; }
They ’re also working on access to the camera , sound , and vibration tools of the phone .
WebTouch
The other day “ Dr Nic ” wrote up an article on how he had used a WebKit instance ( along with HTML , CSS , and JavaScript ) to render a portion of his iPhone application .
I contacted him about the project and wondered if he’d be willing to provide some of the code that backs it .
Written up by his co-worker at Mocra , Anthony Mittaz , the result is called WebTouch .
Right now it ’s just a zip file of sample code but hopefully it ’ll be expanded at some point .
It ’s really simple and gives you a good entry point into the world of hybrid HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Objective - C/ Cocoa development .
If you ’ve been interested in Objective - C this might make for a good starting point , as well .
Bonus
While this is n’t something that you can actually use , I think it ’s pretty cool .
This guy ported my Processing .js work to the iPhone , writing his own Canvas implementation using OpenGL ES hooking in to SpiderMonkey .
There are a lot of options available for the discerning JavaScript developer – the most promising of which is , I think , WebTouch .
It ’s pretty obvious that in order to be able to build the best possible iPhone application you would have to know Objective - C. Having a clear path , paved with JavaScript , to that end result should be any JavaScript developer ’s goal .

Martian dust storms are wreaking havoc with human spacecraft .
Not only did a dust storm cut short the Phoenix lander ’s extended mission , but now , another dust storm around Gusev Crater has cut into the amount of sunlight reaching the solar array on Spirit , one of the Mars Exploration Rovers , leaving the rover in serious trouble from diminished power .
From the image above , it ’s obvious Spirit ’s solar panels are thickly coated with dust .
Although this image was taken over a year ago , it ’s likely the solar panels have only gotten worse .
Spirit ’s solar array produced only 89 watt hours of energy during the rover ’s 1,725th Martian day , which ended on Nov. 9 .
This is the lowest output by either Spirit or its twin , Opportunity , in their nearly five years on Mars , and much less energy than Spirit needs each day .
The charge level of Spirit ’s batteries is dropping so low , it risks triggering an automated response of the rover trying to protect itself .
“ The best chance for survival for Spirit is for us to maintain sequence control of the rover , as opposed to it going into automated fault protection , ” said John Callas of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , project manager for Spirit and Opportunity .
Mission controllers are commanding Spirit to turn off some heaters , including one that protects a science instrument , the miniature thermal emission spectrometer , and take other measures to reduce energy consumption .
The commands will tell Spirit not to try communicating again until Thursday .
While pursuing that strategy the team also plans to listen to Spirit frequently during the next few days to detect signals the rover might send if it does go into a low - energy fault protection mode .
Mars weather forecasts suggest the dust storm may be clearing now or in the next few days .
However , the dust falling from the sky onto Spirit ’s solar array panels also could leave a lingering reduction in the amount of electricity the rover can produce .
We ’ll keep you posted on Spirit ’s condition .

And Fed inaction might have had graver economic consequences , especially if a Buffett deal had fallen through .
In that case , a rapid financial deleveraging would have followed , and the economy would have probably plunged into recession .
That sounds bad , but it might have been better to have experienced a milder version of a downturn in 1998 than the more severe version of 10 years later .
In 1998 , there was no collapsed housing bubble , the government ’s budget was in surplus rather than deficit , bank leverage was much lower , and derivatives markets were smaller and less far - reaching .
A financial crisis related to Long - Term Capital , however painful , probably would have been easier to handle than the perfect storm of recent months .
The ad hoc aspect of the bailout created a precedent for what has come to be called “ regulation by deal ”  now the government ’s modus operandi .
Rather than publicizing definite standards and expectations for bailouts in advance , the Fed and the Treasury confront each particular crisis anew .
Decisions are made as to whether a merger is possible , whether a consortium can be organized , what kind of loan guarantees can be offered and what kind of concessions will be extracted in return .
So far , every deal  or lack thereof , in the case of Lehman Brothers  has been different .
While there are some advantages to leaving discretion in regulators ’ hands , this has n’t worked out very well .
It has become increasingly apparent that the market does n’t know what to expect and that many financial institutions are sitting on the sidelines , waiting to see what regulators will do next .
Regulatory uncertainty is stifling the ability of financial markets to engineer at least a partial recovery .
John Maynard Keynes famously proclaimed that “ in the long run we are all dead . ”
From the vantage point of 1998 , today is indeed the “ long run . ”
We ’re not quite dead , but we are seriously ailing .
As we look ahead , we may be tempted again to put off the hard choices .
But perhaps the next “ long run , ” too , is no more than 10 years away .
If we take the Keynesian maxim too seriously , and focus only on the short run , our prospects will be grim indeed .
So once again , Israel has opened the gates of hell to the Palestinians .
Forty civilian refugees dead in a United Nations school , three more in another .
Not bad for a night 's work in Gaza by the army that believes in " purity of arms " .
But why should we be surprised ?
Have we forgotten the 17,500 dead – almost all civilians , most of them children and women – in Israel 's 1982 invasion of Lebanon ; the 1,700 Palestinian civilian dead in the Sabra - Chatila massacre ; the 1996 Qana massacre of 106 Lebanese civilian refugees , more than half of them children , at a UN base ; the massacre of the Marwahin refugees who were ordered from their homes by the Israelis in 2006 then slaughtered by an Israeli helicopter crew ; the 1,000 dead of that same 2006 bombardment and Lebanese invasion , almost all of them civilians ?
What is amazing is that so many Western leaders , so many presidents and prime ministers and , I fear , so many editors and journalists , bought the old lie ; that Israelis take such great care to avoid civilian casualties .
" Israel makes every possible effort to avoid civilian casualties , " yet another Israeli ambassador said only hours before the Gaza massacre .
And every president and prime minister who repeated this mendacity as an excuse to avoid a ceasefire has the blood of last night 's butchery on their hands .
Had George Bush had the courage to demand an immediate ceasefire 48 hours earlier , those 40 civilians , the old and the women and children , would be alive .

What happened was not just shameful .
It was a disgrace .
Would war crime be too strong a description ?
For that is what we would call this atrocity if it had been committed by Hamas .
So a war crime , I 'm afraid , it was .
After covering so many mass murders by the armies of the Middle East – by Syrian troops , by Iraqi troops , by Iranian troops , by Israeli troops – I suppose cynicism should be my reaction .
But Israel claims it is fighting our war against " international terror " .
The Israelis claim they are fighting in Gaza for us , for our Western ideals , for our security , for our safety , by our standards .
And so we are also complicit in the savagery now being visited upon Gaza .
I 've reported the excuses the Israeli army has served up in the past for these outrages .
Since they may well be reheated in the coming hours , here are some of them : that the Palestinians killed their own refugees , that the Palestinians dug up bodies from cemeteries and planted them in the ruins , that ultimately the Palestinians are to blame because they supported an armed faction , or because armed Palestinians deliberately used the innocent refugees as cover .
The Sabra and Chatila massacre was committed by Israel 's right - wing Lebanese Phalangist allies while Israeli troops , as Israel 's own commission of inquiry revealed , watched for 48 hours and did nothing .
When Israel was blamed , Menachem Begin 's government accused the world of a blood libel .
After Israeli artillery had fired shells into the UN base at Qana in 1996 , the Israelis claimed that Hizbollah gunmen were also sheltering in the base .
It was a lie .
The more than 1,000 dead of 2006 – a war started when Hizbollah captured two Israeli soldiers on the border – were simply dismissed as the responsibility of the Hizbollah .
Israel claimed the bodies of children killed in a second Qana massacre may have been taken from a graveyard .
It was another lie .
The Marwahin massacre was never excused .
The people of the village were ordered to flee , obeyed Israeli orders and were then attacked by an Israeli gunship .
The refugees took their children and stood them around the truck in which they were travelling so that Israeli pilots would see they were innocents .
Then the Israeli helicopter mowed them down at close range .
Only two survived , by playing dead .
Israel did n't even apologise .
Twelve years earlier , another Israeli helicopter attacked an ambulance carrying civilians from a neighbouring village – again after they were ordered to leave by Israel – and killed three children and two women .
The Israelis claimed that a Hizbollah fighter was in the ambulance .
It was untrue .
I covered all these atrocities , I investigated them all , talked to the survivors .
So did a number of my colleagues .
Our fate , of course , was that most slanderous of libels : we were accused of being anti-Semitic .
And I write the following without the slightest doubt : we 'll hear all these scandalous fabrications again .
We 'll have the Hamas - to - blame lie – heaven knows , there is enough to blame them for without adding this crime – and we may well have the bodies - from - the - cemetery lie and we 'll almost certainly have the Hamas - was - in - the - UN - school lie and we will very definitely have the anti-Semitism lie .
And our leaders will huff and puff and remind the world that Hamas originally broke the ceasefire .
It did n't .
Israel broke it , first on 4 November when its bombardment killed six Palestinians in Gaza and again on 17 November when another bombardment killed four more Palestinians .
Yes , Israelis deserve security .
Twenty Israelis dead in 10 years around Gaza is a grim figure indeed .
But 600 Palestinians dead in just over a week , thousands over the years since 1948 – when the Israeli massacre at Deir Yassin helped to kick - start the flight of Palestinians from that part of Palestine that was to become Israel – is on a quite different scale .
This recalls not a normal Middle East bloodletting but an atrocity on the level of the Balkan wars of the 1990s .
And of course , when an Arab bestirs himself with unrestrained fury and takes out his incendiary , blind anger on the West , we will say it has nothing to do with us .
Why do they hate us , we will ask ?
But let us not say we do not know the answer .
Switzerland set to approve prescription heroin as ' safe alternative ' for addicts
The heroin programme has won support since it began 14 years ago ( Photo posed by model )
A pioneering Swiss programme aimed to curb drug abuse by providing addicts with a clean , safe place to take heroin is expected to be made permanent by voters in a referendum on Sunday .
The programme has been criticised by the United States and the U.N. narcotics board , which said it would fuel drug abuse .
But governments as far away as Australia are beginning or considering their own systems modeled on the Swiss one , which is credited with reducing crime and improving the health and daily lives of addicts .
It has won wide support within Switzerland since it began 14 years ago to eliminate scenes of large groups of drug users shooting up openly in parks that marred Swiss cities in the 1980s and 1990s .
Dr. Daniele Zullino 's office , part of the Geneva University Hospitals , is one of 23 such centres in Switzerland .
The heroin is produced by a government - approved laboratory .
Among the nearly 1,300 addicts whom other therapies have failed to help , patients take doses carefully measured to satisfy their cravings but not enough to cause a big high .
Four at a time inject themselves as a nurse watches .
' Heroin prescription is not an end in itself , ' said Dr. Zullino , noting that the 47 addicts who come to his office receive a series of additional treatments , such as therapy with a psychiatrist and counseling by social workers .
' The aim is that the patients learn how to function in society , ' he said , adding that after participating in it for two to three years , one - third of the patients start abstinence - programmes and one - third change to methadone treatment .
' Thanks to this policy we do n't have open drug scenes anymore , ' said Andreas Kaesermann , a spokesman for the Social Democrat Party , part of the coalition government .
A mid-November survey of 1,209 voters by the respected gfs Bern research institute indicated it will be easily approved , with 63 per cent of voters favouring it compared with 21 per cent opposed .
Health insurance pays for the bulk of it , which costs 26 million Swiss francs ( $ 22 million ) a year .
All residents in Switzerland are required to have health insurance , with the government paying insurance premiums for those who cannot afford it .
' It 's wrong that the health insurance pays for this , ' said Alain Hauert , spokesman for the right - wing Swiss People 's Party .
He said the state should invest more money in prevention and law enforcement .
Crimes committed by heroin addicts have dropped 60 per cent since it began in 1994 , according to the Federal Office of Public Health .
Dr Zullino said patients reduce consumption of other narcotics once they start the programme and suffer less from psychiatric disorders .
But , he added , ' the idea has never been to liberalise heroin .
It 's considered a medicine and used as such . '
BBC documentary takes on Obama 's plans for American health care system Nick Cargo
Published : Sunday January 25 , 2009
Print This Email This A January 19 episode of BBC One 's Panorama , the world 's longest running television documentary show , tackles the dismal state of health care in the United States , the lengths to which its estimated 45 million uninsured citizens will go to in pursuit of care , the pharmaceutical industry 's rigged pricing against the American patient , and the insurance industry 's efforts to deny care whenever possible .
The documentary opens in rural Kentucky , where people have driven within a 200 - mile radius to wait in line in the early morning for a spot in line to see a volunteer doctor thanks to the efforts of Remote Access Medical , who originally set out to help people in the Amazon jungle , but now focus 60 % of their time on Americans .
" The need is enormous , " said the organization 's founder Stan Brock .
" We discovered ... there are people here that need help just as much as they do in Guatemala or in the Amazon and all these other places we go to . "
President Obama faces a difficult task to deliver on his promises of change , the segment explains , the country divided between the " super rich " and the " new poor , " and lobbyists putting their power to work to prevent reforms from taking place .
Also , 533 members of Congress , out of 535 , have received campaign contributions from within the health sector .
" We plan on mounting a national campaign , " warned health insurance industry lobbyist Angela Hunter , " and what we hope to do is to , number one , get some articles in the newspaper explaining what the problems are that we see with the plan .
Two : Educate lawmakers , people who are members of our organizations , their clients -- to go and lobby members of Congress - - call them on the phone , visit them in their offices , and to just do everything that we can possibly do to preserve the freedom of choice for individuals in health care in America . "
" It 's really a system of legalized bribery , " said Richard Kirsch of Healthcare for America Now .
" As one congressman says , we 're the only people in the world who are expected to take money from strangers and provide nothing in return . "
Due to licensing restrictions , the episode , " What Now , Mr. President ? , " is only officially available to view online from connections within the United Kingdom .
However , it has also been uploaded to YouTube , where it appears in three parts below .
Micromem reports that their MRAM RFID samples will be available by the end of the month .
The MRAM arrays are manufactured by Global Communications Semiconductor , and are currently undergoing full performance testing .
Micromem also says that BAE Systems has completed manufacturing of Micromem 's wafers .
BAE 's initial products will also be delivered during December .
BAE makes both MRAM arrays and Magnetic Sensors based on Micromem 's tech .
These days , Snopes.com has become the be-all , end - all arbiter of truth .
I do n't know how this happened .
The site is wrong about a great many things , for some reason people still cite Snopes to me as " proof " that I am wrong about one thing or another , as if they were a know - all god that can not tell a lie .
Well , when it comes to 9/11 , Snopes.com is a false and very outdated god .
Because I have a very strong understanding of how media deception works , it comes as no surprise to see how ignorant the general population of the United States is about 9/11 , and that to this day so many people still believe the official narrative of the events of that day .
The disconnect between the official narrative and the body of available evidence could not be greater .
Still , the general public still does not understand that the evidence that has been unearthed not only exposes the lies of the official story , but , in fact strongly supports theories that 9/11 was an inside job .
This is mainly because the official body of evidence is never discussed by the gatekeepers in the establishment media .
As an example , consider the entire bin Laden aspect of the 9/11 events .
Everyone from the left to the right continues to babble on about how we need to get bin Laden , and how George W. Bush should have gone after bin Laden after 9/11 and how bin Laden is our greatest enemy .
Well , everyone except the FBI .
You see , the FBI admitted that they do not have any evidence linking bin Laden to the events of 9/11 and as of the writing of this article they do not reference 9/11 on their Most Wanted bin Laden page .
I may be incorrect but I believe that I was the first person to point this out , doing so in April of 2006 .
At least , I was not and am not aware that anyone else pointed this out prior to my article .
Either way , by June 2006 others went ahead and confirmed my findings .
But thanks to the reality management of the mainstream media , very few people know about this .
Anyway , recently I was perusing some forum when I came across an argument about 9/11 , where some well meaning but ill informed person chimed in by citing Snopes as proof that the Bush administration did not defy the no-fly rules imposed on the nation ater 9/11 in order to shuttle members of the bin Laden family out of the country .
( This was pointed out by Michael Moore in his film Fahrenheit 911 ) As of today , 10- 30- 2008 , Snopes , the be-all , end - all source of truth , has this " fact " listed as FALSE !
Unfortunately for Snopes I do n't like liars ... and I am calling them out on this .
I am not only publicly requesting that they correct this information but I would like to know why information on a topic this important has been wrong for so long on their site ?
I will bet you that people have tried to get them to correct this " error . "
Snopes last updated this article on December 11th , 2005 .
Of course , since that time , a great deal of new evidence has come to light , much of which clearly contradicts the claims stated on the site .
Snopes , however , has not corrected their incomplete , out of date , and incorrect declaration in almost three years !!!
The unreliable and condescending people who run Snopes.com have chosen to belittle and ridicule factual evidence that contradicts the official narrative about the attacks of 9/11 .
They have chosen to ignore evidence that exposes the many 9/11 - related lies told by the Bush administration , stooping so low as to title this particular piece : " Flights of Fancy ! "
Well , a more respectable website has provided the public with pretty solid evidence contradicting the deception perpetrated by Snopes , the Bush administration , and the criminal establishment media !
The flights in question did take place and the information related to those flights were indeed covered up by the US government .
The F.B.I did contradict its own conclusion when explaining the circumstances involving the flights , and most importantly the criminal media did absolutely nothing to make the public aware of any ofl this .
If you were paying attention , you would have noticed that this information was originally confirmed by Richard Clarke during the 9/11 Commission ( Omission ) hearings .
But for those of you who do not remember , like the people who run Snopes.com ... here is some more recent documentation :
So here is my simple request ... next time anyone feels like correcting me on an issue , leave Snopes.com out of the conversation .
Unless you are trying to prove to me that the latest spam epidemic is dangerous , I prefer to get my information validated by someone or something that can itself be proven valid .
After being taunted for being a lesbian , a woman in the city of Richmond was " repeatedly raped and left naked outside an abandoned apartment building " by four strangers on December 13 .
Detectives say the 28 - year - old victim was attacked Dec. 13 after she got out of her car , which bore a rainbow gay pride sticker .
The men , who ranged from their late teens to their 30s , made comments indicating they knew her sexual orientation , said Richmond police Lt. Mark Gagan .
The rape started when one of the attackers hit her " with a blunt object , ordered her to disrobe and sexually assaulted her with the help of the other men . "
Unless the men in question are n't brutally and slowly murdered beforehand by citizens , a $ 10,000 reward is being offered for their capture .
One of the men , it seems , went by the nickname " Blue " and another was called " Pato , " according to police .
The rape is ( correctly ) being considered a hate crime by police .
According to Avy Skolnik , a coordinator with the New York - based National Coalition of Anti-Violence Program , " Anytime there is an anti-LGBT initiative , we tend to see spikes both in the numbers and the severity of attacks ...
People feel this extra entitlement to act out their prejudice . "
Gay rights advocates say that hate crimes based on sexual orientation have increased nationwide over the last month .
IST Announces Release of Portable " Green Energy Machine "
January 20th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Yesterday , IST Energy released the world ’s first compact , mobile waste - to energy system : the GEM ( Green Energy Machine ) .
The slick - looking device converts trash into pellets that are in turn converted into electricity and gas heat .
95 percent of daily consumer waste can be dumped into the machine , including paper , plastic , wood , food , and agricultural materials .
Since the GEM is so portable , it is ideal for locations that produce at least two tons of trash daily .
A GEM unit that processes three tons of waste daily , for example , can power and heat a 200,000 square foot building containing over 500 people .
The GEM is eight feet high and covers the size of three parking spaces , so it wo n’t attract undue attention .
IST Energy is currently scheduling customer demonstrations , and initial deliveries will begin this summer .
The GEM costs a hefty $ 850,000 , but with a payback period of 3 - 4 years , it still seems like a no - brainer for large companies .

MD 20/20
18 % or 13 % alc. by vol .
As majestic as the cascading waters of a drain pipe , MD 20/20 is bottled by the 20/20 wine company in Westfield , New York .
This is a good place to start for the street wine rookie , but beware ; this dog has a bite to back up its bark .
MD Stands for Mogen David , and is affectionately called " Mad Dog 20 /20 " .
You 'll find this beverage as often in a bum 's nest as in the rock quarry where the high school kids sneak off to drink .
This beverage is likely the most consumed by non-bums , but that does n't stop any bums from drinking it !
Our research indicates that MD 20/20 is the best of the bum wines at making you feel warm inside .
Some test subjects report a slight numbing agent in MD 20 / 20 , similar to the banana paste that the dentist puts in your mouth before injecting it with novocain .
Anyone that can afford a dentist should steer clear of this disaster .
Avaliable in various nauseating tropical flavors that coat your whole system like bathtub scum , but only the full " Red Grape Wine " flavor packs the 18 % whallop .
Liquor stores are starting to be infiltrated by a 13 % variety of MD 20/20 Red Grape .
There is also a new " Blue Raspberry " flavor with " BLING BLING " .
Even the lowest functioning of bums will know not to get swindled out of 5 % .

The vast majority of Illinois voters want scandal - plagued Gov. Rod Blagojevich to immediately resign as governor , according to a new poll conducted by the Glengariff Group .
The poll shows 70 percent of voters believing that Blagojevich should resign now , while only 25 percent should wait until he is proven guilty .
A 73 percent majority support the impeachment of the governor – including a majority of Democrats – with 58 percent “ strongly supporting ” his impeachment . .
His approval rating , meanwhile , has tanked to seven percent .
Among Democrats , only 13 percent approve of his performance .
Even African - American voters in Illinois , which comprised his only base of support in recent months , have broken with the governor .
Only 20 percent of African - American voters approve of his performance .
Still , a 48 percent plurality of black voters believe he should remain in office until proven guilty .
“ There are no bright spots for Governor Blagojevich in these numbers , " said Glengariff Group CEO Richard Czuba .
" Governor Blagojevich no longer has a base of support from which to govern .
He has lost Democratic voters , Cook County voters , and even a majority of his strongest base – African American voters – now support his impeachment . "
The poll surveyed 600 registered voters in Illinois from December 9 - 10 , and has a 4 percent margin of error .

Intro
In this post I will talk about some of the techniques used to attack systems , and some solutions that can reduce much the number of attacks that a system may suffer .
A vision to the attack from scanning to gain root in one system .
This work is a continuation of my work on honeypots .
The attacks presented here could be seen in a honeypot of high activity , real systems that have known vulnerabilities .
Unfortunately I used one low activity honeypot in previous posts , emulation of vulnerabilities , so I just could not get to identify some of the attacks mentioned herein .
This post continues in Part II .
Starting
First let me talk about the profile of the principal threat that we face from the moment
we use the Internet , the Script Kiddie .
To a Script Kiddie not interest who is he attacking , its only purpose is to gain root access in a machine .
The problem is that for helping him he has several tools that automate all the process , the only thing that usually has to do is put the tool to scan the entire Internet .
Sooner or later it is guaranteed that he will get access in some machine .
The fact that these tools are becoming more known ally to randomness searches , this threat is extremely dangerous because it is not “ if ” but “ when ” we will be victims of a search .
I introduced the “ who ” , now let me introduce the “ how ” .
Before starting any type of attack , the enemy must find that machines are online and their ports ( services ) that are open to the outside .
This technique is called Port Scanning
Port Scanning
Port Scanning is used both by system administrators and by attackers , the first thing to determine the level of security of their machines ; seconds to find the vulnerabilities as I said before .
I will give special focus to this technique because it domain is essential in both situations .
Basically a Port Scan is send a message to each port of a machine and depending on what kind of response we get determine the status of the port .
These possible state ports are :
Open or Accepted :
The machine has sent a response to indicate that a service that is listening port
Closed , Denied or Not Listening :
The machine has sent a response to indicate that any connection the port will be denied
Filtered , Dropped or Blocked :
There was no response from the machine
Just a note on the legality of this technique : in fact Port Scanning can be seen as a bell to ring to confirm if someone is home .
Nobody can be accused of nothing just for doing a Port Scan .
Now if we are playing constantly on the bell , could be alleged the similarity to a denial of service ( for more about legal issues related to Port Scanning ) .
Now we are ready to see the most popular techniques in Port Scanning .
TCP SYN scan
The SYN scan is the most popular because it can be done in a very quick way , searching thousands
of ports per second on a network ( fast network and without firewalls ) .
This kind of scan is relatively discreet because they never complete TCP connections .
It also allows a distinct differentiation between the states of ports with a good confidence .
This technique is also known as semi-open scan because it never gets to open a complete TCP connection .
It is sent a SYN packet ( the beginning of a normal complete connection ) and expects a answer .
If it receives a SYN / ACK , the port is Open , if it receives a RST , the port is Closed , and if there is no response after several retransmissions of the SYN , the port is marked as Filtered .
This last scenario repeats itself in the event of an ICMP Unreachable Error .
Normal scenario ( client send a SYN , server reply with SYN / ACK , and client send an ACK ) :
TCP SYN attack ( client send a SYN , server reply with SYN / ACK , and client do nothing ) :
This technique is used when the user does not have privileges to create crude packets ( in nmap for example , you must have root privileges to this option . )
Rather than be sent in “ custom ” packets as in all other techniques mentioned here , it established a complete TCP connection in the target machine port .
This causes a considerable increase of time for giving same information as the previous technique ( most packets are produced ) .
In addition , most operative systems log these connections , because it is not a quick or silent scan .
On Unix , for example , is added an entry in syslog .
UDP scan
A UDP scanis much slower than a TCP one , one of the reasons why many systems administrators ignore the security of these ports , but not the attackers .
This technique consists in sending an empty UDP header ( no data ) to all target ports .
If an ICMP Unreachable Error is returned , depending on type and code of error is given the port state ( Closed or Filtered ) .
However if returned another UDP header , then the port is Open , if not received any response after the retransmissions of the header , the port is classified as a combination of Open or Filtered because may be in a state or in the other .
But as I said the greatest disadvantage of this technique is the time spent on scan ; Open or Filtered ports rarely respond which can lead to several retransmissions ( because it is assumed that the packet could have been lost ) .
Closed ports are an even bigger problem because normally respond with ICMP Unreachable Errors and many operative systems limit the frequency of ICMP packets transmission , as a example in Linux that normally limited to a maximum of one package per second .
Faced with such constraints , if we were to the full range of ports of a machine ( 65536 ports ) it will take more than 18 hours .
Some optimizations can pass through the more common ports .
There are many others techniques used in Port Scanning ( more information : here ) but this ones come to show the behavior of this type of scan .
It is easy to see why it is a critical process for an attacker methodology .
For the correct identification of the target , only one technique can not be the most appropriate / enough .
So the Port Scanning area is not only making TCP SYN scans .
The tool I recommend to Port Scanning is the Nmap because it supports all these techniques that I said , and a lot more .
This tool is being actively developed , and the author Gordon “ Fyodor ” Lyon is a guru in this area and highly responsible for the constant development of it .
For more information about Port scanning go to Nmap page explaining Port Scanning Techniques .
Gain access to the machine
At this time the attacker already has a huge list of reachable machines and services .
Now to get remote access on a machine , in essence , we can use two techniques : brute - force / password dictionaries ( see the Infinite monkey theorem ) .
It may seem silly but it is still heavily used in services such as SSH .
As you can see in your / var / log / auth.log file …

And these are just some of the hundreds of attempts that it recorded .
I will then present some strategies for protection against these attacks :
Use strong passwords
This section may seem ridiculous but the fact that this type of attack is used demonstrates the lack of choice of passwords culture .
Here are some requirements to define a strong password in today times :
A password should have , a minimum of 8 characters
If the password can be found in a dictionary is trivial and is not good .
Attackers have large dictionaries of words in different languages ( via IP , for example , can determine the dictionary to use )
As trivial variations of trivial passwords , such as “ p4ssword ” is almost as bad as “ password ” in a dictionary attack but is substantially better in an brute - force attack
The password should ideally be a combination of symbols , numbers , uppercase and lowercase
Mnemonic are easy to remember ( even with special symbols ) and this is the best kind of passwords , such as “ Whiskey - Cola is EUR 3 in Academic Bar ! ” = “ W - CiE3iAB ! ” ( this password is Very String according to The Password Meter )
The fact is , using strong passwords can prevent the success of the attempt but not prevent the numerous attempts that are made consistently .
And in an extreme situation might be suffering Denial of Service attacks ( it is imperative to avoid this on a machine whose purpose is to offer the service to the outside ) .
Not mentioned the fact that we can limit the number of connections established in the port 22 ( SSH ) through iptables .
Using iptables to mitigating the attacks
We can limiting the access to a single source :
iptables -A INPUT -m state -- state NEW -m tcp -p tcp -s 192.168.1.100 -- dport 22 -j ACCEPT
The -s flag is used to indicate the source host ip .
We can also restrict the access to some sub -net , or some IP class address with this flag :
iptables -A INPUT -m state -- state NEW -m tcp -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 - dport 22 -j ACCEPT
If we want access our machine from everyware we might want to limit our server to accept , for example , 2 connections per minute :
iptables -N SSH_CONNECTION -A INPUT -m state -- state NEW -p tcp -- dport 22 -j SSH_CONNECTION
-A SSH_CONNECTION -m recent -- set -- name SSH -A SSH_CONNECTION -m recent -- update -- seconds 60 -- hitcount 3 -- name SSH -j DROP
We can create a new chain called SSH_CONNECTION .
The chain uses the recent module to allow at maximum two connection attempts per minute per IP .
RSA authentication
To avoid the use of passwords , we can use a pair of RSA keys completely avoiding brute - force / dictionaries attacks .
To do this we will do the following steps :
Generate the key pair with the command
ssh - keygen -t rsa
This command create the files :
~/.ssh /id_rsa ( private key ) and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ( public key ) .
In each machine where we want to connect ( target ) , put the “ id_rsa.pub ” generated in ~/.ssh / authorized_keys concatenate the contents of this form for example :

Exploitation of vulnerabilities
Now that we reduce the chances of being attacked , let ’s see another way that attackers use to gain access into a system .
Exploit is the name given to a piece of code used to exploit flaws in applications in order to cause a behavior not previously anticipated in them .
Thus is common , for example , gaining control of a machine or spread privileges .
A widely used type of exploit is stack smashing which occurs when a program writes a memory address outside their allocated space for the structure of data in the stack , usually a buffer of fixed size .
Take a very simple example of local implementation of this exploit :
# include # include int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { char buffer [ 10 ] ; strcpy ( buffer , argv [ 1 ] ) ; printf ( buffer ) ; return 0 ; }
When we try to execute the above code , we get :
user@honeypot :~$ gcc exploit .c -o exploit user@honeypot :~$ ./ exploit thisisanexploit *** stack smashing detected *** : ./ exploit terminated thisisanexploitAborted
As we can see , GCC has introduced mechanisms for blocking implementation of code potentially malicious .
But this example is as simple as possible .
More sophisticated attacks against systems can avoid this mechanisms .
The stack
When a function is called , the return value must be addressed , and it address must be somewhere saved in the stack .
Saving the return address into the stack is one advantage , each task has its own stack , so each must have its return address .
Another thing , is that recursion is completely supported .
In case that a function call itself , a return address must be created for each recursive phase , in each stack function call .
For example , the following code :
/** lengthOf returns the length of list l */ public int lengthOf ( Cell l ) { int length ; if ( l == null ) { length = 0 ; } else { length = 1 + lengthOf(l.getNext ( ) ) ; } return length ; }
Will produce the following stacks :
The stack also contain local data storage .
If any function declare local variables , they are stored there also .
And may also contain parameters passed to the function , for more information about that .
GCC and Stack canary’s
If you wondering why a canary .
GCC , and other compilers insert in the stack known values to monitor buffer overflows .
In the case that the stack buffer overflows , the first field to be corrupted will be the canary .
Forward , the sub- routines inserted into the program by GCC verify the canary field and verify that this as changed , sending a message “ *** stack smashing detected *** ” .
For more information about this subject .
Stack corruption
If you still thinking what stack buffer overflow is god for ?
I give you a simple example ( from Wikipedia article ) .
Imagine you have the following code :
void foo ( char * bar ) { char c [ 12 ] ; memcpy ( c , bar , strlen ( bar ) ) ; // no bounds checking ... } int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { foo( argv [ 1 ] ) ; }
As you can see , there are no verification about the input of the function foo , about the * bar variable .
This is the stack that are created at some point when this function is called by another one :
When you call the foo , like :
void function ( ) { char * newBar = ( char *) malloc ( sizeof ( char ) * 6 ) ; strcpy ( newBar , " hello " ) ; foo ( newBar ) ; }
This is what happens to the stack :
Now , if you try this :
void function ( ) { char * newBar = ( char *) malloc ( sizeof ( char ) * 24 ) ; strcpy ( newBar , " A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​A​x08​x35​xC0​x80 " ) ; foo ( newBar ) ; }
This is what happens to the stack :
So , now , when the foo function terminates , it will pop the return address and jump to that address ( 0x08C03508 , in this case ) , and not to the expected one .
In this iamge , the address 0x08C03508 is the beginning of the char c [ 12 ] code .
Where the attacker can previously put shellcode , and not AAAAA string …
Now imagine that this program is SUID bit on to run as root , you can instantly scale to root …
Fortunately this kind of attacks is being to reduce , since the introduction of stack canary ’s .
This kind of protection is possible because the stack is not dynamic , but as we gone see later ( in part II ) , the heap is .

Every doctor starts as a student .
And the experiences students have in medical school help shape the kind of doctors they become .
But the reality is , many medical students are painfully unhappy .
That ’s the issue explored by Dr. Pauline W. Chen in her latest “ Doctor and Patient ” column .
Medical school was not easy for me .
I knew that I wanted to become a doctor to help people , but I had given little thought to the process .
I was poorly prepared for many things : the pressure to excel in ways that seemed so far from caring for people ; rapidly mounting debts I signed off on every semester ; a roller coaster existence from chronic lack of sleep ; hazing from the more experienced students and residents ; and the realities of patient suffering despite my best efforts .
Dr. Chen explores the fascinating research about medical student burnout and why it happens .

A computer model that can predict how people will complete a controlled task and how the knowledge needed to complete that task develops over time is the product of a group of researchers , led by a professor from Penn State 's College of Information Sciences and Technology .
Frank Ritter , associate professor of IST and psychology , and his research associates , used the Soar programming language , which is designed to represent human knowledge , on a 20 - trial circuit troubleshooting task most recently done by 10 students at the University of Nottingham , UK .
Each participant was to identify faults in a circuit system after memorizing the organization of its components and switches .
This process was repeated 20 times for each person , with the series of tests chosen randomly each time .
Their choices and reaction times were recorded and compared with the computer model 's results .
Much like the students , the computer model , called Diag , learned as it went through each test and developed the knowledge for completing the task quickly and efficiently .
" The model does not merely accurately predict problem - solving time for the human participants ; it also replicates the strategy that human participants use , and it learns at the same rate at which the participants learn , " Ritter said .
In most cases , the model came within two to four seconds of predicting how long it would take each participant to solve the problem and it fit eight out of the 10 participants ' problem - solving times very well .
Ritter said the results outlined in the paper were consistent with previous trials , showing the development of regularity in the model .
" The project shows we can predict human learning on a fine - grained level , " Ritter said .
" Everyone thinks that 's possible , but here 's an actual model doing it .
The model provides a detailed representation of how a transfer works , and that transfer process is really what education is about . "
Ritter worked with Peter Bibby and two research assistants at the University of Nottingham .
Their paper , " Modeling How , When , and What is Learned in a Simple Fault - Finding Task , " appeared in the July / August 2008 issue of Cognitive Science .

After firing 4,600 tear - gas canisters in the past week , the Greek police have nearly exhausted their stock .
As they seek emergency supplies from Israel and Germany , still the petrol bombs and stones of the protesters rain down , with clashes again outside parliament yesterday .
Bringing together youths in their early twenties struggling to survive amid mass youth unemployment and schoolchildren swotting for highly competitive university exams that may not ultimately help them in a treacherous jobs market , the events of the past week could be called the first credit - crunch riots .
There have been smaller - scale sympathy attacks from Moscow to Copenhagen , and economists say countries with similarly high youth unemployment problems such as Spain and Italy should prepare for unrest .
Ostensibly , the trigger for the Greek violence was the police shooting of a 15 - year - old boy , Alexis Grigoropoulos .
A forensic report leaked to Greek newspapers indicated he was killed by a direct shot , not a ricochet as the policeman 's lawyer had claimed .
The first protesters were on the streets of Athens within 90 minutes of Alexis 's death , the start of the most traumatic week Greece has endured for decades .
The destructiveness of the daily protests , which left many stores in Athens 's smartest shopping area in ruins and caused an estimated € 2bn ( £ 1.79 bn ) in damage , has stunned Greece and baffled the world .
And there was no let - up yesterday , as angry youths shrugged off torrential rain to pelt police with firebombs and stones , block major roads and occupy a private radio station .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Their parents grope for explanations .
Tonia Katerini , whose 17 - year - old son Michalis was out on the streets the day after the killing , emphasised the normality of the protesters .
" It 's not just 20 or 30 people , we 're talking about 1,000 young people .
These are not people who live in the dark , they are the sort you see in the cafes .
The criminals and drug addicts turned up later , to loot the stores .
The children were very angry that one of them had been killed ; and they wanted the whole society not to sleep quietly about this , they wanted everyone to feel the same fear they felt .
And they were also expressing anger towards society , towards the religion of consumerism , the polarisation of society between the few haves and the many have - nots . "
Protest has long been a rite of passage for urban Greek youth .
The downfall of the military dictatorship in 1974 is popularly ascribed to a student uprising ; the truth was more complicated , but that is the version that has entered student mythology , giving them an enduring sense of their potential .
So no one was surprised that Alexis 's death a week ago today brought his fellow teenagers on to the streets .
But why were the protests so impassioned and long - lasting ?
" The death of this young boy was a catalyst that brought out all the problems of society and of youth that have been piling up all these years and left to one side with no solutions , " said Nikos Mouzelis , emeritus professor of sociology at LSE .
" Every day , the youth of this country experiences further marginalisation . "
Although Greece 's headline unemployment of 7.4 per cent is just below the eurozone average , the OECD estimates that unemployment among those aged 15 to 24 is 22 per cent , although some economists put the real figure at more like 30 per cent .
" Because of unemployment , a quarter of those under 25 are below the poverty line , " said Petros Linardos , an economist at the Labour Institute of the Greek trade unions .
" That percentage has been increasing for the past 10 years .
There is a diffused , widespread feeling that there are no prospects .
This is a period when everyone is afraid of the future because of the economic crisis .
There is a general feeling that things are going to get worse .
And there is no real initiative from the government . "
For Greek youngsters such as Michalis Katerini , job prospects are not rosy , but without a university degree they would be far worse , so he and his mother are making serious sacrifices to get him into further education .
So inadequate is the teaching in his state high school that he , like tens of thousands of others across the country , must study three hours per night , five nights a week at cramming school after regular school , to have a hope of attaining the high grades required to get the university course of his choice .
His mother , whose work as an architect is down 20 per cent on last year , must pay € 800 a month to the crammer for the last , crucial year of high school .
She believes the government of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis faces more turbulence if it fails to grasp the reality of the past week , and pass it off as a spontaneous over - reaction .
" The government has tried hard not to connect what is happening with the problems of young people .
The government says one boy died , his friends are angry , they over - reacted then anarchists came to join in the game .
But this is not the reality . "
Vicky Stamatiadou , a kindergarten teacher in the rich northern suburbs with two teenage sons , agrees .
" Until now , our society was full of dirty but calm water ; nothing was moving , nothing improving , all the problems of our society remained unsolved for years .
People pretended that everything was going well .
But now this false picture has been broken and we are facing reality . "
Greece 's official youth unemployment statistics are not far removed from the rates in other European countries with a history of mass protest , such as France , Italy and Spain .
With the graffiti " The Coming Insurrection " plastered near the Greek consulate in Bordeaux this week , the warning signs to the rest of the continent 's leaders are clear .

Well , here ’s a fine howdy - do : Rick Warren , pastor of the mother of all mega- churches , has been tapped to channel Jesus conduct a seance deliver the invocation at Barack Obama ’s inauguration .
Because Warren is , you know , a “ moderate . ”
… in 2004 Warren declared that marriage , reproductive choice , and stem cell research were “ non-negotiable ” issues for Christian voters and has admitted that the main difference between himself and James Dobson is a matter of tone .
He criticized Obama ’s answers at the Faith Forum he hosted before the election and vowed to continue to pressure him to change his views on the issue of reproductive choice .
He came out strongly in support of Prop 8 , saying “ there is no need to change the universal , historical definition of marriage to appease 2 percent of our population …
This is not a political issue — it is a moral issue that God has spoken clearly about . ”
He ’s declared that those who do not believe in God should not be allowed to hold public office .
“ Tone , ” my well - toned ass .
At the risk of reopening some delicate old rhetorical wounds , the difference between Warren and James Dobson / Jerry Falwell / Pat Robertson is lipstick .
Oh , and he also believes that God wants us to whack Ahmadinejad .
Good thing for him that Warren is a moderate , huh ?
Just imagine what a real conservative Christian would want to do to him .
So , what is Obama thinking here ?
Possibilities include :
1 : The Uber - Unity Angle : I know Obama is hell - bent on being a man for ALL the people , ALL the time , regardless of whatever sorts of barking loonery they profess great faith in , and I ’m sure this is part - and - parcel of his realpolitik theory about getting us past our partisan divisions .
I ’ve written before about the ways in which our power - elites have played us against each other , and I ’m not a fan of artificial divisions .
But at the same time , I do n’t think we want everybody on the team – not unless they join on the right terms .
There are people in America who do n’t need to be courted or united , they need to be changed , and until this happens you ’re inviting disaster .
2 : The Strictly Personal Angle : Maybe Pastor Dan is right – maybe Barack just likes the guy .
I do n’t know that this makes me feel a whole lot better , but by the same token , no politician ever got elected by pandering to the likes of me .
3 : The Use ‘ Em and Lose ‘ Em Angle : Perhaps Obama is just about tossing the fundagelicals a bone to make them feel like he ’s representing them , too .
If so , Warren doing an invocation is something I can live with as long as that ’s all he ’s doing .
I wo n’t like it ( listen , I ’ve read the Constitution and Jefferson ’s letter to the Danbury Baptists , so to my understanding the word “ God ” should never occur in any remotely official legal context ) but if this is the extent of Warren ’s involvement in the next four to eight years of my life I suppose I ’ll hold my nose and deal with it .
But if this well - heeled neo-Puritan becomes an intimate consultant and policy driver I might not be quite as forgiving .
Nor should you .
Whether it ’s 1 , 2 , 3 , all of the above or none , this is a bad move by Obama .
You do n’t effectively promote unity and progress by handing the show over to a guy who has offended every American with a working brain .
So – off to a bad start .
Maybe the change we can believe in comes later on the card .
Now , if you ’ll excuse me , I have an inauguration to plan for and I can’t find my Ouija board or my official Increase Mather prayer book anywhere ….

Finally , Bill Clinton is sticking his neck out for something he truly believes in , and asking Californians to voted NO on prop 8 ( the proposition that would stop gays from marrying each other ) .
I 've never really been that riled up about the social issues of politics , as I 've always believed economic issues were the most important .
It 's probably a result of not having lived through discrimination myself , but being acutely aware of the economic disparity in every day life .
However , I now live in West Hollywood ( where most of the Los Angeles gay community lives ) and have gotten to know a lot more gay people .
I feel I can better understand where they are coming from now , and sympathize immensely with the horrible discrimination this proposition represents .

Homosexuality is not a choice .
There is ample scientific evidence that it is genetically pre-determined , and on that basis alone , it is clearly morally wrong to discriminate against them .
And even if homosexuals ' decide ' to be gay , so what ?
If a relationship blossoms between two consenting adults , then why should anyone have a problem with it ?
It is literally like going to restaurant and eating a cake , then complaining that someone across the room is eating a cake too and ruining your experience .
It is completely nonsensical .

The argument that there is some religious basis for discrimination against homosexuals is also bogus .
Anyone who has read ' Leviticus ' will note the many sins God listed , most of them so ridiculous it is funny anyone bothers to mention it as an argument .
Here 's a great one :
Leviticus
25:44-45
Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations
around you ;
from them you may buy slaves .
You may also buy some of the temporary
residents living among you and members of their clans born in your
country , and they will become your property .
Why do Christian fundamentalists not insist on having slaves ?
Because it is clearly absurd .
Yet the clause about homosexuality is taken as a core belief , revealing more about personal prejudice than moral purity .
Anyway , if you live in California , go out and vote against proposition 8 .
It 's not right , and it needs to be voted down definitively .
But let ’s give it a second thought .
Consider for a moment the complexity of a mere snippet of what you might have seen on the tube that Sunday afternoon :
In the seconds between the return from the two - minute - warning commercial break and the snap of the ball to Giants quarterback Eli Manning , as play - by - play man Greg Gumbel quickly oriented the audience —
It has been a dandy here at Giants Stadium .
Two minutes to play .
Bengals by four .
Giants at the six - yard line .
Second and goal .
The Giants have one time - out remaining — the following scene - setting images flashed past in rapid succession :
* A high , wide shot of the stadium and the walls of cheering fans ;
* Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer watching anxiously from the sidelines ;
* Bengals coach Marvin Lewis looking perplexed on the sidelines ;
* Giants coach Tom Coughlin , head down , talking intently into his headset microphone ;
* On the field , a close - up of Bengals middle linebacker Dhani Jones pointing urgently to his teammates and shouting , positioning them for the snap ;
* Manning shouting and gesturing behind center ;
* Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress lined up in the slot , poised , looking back toward Manning ; and
* A wide shot showing the complete line of scrimmage as the ball is snapped and the play begins .
Roll back to the beginning of this brief sequence , and here is how it sounded inside the windowless production trailer parked outside the stadium , where two rows of technicians sat beneath the glow of 100 TV monitors , 20 screens across stacked five deep .
Staring at this wall were three men : producer Mark Wolff on the left ; technical director Dennis Stone on the right ; and between them the show ’s impresario , its director , Bob Fishman , known as “ Fish . ”
Just before coming back on air from the commercial , the crew counted down in unison :
“ Five ! ”
“ Four ! ”
“ Three ! ”
Wolff shouted , “ Fish is going to cut some shots ! ”
“ Two ! ”
“ One ! ”
“ Aaaand go ! ” shouted Fish , a wiry man in faded blue jeans and a loose - fitting , long - sleeved cotton shirt , a headset clamped over a baseball cap .
He was leaning up and out of his swivel chair , choosing shots and barking orders , arms elevated , snapping his long fingers loudly with each new command .
“ Go fan shot !
Ready four .
Take four !
Ready eight .
Take eight !
Ready one .
Take one !
Ready 12 .
Take 12 !
Ready five .
Take five !
Ready thre — ready two .
Take two !
Ready three .
Take three ! ”
Camera three , which Fish returned to just before the snap of the ball , offers a wide angle from above that ’s used to frame the play .
In this case , with one eye on the play clock , Fish snuck in one last scene - setting image — Burress lined up and looking back toward his quarterback — before returning to the wide angle as the ball was snapped .
This was just 30 seconds .
The entire broadcast would last more than three and a half hours .
If the production crew of a televised football game is like a symphony orchestra , Bob Fishman is its conductor .
He sits front and center in the dark trailer , insulated from the sunshine and the roar of the crowd , taking the fragments of sounds and moving images and assembling the broadcast on the fly , mediating the real event into the digital one .
He scans the dizzying bank of screens to select the next shot , and the next , and the next , layering in replays , graphics , and sound , barking his orders via headset to his crew , plugging into a rhythm that echoes the pulse of the game .
The tequila diamonds could be used to " detect radiation , coat cutting tools or , above all , as a substitute for silicon in the computer chips of the future , " Miguel Apatiga , one of three researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico who made the discovery said .
CHICAGO , Dec. 23 ( UPI ) --
In everyday social exchanges , being mean to people has a lot more impact than being nice , University of Chicago researchers suggest .
Lead author Boaz Keysar said feeling slighted can have a bigger difference on how a person responds than being the recipient of perceived generosity -- even if the net value of the social transaction is the same .
Advertisement
" Negative reciprocity -- or taking -- escalates , " Keysar said in a statement .
The study was based on giving - and - taking games conducted on students and people in downtown Chicago .
The games provided data on how people respond to give - and - take social exchanges .
" For instance in driving , if you are kind and let someone go in front of you , that driver may be considerate in response , " Keysar said .
" But if you cut someone off , that person may react very aggressively , and this could escalate to road rage . "
The situation can escalate when the person doing the slighting does n't appreciate how strongly the slight is being experienced , Keysar said .
" The one receiving the slight cannot imagine that the slighter lacks that appreciation , " he said .
" And so it goes , because of such differential perception , they respond more and more strongly .
Small slights could escalate to unbelievable , irrational feuds . "
The findings are published in the journal Psychological Science .
Pretty cool even though it broke .
I 'm sure he later whipped out his tools and fixed it up soon enough .
Not sure if this device makes efficient and optimum use of the pot / hash / whatnot though .
It ’s not often that we ( as programmers ) need random numbers , especially from a database .
When you are testing your queries for performance , it ’s best to use a large table to do it .
Sometimes you just do n’t have access to a large table to test with , so you may think about creating many rows in your existing table .
SQL Server has a rand ( ) function that will return a random ( fractional ) number between 0 and 1 .
For example :
Select Rand( ) -- 0.686350654426017
The problem with the rand function occurs when you use set based operations .
Select Rand ( ) As RandomNumber From ( Select 1 As NUM Union All Select 2 Union All Select 3 ) As Alias
RandomNumber
----------------------
0.920057583532051 0.920057583532051 0.920057583532051
Not very random , is it ?
I mean , the number is random , but it ’s also the same for each row .
The purpose of this blog is to demonstrate how to get a random value in set based operations .
There is an interesting technique that you can use to accomplish this .
There is a NewId ( ) function in SQL Server that returns a GUID , for example : ‘94344EE4-5D7A-45EB-9EBC-7A596B7F90F3 ’.
New
Id does work well for set based operations , for example :
Select Rand ( ) As RandomNumber , NewId ( ) As GUID From ( Select 1 As NUM Union All Select 2 Union All Select 3 ) As Alias
RandomNumber GUID
---------------------- ------------------------------------
0.130542187318667 D12D6274-CB93-4CDB-B848-9F0FA8B88614 0.130542187318667 C708217F-5204-4284-B76B-A55D87BEFBC0 0.130542187318667 B42D7973-B3E2-420F-8D4D-DC72442D0824
Notice that the ‘ Random Number ’ column is the same for each row , but the GUID column is different .
We can use this interesting fact to generate random numbers by combining this with another function available in SQL Server .
The CHECKSUM function will return an integer hash value based on its argument .
In this case , we can pass in a GUID , and checksum will return an integer .
Select Rand ( ) As RandomNumber , NewId ( ) As GUID , Checksum ( NewId ( ) )
As RandomInteger From ( Select 1 As NUM Union All Select 2 Union All Select 3 ) As Alias
RandomNumber GUID RandomInteger
---------------------- ------------------------------------ --------------
0.152440960483059 CDEB9F5D-E8A2-4FC7-A5A4-0E0A9CCF9786
84,364,212 0.152440960483059 9ABCEC8F-6C0C-4CEF-BA16-E8F0B50FB399
-1,317,220,961 0.152440960483059 6BD23217-F3FF-4F19-AA7F-C127CA7A4763 976,389,102
Before we continue , let ’s take a look at the output , because there are some interesting observations that we need to consider before continuing .
RandomInteger can be positive or negative because it ’s limited to the range of an integer , so the values must fall between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 .
Most of the time , we want a random number within a certain range of numbers .
In most languages , we simply multiply the result of the Rand ( ) function to get this number .
Since our RandomInteger is already a whole number , we really ca n’t do this .
However , we could use the mod operator to guarantee a range of numbers .
Mod is the remainder of a division operation , so if we mod a number by 10 , we are guaranteed to get a number between - 9 and +9 .
Unfortunately , this is a little misleading because there are 19 possible numbers we can get for this .
So , to make sure we get a range to 10 numbers , we need to take the absolute value of the number , and then mod 10 .
Like this :
Select Rand ( ) As RandomNumber , NewId ( ) As GUID , Abs( Checksum ( NewId ( ) ) ) % 10 As RandomInteger From ( Select 1 As NUM Union All Select 2 Union All Select 3 ) As Alias
RandomNumber GUID RandomInteger
---------------------- ------------------------------------ -------------
0.490769895131745 8237A3F3-98C6-4B31-8F4B-8A80ECC8FBFF 1 0.490769895131745 C231EB65-FA81-4536-B909-44FEC91953D9 9 0.490769895131745 F0AD28C5-8AE4-46A1-B8 AC-D8C9F90A5747 4
Now , we are guaranteed to get a Random number between 0 and 9 .
Suppose you want to get a random number between 10 and 15 .
The range of numbers is 6 ( 10,11,12,13,14,15 ) .
The mod value for this needs to be 6 , to get a number in the range of 0 to 5 .
Then , we add 10 to the result to get a number in the range of 10 to 15 .
If you want to generate a random number between - 5 and 5 , do n’t be tempted to remove the absolute value function , because you will get numbers that appears to be random , but are not ‘ as random ’ as they should be .
In my database , I have a numbers table with 1,000,000 rows .
When I run this code :
Select RandomNumber , Count (*) As NumberCount From ( Select Checksum( NewId ( ) ) % 6 As RandomNumber From Numbers ) As A Group By RandomNumber Order By RandomNumber

Notice that 0 has double the number of occurrences .
Instead , we should write it like this :
Select RandomNumber , Count (*) As NumberCount From ( Select Abs( Checksum( NewId ( ) ) ) % 11 - 5 As RandomNumber From Numbers ) As A Group By RandomNumber Order By RandomNumber

Notice now that the values are ‘ more ’ random than the previous version ( where 0 had double the number of occurrences ) .
Since we are talking about random numbers , we would n’t expect there to be the same number of occurrences for each number , but with the previous version , there were double the number of zero ’s , which is n’t truly random .
This version has approximately the same number of zero ’s as any other number , making it ‘ more random ’ .

Excitement has recently been rising about the possibility of using thorium as a low - carbon way of generating vast amounts of electricity .
The use of thorium as a nuclear fuel was extensively studied by Oak Ridge National Laboratory between 1950 and 1976 , but was dropped , because unlike uranium - fueled Light Water Reactors ( LWRs ) , it could not generate weapons ' grade plutonium .
Research on the possible use of thorium as a nuclear fuel has continued around the world since then .
Famed Climate Scientist James Hanson , recently spoke of thorium 's great promise in material that he submitted to President Elect Obama :
This is a guest post by Charles Barton .
Charles is a retired counselor who writes the Energy from Thorium blog .
His father Dr. Charles Barton , Senior , worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for 28 years .
He was a reactor chemist , who worked on the Liquid - Fluoride Thorium Reactor ( LFTR ) concept for about 2/3 of his ORNL career .
Charles Barton , Junior gained his knowledge of the LFTR concept from his familiarity with his father 's work .
Neither his father nor Mr. Barton will gain financially from the advancement of this idea .
The Liquid - Fluoride Thorium Reactor ( LFTR ) is a thorium reactor concept that uses a chemically - stable fluoride salt for the medium in which nuclear reactions take place .
This fuel form yields flexibility of operation and eliminates the need to fabricate fuel elements .
This feature solves most concerns that have prevented thorium from being used in solid - fueled reactors .
The fluid fuel in LFTR is also easy to process and to separate useful fission products , both stable and radioactive .
LFTR also has the potential to destroy existing nuclear waste .
( The ) LFTR (s ) operate at low pressure and high temperatures , unlike today ’s LWRs .
Operation at low pressures alleviates much of the accident risk with LWR .
Higher temperatures enable more of the reactor heat to be converted to electricity ( 50 % in LFTR vs 35 % in LWR ) .
( The ) LFTR ( has ) the potential to be air - cooled and to use waste heat for desalinating water .
LFTR(s ) are 100-300 times more fuel efficient than LWRs .
In addition to solving the nuclear waste problem , they can operate for several centuries using only uranium and thorium that has already been mined .
Thus they eliminate the criticism that mining for nuclear fuel will use fossil fuels and add to the greenhouse effect .
The Obama campaign , properly in my opinion , opposed the Yucca Mountain nuclear repository .
Indeed , there is a far more effective way to use the $ 25 billion collected from utilities over the past 40 years to deal with waste disposal .
This fund should be used to develop fast reactors that consume nuclear waste , and thorium reactors to prevent the creation of new long - lived nuclear waste .
By law the federal government must take responsibility for existing spent nuclear fuel , so inaction is not an option .
Accelerated development of fast and thorium reactors will allow the US to fulfill its obligations to dispose of the nuclear waste , and open up a source of carbon - free energy that can last centuries , even millennia .
It is commonly assumed that 4th generation nuclear power will not be ready before 2030 .
That is a safe assumption under " business - as- usual ” .
However , given high priority it is likely that it could be available sooner .
It is specious to argue that R&D on 4th generation nuclear power does not deserve support because energy efficiency and renewable energies may be able to satisfy all United States electrical energy needs .
Who stands ready to ensure that energy needs of China and India will be entirely met by efficiency and renewables ?
_________
Development of the first large 4 generation nuclear plants may proceed most rapidly if carried out in China or India ( or South Korea , which has a significant R&D program ) , with the full technical cooperation of the United States and / or Europe .
Such cooperation would make it much easier to achieve agreements for reducing greenhouse gases .
Uranium - 235 is the only fissionable material that is observed in usable amounts in nature .
Thus pioneering nuclear physicist like Enrico Fermi and Eugene Wigner had no other choice of but to use U - 235 to create their first chain reaction under the bleachers of the University of Chicago ’s unused football field .
But Fermi and Wigner knew early on that once a reactor was built , it was possible to create other fissionable substances with the excess neutrons produced by a U - 235 chain reaction .
Thus if U - 238 absorbed a neutron , it became the unstable U - 239 , which through a two stage nuclear process was transformed into plutonium - 239 .
Plutonium - 239 is very fissionable .
The physicists also calculated that if thorium - 232 was placed inside a reactor and bombarded with neutrons , it would be transformed into U - 233 .
Their calculations also revealed that U - 233 was not only fissionable , but had properties that made it in some respects a superior reactor fuel to U - 235 and Pu-239 .
During World War II , Fermi and Wigner , who were geniuses with active and far ranging minds , collected around themselves a group of brilliant scientists .
Fermi , Wigner and their associates began to think about the potential uses of the new energy they were discovering -- uses that would improve society rather than destroy it .
The capture of nuclear energy and its transformation into electrical energy became a central focus of discussions among early atomic scientists .
They were not sure how long the uranium supply would last , so Fermi proposed that reactors be built that would breed plutonium from U - 238 .
Wigner counted that thorium was several times as plentiful as uranium , and that it could produce an even better nuclear fuel than Pu-239 .
The first nuclear era was dominated by uranium technology , a technology that was derived from military applications , and carried with it , rightly or wrongly , the taint of association with nuclear weapons .
As it turned out , there was far more uranium available than Fermi or Wigner had originally feared , but other rationales propelled scientific interest in developing thorium fuel cycle reactors .
First , Pu-239 was not a good fuel for most reactors .
It failed to fission 1/3 of the time when it absorbed a neutron in a conventional Light Water Reactor ( LWR ) .
This led to the most difficult part of the problem of nuclear waste .
Plutonium made excellent fuel for fast neutron reactors , but the fast neutron reactor that Fermi liked used dangerous liquid sodium as its coolant , and would pose a developmental challenge of enormous proportions .
Advocates of the thorium fuel cycle point to its numerous advantages over the uranium - plutonium fuel cycle .
B.D. Kuz’minov , and V.N. Manokhin , of the Russian Federation State Science Centre , Institute of Physics and Power Engineering at Obninsk , write :
Adoption of the thorium fuel cycle would offer the following advantages : - Increased nuclear fuel resources thanks to the production of 233U from 232Th ; - Significant reduction in demand for the enriched isotope 235U ; - Very low ( compared with the uranium - plutonium fuel cycle ) production of long - lived radiotoxic wastes , including transuraniums , plutonium and transplutoniums ; - Possibility of accelerating the burnup of plutonium without the need for recycling , i.e. rapid reduction of existing plutonium stocks ; - Higher fuel burnup than in the uranium - plutonium cycle ; - Low excess reactivity of the core with thorium - based fuel , and more favourable temperature and void reactivity coefficients ; . . .
Thorium could replace U - 238 in conventional LWRs , and could be used to breed new nuclear fuel in specially modified LWRs .
This technology was successfully tested in the Shippingport reactor during the late 1970 ’s and early 1980’s .
WASH - 1097 remains a good source of information on the thorium fuel cycle .
In fact , some major recent studies of the thorium fuel cycle rely heavily on WASH - 1097 .
A recent IAEA report on Thorium appears to have been prepared without overt reliance on WASH - 1097 .
One of the first things physicists discovered about chain reactions was that slowing the neutrons involved in the process down , promoted the chain reaction .
Kirk Sorensen discusses slow or thermal neutrons in one of his early posts .
Under low energy neutron conditions , Th232 can be efficiently converted to U233 .
The conversion process works like this .
Th232 absorbs a neutron and emits a beta ray .
A neutron switches to being a proton and the atom is transformed into Protactinium 233 .
After a period averaging a little less than a month , Pa 233 emits a second beta ray and is transformed into U233 .
U233 is fissionable , and is a very good reactor fuel .
When a U233 atom encounters a low energy neutron , chances are 9 out of 10 that it will fission .
Since U233 produces an average of 2.4 neutrons every time it fissions , this means that each neutron that strikes U233 produces an average of 2.16 new neutrons .
If you carefully control those neutrons , one neutron will continue the chain reaction .
That leaves an average of 1.16 neutrons to generate new fuel .
Unfortunately the fuel generation process cannot work with 100 % efficiency .
The leftover U - 234 that was produced when U - 233 absorbed a neutron and did not fission will sometimes absorb another neutron and become U - 235 .
Xenon -135 , an isotope that that is often produced after U - 233 splits , is far more likely to capture neutrons than U233 or Th232 .
This makes Xenon - 135 a fission poison .
Because Xenon in a reactor builds up during a chain reaction , it tends to slow the nuclear process as the chain reaction continues .
The presence of Xenon creates a control problem inside a reactor .
Xenon also steals neutrons needed for the generation of new fuel .
In conventional reactors that use solid fuel , Xenon is trapped inside the fuel , but in a fluid fuel Xenon is easy to remove because it is what is called a noble gas .
A noble gas does not bond chemically with other substances , and can be bubbled out of fluids where it has been trapped .
Getting Xenon 135 out of a reactor core makes generating new U233 from Th232 a whole lot easier .
It is possible to bring about 1.08 neutrons into the thorium change process for every U - 233 atom that splits .
This means that reactors that use a thorium fuel cycle are not going to produce an excess of U - 233 , but if carefully designed , they can produce enough U233 that burnt U233 can be easily replaced .
Thus a well designed thorium cycle reactor will generate its own fuel indefinitely .
Research continues on a thorium cycle LWR fuel that would allow for the breeding of thorium in LWRs .
There is however a problem which makes the LWR a less than ideal breeding environment for thorium .
Elisabeth Huffer , Hervé Nifenecker , and Sylvain David note :
Fission products are much more efficient in poisoning slow neutron reactors than fast neutron reactors .
Thus , to maintain a low doubling time , neutron capture in the fission products and other elements of the structure and coolant have to be minimized .
India has only a small uranium supply , but an enormous thorium reserve .
Millions of tons of thorium ore lie on the surface of Indian beaches , waiting to be scooped up by front loaders and hauled away to potential thorium reactors for a song .
( For those of you who are interested in the EROEI concept , the EROEI for the recovery of thorium from Indian beaches would be almost unbelievably high , and the energy extracted could power the Indian economy for thousands of years , potentially making India the richest nation in the world . )
India has for 50 years been following a plan to gradually switch from uranium to thorium cycle reactors .
That plan is expected to finally come to fruition by the end of the next decade .
At that point India will begin the rapid construction of a fleet of thorium fuel cycle reactors .
A commercial business , Thorium Power , Limited , continues research based on the Shippingport Reactor experiment .
Thorium Power plans to offer a thorium cycle based nuclear fuel with a starting charge of enriched U - 235 for modified LWRs .
Thorium Power has sponsored Throium fuel research at the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow , and a Russian VVER has been used to conduct thorium cycle fuel experiments .
Research on thorium cycle liquid fuel reactors is ongoing world - wide .
The best - known effort is being performed in Grenoble , France at the Laboratoire de Physique Subatomique et de Cosmologie .
The Reactor Physics Group there is the only one in the world that has the resources and backing needed to actually develop a fluid core thorium cycle reactor that can be commercialized .
In terms of organization size , the Thorium Molten Salt Reactor research group is much smaller than would be required to sustain a full - scale rapid development of thorium cycle reactor technology .
The LPSC group thus is working in a business as usual time frame , and has no urgent motivation to do otherwise .
After all , 80 % of French electricity already comes from nuclear power plants .
Thorium fuel cycle research is also being carried on in the Netherlands , Japan , the Czech Republic .
There is also presently a small - scale effort in the United States .
Thorium is extremely abundant in the earth 's crust , which appears to contain somewhere around 120 trillion tons of it .
In addition to 12 % thorium monazite sands , found on Indian beaches and in other places , economically recoverable thorium is found virtually everywhere .
For example , large - scale recovery of thorium from granite rocks is economically feasible with a very favorable EROEI .
Significant recoverable amounts of thorium are present in mine tailings .
These include the tailings of ancient tin mines , rare earth mine tailings , phosphate mine tailings and uranium mine tailings .
In addition to the thorium present in mine tailings and in surface monazite sands , burning coal at the average 1000 MWe power plant produces about 13 tons of thorium per year .
That thorium is recoverable from the power plant ’s waste ash pile .
One ton of thorium will produce nearly 1 GW of electricity for a year in an efficient thorium cycle reactor .
Thus current coal energy technology throws away over 10 times the energy it produces as electricity .
This is not the result of poor thermodynamic efficiency ; it is the result of a failure to recognize and use the energy value of thorium .
The amount of thorium present in surface mining coal waste is enormous and would provide all the power human society needs for thousands of years , without resorting to any special mining for thorium , or the use of any other form or energy recovery .
Little attention is paid to the presence of thorium in mine tailings .
In fact it would largely be passed over in silence except that radioactive gases from thorium are a health hazard for miners and ore processing workers .
Thorium is present in phosphate fertilizers because fertilizer manufactures do not wish to pay the recovery price prior to distribution .
Gypsum present in phosphate tailings is unusable in construction because of the presence of radioactive gasses associated with the thorium that is also present in the gypsum .
Finally organic farmers use phosphate tailings to enrich their soil .
This has the unfortunate side effect of releasing thorium into surface and subsurface waters , as well as leading to the potential contamination of organic crops with thorium and its various radioactive daughter products .
Thus the waste of thorium present in phosphate tailings has environmental consequences .
The world ’s real thorium reserve is enormous , but also hugely underestimated .
For example the USGS reports that the United States has a thorium reserve of 160,000 tons , with another 300,000 tons of possible thorium reserve .
But Alex Gabbard estimates a reserve of over 300,000 tons of recoverable thorium in coal ash associated with power production in the United States alone .
In 1969 , WASH - 1097 noted a report that had presented to President Johnson that estimated the United States thorium reserve at 3 billion tons that could be recovered for the price of $ 500 a pound – perhaps $ 3000 today .
Lest this sound like an enormous amount of money to pay for thorium , consider that one pound of thorium contains the energy equivalent of 20 tons of coal , which would sell on the spot market for in mid-January for around $ 1500 .
The price of coal has been somewhat depressed by the economic down turn .
Last year coal sold on the spot market for as much as $ 300 a ton , yielding a price for 20 tons of coal of $ 6000 .
How long would 3 billion tons last the United States ?
If all of the energy used in the United States were derived from thorium for the next two million years , there would be still several hundred thousand years of thorium left that could be recovered for the equivalent of $ 3000 a pound in January 2009 dollars .
Nor would exhausting the USAEC ’s 1969 estimated thorium reserve exhaust the American thorium supply .
Even at average concentrations in the earth ’s rocks , thorium can be recovered with a good EROEI , without making the cost of electricity impossibly expensive .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
Clashes between Hamas militants and Israeli soldiers raged to the north and east of densely populated Gaza City early Sunday , the 16th day of an Israeli offensive , witnesses and medical sources said .
A photo provided by the Israel Defense Forces shows troops in Gaza on Saturday .

Heavy gunfire could be heard to the east of Gaza City -- home to about 400,000 of Gaza 's 1.5 million people -- as fighting moved closer , according to a CNN stringer in the area .
Israeli shelling north of the city killed two people , sources at Shifa hospital told CNN .
Sunday 's fighting came after one girl was killed and 49 other people were severely burned by fires caused by Israeli shelling in southern Gaza on Saturday , local hospital sources said .
The shelling ignited several buildings , including a U.N. school , near the city of Khan Younes , sources said .
The girl died of burns she suffered in one of the fires , the sources said .
Also Saturday , a family of nine was killed when a shell hit their home in the village of Jebalya in northern Gaza , Palestinian medical sources said .
The Israeli military was " not operating in the area of this house , and no fire was directed in that direction , " a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said .
Later Saturday , the IDF said that two rocket - launching squads near Jebalya were hit .
Meanwhile , Hamas militants fired 20 Grad long - range rockets into Israel on Saturday , injuring four civilians , according to an IDF spokesman .
And the Hamas commander in charge of launching rockets into Israel from the Gaza City area was killed Saturday by Israeli ground fire , the IDF said .
Amir Mansi was spotted firing a rocket Saturday from the Jabel Rise area , east of Gaza City , during a ground force operation , the IDF said .
Israeli forces opened fire , killing Mansi and wounding two other Hamas operatives , who were captured , the Israelis said .
Watch what overnight air attacks did »
Mansi was the leading Hamas authority on the Grad long - range missile - launching system , the IDF said .
Grad rockets have allowed Hamas to reach farther into Israel than in previous attacks .
Israelis say their Gaza military operation , which started December 27 , is aimed at stopping Hamas militants from sending rockets into southern Israel .
The operation began with airstrikes ; a week later , the Israeli military launched a ground assault .
More than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the attacks , including 235 children , and about 3,300 people have been wounded , according to Palestinian medical sources .
Thirteen Israelis , including 10 soldiers , have died since the operation began .

On Saturday evening , two pair of Israeli F - 16 fighter jets that were on bombing runs in southern Gaza violated Egyptian airspace , a CNN team observed .
" We can tell they 're coming through Egyptian airspace because they 're over the far side of the building where we 're standing , " CNN 's Karl Penhaul reported from Rafah , Egypt .
He was atop a building about 500 meters ( 547 yards ) from the Gaza border .
The Israelis have been bombing tunnels that run under the border of southern Gaza and Egypt.
Israel says Hamas smuggles weapons and munitions through them into Gaza .
A spokesman for the Egyptian prime minister 's office said the Israeli aircraft did not have permission to use the airspace .
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said no airspace violation had occurred .
Before strafing the area in and around Rafah , the Israeli air force dropped leaflets warning residents to leave their homes because more Israeli attacks were imminent , Palestinian security sources said .
According to an IDF spokesman , the leaflets say : " Two days ago , the IDF distributed leaflets in Rafah in which the residents were warned to evacuate their homes for their own safety .
As they heeded the IDF instructions , the harming of residents in combat was avoided .
" Over the coming period , the IDF will continue to target tunnels , weapon caches and terrorist operatives with growing intensity .
For your safety and that of your family , stay away from terrorist elements or places where weapons are stored or places where terrorist elements operate . "
In Gaza City on Saturday afternoon , heavy black smoke rose during a three - hour period during which Israel was to halt its attacks on militants so Palestinians could stock up on supplies .
CNN 's Ben Wedeman said the lulls , which have been tried before , are n't " rock solid . "
Limited military activity continues during that period , he said .
A United Nations spokesman said Saturday 's pause was not long enough to resume the transport of humanitarian supplies from Israel into Gaza .

Meanwhile , in Cairo , Egypt , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to discuss a possible cease - fire .
Exiled Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal said during a televised news conference Saturday night that his followers will consider any proposals to stop the violence if conditions are met : the Israelis stop their " aggression " and all crossings between Israel and Gaza are opened .
" These are our just demands , and with an open mind we will interact with any initiative , " Mashaal said .

Senator Joe Lieberman ( ID - CT ) today issued the following statement on the election of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States : " I sincerely congratulate President - elect Obama for his historic and impressive victory .
America remains a nation of extraordinary opportunity and the American people are a people of extraordinary fairness .
Now that the election is over , it is time to put partisan considerations aside and come together as a nation to solve the difficult challenges we face and make our blessed land stronger and safer .
I pledge to work with President - elect Obama and his incoming Administration in their efforts to reinvigorate our economy and keep our nation secure and free . "
While I 'm trying to get into the spirit of Obama 's hope for a post - partisan presidency , can I be allowed this one small , deeply partisan moment and demand the Senate leadership kick this sorry ass out of the Democratic caucus once and for all ?
Lieberman is supposed to meet with Harry Reid later this week .
Once upon a time , Reid was insisting that Lieberman was " with us on everything but the war . "
Of course , that was before he said he feared " America will not survive " if Democrats won 60 seats and before he said Obama " has not always put America first " and said he was " not ready to lead . "
Lieberman may once have been " an important vote for our caucus , " as Reid said in defending Holy Joe this summer .
But he 's irrelevant now , and deserves the fate he has earned .
Christine Maggiore , a Van Nuys woman who garnered national attention as an outspoken skeptic of the human immunodeficiency virus , or HIV , has died , according to the L.A. County coroner 's office .
Maggiore , 52 , was founder of Alive & Well AIDS Alternatives , a nonprofit that challenges " common assumptions " about AIDS .
Her group 's website and toll - free hotline cater to expectant HIV - positive mothers who shun AIDS medications , want to breast - feed their babies and seek to meet others of like mind .
She also had written a book on the subject , titled " What if Everything You Thought You Knew About AIDS Was Wrong ? "
In 2006 , the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office decided not to file criminal charges against Maggiore , whose daughter died the year before in what the county coroner ruled was AIDS - related pneumonia .
What chutzpah :
Think you could borrow money from a bank without saying what you were going to do with it ?
Well , apparently when banks borrow from you they do n't feel the same need to say how the money is spent .
After receiving billions in aid from U.S. taxpayers , the nation 's largest banks say they can't track exactly how they 're spending it .
Some wo n't even talk about it .
" We 're choosing not to disclose that , " said Kevin Heine , spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon , which received about $ 3 billion .
Thomas Kelly , a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase , which received $ 25 billion in emergency bailout money , said that while some of the money was lent , some was not , and the bank has not given any accounting of exactly how the money is being used .
" We have not disclosed that to the public .
We 're declining to , " Kelly said .
The Associated Press contacted 21 banks that received at least $ 1 billion in government money and asked four questions :
How much has been spent ?
What was it spent on ?
How much is being held in savings , and what 's the plan for the rest ?
None of the banks provided specific answers .
* *Hollywood action director Michael Bay enlisted the U.S. military to provide realistic props for his 2007 giant - robot epic Transformers .
After the Pentagon helped rewrite the script , Bay got access to helicopters , warships and – for just $ 25,000 an hour – F - 22 stealth fighters .
As we speak , Bay is shooting a sequel that has even more U.S. military hardware on display , according to USA Today .
The director set up shop at White Sands , a test range in New Mexico , standing in for Egypt , where the new movie 's climactic battle takes place .
" As far as I know , this is the biggest joint military operation movie ever made , " said Bay 's liaison officer from the Army .
The list of military assets for the White Sands shoot included :
two A - 10 Thunderbolt II " Warthog " tank - killing jets ; six F - 16 Fighting Falcons ; 10 armored Humvees ; the Army 's Golden Knights parachute team ; two Abrams tanks ; two Bradley tanks ; two missile - launcher vehicles ; two armored personnel carriers ; and a quarter - mile of the missile testing range , cleared of unexploded ordnance ...
Plus , an F - 22 , apparently from the new Raptor base at nearby Holloman , buzzed overhead , playing the role of Transformers bad guy Starscream .
" So many people are firing so many guns that civilian crew workers go through between shots , gathering up buckets full of empty brass shell casings , " the newspaper reported .
One new villain for Transformers 2 is Long Haul , the robot version of a 700 - ton Caterpillar dump truck that is one of the biggest land vehicles in the world .

In an earlier opinion piece , I discussed how impact factor , scientific quality , and writing ability came together in a cycle that did not necessarily select for the best science .
In this piece , we 'll look at how some commercial publishing houses ( Elsevier , in this particular case ) are bringing disrepute to the scientific enterprise .
The practice of subscription bundling is used to make it more economic to buy access to all of a publisher 's journals than it is to buy a substantial subset .
We 'll look at how bunding combines with the publication of pseudoscientific journals and having pseudoscientists edit respectable journals to create a situation where junk science shows up in real research institutes .
That , in turn has an impact on the credibility of science , as well as its cost of science .
The example at hand , Elsevier publishes some 930 odd journals — most of them are low impact so , if you had any results worth a damn , you would probably publish them elsewhere .
Elsevier could charge a premium for journals with very high quality science in them , but that does n't appear to be what Elsevier does .
Its charges are such that , in at least one case , Elsevier journals constitute two percent of a library 's subscription catalog , but 20 percent of its subscription fees .
This policy is designed to encourage bundling .
Bundling is Elsevier 's practice of offering steep per-journal subscription discounts if you take the lot .
The numbers quoted above are from Cornell 's bundled subscription deal , so one can only imagine what the per-journal subscription fees must be .
Now , bundling would n't be so bad if Elsevier were flexible about it .
But they do n't seem to be .
Do n't have a Mathematics department ?
Tough , you get Applied Numerical Mathematics or you pay per-journal .
This practice is not just designed to increase Elsevier 's bottom line , it is also designed to make Elsevier appear larger than it actually is .
That is because Elsevier publishes many specialized journals that very few people actually want .
These journals are nearly worthless to Elsevier in every respect except two .
They enable Elsevier to say that it has the largest single library of peer reviewed journals , and it can advertise about how all these libraries subscribe to their journals — the Journal of Podunk Economics must be important if Harvard takes it .
This practice suggests to me that Elsevier primarily regards science as a vehicle for making money , with quality a distant second concern .
For those of you thinking that this is a " well , duh " moment , Nature publishing group places a much higher value on quality and still maintains profitability , so the two are not incompatible .
Furthermore , Nature has taken the opposite tack by creating the impression that publishing in its journals are the height of scientific achievement .
Elsevier 's practice of expensive bundled subscription policies actually has serious consequences for the amount of research performed at universities .
The money to pay for subscriptions typically comes from the agencies that provide research grant money .
When calculating the budget for a research grant , researchers must include overhead costs , which are used to pay for things like janitorial services , computer network infrastructure , and journal subscriptions .
Now , contrary to what many people think , scientists are usually very cost conscious : we want to give and get value for money .
We accept that instruments may be very expensive because of the limited market .
We accept that graduate students and post - docs must be paid .
Experimental work , even if it does n't directly use such services , should contribute to the maintenance of a mechanical workshop .
Every dollar that goes into these overhead costs is a dollar that does n't go into science .
In general , university overheads are high , and the library constitutes a significant proportion of that cost .
Elsevier has , in effect , an umbilical cord attached to just about every granting agency on Earth .
Forcing Elsevier to change its prices will not remove the umbilical cord , but could see the umbilical cord reduced in diameter .
The argument that Elsevier would make is that it publishes valuable specialist journals , where the small number of subscriptions warrant high prices .
Several factors appear to undercut this claim .
Electronic distribution , which is now the main delivery vehicle for science journals , means the subscriber number is far less relevant .
In fact , fewer subscribers means fewer downloads , which means reduced hosting costs for those journals — especially when you consider that there 's a single database and front end common to all Elsevier journals .
They also use the same format for nearly all their journals , meaning that type setting costs are widely distributed .
In fact the only place where they can claim increased cost is editorial staff .
Except that most journals are voluntarily edited by academics .
There does n't seem to be a valid economic justification for Elsevier 's pricing structure , other than the inherent value of their journals .
So , are they worth it ?
Lets take a look at some examples .
Exhibit A must be the Journal of Homeopathy .
Homeopathy is not science .
The journal has a negative scientific value because it does not distribute scientific knowledge , but rather disseminates wishful thinking about reality .
It is the very essence of anti-science .
Yet , here it is , a peer - reviewed " scientific " publication being foisted upon universities through subscription bundling .
A wedge , if you will , of pseudoscientific thinking right in the heart of science .
Exhibit B is Chaos , Fractals , and Solitons , a real mathematical journal that was once a respectable vehicle for scientific communication .
Now , however , the Editor - in - Chief is one M. S. El Naschie , who has managed to publish 300 peer - reviewed papers in his own journal .
By itself , this would be an abuse of position , but it 's actually worse than that .
El Naschie is apparently a numerologist .
Yes , that 's right , the idiots who spend time looking for mystical significance in integers .
No matter where you look , numerical coincidences occur .
But coincidences are not the subject of science — in fact , much of science involves demonstrating that data is n't the result of coincidence .
El Naschie would never have a voice on an adequately edited scientific journal , and any journal that was inadequately edited enough to allow numerology in would normally be shunned by the scientific community .
It is only Elsevier 's drive to profit , even at the expense of their own credibility , that lets this sort situation occur .
It 's not clear that Chaos , Fractals , and Solitons can be rescued .
It does n't even deserve to be rescued — mathematicians are publishing in other journals now .
Even if that journal were to recover , that would n't solve the more general problem posed by bundling .
Only if Elsevier charged a reasonable per-journal subscription fee for each journal , one that reflected not just its cost but also its significance , would the journal be compelled to improve or fold .
This approach could generally solve the problem of poor content and poor editorial choices .
If the quality of a journal falls , or is filled with pseudoscientific garbage , subscriptions will be cancelled .
In this case , libraries will need to start analyzing usage patterns more carefully .
Has anyone downloaded a paper from Chaos , Fractals , and Solitons since it turned into a journal of numerology ?
If the mathematics department at your local university knew about its content , would they still want it in the university ?
These are questions that should be subjected to regular review , but the bundling practice makes asking them useless .
Universities should have the power to cancel these subscriptions without looking forward to a huge increase in subscription fees .
It would be nice to think that Elsevier will listen to scientist , but I suspect that this will not happen until scientists start getting a little more strident .
If you are scientist , publish your work in society journals rather than Elsevier journals .
Try to avoid citing work published in Elsevier journals .
Elsevier lives by a combination of pricing and impact factor , and scientists have direct control over only one of these — impact factor .
Librarian could start looking at Elsevier journal usage patterns ; perhaps they can follow Cornell 's example , and subscribe to just a few Elsevier journals .
I do n't often use Ars Technica as a podium , but Elsevier 's practices cut to the very heart of science as a profession : they reduce the ability to perform research , and they reduce the credibility of the profession .
WASHINGTON  Faced with worsening forecasts for the economy , President - elect Barack Obama is expanding his economic recovery plan and will seek to create or save 3 million jobs in the next two years , up from a goal of 2.5 million jobs set just last month , several advisers to Mr. Obama said Saturday .
Even Mr. Obama ’s more ambitious goal would not fully offset as many as 4 million jobs that some economists are projecting might be lost in the coming year , according to the information he received from advisers in the past week .
That job loss would be double the total this year and could push the nation ’s unemployment rate past 9 percent if nothing is done .
The new job target was set after a meeting last Tuesday in which Christina D. Romer , who is Mr. Obama ’s choice to lead his Council of Economic Advisers , presented information about previous recessions to establish that the current downturn was likely to be “ more severe than anything we ’ve experienced in the past half - century , ” according to an Obama official familiar with the meeting .
Officials said they were working on a plan big enough to stimulate the economy but not so big to provoke major opposition in Congress .
Mr. Obama ’s advisers have projected that the multifaceted economic plan would cost $ 675 billion to $ 775 billion .
It would be the largest stimulus package in memory and would most likely grow as it made its way through Congress , although Mr. Obama has secured Democratic leaders ’ agreement to ban spending on pork - barrel projects .

Turn - out is never very high for run-off elections and The Stonecipher Report 's ' Most Annoying FOX News Anchor ' Poll was no exception .
After almost 800 votes in the initial poll , which included eight different FOX News anchors , turn - out for the run-off between Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly was disappointing .
Less than 10 % of TSR readers turned out for the run-off .
The run-off was deemed necessary when neither O'Reilly or Hannity managed to garner 50 % of the vote , although Bill O'Reilly finished a full six points ahead of Sean Hannity in the initial poll .
O'Reilly was expected to win the run-off , but the low turn - out probably helped Hannity , who developed an early lead and never let go of it .
Exit polls show that much of O'Reilly 's support was due to his now famous " Fuck it , we 'll do it live ! " rant , while Hannity scored points with voters for his complete , unwavering and unthinking support of the Bush Administration and its neocon policies .
In the end , Hannity ended up with an eight - point victory over O'Reilly , 56 % - 44 % .
So congratulations to Sean Hannity - you are officially The Stonecipher Report 's most annoying FOX News Anchor !
Thanks to all those who voted in this poll and please do n't forget to vote in our latest poll which can be found in the right hand column of this page .
Jealousy no defence for killer husbands , but abused wives can escape a murder charge
Freed : Sara Thornton
Husbands who kill cheating wives in a so - called crime of passion will no longer be able to claim they were provoked , ministers will say today .
Stripping husbands of the right to claim that infidelity was the spur for their actions means they will face a charge of murder , rather than manslaughter .
But women who kill abusive partners in cold blood could escape a murder conviction if they prove they feared more violence .
The most sweeping changes to murder laws in 50 years are part of the Government 's controversial Coroners and Justice Bill , to be published today .
Women who kill violent partners will be punished for the lesser offence of manslaughter , sparing them a mandatory life sentence .
They must establish only that they were responding to a ' slow burn ' of abuse .
The change sweeps aside the existing requirement in any defence of provocation that they killed on the spur of the moment after a ' sudden ' loss of control .
But , in cases where a husband kills , the existing ' partial defence ' of provocation if a wife was having an affair is scrapped altogether .
The move means that the law will no longer recognise adultery as a ' serious wrong ' .
Currently , men can escape a murder conviction because a provocation plea allows them to be tried instead for manslaughter .
Ministers say the law needs reform because it allows men to ' get away with murder ' .
Harriet Harman , the minister for women , said : ' For centuries the law has allowed men to escape a murder charge in domestic homicide cases by blaming the victim .
' Ending the provocation defence in cases of " infidelity " is an important law change and will end the culture of excuses . '
Provocation will be scrapped as a defence altogether , and be replaced with two partial defences - that a person feared they could be the victim of serious violence , or could prove they had been ' seriously wronged ' by the victim 's actions .
The fear of further serious violence offers specific protection to women victims of domestic attacks .
They will be able to claim they were responding to a ' slow burn ' of abuse .
Equally controversial is allowing a person to claim they killed because they had been ' seriously wronged ' by a person 's actions or insults .
Beneficiaries of this change may include those who strike out after long and bitter disputes with neighbours , or victims of a serious crime - such as rape - who are taunted at a later date by the attacker .
Instead of receiving a mandatory life sentence for murder , they too could escape with a manslaughter conviction .
But the ' seriously wronged ' clause is expected to make a special exemption for infidelity .
Ministers have said sexual ' jealousy ' should no longer be used as a defence under any circumstances .
Erin Pizzey , the women 's rights campaigner , has attacked the plans .
She said : ' I 'm appalled by it , because I think " thou shalt not kill " has been with us since the time of Moses .
' It 's so important that we do n't in any way upset the concept that to kill another human being is the most terrible thing you can do . '
The new murder rules follow a report from the Government 's legal advisers , the Law Commission , which paid deep attention to the claims of feminists that women who kill violent husbands or boyfriends are too harshly treated .
But Robert Whelan of the Civitas think - tank said : ' The Government is making some people more equal than others before the law .
It seems some lives are worth more than others . '
Researcher and author on families and the law , Patricia Morgan said : ' They are differentiating between victims .
They are saying some groups have excuses because they fall into a different category . '
Mrs Morgan added : ' It seems that women have excuses and men do n't . '

ADMITTING THE PROBLEM …. James Joyner bemoans the lack of substance in the conservative blogosphere :
Part of the reason I ’m drawn to the center - left blogs [ … ] while finding it increasingly difficult to find center - right blogs worth my time is that the former are much more likely to get beyond the debates of the 1980 election .
There ’s almost no serious analysis of health care reform , urban planning , education , and many other issues that regularly crop up on the best lefty blogs on their conservative counterparts .
If we read about those issues at all , they ’re framed as if Ronald Reagan were still aspiring to high office : Say No to socialism !
Abolish the Department of Education !
Government IS the problem !
Right .
The world has changed in the past 20 years but conservatism does n’t really seem willing to accept it .
Take global warming .
Here ’s the rough conservative reaction to it starting in the early 90s :
It does n’t exist .
It exists but it is n’t manmade .
It ’s manmade , but it ’s too expensive to do anything about .
Even this is a generous assessment .
A lot of conservatives are still stuck at # 2 , and sizeable chunk at # 1 .
What this means is that they ’re basically shut out of the conversation entirely .
Which is too bad , because I ’d actually be sort of interested to hear a conservative take on how to address global warming that accepts both its reality and the necessity of doing something about it .
If we really are facing a global environmental catastrophe , what shape would a conservative solution take ?
I do n’t think anyone knows .
Likewise , conservative reaction to wage stagnation and growing income inequality has gone down a similar road :
It does n’t exist .
It exists , but consumption inequality is what really matters . ??
Our current financial meltdown has pretty much wiped out # 2 as a plausible explanation , since the stagnating middle class can no longer borrow to keep up their consumption .
But what ’s # 3 ?
Will it be yet another attempt to deny that the problem even exists ?
Or some kind of interesting conservative take on what to do about it ?
Global warming and skyrocketing income inequality are problems that did n’t even exist in 1980 , which means there is no “ Reaganite ” solution to appeal to .
There might still be conservative takes on these things , but they wo n’t do any good until conservatives actually accept that these are real problems that people genuinely care about .
That day still seems pretty far off .

( Experimental ) Replay debugging —
Record the execution of an application you want to debug and then use the Integrated Virtual Debugger for Visual Studio to examine the recording repeatedly .
No debugging is performed during the recording process , so debugging activities do not affect the normal execution of an application .
This powerful tool enables you to fix bugs that cannot be reliably reproduced .
You can also use reverse - execution debugging , which is analogous to forward execution , except the application runs until it reaches the previous breakpoint , data breakpoint , or exception .

Removable Devices
Display
Integrated Virtual Debuggers
Miscellaneous Localization and Internationalization
On Linux hosts , if you open a Workstation 5.x or 6.0.x virtual machine that has Japanese characters in the .vmx file name , Workstation 6.5 might exit unexpectedly .
If you create a virtual machine on a host with an English locale and then try to open that virtual machine on a Japanese host where the path to the Workstation installation directory contains certain Japanese hanzi characters or other characters that are not in the local encoding ( that is , not Japanese ) , you might not be able to open the virtual machine .
If a virtual machine 's configuration file ( .vmx file ) contains characters outside of the ASCII character set and you want to use Workstation 6.5 to open a virtual machine that was created with an older version of another VMware product , such as VMware Fusion 1.1 , you must first open the virtual machine with a new version of that other VMware product .
For example , open a Fusion 1.1 virtual machine with Fusion 2.0 and then you will be able to open it with Workstation 6.5 .
Workstation and Virtual Machine Upgrade and Compatibility On Linux hosts that use a Compiz window manager , after you install Workstation , you might not be able to power on a virtual machine until you reboot the host .
On some Windows hosts , when you attempt to upgrade Workstation , if the uninstallation portion of the upgrade fails , you might need to reboot the host .
Reboots are necessary if the uninstallation fails with the error " The installer failed to stop VStor2 WS60 Virtual Storage driver .... "
On Windows Vista hosts , when you update Workstation to this release version , network settings might not be preserved .
If you create a Workstation 6.5 virtual machine and then open it with the beta version of VMware Fusion 2.0 , you will not be able to open it again in a beta version of Workstation 6.5 , VMware Server 2.0 , or any future product .
If you upgrade some virtual machines from Fusion 1.1 to Workstation 6.5 , you will not be able to configure or install an update for VMware Tools .
Guest operating system that have this problem include Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and Solaris 10 .
When installing or updating VMware Tools in a virtual machine , if you see the message " Files in Use " ->
" VMware Snapshot Provider ( Process Id: xxxx ) , " you must click Retry to continue .
If you see the message again , you must click Ignore .
On virtual machines with a Windows 2000 operating system , if the virtual machine is set to automatically update VMware Tools , the virtual machine is not restarted after the update .
You must manually restart the virtual machine to complete the update and start VMware Tools .
Auto -updates of VMware Tools on Ubuntu Linux guests does not work if the virtual machine uses a version of VMware Tools included in Workstation 5.5.x .
Auto - upgrades from 6.0.x are successful .
If you use Avira AntiVir antivirus software on a Windows Vista host , you might have problems running virtual machines .

For a virtual CD - ROM device , if you have legacy emulation turned on and then use a CD to install a Solaris guest operating system , you might see an error message that says the medium is incompatible .
You can safely ignore this message .
If you attempt to disconnect a USB keyboard from the host in order to connect it exclusively to the guest , you might receive a " Found New Hardware Wizard " prompt " in the virtual machine .
The prompt requests permission to search for the VMware USB driver .
If you dismiss the prompt from the keyboard , mouse control is lost from both host and guest .
On Windows XP hosts and perhaps other hosts , you might be locked out of the host if you remove a smart card from its reader in order to insert it for logging in to a virtual machine .
To avoid this problem , configure the host 's smart card removal behavior so that no action is taken when the smart card is removed .
On Windows Vista guests , you must use the non-virtual smart card reader item in the Removable Devices menu rather than the virtual smart card reader item .
This non-virtual , or pass - through , smart card reader device does not let you share the smart card with the host or with other virtual machines .
It might also lack functionality that the virtual smart card reader provides .
If you upgrade from Workstation 6.0.x , or an earlier 6.5 beta release , you might have difficulties logging in to a domain using a smart card .
For example , you might see an error such as , " The system could not log you on .
Your credentials could not be verified . "
Smart cards that have been tested include Gemplus and ActivIdentity .
Smart card readers that have been tested include : Readers with USB interfaces : Gemplus USB-SW , HP USB Smartcard Keyboard KUS0133 , Advance Card System ACR30U , and ActivIdentity USB Reader Readers with serial interfaces : Gemplus American Express GCR415 Readers with PCMCIA interfaces : Omnikey CardMan 4040
The HP Smartcard keyboard cannot be connected to any virtual machine .
The keyboard is not a visible device under the removable devices menu when the " Show all input devices " option is selected .
Display
If you want to use exclusive mode when running a 3 - D game , application , or screensaver , you must first go into full screen mode , then start the 3 - D application , and then go into exclusive mode .
If you start a 3 - D application when you are already in exclusive mode , the virtual machine will go into full screen mode .
On Linux hosts with a Linux guest , when in Unity mode , you might not be able to start some applications from a virtual machine 's Applications menu on the host .
For some applications , the application might show a fatal error at startup and for others , the application does not start .
Workaround :
Do one of the following :
On Open SUSE guests , use a text editor to open the file named /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.common .
Search for and delete the block of lines starting with " Beginning of the block added by the VMware software " and ending with " End of the block added by the VMware software " .
On Debian and Ubuntu guests , find and delete the file named /etc/X11/Xsession.d/99-vmware-vmware_user ( or similar ) .
If you are using xdm , use a text editor to open the files named xdm-config in /etc / X11/xdm , /usr/lib/X11/xdm , /usr/local/lib/X11/xdm , and so on .
Search for and delete the block of lines starting with " Beginning of the block added by the VMware software " and ending with " End of the block added by the VMware software " .
Workaround :
Do one of the following : On Linux hosts with a Linux guest , you might not be able to use Unity mode to place application windows from different virtual desktops into corresponding virtual desktops on the host .
Windows from different virtual desktops on the guest might all be placed in one virtual desktop on the host .
When you place a virtual machine in Unity mode , Workstation tries to disable the guest screensaver .
On some Linux guests , however , the screensaver is not disabled .
If a guest 's screensaver starts being used when in Unity mode and if you have the guest configured to require authentication to exit the screensaver , you might get locked out of the guest .
In such environments , disable the guest screensaver for any Linux virtual machine that will use Unity mode often .
On Linux hosts , Unity mode might not work correctly if the host has enabled the " Show position of pointer when the Control key is pressed " option in System > Preferences >
Mouse .
If you notice issues in Unity mode with copying and pasting text or files , or if you have problems with keyboard shortcuts that include the Control key , disable the " Show position of pointer ... " option .
On Linux hosts , you might not be able to use Unity mode , depending on the user 's system , the applications that are running , and the amount of RAM .
This situation results from not being able to allocate enough memory for the framebuffer .
Possible workaround : Double the value in / proc / sys / kernel / shmmax .
If this does not work , try logging out of X or rebooting to free up the necessary memory for the framebuffer .
If this does not work , choose VM > Settings > Hardware > Display and deselect the 3D Graphics check box .
If a Workstation 6.0.x virtual machine has accelerated 3 - D graphics enabled and you upgrade it to a Workstation 6.5 virtual machine , the 3 - D Graphics check box is deselected .
You must re-enable it .
Occasionally , on Windows guests , when you try to play a QuickTime video while in full screen mode , you see only a black screen .
Integrated Virtual Debuggers
If a virtual machine is powered off and you use the Integrated Virtual Debugger for Eclipse , you may see the error " Guest has only loopback IP address .
Ensure that it has a properly configured TCP / IP connection to the host . "
Workaround : Enabled shared folders manually .
Workaround : Enabled shared folders manually .
If you add additional . jar files to the class path of your Eclipse project and launch it inside a Windows virtual machine from within Eclipse then you may not be able to detach and re-attach the Integrated Virtual Debugger for Eclipse from the application .
Miscellaneous Issues On Windows hosts , the sound drivers are not installed in some Windows guests .
Sound does not work in these guests .
You cannot install VMware Tools on a virtual machine with a 64 - bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.0 Update 8 AS operating system .
On Windows 95 and Windows 98 guests , the Autofit Guest command and the Fit Guest Now command do not work unless you use the guest 's Display Properties settings to change the screen resolution to a higher value than 640 X 480 .
Occasionally , if you attempt to play an audio CD while using the record / replay feature to record virtual machine execution , the audio stops playing .
For Windows XP guests , you might need to restart the virtual machine .
For other guests , audio will start working again after you stop recording .
The VM streaming feature does not yet work with HTTP redirects .
If you use File >
Import to convert a dual - boot physical machine or virtual machine , the Conversion wizard might not be able to determine the default system volume correctly .
If the default system volume from boot.ini in the source machine shares the same partition number and the same system folder name with other system volumes , it might incorrectly assume any other system volume as the default system volume .
As a result , the virtual machine that the Conversion wizard creates might not be bootable in the default operating system .
Top of Page Resolved Issues
To share a smart card between the host and a virtual machine or between multiple virtual machines , you must add the following line to the global configuration file :

By George Will - December 7 , 2008
WASHINGTON -- Reactionary liberalism , the ideology of many Democrats , holds that inconvenient rights , such as secret ballots in unionization elections , should be repealed ; that existing failures , such as GM , should be preserved ; and , with special perversity , that repealed mistakes , such as the " fairness doctrine , " should be repeated .
That Orwellian name was designed to disguise the doctrine 's use as the government 's instrument for preventing fair competition in the broadcasting of political commentary .
Because liberals have been even less successful in competing with conservatives on talk radio than Detroit has been in competing with its rivals , liberals are seeking intellectual protectionism in the form of regulations that suppress ideological rivals .
If liberals advertise their illiberalism by reimposing the fairness doctrine , the Supreme Court might revisit its 1969 ruling that the fairness doctrine is constitutional .
The court probably would dismay reactionary liberals by reversing that decision on the ground that the world has changed vastly , pertinently and for the better .
Until the Reagan administration extinguished it , the doctrine required broadcasters to devote reasonable time to fairly presenting all sides of any controversial issue discussed on the air .
The government decided the meaning of the italicized words .
When government regulation of the content of broadcasts began in 1927 , the supposed justification was the scarcity of radio spectrum .
In 1928 and 1929 , when Republicans ran Washington , a New York station owned by the Socialist Party was warned to show " due regard " for others ' opinions , and the government blocked the Chicago Federation of Labor 's attempted purchase of a station because all stations should serve " the general public . "
In 1939 , when Democrats ran Washington , the government conditioned renewal of one station 's license on that station 's promise to desist from anti-FDR editorials .
In 1969 , when the Supreme Court declared the fairness doctrine constitutional , it probably did not know the Kennedy administration 's use of it , as one official described it : " Our massive strategy was to use the fairness doctrine to challenge and harass the right - wing broadcasters and hope that the challenges would be so costly to them that they would be inhibited and decide it was too expensive to continue . "
Richard Nixon emulated this practice .
In 1973 , Supreme Court Justice William Douglas , a liberal , said the doctrine " has no place in our First Amendment regime " because it " enables administration after administration to toy with TV or radio . "
The court 's 1969 ruling relied heavily on the scarcity rationale .
But Brian Anderson and Adam Thierer , in their book " A Manifesto for Media Freedom , " note that today there are about 14,000 radio stations , twice as many as in 1969 , and 18.9 million subscribers to satellite radio , up 17 percent in 12 months , and 86 percent of households with either cable or satellite television receive an average of 102 of the 500 available channels .
Because daily newspapers are much more scarce than are radio and television choices , should there be a fairness doctrine for The New York Times ?
The 1969 court dismissed as " speculative " the possibility that the fairness doctrine would cause broadcasters to " eliminate coverage of controversial issues . "
But the proper worry was that the doctrine would continue to stifle the flowering of controversy .
A court that considers the doctrine today will note that whereas in 1980 there were fewer than 100 talk radio programs , today there are more than 1,500 news or talk radio stations .
Further subverting the " scarcity " rationale for government supervision of broadcast content , some liberals now say :
The problem is not maldistribution of opinion and information , but too much of both .
Until recently , liberals fretted that the media were homogenizing America into blandness .
Now they say speech management by government is needed because of a different scarcity -- the public 's attention , which supposedly is overloaded by today 's information cornucopia .
And these worrywarts say the proliferation of radio , cable , satellite broadcasting and Internet choices allows people to choose their own universe of commentary , which takes us far from the good old days when everyone had the communitarian delight of gathering around the cozy campfire of the NBC - ABC - CBS oligopoly .
Being a liberal is exhausting when you must simultaneously argue for illiberal policies on the basis of dangerous scarcity and menacing abundance .
If reactionary liberals , unsatisfied with dominating the mainstream media , academia and Hollywood , were competitive on talk radio , they would be uninterested in reviving the fairness doctrine .
Having so sullied liberalism 's name that they have taken to calling themselves progressives , liberals are now ruining the reputation of reactionaries , which really is unfair .
Today American children are taught in our schools that Wilson was one of our greatest presidents .
That is proof in itself that the American Republic has never recovered from the blow he inflicted upon it .

This article is a followup to my previous post , Facebook apps in Python and Pylons part 1 .
I 'm going to talk a little more about what is interesting about Facebook apps and how they work in practice .
At the end , I provide a little code sample and a convenience decorator to save you some hassle .
Why write a Facebook app ?
Even if you are pretty familiar with using Facebook , you would be easily forgiven if you did n't fully understand what the capabilities of a Facebook application are , and how the flow works .
Facebook applications essentially offer you :
The ability to put your own content on a user 's profile .
The ability to update a user 's news feed .
def require_login(f ) : '''
This decorator first checks to see if the user is authenticated .
If not , it redirects them in the appropriate fashion to the log in page .
If they are authenticated , it sets up the PyFacebook Facebook object and passes it down to our wrapped method . ''' def redirect ( fb , url ) : if fb.in_canvas : log.info( " doing fbml redirect 302 " ) return ' ' %( url , ) else : log.info ( " sending a 302 " ) response.status_int = 302 response.headers [' location ' ] = url return ' Moved temporarily ' api_key = config [ ' pyfacebook.apikey ' ] secret_key = config [ ' pyfacebook.secret ' ] appid = config [ ' pyfacebook.appid ' ] auth_token = request.params.get ( ' auth_token ' , None ) fb = Facebook ( api_key , secret_key , app_name= ' myapp ' , callback_path='/myapp/callback ' , auth_token=auth_token ) if not fb.check_session( request ) or not auth_token : log.info( " got an unauthenticated session request " ) return lambda a : redirect ( fb , fb.get_login_url ( ) ) return lambda a : f ( a , fb=fb ) class FacebookController ( BaseController ) : def index ( self ) : return ' Hello World ' @require_login def post_add ( self , fb=None ) : fb.auth.getSession ( ) log .info( " got a valid session from user %s " , fb.uid ) fb.profile.setFBML (' ') @require_login def callback ( self , fb=None ) : c.uid = fb.uid return render ('/canvas.fbml ' )
While there are a bunch more things you can do with your Facebook application - as described on the official " Anatomy of a Facebook application " page on developers.facebook.com , those two things are likely the most interesting to you .
This is the next question !
Obviously , the basic answer is " by writing a Facebook app , stupid ! " .
Of course , you 're looking for a little bit more than just that .
The first step is for the user to .
I 'm about to drop a whole load of Facebook API jargon - specialised terms are highlighted in bold - the user can do this by visiting your .
You generate the canvas page from your , and include some FBML to give it an add to profile button .
Once the person adds your application , Facebook will redirect them to your .
From the post add hook , you can use the Facebook API to call setFBML to add content to their profile page , and publishUserAction to add stuff to their feed .
Its pretty trivial - but there is an additional caveat .
Before you can do anything useful in a Facebook app , you must have a valid Facebook session .
Basically , you want most of your entry points to only be loaded if a user has a logged in session , and if they do n't , you want them to be redirected to the login page .
This ends up being a fair bit of boiler - plate code .
I have written this method decorator to normalise the boiler - plate code into a single place , such that your Pylons controller methods will be handed a valid PyFacebook API object ( from the PyFacebook library - see part 1 ) .
Here is an extremely basic code skeleton for a Facebook app in Pylons using my decocorator and PyFacebook : Hopefully that is enough to get you started .
I 'll be writing more about this subject so stay tuned .
If you have any specific questions , feel free to post a comment !
Niall O'Higgins is an author and software developer .
He wrote the O'Reilly book MongoDB and Python .
He also develops Strider Open Source Continuous Deployment and offers full - stack consulting services at FrozenRidge.co .
Cheating at video games was a hobby early on .
“ I remember in particular there was a ‘ Star Wars ’ game , X - Wing , where you shoot down Imperial spaceships , ” he recalled in an e-mail message .
“ Only one of my computer - controlled wingmen was any good .
My very first hack at age 9 was noticing there was a file for each pilot , and I simply copied the pilot file for the good wingman 20 times , giving me a plentiful supply of the best wingmen from then on . ”
Beating X - Wing must have been supernaturally gratifying because , then and there , Griffith seemed to have devoted himself to finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems of all kinds .
As he wrote to me : “ I love the ingenuity that goes into trying to think of the most perverse things you can do within the game that the designers would have never intended or foreseen someone trying .
You step back and look at the entire interacting , breathing system and pick out the counterintuitive , unbalanced , seldom - explored parts and look for a way for these parts to interact such that they play off each other , synergistically amplifying their power to influence everything else , potentially spiraling out of control . ”
This cast of mind , Griffith wrote , “ gave me a knack for computer security . ”
During his freshman year in college , at the University of Alabama , he read an article in 2600 : The Hacker Quarterly that revealed potential flaws in the Blackboard Transaction System , which administers the multipurpose campus ID card used at many American colleges and universities .
Griffith approached Billy Hoffman , the author of the article and a student at Georgia Tech , about collaborating on the problem .
The pair worked for months on a demonstration of the weaknesses of Blackboard technology .
In April 2003 , they were hours away from presenting their findings at a security conference in Atlanta when Blackboard hit them with a restraining order .
The company then sued Griffith and Hoffman for something considerably less than trying to overthrow the government ( so much for the rumors ) .
In fact , they were charged with violating the Consumer Fraud and Abuse Act , among other things .
The parties settled out of court later that year .
( The terms of the settlement are sealed . )
Griffith says he likes to think of himself as a superhero of online anarchy : a “ disruptive technologist . ”
But there ’s another side to the mischief maker from Tuscaloosa — a more contemplative side .
In 2002 , Griffith , like many other scientifically inclined young people , fell under the spell of Douglas R. Hofstadter ’s Pulitzer Prize - winning 1979 best seller , “ Gödel , Escher , Bach . ”
It was a revelation .
In downtime from his life as an Internet poltergeist , Griffith started to explore quieter , more ethically defensible intellectual pleasures .
“ I wrestled with materialism , ” he explained , referring to the vexing fact that the miracle of consciousness somehow inheres in three pounds of quivery human flesh .
Why could n’t a smart guy like himself make a computational device with the self - awareness of a human mind ?
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -
In another sign of the depth of the global economic slowdown , U.S. consumer prices increased just 0.1 % in 2008 , the smallest increase in 54 years , the Labor Department reported Friday .
The consumer price index fell 0.7 % in December , the third decline in a row , led by an 8.3 % drop in energy prices and a 0.1 % drop in food prices .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had given an average expectation for a 0.8 % decline .
See Economic Calendar .
The CPI has n't risen since its 0.8 % gain in July , after which energy and commodity prices plunged .
Read the full government report .
Core prices -- which exclude food and energy prices -- were flat in December for the second straight month , as expected .
The core CPI has n't risen since September .
Consumer prices were up 0.1 % in 2008 , the slowest annual inflation since prices fell 0.7 % in 1954 .
The core CPI was up 1.8 % in 2008 , the smallest increase since 2003 .
If the CPI had fallen 0.8 % in December as expected , prices would have been down for the year as a whole .
A separate CPI for urban workers showed prices fell 0.5 % in 2008 , the biggest decline since 1949 .
The CPI - W is used for many cost - of - living adjustments .
With prices for urban workers down 0.9 % in December and average weekly earnings down 0.3 % , real weekly earnings -- those adjusted for inflation -- rose 0.6 % .
For all of 2008 , real earnings were up 2.9 % .
Falling prices have been a boon for consumers , but have devastated corporate profit margins , leading to even more layoffs and production cutbacks .
Most economists expect inflation to ease for much of this year as global demand weakens .
Federal Reserve officials say they are n't especially concerned about deflation taking hold , and insist that they are ready to shrink the money supply once the economy begins to recover in order to prevent a bout of inflation next year .
" Our latest forecast shows the core slipping to 1 % by the end of 2009 , consistent with a growing output gap that is expected to reach 6 % , " wrote David Greenlaw and Ted Wieseman , economists for Morgan Stanley .
" Even with energy prices having flattened out of late , the deflation risk confronting the U.S. economy is real . "
In a separate report released Friday , the Federal Reserve said industrial output plunged 2 % in December , much more than expected .
See full story on industrial output .
In a separate report , the consumer sentiment index rose to 61.9 in January from 60.1 in December .
See full story .
Details of CPI
In December , prices were flat or falling in most major consumer categories , with health and education serving as the exceptions .
Energy prices fell 8.3 % , including a 17 % drop in gasoline prices and a 13 % drop in fuel oil prices .
Excluding energy , the CPI was flat .
Food prices fell 0.1 % , led by declining prices for fruits , vegetables , dairy and meat .
Shelter prices -- which represent about a third of the CPI -- were flat in December .
Hotel rates fell 0.7 % , rents rose 0.2 % , and homeownership equivalent rent rose 0.1 % .
Apparel prices fell 0.9 % .
Transportation prices fell 4.4 % on lower fuel bills .
Airfares fell 1.2 % .
New vehicle prices fell 0.4 % .
Medical care prices increased 0.3 % .
Education and communication prices rose 0.3 % , led by a 0.6 % rise in tuition .
Carl Tashian has emailed me to alert you all to a marriage equality flag they created .
This is a protest flag for equal marriage rights in the United States .
The flag only has two stars , for Connecticut and Massachusetts ( the 5th and 6th states in the union ) , the only states with legalized gay marriage .
The idea is based on the suffragists who created their own US flag with only four stars , representing the four states that allowed women to vote , they added stars as states started to grant voting rights .
The designer will add stars as more states enact equal marriage rights .
All proceeds from products sold off the website will benefit Marriage Equality USA .

A man who accidentally left his mobile telephone in a branch of McDonald 's is suing the fast - food chain after nude photos of his wife that had been stored in the device ended up on the internet .
Philip Sherman says he was promised by staff at the burger restaurant in Fayette , Arkansas , that the handset would be turned off and securely stored until he could retrieve it .
Instead , he alleges that employees at the branch ended up rifling through his phone 's memory , address book , text messages and library of images before posting pictures of his wife , Tina , online .
Next to the photographs , which were meant only for Mr Sherman 's eyes , the miscreants added the McDonald 's logo , together with its slogan " I'm lovin ' it " and a caption describing Mrs Sherman as " hot like McDonald 's ' coffee " .
They also provided her name , address and contact details , prompting dozens of unwelcome letters , phone calls and emails that apparently forced the couple to move home .

The Shermans are seeking $ 3 m ( £ 2 m ) for emotional distress , embarrassment and damage to their reputations .
They also allege loss of earnings , and want to reclaim the cost of their change of address .
The nude photos had been removed from the site that originally posted them yesterday , but a professional - looking black - and - white image of Mrs Sherman dressed in lingerie , which was allegedly part of the leaked set , was being carried by several online news outlets .
Mrs Sherman says in the lawsuit that she began receiving threatening and offensive calls and text messages about the pictures shortly after her husband visited McDonald 's on 5 July .
She was then shocked to discover that several private images she had sent to him had been posted online .
The lawsuit holds the McDonald 's Corporation , together with the local franchise owner , responsible for what it claims were the reckless and abusive actions of its staff .
A spokesman for the company did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the case .
The affair has sparked heated debate in online forums , with many correspondents expressing surprise at the quality of the allegedly private photographs .
Some wondered if the couple might have somehow engineered an elaborate compensation scam , a suggestion they are likely to reject .
PBuchanan : Brief On Informants In Intel Operations
A Word From Afar : Brief On The Use Of Informants
In Intelligence Operations A Word From Afar is a regular column that analyses political / strategic / international interest .
By Paul G. Buchanan
Revelations that for a decade the New Zealand Police used a paid informant to infiltrate progressive activist groups including Greenpeace , the Green Party and the Unite union have provoked outrage from civil libertarians .
The latter argue that the infiltration of legitimate dissent and anti-status quo organizations , to say nothing of a prominent political party , is anti-democratic and intimidatory .
They may well be correct in that assessment .
But there is a backdrop to the recently unearthed evidence of Police spying on activist groups , and that needs to be understood in order to bring things into context .
A tried and true tool of Police work is undercover operations in which informants infiltrate criminal entities in order to secure evidence that will lead to arrests and convictions of those involved in illegal enterprise .
Along with electronic and other forms of technical surveillance , this human intelligence collection is vital to the successful prosecution and incarceration of guilty parties .
Drug cartels , gangs , auto theft rings — the spectrum of criminality can be undone with a well - conceived and executed undercover operation .
National intelligence collection follows a similar pattern , albeit with a focus on foreign actors and non-criminal organizations .
Among the instruments employed is the covert operative , that is , a human intelligence collector in a designated area of interest , country or region .
These come in several guises , ranging from official cover agents ( diplomats and others with diplomatic passports who operate outside of the terms of their diplomatic credentials ) to non-official cover agents ( state agents posing as something else ) , to liaison agents ( foreign intelligence partners ) and contract assets .
Contract assets are non-state agents who are hired to provide information of trends , issues , groups , security agencies or governments .
They may display ideological affinity or nationalistic fervour ( such as the use by Mossad of foreign Jewish spies and supporters of Israel known as Katya and Sayanin , or the use of Chinese ex-patriot foreign residents as spies by the PRC ) .
They may simply be paid a contractual fee ( as appears to be the case with the now infamous Mr. Gilchrist ) .
Contract assets are generally considered less reliable than state agents , especially if they are paid contractors , as their loyalties are often suspect and may go to the highest bidder .
In addition , they often manufacture or embellish information to secure their fees , which taints the quality of the information being obtained .
For example , US claims about Iraq ’s weapons program in the lead up to the invasion were based in large part by the “ evidence ” provided by one paid informant that turned out to be exaggerated or false in most instances .
It is said that we live in an age of terror .
The best tool to defeat irregular warfare groups that use terrorism as a tactic is timely intelligence on their operations .
The better the intelligence on what extremists are preparing to do , the more likely that they can be disrupted prior to the event .
That requires the use of electronic and other technical means , but it is mostly reliant on infiltrating such groups with informants , be these state agents working without official cover or contract assets working out of affinity or for a fee .
After 9/11 the field was opened for the expansion of such activities , including the targeting of “ progressive ” groups exhibiting sympathy towards Palestinian and / or other Muslim , Islamicist or pan-Arabic causes , anti-imperialist sentiments , or a penchant for engaging in direct action in order to pursue anti-status quo political agendas .
Throughout the world governments rushed through anti-terrorist legislation expanding the scope of intelligence collection activities both foreign and domestic .
New Zealand was not immune from the trend .
To the contrary .
The fifth Labour government enacted security legislation that was more appropriate for the threat environment in Karachi than Kaikoura , and went so far as to violate the human rights of an Algerian refugee seeker in order to show that it was “ tough ” on terrorism .
Security agencies , particularly the Police and the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service ( NZSIS ) saw the post - 9/11 environment as a window of opportunity to expand the scope of their intelligence operations and the legal charter governing them .
That in turn required bigger budgets and more personnel .
All of this did , in fact , eventuate .
Under provisions of the Terrorism Suppression
Act of 2008 , its predecessors and related legislation , the ability of the Police and intelligence agencies to conduct electronic and technical eavesdropping and the rights of “ terrorism ” defendants have been modified in favour of greater State powers and less legal protection for suspects and accused .
All of this happened without public fanfare or , dare it be said , interest .
The general attitude in parliament and on the street was indifferent to the trend and if anything , the ends were said to justify the means .
Security agencies argue that the infiltration of otherwise peaceful activist groups is justified because it is not the majority of activists or their activities that are of concern .
The argument goes that such groups , be they Left or Right wing in orientation , tend to attract mentally unstable individuals with a penchant for violence that extends beyond the tactics or goals of a particular group .
One deranged soul acting on a distorted ideological belief could cause a terrorist incident , and it is the security agencies responsibility to prevent that .
Recall that amongst the original Urewera 17 “ terrorism ” defendants was an individual with obvious metal health issues .
It was this individual who said the most alarming things recorded by Police surveillance .
Thus the Police will feel that even if the others involved in the paramilitary camps ( if that is in fact what they were ) were no threat to society , stopping that one individual was worth the cost of the operation .
That remains to be seen .
The larger point is that crazy people are believed to gravitate to militant activist groups , and thus it is a security obligation to be on top of their activities .
In this case , even if the Police use of a paid informant to infiltrate a number of well - known progressive groups ( environmental and animal rights activists for the most part , but including the fore - mentioned union and party as well ) is justified on those terms , several questions beg .
If there is one informer , there might well be others .
Are the police targeting right wing militants such as neo -nazis and skinheads , or are they being ideological selective in their use of infiltration techniques ?
Why did they target the Green Party — once part of a Labour - led government — and why did they target Greenpeace when that organization has been the sole victim of foreign terrorism in New Zealand ’s history ( albeit at the hands of agents of the French state , which is now New Zealand ’s intelligence partner ) ?
The choice of targeted groups is otherwise a smorgasbord of progressive causes with shared memberships and proclivities for direct action tactics .
Why , exactly , were they targeted ?
There are organizational differences between activist groups and terrorist units that the Police are undoubtedly aware of .
Protest groups work to develop horizontal solidarity ties with kindred outfits , other social movements and unions .
They do so by overlapping memberships and developing networking circles in order to raise consciousness about their cause and increase the numbers present at symbolic acts of defiance .
Taken as a whole this form of organization has come to be known as social movement unionism , which emerged as a late 20th century response by subordinate groups to the challenges of capitalist globalisation .
Irregular warfare units utilize small ( 3 - 5 person ) cells that maintain rigid secrecy about their planned activities so as to not compromise operational security .
Although they may organise within the confines of a larger group , they are autonomous and independent in their actions , maintaining a degree of psychological separation from the larger group .
Their logistical preparations , training , reconnoitring and associated planning are done completely apart from the activities of the peaceful activist groups that they may be associated with .
Given that there was much overlap between the memberships of the groups that Mr. Gilchrist was monitoring , and the fact that their activities were well publicised and much debated within activist circles , it appears that they did not , in fact , conceal potential terrorist cells or criminals within them .
The behaviour of the informant in this case is interesting .
Intelligence collectors are charged with obtaining information about other people ’s behaviour , plans and intentions .
They are there to observe rather than meddle .
In this instance Mr. Gilchrist was clearly a provocateur who incited others to escalate their direct action activities beyond their original intentions .
That may well have been because he had to justify his pay .
His behaviour is problematic because it compromises the integrity of the intelligence collected given that it is the contract asset who was advocating potentially violent acts .
The Police have a word for this sort of behaviour : “ entrapment . ”
Since several members of the groups he infiltrated have made mention of his incitement , it would have been difficult to secure convictions on the basis of any evidence he provided .
There are other oddities in this affair as well .
The fact that the Mr. Gilchrist did not practice electronic security in his emailed reports to his Police handlers ( as easy as establishing remote accounts on large internet providers ) , then asked his computer technician girlfriend to fix a minor technical problem on the home computer he was using to send his reports is evidence of supreme stupidity , amateurism , or perhaps something else .
It was a very convenient way of “ outing ” that particular individual , who then expressed remorse for his actions .
Yet it is interesting that the groups he was reporting on had members caught up in the Urewera Police raids .
It is not specious to speculate that perhaps this convenient “ outing ” of Mr. Gilchrist deflected attention from the undercover operation that led to the tip - off that something funny was happening in the Ureweras .
It might be equally plausible that it deflects attention away from ongoing clandestine operations against domestic political groups .
The point is that the discovery of this particular informant was almost too easy .
There be much more to this incident than initially meets the eye .
That may be the reason why Prime Minister Key has refused to conduct an investigation and supports Police assurances that the informant operation was in the interest of national security .
Mr. Key is either naive to believe that Police explanation given who was targeted by Mr. Gilchrist , or is disinclined to challenge the security apparatus early in his tenure , or is disinterested in the civil rights implications of allowing the Police to conduct clandestine surveillance on peaceful activist groups whose direct action involves symbolic protests against abuses of power , corporate greed and contested property .
Thus the Labour governments carte blanche approach to such activities is most likely to continue regardless of the change in government — and it could well get worse under National given its blanket support for the TSA and the US - led approach to the so - called “ war on terror . ”
The bottom line is that , under the now - fashionable concept of the “ responsibility to protect ” ( whereby security agents act proactively to protect vulnerable populations from harm ) , the Police may be justified in using informants infiltrated into seemingly peaceful activist groups IF and only if they have clear indications that someone in those groups is planning acts of violence against people .
A decade - long infiltration of an array of progressive groups suggests that is not the case , but instead is symptomatic of a general Police concern about those groups .
That needs to be explained in detail .
General assurances and Mr. Key ’s belief aside , nothing indicates that the groups spied on by Mr. Gilchrist fit the profile of a terrorist or criminal incubator .
Thus the points raised by civil libertarians remain true : what was the real purpose of this intelligence gathering operation , who in government knew about it , when did they know about it , how did Mr. Gilchrist ’s outing happen so easily and why are the revelations of domestic political espionage so painless for the Police and their elected overseers ?
For a country that prides itself on its respect for human rights and ethical public policy , these are vexing questions only if the Police ( and the governments that supervise them ) use their purported “ duties to protect ” in order to suppress domestic political dissent .
Since the Police Conduct Authority would be hard pressed to reveal undercover operations , that means the matter is one for parliament to investigate .
It remains to be seen if it has the interest or will to do so .

“ Do n’t take someone to task simply because a group has supported him politically and now he supports legislation that helps them , ” Mr. D’Amato said .
“ The question is , is the legislation good or bad ?
With Chuck , it is clear he tries to do what is best for the state and city as a whole . ”
Doling Out Criticism
For Mr. Schumer , Wall Street ’s crisis has been especially painful to watch .
“ It is horrible , just awful , ” he said in the interview .
“ And it affects everybody . ”
And he has already begun identifying those he faults for the devastation .
Subprime lenders top the list , but he has lashed out with particular fury at the credit - rating industry , which he once defended but now says misled him and the investing public .
“ The work at these ratings firms was severely compromised , and the companies were some of the biggest contributors to the current financial crisis , ” Mr. Schumer said earlier this month in response to an S.E.C. move that same day to tighten control over the agencies .
“ The lesson from this is that the three major firms ’ stranglehold on the ratings industry must be loosened . ”
Mr. Schumer has also blamed the Bush administration for its push to ease rules .
“ After eight years of deregulatory zeal by the Bush administration , an attitude of ‘ the market can do no wrong ’ has led it down a short path to economic recession , ” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor in September .
He has not assigned responsibility to himself or fellow Democrats , saying he had no way of knowing of the misdeeds going on on Wall Street .
“ I wish I was omniscient , ” he said .
“ I ’m not . ”
Since the economy began to fall apart , Mr. Schumer has joined others in calling for new regulations to combat abuses .
He has proposed tougher rules for credit - rating agencies , even changing the way they are paid so they are compensated by investors , not by the companies they are evaluating .
He has said he is open to imposing regulations on hedge funds , which currently operate with limited government oversight .
The group , B'Tselem , said the incident was filmed during Israel 's November 5 demolition of homes built by Palestinians without permission from the Jerusalem Municipality
BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) --
For much of my life , the name Bernie Madoff has meant nothing to me .
Now , however , it means far more than it should in my household and countless others across America .
In my household , the net effect of the Madoff scheme is that my wife has lost all the money in her 401 ( k ) account and her job as well .
But that 's only part of the story .
She worked at a private foundation that shut its doors last Friday , its assets -- all of which were " managed " by Madoff 's firm -- frozen by court order .
The head of the Robert I. Lappin Charitable Foundation spent his hard - earned money on a cause that affected thousands of people who lived in the Jewish community north of Boston .
And now , that cause -- in the absence of anyone or any group of people and organizations stepping up -- will become a memory instead of a legacy .
Red flags missed
My personal story with Madoff begins this way .
Some years ago , my wife signed up for a 401 ( k ) at work .
I did n't pay much attention to her retirement account until earlier this year , after the 2007 year - end performance numbers were reported .
Her account was up , not significantly but more than other retirement accounts .
Curious , I tried to learn more about her employer 's 401 ( k ) plan provider , the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC .
Unfortunately , I found little information about the firm on its Web site , nor on the Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA )
Web sites .
So , I dropped the matter , failing to take note of what , in retrospect , was one of the red flags .
Read more on what prosecutors say was Madoff 's Ponzi scheme .
Like most 401 ( k ) statements , it listed employee contributions , employer contributions , amount vested , percent increase over the previous period and total value .
But what the statement did n't contain was any footer with the usual legal mumbo jumbo , no mention of SIPC insurance , or the broker - dealer through which securities are cleared , or anything that is normally found on 401 ( k ) statements .
Nor did the statement contain the names of any listed securities or mutual funds .
Fast forward to October of this year .
Her 401 ( k ) statement for the nine months ended September 2008 arrives and once again the account was up 6 % or so -- it 's hard to tell exactly .
Now , I 'm thinking that maybe her 401 ( k ) plan provider is the Joe Kennedy of his time .
He 's the one guy who 's making money in a down market , he 's the guy on the other side of the trade .
He 's the next Bill Miller or Peter Lynch .
In fact , my wife and I even discussed upping her contribution to her 401 ( k ) plan given what 's his name 's success .
Then last Thursday evening I am with two other gentlemen -- a professor and money manager -- at a holiday party .
The money manager asks whether we read the news about Madoff .
No , I say , thinking the name Madoff rings a bell but I can't place it .
The money manager relates the story .
" Madoff , " the professor asks .
" Oh my God , I think my sister has her life savings with that guy , " he says .
He borrows the money manager 's phone to call his sister and returns ashen - faced .
His sister has lost her life savings .
The money manager and I offer the professor our condolences .
I tell him about Securities Investor Protection Corporation and the possibility of his sister getting some of her money back .
But really there are no words of comfort , except " there but for the grace of God go I . "
I return home from the party and tell my wife about the " Madoff story , " about the professor , about how sad he looked , about how terrible it all is on top of everything else .
For whom the bell tolls
Bob , she says , Madoff is the guy who runs our 401( k ) .
Oh s*#t , I say .
The connection is made .
We begin to read the stories on the Wall Street Journal , on MarketWatch , on every media outlet and blog possible .
Does this mean what I think it means , my wife asks .
Yes , I say .
You 've lost everything in your 401 ( k ) .
And then my wife asks the question about the elephant in the room .
What if the foundation 's money was with Madoff ?
My wife emails her boss to no avail .
After a sleepless night , Friday morning arrives .
There 's an email from my wife 's boss with a timestamp of 5 a .m .
My wife rushes to work .
By 10 a.m. , I get a tearful call .
The entire staff has been laid off and all the foundation 's programs have been terminated .
Their money and a lot of other people 's money is gone .
And all because of this guy Madoff , who was n't happy with enough .
In some small way , I feel better knowing that plenty of big - name investors got duped as well .
I 'm angry with myself for not questioning the statements and the performance more closely , for not asking my friends at the SEC or other experts to give things a once over .
But even then , I 'm not sure what good it would have done .
Plenty of people , more important than me , raised red flags to no avail .
With hope , my wife and I will survive this setback .
We may or may not recover her 401 ( k ) money .
She may or may not land the same kind of job .
Oddly , that 's almost irrelevant in the scheme of things .
Thousands upon thousands of people put their trust in someone who did n't deserve that trust .
And the collateral damage caused by that misplaced trust is not yet fully known and may never be fully known .
Read about the lawsuits that are likely to ensue from the Madoff scheme .
" I hope he fries in hell , " the professor writes in an email to me .
And though Bernie Madoff has been a household name for a couple days now , so do I , so do I .
PARIS ( Reuters ) -
The sharp drop in the price of oil is worrying and could hinder investment in the industry , Total Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie said on Sunday .
“ I think it is beginning to get dangerous .
I think that ... we are getting to a level that will brake investment in a sector that is crucial , ” Margerie told LCI television .
He added that recent highs of $ 140 a barrel were excessive , but said oil should cost between $ 80 - $ 90 a barrel to allow the industry to bring much - needed new fields on line .
The price of oil has fallen nearly $ 100 from a record high of more than $ 147 in July , with U.S. light crude for January delivery trading around $ 50 on Friday .
Music bosses have unveiled a revolutionary new recording format that they hope
will help win the war on illegal file sharing which is thought to be costing the
industry millions of dollars in lost revenue .
Nicknamed the ‘ Record ’ , the new format takes the form of a black , vinyl disc
measuring 12 inches in diameter , which must be played on a specially designed
‘ turntable ’ .
“ We can state with absolute certainty that no computer in the world can access
the data on this disc , ” said spokesman Brett Campbell .
“ We are also confident
that no - one is going to be able to produce pirate copies in this format without
going to a heck of a lot of trouble .
This is without doubt the best anti-piracy
invention the music industry has ever seen . ”
As part of the invention ’s rigorous testing process , the designers gave some
discs to a group of teenage computer experts who regularly use file swapping
software such as Limewire and gnutella and who admit to pirating music CDs .
Despite several days of trying , none of them were able to hack into the disc’s
code or access any of the music files contained within it .
“ It ’s like , really big and stuff , ” said Doug Flamboise , one of the testers .
“ I could n’t
get it into any of my drives .
I mean , what format is it ?
Is it , like , from France or
something ? ”
Invention : Teenage computer hackers struggled to access the new disc .
In the new format , raw audio data in the form of music is encoded by physically
etching grooves onto the vinyl disc .
The sound is thus translated into variations
on the disc ’s surface in a process that industry insiders are describing as
‘ completely revolutionary ’ and ‘ stunningly clever . ’
To decode the data stored on the disc , the listener must use a special player which
contains a ‘ needle ’ that runs along the grooves on the record surface , reading the
indentations and transforming the movements back into audio that can be fed
through loudspeakers .
Even Shawn Fanning , the man who invented Napster , admits the new format will
make file swapping much more difficult .
“ I ’ve never seen anything like this , ” he
told reporters .
“ How does it work ? ”
Pirates :
Their days are numbered .
As rumours that a Taiwanese company has been secretly developing a
12 inch wide , turntable - driven , needle - based , firewire drive remain unconfirmed ,
it would appear that the music industry may , at last , have found the pirate - proof
format it has long been searching for .
Prince Harry Racist Video
A three year old video has surface ofduring his Army training .
On it he makes several racist remarks that have caused a firestorm and prompted an apology from the House of Clarence .
The first insult is to an Asian trainee who Harry refers to as " our little Paki friend . "
In another instances , he calls another officer " a f*** ing raghead . "
A spokesman from St. James Palace released the following statement on the Prince 's behalf :
" Prince Harry fully understands how offensive this term can be - and is extremely sorry for any offense his words might cause .
However , on this occasion three years ago , Prince Harry used the term without any malice and as a nickname about a highly popular member of his platoon .
There is no question that Prince Harry was in any way seeking to insult his friend . "
The Prince made waves in 2005 when he dressed in a Nazi uniform for a costume party .
He later made a public apology to Britian 's Jewish community for having offended them .
Prince William had his own embarrassing video - showing the future King of England peeing on a fence .

Six months ago , startup pimp Michael Arrington of TechCrunch put out a call for help on a hardware project , specifically a $ 200 minimalist web tablet .
Lo and behold , his team has made it !
Well , one .
This is technically the second prototype , but the first does n't really bear noting — it barely started , did n't yet resemble the planned project and had a bare - metal accidental Steampunk aesthetic .
This , well , this looks pretty close to the concept .
The machine boots , browses the net , and operates with only a touchscreen and an onscreen keyboard .
Behind the screen is a a Via Nano processor , 1GB of RAM and a 4GB flash drive , running a stock Ubuntu install and a custom WebKit browser ( Konquerer with bigger buttons ? ) .

The whole thing works pretty well , and I have to give Arrington props for pushing the project along this far .
But !
There 's a catch :
We were aiming for $ 200 , it looks like $ 299 is more realistic
and :
The real question for us is whether this project has legs and should go forward towards production units , which is a very big step from a working prototype .
That would require spinning the company off from the blog and building a team around Louis .
It ’s a decision we have n’t made yet .

Yeah , I 'd say " are we going to even make this thing ? " is a " real question " , but even for $ 300 , I kind of hope they do .

TULSA , Okla . —
“ I voted for John McCain and still would , ” said Tim Driskill , in a flatly drawled declaration of certainty that still speaks for many in this place underwhelmed last November by the charms of Barack Obama , then the Democratic nominee for president .
Not a single county in Oklahoma stirred from the orderly phalanx marching behind Mr. McCain , the senator from Arizona who was the Republican nominee , and Mr. Driskill , the owner of an insurance agency in downtown Tulsa , said he was proud to be in those ranks .
Statewide , two out of three voters supported Mr. McCain , the highest percentage in the nation .
But that staunchly Republican , conservative Oklahoma is harder to find now .
While there are countless Mr. Driskills here — and hardly anyone doubts that Mr. McCain would easily win again in a redo of the vote — there are also new fractures and fault lines as some voters have shifted toward accepting what the rest of the country wrought in giving Mr. Obama a lopsided victory .
In interviews in the week leading up to Mr. Obama ’s inauguration , many people here said a tolerant spirit toward his presidency has been hastened , paradoxically , by some of the same groups that voted mostly Republican in the election .
Those include active or former military personnel , and people who identify themselves as evangelical Christians , two groups with traditions of respecting hierarchical order and strong leadership .

I ’ve got an urge to write another introductory tutorial for the Python MCMC package PyMC .
This time , I say enough to the comfortable realm of Markov Chains for their own sake .
In this tutorial , I ’ll test the waters of Bayesian probability .
Now , what better problem to stick my toe in than the one that inspired Reverend Thomas in the first place ?
Let ’s talk about sex ratio .
This is also convenient , because I can crib from Bayesian Data Analysis , that book Rif recommended me a month ago .
Bayes started this enterprise off with a question that has inspired many an evolutionary biologist : are girl children as likely as boy children ?
Or are they more likely or less likely ?
Laplace wondered this also , and in his time and place ( from 1745 to 1770 in Paris ) there were birth records of 241,945 girls and 251,527 boys .
In the USA in 2005 , the vital registration system recorded 2,118,982 male and 2,019,367 female live births [ 1 ] .
I ’ll set up a Bayesian model of this , and ask PyMC if the sex ratio could really be 1.0 .
The simple model of the situation is that there is some number , and every baby flips a biased coin , which says “ be a boy ” with probability and “ be a girl ” with probability .
This model ignores correlations between twins , the biophysics of sperm , the existence of intersex babies , as well as many other things .
All models are wrong , but some are simple examples .
Mathematically , if denotes the number of live births , and denotes the number of boys , the model says
You can think of this as a one parameter model .
If I tell the model , then for any and , the model can tell me the probability .
Now , to answer a question like “ is it possible that ? ” , the Bayesians need some sort of prior distribution on .
Where does this prior come from ?
Maybe I should invoke the “ principle of insufficient reason ” , and say that , since I have no idea , I expect any value between 0 and 1 for , which leads to a uniform distribution on [ 0,1 ] .
But maybe that ’s not an accurate representation of truth ; even before I looked up the numbers quoted above , I would have been shocked to learn that , much more shocked than if you told me that .
But I ’ll hold on to that thought , and go with the uniform prior for now .
In PyMC , it ’s 4 lines to set up this model :
from pymc import * p_b = Uniform ( ' p_b ' , 0.0 , 1.0 ) N_b = Binomial ( ' N_b ' , n=4138349 , p=p_b , value=2118982 , observed =True ) m = Model ( [ p_b , N_b ] )
To see the posterior log- probability for a particular value of , do this :
p_b.value = 0.5 print m.logp
Here is the plot :
This simple example is so simple that you do n’t need any MCMC .
But it would be easy to do some if you did .
mc = MCMC(m ) mc.sample(iter=50000 , burn=10000 ) hist( p_b.trace ( ) )
To return to the thought that I ’ve been holding , I know that .
How can I encode this ?
I could replace my definition of p_b using something like p_b = Uniform ( ' p_b ' , 0.0 , 0.95 ) , but I ’d also be surprised to learn that , so maybe something like p_b = Normal ( ' p_b ' , 0.5 , 0.2 ) is a good way to go .
I do n’t know what the pros would think of that ; they seem to favor an exotic prior , like p_b = Beta ( ' p_b ' , 10 , 10 ) which is “ conjugate ” in this case .
To turn the problem around ( and put it in a context I ’m familiar with from work ) , how concentrated does the prior have to be to model a doctor who believes that despite the evidence ?
For bonus points , with PyMC we can go beyond the work of Bayes , and model the uncertainty in the vital registration system .
These numbers for the USA are probably very close to perfect .
But I would be more skeptical of the accuracy for the 241,945 girls and 251,527 boys recorded during Laplace ’s day .
And how can I represent my skepticism ?
Maybe I ’ll represent it as a normally distributed error with standard deviation 10000 .
from pymc import * p_b = Uniform ( ' p_b ' , 0.0 , 1.0 ) e_N = Normal( 'e_N ' , 0.0 , 1.0/( 10000.0 ) ** 2 ) e_N_b = Normal ( 'e_N_b ' , 0.0 , 1.0/( 10000.0 ) * * 2 ) @potential def likelihood ( N_b=251527 , e_N_b=e_N_b , N=241945+251527 , e_N=e_N , p=p_b ) : return binomial_like ( N_b + e_N_b , N + e_N , p ) mc = MCMC ( [ p_b , N , N_b , likelihood ] )
Easy , right ?
Well , easy to write .
Can you get PyMC to draw believable samples from it ?
I can , but it takes a little longer .
Remember to thin your samples !
The recount of the closest U.S. Senate race in Minnesota history will be directed by a freshman elections chief -- a liberal DFLer who won election two years ago after accusing his Republican predecessor of bringing partisan bias to her official duties .
Secretary of State Mark Ritchie pledges to oversee a fair , accurate and open recount of the nearly 2.9 million ballots in the Senate race .
" Minnesotans have an expectation of a nonpartisan election recount , " Ritchie said late last week .
Yet a fight with partisan overtones is shaping up over the recount of the race between U.S. Sen .
Norm Coleman , a Republican , and Democrat Al Franken .
On Friday , the Coleman campaign questioned the integrity of the vote counting by citing " improbable shifts " in vote tallies that it said benefited Franken .
Ritchie responded by scolding the Coleman campaign for trying " to create a cloud " over the recount and " denigrating the election process . "
Republicans indicate they will be watching Ritchie closely .
" A recount of this magnitude is absolutely huge and it's going to define his time in office , " said Rep. Laura Brod , R - New Prague , a critic of Ritchie .
" The eyes are going to be very heavy on that office and on Secretary Ritchie . "
Ritchie acknowledged that his office will face pressure over the next few weeks , but pledged to resist it .
" People who are the most active have a kind of bias to want to get [ results ] fast , " he said of the recount .
" Election administrators have a bias for wanting it correct , transparent and trusted .
We know there will be pressure for fast , faster , get it done .
We will not be swayed by those demands . "
A recount requires ballot verification by precinct in each county and allows the public and representatives of the candidates to watch .
Disputes over contested ballots go to the state canvassing board , made up of two state Supreme Court justices , two district court judges and chaired by the secretary of state .
Nearly 12,500 handsets will be misplaced , stolen or broken during the Christmas party season
Nearly 12,500 handsets will be misplaced , stolen or broken as the Christmas party season reaches its peak tonight .
The rate at which mobile phones go astray has soared as people use them as cameras at boozy bashes , while an average of 10,000 are left in cabs every month .
But researchers have dubbed today the festive Friday phone fiasco , as it is this year ’s most popular choice for Christmas parties – and potentially reckless behaviour .
An estimated 12,328 phones will be lost during the revelries , and with each one typically costing £ 80 to replace , the bill for missing phones will come to £ 986,301 in just one day .
The poll , by mobile phone service ShoZu , found that people in London , Manchester and Liverpool are most likely to end the evening without their mobile .

The most common symptoms of Candida are sugar and carbohydrate cravings , fatigue after eating , recurring fungal infections , jock itch , vaginal infections , depression , mood swings and an overall " foggy " mental feeling .
In chronic Candida cases , these symptoms can turn even more serious , such as acute kidney infections , insomnia , blurred vision , memory loss , extreme premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) and increased food allergies .
Unfortunately , many of these medical symptoms are mis-diagnosed and treated with medication that can actually make candida worse .
The truth is there are many cases when natural Candida treatments can solve a number of these problems by simply and naturally regulating the amount of Candida in the body .
There are many causes for candida overgrowth , but now this problem is being linked directly to the standard American dietone that is high in carbohydrates .
Candida feeds off sugar , and once eaten all carbohydrates even whole grains are eventually broken down into glucose , a simple sugar .
Excess sugar in the body gives Candida a food source that allows it to grow by leaps and bounds causing many of the undesirable symptoms previously mentioned .
Dr. Janet Hull sites diet as one of the most important means of preventing and overcoming Candida infections .
She suggests avoiding or at least limiting primary dietary causes of Candida : refined sugars , wheat , milk and cheese , alcohol , honey , mushrooms and white vinegar .
Once Candida is under control you can often bring some of these foods back into your diet as an occasional indulgence , but they should not be overeaten .
In addition to diet changes , Dr. Mark Pellegrino also suggests a daily regimin of probiotics and prebiotics , such as acidophilous .
These prevent Candida buildup in the gut by promoting healthy intestinal bacteria .
Taking these supplements is especially important if you are taking thyroid medication or antibiotics .
Be aware there is a common reaction to eliminating excess yeast called Herxheimer 's reaction .
This occurs when the kidneys and liver can't process the amount of Candida dying off all at once .
The symptoms of Herxheimer 's include an aching head and body , chills , dizziness and fatigue .
All of these symptoms subside after a few days when you 're treating Candida .
Die - off symptoms can also be lessened by making lifestyle changes more slowly .

“ I was a playboy .
Do n’t write that ! ” he jokes , grinning .
“ How old do you think I am ?
Wrong .
I ’m 65 !
Do n’t write that !
Write that I am 55 ! ”
His government ID proves his age , and on the back it says , unmistakably : “ Religion : Jewish . ”
He has made contact with a reporter , not because he wants to tell the story of his persecuted community , but because he wants to complain about the landlord who is raising his rent .
“ Because we are Jewish he knows we can do nothing .
He is n’t afraid because he knows we have no tribe here .
Do n’t use my name . ”
Once one of the largest Jewish communities in the Middle East , Baghdad Jews have now nearly vanished while the country has been consumed by sectarian war .
Speaking in fluent English , the ex-accountant launches into a description of the Baghdad of his youth , one of the Muslim world ’s most cosmopolitan cities .
He recites the names of legendary social clubs where Jews , Christians and Muslims mingled in better days , with music and whisky and parties that ran through the night .
“ So many people -- Muslim people -- say if the Jewish people come back it will be nicer , ” he says .
His family have left .
Some are in London , some in the United States .
His father was offered a chance to move to Canada , but turned it down because he wanted to die and be buried in Iraq .
The ex-accountant himself stayed , but if he can sell his father ’s house -- now a ruin bombed out in the Iran war in the 1980s -- he will finally leave .
“ I want to sell the house and go .
I like Iraq , but I am fed up .
We had very nice times in Iraq , but now we do n’t like it . ”
Iraq ’s Jewish community dates from biblical times .
According to Charles Tripp ’s History of Iraq , the country was home to 117,000 Jews in 1947 .
Under Ottoman rule , well into the first half of the 20th century , Jews made up about a fifth of the population of the capital .
Some of the villas in neighborhoods along the Tigris still have six - pointed stars of David in their stucco .
How many Jews are there now ?
“ We know them all , ” says the ex-accountant , counting .
There ’s the ex-accountant himself , plus the nephew with whom he shares a rented house in Baghdad ’s central Karrada district .
There ’s the man who lives near them , the man who leads the community , the very old woman , the male doctor and the female dentist .
And the man whose brother was a goldsmith .
The goldsmith married the dentist a few years ago .
A few months later , he was abducted by gunmen .
“ They came to his house and took him .
He disappeared .
They left his car , they left his mobile .
They just took him . ”
So that leaves eight .
Eight Jews left .
The synagogue in central Baghdad has been boarded up since 2003 .
The ex-accountant occasionally runs into some of the other Jews on the street , but confesses he is n’t much for religion .
“ We do n’t know how to pray , ” he says .
“ Hebrew books we have everywhere in the synagogue , but we do n’t know how to read it .
Some words I know .
The important one is Adonai .
Adonai is God .
We believe in God . ”
In the old days , Jews were an integral part of Iraqi life .
A relative of the ex-accountant was finance minister decades ago .
But beginning in the late 1940s , successive Arab governments accused Baghdad ’s Jews of supporting Zionism .
Some were jailed , others were barred from government posts , and thousands upon thousands left for Israel or the West .
By the time of Saddam Hussein ’s fall , the ex-accountant estimates there were only a few dozen Jews left .
Western organizations came and evacuated most of the rest .
“ A woman called Rachel , she came here took some of them to the Jewish community in London , I think , ” he said .
In 2003 , he went to the Green Zone to meet a cousin who was born in the United States and had come to Iraq to work for the U.S. - run administration .
The American woman was shocked when her mother put them in touch .
“ She said : incredible !
You are still here ?
She did not know she had a cousin in Iraq , ” he said .
Apart from his quarrel with his landlord , the ex-accountant says he has had few problems with the neighbors , most of whom do n’t know he is Jewish , some of whom do n’t care .
“ Somebody says ‘ You are Christian ’ , I do n’t say anything .
Somebody says ‘ You are Muslim ’ , I do n’t say anything .
I think most people think we are Christian because they do n’t know there are still Jews in Iraq . ”
Australian job losses spread to mining sector
By Terry Cook
23 December 2008
After thousands of job losses across the financial and banking sector , the impact of the global economic crisis is spreading to other sections of the Australian economy , with almost daily reports of layoffs or closures .
While the latest Bureau of Statistics employment data estimated that 15,600 jobs were eliminated during November , sending the jobless rate up from 4.3 to 4.4 percent , these figures do not yet register the scale of job destruction that has commenced .
In particular , mine workers have joined those paying the price for the international meltdown , highlighting the end of the mining boom on which Australian capitalism has heavily depended .
Nearly 700 mining job cuts were announced last week — bringing the total since June to 4,400 — and one of the biggest companies , Rio Tinto , put another 630 workers on notice .
First , Macarthur Coal , a specialist in pulverised coal , announced it would lay off 180 fulltime staff and contractors from its Moorvale and Coppabella mines in northern Queensland , citing an " unprecedented reduction in coal sales over recent months " .
Next , Anglo - Swiss miner Xstrata said it would suspend longwall mining at its Oaky No 1 underground coking coal mine in Queensland 's Bowen Basin and slash 190 contract and 40 permanent jobs in response to " reduced market demand " .
A third company , OZ Minerals , shed 135 contract workers from its Century zinc mine near Lawn Hill in north - west Queensland — 14 percent of the company 's workforce in the region .
A company spokesman said the operation was in " survival mode " and further layoffs could follow .
OZ Minerals , which is faced with refinancing more than $ 800 million in debt due by December 31 , also declared it would close its nickel mine at Avebury in Tasmania at the cost of around 190 jobs — 64 direct employees and 125 employed by mining contractor Barminco .
Rio Tinto put 630 workers at the Northparkes copper mine in NSW on notice , giving the first indication of where the 14,000 worldwide job cut it announced last week will hit in Australia .
Thousands more Rio workers across the country are waiting to hear whether their jobs will be eliminated .
The company has coal , alumina and bauxite operations in Queensland , iron ore operations in Western Australia , a Northern Territory bauxite mine and coal mines in New South Wales .
A week earlier , Xstrata announced it was shedding 200 jobs at its McArthur River zinc mine in the Northern Territory , about half of the mine 's workforce .
In all mining areas , contractors are warning that more cuts are expected as production is wound back .
Other recent mine job losses include 220 at Canadian - owed GBS Gold — the company 's gold mines in the Northern Territory will close this week , owing creditors around $ 100 million .
Norilsk Nickel shut its Waterloo and Silver Swan operations in Kalgoorlie , Western Australia at the cost of 100 jobs and 10 jobs went at the Maxwell gold mine at Inglewood after it went into voluntary administration owing more than $ 1 million to unsecured creditors .
The job cuts will devastate many mining communities and have a broader fallout throughout industry .
Pointing to the flow - on effects , Professor John Rolfe , an expert on regional economics at Central Queensland University in Rockhampton , warned : " For every job in mining there are six jobs created . "
Just last week , South Australian company Boart Longyear , which supplies drilling services and products to the mining industry , said it planned to shed a further 67 staff , on top of the 55 job cuts announced two months ago .
Citing sharp falls in aluminium prices , Portland Aluminium announced at the end of last month it would cut production at its smelter by 5 percent a year , around 15,000 tonnes , and slash 20 positions .
It is clear that much worse is to come .
Steel production in China is down more than 12 percent since November last year while Japanese mills have begun to idle blast furnaces on a temporary basis — a measure that the big steelmakers have avoided since 2002 .
Meanwhile , job cuts in Australian manufacturing are accelerating .
According to the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union , the sector has already lost 38,000 jobs over the past 12 months .
Car producers have shed hundreds of jobs and the knock - on effect is hitting parts suppliers .
Last month , Teson Trims axed 126 jobs at its Mitcham and Euroa plants in Victoria and last week Nissan Casting Plant Australia announced it would axe 50 jobs from the 203 - strong workforce at its aluminium casting plant in Dandenong , Victoria .
Ballarat - based brake pad manufacturer FMP Group , which primarily exports to car makers in the US , is cutting 50 jobs from its staff of 350 .
Military engineering company Thales Australia said it would slash 50 jobs at its Bendigo plant by January .
Another 125 jobs were lost at John Valves , in Ballarat after the company went into liquidation this month .
Silicon Graphics closed its research and development centre in Camberwell , Victoria at the cost of about 30 jobs .
French - owned company Chargeurs cut a further 16 jobs from its wool processing operations at Bomen in the Riverina this month .
The company once employed 250 people .
Around 50 bakery jobs will be axed at Maypole Foods ' Glenorchy operations in Tasmania .
Over 150 jobs will be slashed at Huyck Wangner 's factory in Geelong , when it ends operations in March next year .
The factory produces covers for paper - making machines .
This week , Australia 's largest luxury boat builder Gold Coast - based Riviera laid off more than 120 staff on top of the 200 shed over recent months .
The company has been hit by a sharp drop in demand of luxury boats as credit tightens and by the plunging value of the Australian dollar .
Retail employment has also started to fall , despite the Christmas period traditionally being the busiest time of the year .
The latest Bureau of Statistics figures show that retail jobs decreased by 21,200 , or 1.4 percent , in the three months to the end of the November .
Last week , Australia 's biggest online entertainment retailer EzyDVD went into receivership , putting a question mark over the future of 70 full - time staff in South Australia and about 150 casual employees nationally .
Giving an indicator of what is to come in the New Year , the number of jobs in the wholesale trade , which is the back end of the retail sector , declined by 5 percent , or 23,200 jobs , in the November quarter .
Overall , the Bureau of Statistics figures lag well behind the rapid deterioration in the economic situation — for example they report that mining jobs still increased by nearly 5 percent in the November quarter .
Job cuts are still continuing at the fastest rate in the finance and banking sector , with a fall of employment of 5.5 percent , or 22,500 jobs in the November quarter .
Last week , the ANZ bank said it would axe a further 620 jobs before September next year , on top of the 800 middle - management jobs it announced would be shed before the end of this month .
Media reports last week are tipping that Macquarie Bank will slash another 600 jobs on top of the 200 it announced last month .
State governments have begun slashing jobs as falling mining royalties and other tax revenues send their budgets into deficit .
South Australia last week foreshadowed 1,400 job cuts , and the NSW government previously pledged in an emergency mini-budget to cull 4,000 public sector jobs .
A survey of employers by consultants Hay Group , released this month , confirmed that many more cuts are in the pipeline throughout the economy .
The survey found that 17 percent of companies were planning to sack staff and 27 percent were planning to stop new hirings , tripling the result in the firm 's March survey .
None of these figures include the wider impact of reduced working hours , cancelled shifts for casual workers , and losses of overtime , all of which can spell financial ruin for working class families .
Forgotten Detroit
www.forgottendetroit.com
Detroit is known for one of the most stunning collections of pre-depression architecture in the world .
The past two decades have seen several of these treasures sit vacant , waiting for economic revival .
On these pages you will find information about the past , present , and future situations of a few of these landmarks .
It is my hope that this information helps you gain an appreciation for the importance of both the history and continued survival of these buildings .
Cruelty against cats is increasing in Guangdong , China , where over 10,000 domesticated cats are eaten daily .
The cats , some of which are apparently being stolen from people ’s houses , are transported in small cages to restaurants in the town where they are then cooked , often while they are still alive .
Activists in China are taking a stronger stance against this cruelty , and have begun demonstrating in Beijing against the treatment of cats used for food .
40 people , many of them elders who care for orphaned cats , protested outside of the Guangdong office in Beijing .
A butcher from the province plans to continue using cat meat as the main ingredient in the region ’s famous soup , which also includes chicken and dog .
She blew the protests off , saying “ Cats have a strong flavor . ”
The animals are likely to continue being used as food , as the Chinese , and the Cantonese in particular , are known for their adventurous taste buds .
[ social_buttons ]
But even if cats remain a food source in China , the abhorrent treatment of them must cease .
Stealing companion animals from peoples ’ homes and skinning them alive is something that would never be tolerated in many other countries , regardless of the type of animal .
With outcry like this , and with landmark animal welfare legislation such as California ’s Proposition 2 passing , it is obvious that people are making the connection between the animals we see as “ pets ” and the animals we see as food sources .
Maybe this awareness will even cause more people to make the switch the vegetarianism ?

Southeast Francesca
Lane cuts up and around a hillside to reveal the boom - time promise of Happy Valley circa 2006 .
Young families rolled in to snap up $ 600,000 , stone - fronted homes with Mount Hood views .
They came for the country meets cul - de- sac life , solid schools and a 4,000 - square - foot edition of the American dream .
Speculators trailed on their heels for the next get - rich - quick venture .
Francesca Lane circa 2008 is n't dreamy any longer .
One of every five homes or lots on the street has fallen into foreclosure since the neighborhood sprang up three years ago .
The street offers a grim picture of how greed dragged Happy Valley , Oregon and even the world into financial turmoil .
Francesca
Lane is where the country 's gamble on high - risk mortgages inflated home values , then crashed down on the freshly manicured lawns .
All sides contributed .
A builder who pumped out more high - end homes than the town 's buyers demanded .
Mortgage lenders who ditched traditional standards with subprime loans , no down payments and 11 percent interest rates .
Speculators who banked on climbing home prices .
Buyers who took on more home than their pay stubs said they could afford .
The collapse has fallen on the mighty and tiny .
The king of Happy Valley homebuilders , Roger Pollock and his Buena Vista Custom Homes , faces a foreclosure lawsuit on two Francesca Lane lots .
Dick and Aloma Anderson , a retired couple from Clark County , gambled that they could flip a Francesca Lane home for a quick profit .
Now , their retirement wo n't be quite as golden .
Portland 's housing market has generally avoided the deep pain found in fast - growing Southwest cities or economically stagnant Detroit .
Yet Happy Valley -- along with Clark County and central Oregon provides a local example of the California - style ' burb boomtown gone bust .
The suburb that should be so upbeat is infected with plunging home values , 675 empty lots carved into hillsides and 35 half - finished homes soaking in the rain .
To the most macabre , Happy Valley is known as Death Valley and its slopes as Foreclosure Hills .
Across the Portland area , home prices actually rose in the first nine months of 2008 compared with the same period in 2006 .
But in Happy Valley 's main ZIP code , prices fell 24 percent .
The foreclosure rate of 1.7 percent is double the regional average .
The ramifications are broad .
Happy Valley 's vast supply of unsold homes and lots will suppress values across the east side for months , if not years , to come .
" It was the next dot - com , " says Jeff Tabler , 40 , who bought a discounted Francesca Lane home at an auction in January .
" Anyone who thought they could speculate on it did speculate on it .
" These people were into the concept of making money , and it just got out of hand . "
Farmers fought growth
It seems implausible today , but Happy Valley incorporated as the anti-city to halt growth .
By the 1960s , the city of Portland had steamed eastward , and Happy Valley 's small farmers fretted that their community would be overrun by asphalt .
The city of Happy Valley
• Founded : 1965
• Population : 10,380 in 2007
• Growth : 129 percent between 2000 and 2007 , making it Oregon 's fastest growing city
They formed the city of Happy Valley in 1965 .
For the next three decades , James Robnett held the mayor 's seat , but his title might as well have been growth gatekeeper .
The town lacked a sewer pipe to absorb new homes , and Robnett was n't about to build one .
Oregon won national acclaim for clamping down on distant sprawl by sending growth to places close to the big city like Happy Valley .
Yet Robnett and his supporters riled regional planners by holding onto their rural resistance .
Capitalism eventually overpowered .
Grocery stores and strip malls rolled out Southeast Sunnyside Road and brought a sewer pipe to the city 's border .
A younger , more growth - friendly group won City Council seats and voted out Robnett in 1995 .
Five years later , regional planners got their way as Happy Valley agreed to open a vast hillside above Sunnyside Road to subdivisions .
To serve the hill , the city replaced a remote farm - to - market road with a tree - lined boulevard that became Southeast 152nd Avenue .
The new road eventually paved the way for Francesca Lane .
By 2003 , the table for growth was set .
That 's when Roger Pollock arrived carrying plans to house the next generation .
A brash builder with a plan
Happy Valley had never seen anything like Pollock and Pollock had never seen anything like Happy Valley .
The town was so quiet it would n't allow a grocery store in its trademark hollow for fear of attracting too much commercial buzz .
Residents prized their oversize lots , custom - built homes and pastoral scene .
Pollock , on the other hand , is a brash , bleached - blond , chain - smoking , fast - talking builder .
He arrived with a business model to stamp out tract homes as fast as anyone .
He favored oversize homes for relatively undersize prices .
His homes attracted young , growing families but conflicted with the town 's more stately image .
" If the city had its choice of a builder , Roger Pollock would not have been their first choice , " says Gene Grant , the town 's former mayor .
Sipping bottled water at a Starbucks near town recently , Pollock describes Happy Valley as a suburban utopia with the polish of a new city and the quaintness of an old farm town .
Wide , freshly paved streets .
Easy freeway access .
Sweeping views .
Happy Valley has become the Generation Y hot spot while Beaverton -- the baby boomers ' boomtown -- looked worn out and traffic - choked .
" It is an incorporated town inside a bigger city , not unlike Beverly Hills , " Pollock , 47 , says without a touch of sarcasm .
Pollock took out bank loans to buy nearly every lot primed for new homes .
" I did n't have a monopoly , but I owned all the lots , " he says , chuckling .
Facing stiff competition starting in 2003 , Pollock agreed to pay about $ 128,000 a lot when the going rate was $ 115,000 .
He knew he overpaid but presumed he'd make the money back as values climbed .
In some cases , Pollock says , he resold lots for as much as $ 225,000 .
But he kept most to build on himself .
Pollock 's Happy Valley projects propelled Buena Vista Custom Homes into the nation 's fastest - growing homebuilding business , trade journal Builder Magazine declared in 2005 .
That year , his homebuilding machine rolled onto Francesca Lane on that hillside above Sunnyside Road .
By summer 2006 , the Portland housing market was boiling over .
Prices rocketed up 30 percent in two years , more than double the historical pattern .
That 's when Aloma and Dick Anderson showed up on Francesca Lane .
House flips retirees
The Andersons arrived after reading news stories about Happy Valley 's charm .
The couple lived a comfortable retirement in Clark County 's Hazel Dell neighborhood afforded by Social Security and their public employee pensions .
Dick , 70 , retired after a career teaching at the Washington State School for the Blind .
Aloma , 66 , stayed home to raise the couple 's three children and worked for a while at Clark College in Vancouver .
Both came from Minnesota and clung to Midwestern values .
" We 've never had a negative thing on our credit .
We were one of those people with a 770 credit score , " Aloma says while rocking in a chair in her living room in Hazel Dell , the clothes dryer humming in the other room .
Still , Aloma saw opportunity in Happy Valley 's hills .
The couple had never bought an investment property .
But by 2006 , flipping houses had become so common nationwide that TV networks celebrated it with reality shows .
Aloma was certain they could buy a home , resell it for a hefty profit and pad their retirement .
That 's how they ended up on Francesca Lane in winter 2006 .
The Andersons saw a fleet of construction vans and heard nail guns popping .
After talking to a salesman representing Buena Vista , they picked a lot with a yard a family could ramble around .
Aloma says the salesman told them the home would be worth as much as $ 1 million by the time it was finished in the summer .
They never hired their own real estate broker .
They closed the deal in August 2006 on the four - bedroom , 5,000 - square - foot home for $ 633,865 .
It was a steal , they figured , at $ 125 a square foot .
" We thought it was a very simple situation .
Good value , good ambience , " Aloma says .
The Andersons bought the home with a no-money - down loan and an 8.5 percent adjustable interest rate from Hyperion Capital Group of Lake Oswego .
That added a $ 5,000 monthly payment on top of the $ 1,500 for their Hazel Dell home .
Within weeks , Aloma put the house on Craigslist for $ 799,000 .
She planned to sell it herself and made the 35 - minute drive most Saturdays to host open houses .
She 'd stay for seven hours and usually saw no one , a signal the market boom had wilted .
She lowered the price to $ 749,000 .
Even after a year , she still had no offer .
The Andersons refinanced their Hazel Dell home twice to raise cash for the Happy Valley mortgage .
In late 2007 , they raided their IRA .
Still no offers .
By then , the nation 's housing market had tumbled as subprime mortgage lenders went belly up .
Pollock expected things would get much worse , and he cut his losses .
He announced an auction in December 2007 to sell 230 homes , including some on Francesca Lane , at bargain prices .
His move drove down home values across the city .
" When he did that to us , it killed us , " Aloma says .
She mailed her last payment in January , and the lender declared the mortgage in default three months later .
Staring at a loan far higher than the home 's value , the Andersons faced losing the home to the bank .
A real estate broker found the Andersons a bargain hunter .
The lender approved the sale for $ 515,000 .
That 's $ 123,000 less than it had loaned the Andersons 20 months earlier .
The Andersons never spent a night in the Happy Valley money pit .
But the mortgage , fees and taxes cost them close to $ 100,000 .
" We did everything we thought we could , " Aloma says .
Looking back , seeing differently
Pollock 's once high - flying company has nearly dissolved .
He has reduced his staff from 50 to two and halted new construction .
Buena Vista stopped paying its loan and property taxes on the two Francesca Lane lots because Pollock said they were " nonperforming assets . "
He hopes to sell the lots , but for now the builder owes Clackamas County $ 12,170 for three years ' worth of taxes .

Looking back on the bust , Pollock says the plunging market , not his auction , drove down Happy Valley 's values .
About the Andersons , he says his sales staff never would have suggested their home would be worth close to $ 1 million .
" Everybody always needs somebody to blame , " Pollock says .
Pollock 's company made millions on Happy Valley 's growth .
How much ?
" I do n't want to tell you , " Pollock says as he steers his black Cadillac Escalade through the town and takes a drag on a Camel Light .
" I 'll get in trouble . "
He 'll say only that he sold 600 homes or lots in the boom and that he expects to build again in Happy Valley when the market recovers .
Pollock spends part of his time now building a resort in Mexico near Cabo San Lucas and still has his 19,000 - square - foot Dunthorpe house .
But the housing downturn , he says , has taken its toll on him , too .
" It 's really tough paying the bills .
I 'm not immune , " he says .
" Stressed ?
Yes .
Worried ?
I believe in myself .
I know it will work out . "
With hindsight , Aloma Anderson painfully diagnoses her mistakes .
" I saw dollar signs , " she says .
She says she should have hired her own real estate broker for expert advice .
" That was our mistake .
My mistake , " Aloma says , hanging her head , blinking back tears .
The couple would like to sell their Hazel Dell home to move closer to family in the Midwest .
But the Clark County market is about as bad as Happy Valley's .
Their builder , Pacific Lifestyle Homes , is now bankrupt .
The home was appraised for $ 465,000 last year .
Now , she 'd take $ 379,000 .
After all this mess , the Andersons had to tell their children they can't help out with money any longer .
" That 's a hard thing to tell them , " Aloma says .
" We do n't have it anymore . "
Along Francesca Lane , it 's difficult to see the imprint left by foreclosures .
The street , and most of Happy Valley , remains a tidy , typical bedroom community .
But look closer and you see signs .
The Francesca Lane homes that fell into foreclosure resold for 80 percent or less of their original purchase prices .
Pete Herder , who lives across from two foreclosures , figures his home has lost 15 percent of its value .
Down the hillside , half - finished homes line a couple of streets in a more upscale subdivision .
" They 're just waiting for arson , " Herder says .
Contractors canvass the hillsides for homes like these .
They call on the banks -- now the homeowners -- for fix - up work to seal out the winter rain .
Before anyone could block them out , birds took over one vacant house on a bluff nearby and turned it into the city 's biggest birdhouse .

Farms to take heat out of warming
By Richard Black
Environment correspondent , BBC News website
Some varieties of crop are more reflective than others Farmers could help curb rising global temperatures by selecting crop varieties that reflect solar energy back into space , researchers say .
Scientists at Bristol University calculate that switching crops in North America and Europe could reduce global temperatures by about 0.1C .
Temperatures have risen by about 0.7C since the dawn of the industrial age .
Other experts say the idea is feasible but could not cool the world enough to combat rising greenhouse gas levels .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) projects that by the end of the century , the average global temperature will have risen by 1.8- 4.0C from 1990 levels .
The scientists behind the new research suggest that compared to other engineering concepts for curbing temperature rise , the farming switch would probably have no downside and would be easy to do .
It should n't cause anybody to think we can slow up our efforts to stop dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
Professor Ken Caldeira
" There 's lots of talk about whether we can build sunscreens in space or pump aerosols into the atmosphere , " Bristol 's Andy Ridgewell told BBC News .
" But these schemes require trillions of dollars of investment in infrastructure and it seems unlikely we 'll get round to it .
" Whereas farming already has a global infrastructure and it's done each year , so it should be relatively simple to utilise it to provide a climate benefit . "
On reflection
The principle , expounded in the scientific journal Current Biology , is certainly simple enough .
Some crop varieties are naturally more reflective than others .
A field of more reflective leaves will send more solar energy back into space than a field of a more absorbent variety .
Most of the data on this has come from satellites that monitor albedo - reflectivity - across the planet 's surface .
Dr Ridgewell acknowledged that more research needed to be done on which varieties would prove most suitable to the task .
Satellites can give a remarkably detailed view of crop cover
It would be natural to think that a plant that absorbs a greater proportion of the incoming solar energy would produce a higher yield .
But that does not appear to be borne out in practice , according to another of the scientists involved , Bristol University botany professor Alistair Hetherington .
" Having said that , however , we would want to repeat and extend all these experiments , " he told BBC News .
" But another possibility for the future would be to produce a [ leaf ] surface that differs in reflectivity at different wavelengths , so it could selectively absorb wavelengths involved in photosynthesis . "
This might be possible either through intensive plant breeding or genetic engineering , he said .

One downside to the idea is that it only works with crops grown in Europe and North America , according to Andy Ridgewell 's computer modelling .
In the Asian growing season , he explained , most of the reflection is done by clouds , so changing the ground 's albedo would have little impact .
The corollary of that is that most of the temperature reduction would happen over North America , Europe and neighbouring regions such as western Russia , and would be concentrated in the summer , when the net regional cooling could be as much as 1C .
But with the IPCC forecasting a greater number of summer heatwaves over Europe , the continent 's politicians might see the concept as desirable , the researchers believe .
Ken Caldeira from the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University , California , has analysed many different potential climate " fixes " ; and he suggested the approach seemed feasible , especially given other research indicating that conversion of dark forests to lighter - coloured croplands during the settlement of North America might have lowered temperatures by about 1C .
A quick fix for global warming But , he said : " This kind of approach can never be quantitatively important on a global scale .
" It could help marginally in certain places but it should n't cause anybody to think we can slow up our efforts to stop dumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . "
Another obvious question with the approach is how to persuade farmers to make crop choices that might impact on their income , if they were asked to adopt strains that fetched less at market .
One way would be to allow farmers to gain carbon credits for making a reflective choice , although Professor Caldeira suggested " starting to price albedo could open up a whole can of worms " .
But for Andy Ridgewell , rewards such as those the EU offers to stimulate the growing of biofuel crops would be one way to incentivise farmers - and this approach should not generate any of the same problems that biofuels raise , he suggested .
" You certainly would n't have to replace food crops , so food production should n't be affected by our idea , " he said .
Most engineering " fixes " do not address a separate problem posed by the build - up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - the acidity change in the oceans , which is likely to impact marine organisms such as coral and molluscs .

Spanish has replaced German as the second most popular language learnt in schools , it was revealed yesterday .
And the number of state schools offering Mandarin as an option has more than trebled in the past two years from one in 25 to more than one in seven .
The figures are revealed in the annual census of secondary schools compiled by the Centre for Information on Languages Teaching , which also shows that the dramatic decline in languages since it was made optional for 14 to 16 - year - olds has halted for the first time .
However , there has been no increase in take - up .
The census also suggests a revolution in the language options offered in secondary schools .
The figures show 75 per cent of state schools are now offering Spanish compared with 67 per cent offering German .
French remains the most popular language , with 99 per cent offering it .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The number of schools offering Italian has doubled in the past two years from 9 per cent to 18 per cent while Mandarin has risen from 4 per cent to 14 per cent .
Last night , language experts said they believed TV's " obsession " with programmes about the Second World War had contributed to the decline in take - up of German .
Linda Parker , director of the Association for Language Learners , said : " You can always find Hitler on the TV .
I think German is seen as a difficult language to learn – yet that is n't necessarily the case .
Children do n't see it as an exciting or interesting language and the culture does n't appeal to them . "
Teresa Tinsley , director of communications at CILT , added : " I 've certainly heard German teachers say ' not another programme about Hitler ' . "
She said businesses feared the demise of German because the country is one of the UK 's largest non-English speaking trading partners .
By contrast , Spain was seen as a " language of leisure " – useful for holiday destinations , she said .
Languages take - up in state schools mirrors what has been happening in the independent sector – where Spanish had already taken over from German as the second language .
However , after an initial spurt in Mandarin , the numbers have slightly declined this year .
Even so , 28 per cent of private schools offer it .
Overall , the figures show the number of youngsters taking a modern foreign language at GCSE fell again this summer to 44 per cent .
However , a census taken by CILT in September revealed they were now holding up for the first time since the decline started seven years ago .
Pupils were also opting for different types of qualifications – such as the new Asset qualifications which offer youngsters the chance to study for a language grade – in the same way as they can do for music .
A breakdown of the figures reveals there is still a class dividein the take - up of languages – with 78 per cent of state schools saying it was now optional at GCSE and only 18 per cent of private schools .
Grammar schools and specialist language colleges featured heavily in the 22 per cent of state schools which still made the subject compulsory at GCSE .
Only a handful of comprehensive schools were included in this list .
It may seem like you 're always reading about foods that can help protect you from cancer .
But what if you already have cancer ?
Can any foods help you then ?
Everyone likely benefits from eating plant - based foods .
To add more fruits and vegetables to your diet :
Food and Cancer Treatment
So far , experts do n't recommend foods as a way to kill cancer cells .
One piece of promising news is garlic may neutralize carcinogens , possibly causing cancer cells to self - destruct .
“ Unfortunately , there is no single food that will cure cancer .
Still , what you eat is very important , ” says Veronica McLymont , PhD , RD , director of food and nutrition services at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center .
While you ’re treated for cancer , eat a variety of healthy foods to give your body all the nutrients it needs .
Evidence is n’t conclusive , but experts believe that a healthy diet may improve your chance of recovery .
If you drink alcohol and are starting cancer treatment , talk with your doctor about it .
Alcohol can interact with some cancer therapies .
American investor George Soros said he would like to see Washington put $ 300 to $ 600 billion more into the $ 700 billion U.S. economic bailout package , the German magazine Der Spiegel reported in an advance of Monday 's edition .
The weekly quoted the billionaire as saying that the United States needs a bigger economic program than the existing Troubled Asset Relief Program package to accommodate American cities and states with the money they need to get out of the financial turbulence , and that the country needs an infrastructure investment program .
Soros also criticized U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson for not seeing the economic crisis earlier .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Bank of America will get another $ 20 billion from the U.S. government 's bailout fund , with federal guarantees for another $ 118 billion in mortgage - backed securities on its balance sheets , the Treasury Department announced early Friday .
Bank of America recently bought ailing Merrill Lynch .
The new arrangement provides additional capital for Bank of America in exchange for preferred stock with an 8 percent dividend , the Treasury , the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced in a joint statement .
Bank of America has agreed to restrictions on executive pay and will be expected to adjust mortgages for troubled borrowers .
The FDIC will also extend its temporary loan guarantee program , which insures some debt beyond current limits , in exchange for expanded lending to consumers , senior government officials told reporters in a midnight briefing on the plan .
The deal also provides a backstop in case of " unusually large losses " on assets backed by real - estate loans .
Most are being absorbed by Bank of America in its buyout of brokerage house Merrill Lynch , a $ 50 billion acquisition in the works since September .
The assets will remain on the company 's books , the feds said .
The $ 20 billion in funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) -- the $ 700 billion bailout fund created by Congress in October -- should be transferred to Bank of America later Friday , according to one of the officials .
They did not say whether other troubled banks will need similar assistance .
" Each time we do one of these , we hope it 's the last one we will ever have to do , " one said .
Bank of America 's shares fell 18.4 percent Thursday and have tumbled 36 percent so far this week .
The company declined to comment .
Bank of America , which has already received $ 15 billion in government capital , including $ 10 billion set aside for Merrill Lynch , reportedly first approached the Treasury Department for help last month as losses mounted at the failing Wall Street firm .
Government officials agreed to step in to avoid the merger 's collapse , which would further roil the financial system .
The purchase , which was announced hours before Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in mid-September , closed January 1 .
Merrill Lynch 's losses could top $ 10 billion , the Journal reported .
The deal would mark the second time the federal government has had to step in again to prop up a faltering financial institution .
In November , officials injected another $ 20 billion into Citigroup , which had already received $ 25 billion , and agreed to backstop more than $ 300 billion in troubled assets .
Under the terms of the Citigroup rescue package , the bank would be on the hook for the first $ 29 billion in losses on the covered assets , which includes mostly loans backed by residential and commercial mortgages .
It would cover 10 % of losses above that amount , with the government shouldering the rest .
The Treasury Department has less than $ 60 billion left to inject into banks under its capital purchase program .
President - elect Barack Obama on Thursday secured access to the $ 350 billion remaining in the federal bailout package , after a measure that would have blocked the funds ' release failed in the Senate .
Some say banks are likely to get additional capital infusions this year .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Tuesday that the government must pump more money into troubled financial institutions and that further guarantees of their debt could be necessary .
Bank of America , which had been viewed as one of the strongest banks in the country , may be buckling as the nation 's economy worsens .
Also , several key Merrill Lynch executives recently departed the merged firm .
The Charlotte , North Carolina - based bank has also taken over two ailing companies that thrust it deeper into the most troubled sectors of the financial system .
Not only did it take a big gamble on its $ 24 billion acquisition of the faltering brokerage titan , but it also bought battered mortgage lender Countrywide Financial early last year .
Analysts are rapidly reducing their estimates for the bank , with some even expecting a loss .
Citigroup is expected to report a whopping loss Friday , while JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) said its profits plummet 76 % Thursday .
Bank of America is expected to report higher charge - offs for uncollectible debts , increased loan reserves and greater trading losses , wrote Richard X. Bove , analyst with Ladenburg Thalmann .
He reduced his estimates to $ 0.68 per share from $ 1.14 per share on Wednesday .
Merrill Lynch is expected to shave 15 cents off Bank of America 's 2009 earnings , wrote Jeff Harte , analyst with Sandler O'Neill & Partners , who predicts the bank will report a 2 - cent loss for the quarter .
" The acquisition of [ Merrill Lynch ] significantly increases [ Bank of America 's ] exposure to currently depressed capital markets - related revenues , " Harte wrote .
Bank of America already announced it plans to shed up to 35,000 jobs over the next three years as it integrates the Wall Street firm .
Chief Executive Ken Lewis gave up his 2008 bonus last week .

The Animal Legal Defense Fund has released a new report showing that while animal welfare laws have made great progress in recent years , five states lag far behind .
The only annual report of its kind in the nation , the ALDF ranks all fifty states , the District of Columbia , and other U.S. territories for the general comprehensiveness and relative strength of their respective animal protection laws .
Their research determined that Arkansas , Idaho , Kentucky , Mississippi , and North Dakota are the five states where it ’s easiest to be an animal abuser without legal repercussion .
[ social_buttons ]
The states at the bottom of the animal protection list have legislative issues such as severely restricted or absent felony animal cruelty provisions , inadequate animal fighting provisions , and lack of restrictions on the future ownership of animals for those convicted of cruelty to animals .
While states like Arkansas show signs of improvement with upcoming animal protection legislation , states like Kentucky are still under fire for issues such as animal cruelty in the Kentucky County animal shelter system .
“ This year we see many states and territories that are continuing to make outstanding progress with their laws .
Unfortunately , there are still many places where the laws are incapable of providing the legal protections that our country ’s animals need and deserve , ” says Stephan Otto , Animal Legal Defense Fund ’s director of legislative affairs and author of the report .
On the other end of the spectrum , this year ’s “ best five for animals ” list remains unchanged from the 2007 list , with California , Illinois , Maine , Michigan and Oregon demonstrating through their laws the strongest commitment to combating animal cruelty ; Illinois was the very best of the best for the strength of its laws protecting animals .
While Otto praises these states , he says more can be done , “ Even in those jurisdictions that have today ’s best laws , there remain many opportunities for improvement .
Especially important during our country ’s current recession are laws that help to save limited community resources by reducing the costs of caring for abused animals and ensuring that those who are responsible for such crimes shoulder this burden instead of taxpayers and private interests .
While animals do not vote , those who love and care about them certainly do , so we encourage lawmakers throughout the country to take heed and commit to working to improve these critical laws . ”

" Oh hey , " you ’d say as I walked up .
" I was just stealing your bike .
" " What the fuck ? " I 'd say .
" I feel terrible , " you 'd say .
And then you 'd say something cute to move things along , like " Can I make it up to you with coffee ?
" I totally understand where you were coming from -- we all have a hard time starting a conversation with the person we have a crush on .
Your plan was actually really good and clever and I am just so so bummed that we missed each other .
I can imagine how awful you felt -- it 's midnight in East Williamsburg and you 're standing there holding 3 - foot - long garden clippers and feeling very , very conspicuous .
There ’s a busted chain pooled at your feet and a beautiful old white Italian racing bike with blue highlights and red handlebar tape leaning up against a stop sign , and I 'm nowhere in sight .
You 're starting to wonder whether I 'm ever going to show up .
Maybe I 've gone to Arizona for the weekend or something .
Then you realize , with a sense of dread that grows and grows the longer you wait , that you can't just leave the bike there and abandon the whole plan -- the chain is well and truly cut , so the bike is n't secure anymore and it would be all too easy for some complete and total fucking asshole to walk away with it and make maybe $ 150 selling my most beloved possession and possibly greatest and most trusted friend so far in New York .
If this were to happen , if this hypothetical asshole were to walk away with my bike , which I just spent my first month here searching for and then carefully patching up and tuning , then where would all my love for this bike go ?
It would simply vanish .
The bike would be reduced to an object of monetary value and I would be reduced to a guy who has to find a new bike .
There would be measurably less love in the world , and the hypothetical asshole who had stolen my bike would therefore be a destroyer of love .
A Love Destroyer .
You , of course , could not allow this to happen .
The destruction of love is antithetical to your core mission in life , which is to create love , more love , for me .
So you decided to take the bike for safe - keeping .
THANK YOU .
I cannot express how grateful I am and how eager to finally to have our long - awaited conversation , which might honestly be a little awkward now but will be well worth it .
I 've been pretty lonely in my first month in New York and kind of missing my ex-girlfriend and frankly I 'm just really flattered that you 've taken an interest in me .
I can't wait to meet you .
And to get my bike back .

Artist Victoria Reynolds used meat as her inspiration for a series of incredible paintings .
Available now at the Richard Heller Gallery , her paintings feature extremely realistic - looking meat renderings encapsulated within amazingly detailed and creative frames .
We first found out about Ms. Reynold ’s work from Bacon Today reader Pete Lim who stated about her work :
“ Does it symbolize gluttony , American food worship , immortality vs. emminent demise ?
I do n’t know .
Does it make me hungry ?
Yes most definitely . ”
We are currently clearing wall space at Bacon Today Headquarters for a few of Victoria Reynolds ’ oil paintings .
Now we just need to scrape up about $ 6,000 …
In addition to the paintings , Pete also spied the following photographs on the wall at Avenue G restaurant in San Francisco .
We do n’t have any further details on the images , so if anyone knows the artist or can provide us more information we ’d love to know !

Why is a four octave vocal range so rare ?
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Yma Sumac sang on The Big Lebowski soundtrack Yma Sumac , the Peruvian soprano famous for her range , has died .
Her voice spanned more than four octaves , but why is that so unusual ?
Many things were considered amazing about Yma Sumac , from her exotic costumes to her claims about being an Inca princess .
But her extraordinary voice is what really made her special .
Known as the Peruvian songbird , it ranged over more than four octaves .
It made her a Hollywood star in the 1950s and she stunned audiences globally throughout her long career .
To this day Sumac , who died at the weekend , is considered to have one of the biggest vocal ranges of any singer .
THE ANSWER
The human voice is very limited and we use only a small part of it
Peru 's songbird Sumac dies at 86 Such a range is so unusual because the human voice is very limited and we use only a small part of it .
This makes it very difficult to expand the vocal range and articulate such high notes .
Exploiting the range we do have comes down to physical aspects , like body structure and the length of vocal cords , technique and psychological attitude .
There has been a massive amount of research over the years to try and understand why our voices are so limited , says vocal coach Janet Edwards , who 's worked with Leona Lewis and Spice Girl Mel C. Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" What we do know is most people are capable of three octaves .
The average person could sing within this range with very good guidance from an expert . "
Most classical singers who have been professionally trained are still within this three octave range .
A modern day comparison to Yma Sumac is Mariah Carey .
She has a multi-octave vocal range which can reportedly reach five octaves .
Mariah Carey 's voice also scales the heights " The young Mariah Carey used to sing in a lowish voice and then these stratospheric notes would sound more and more like whistling , " says Gillyanne Kayes , vocal trainer and voice researcher .
" It takes a high degree of skill to sing across a range .
The colour , or timbre , of a voice is not the same all the way through . "
And octave range does n't just come down to physical attributes and technique , it 's about the psychological as well .
" People can have a fear of using their voice , " says Ms Edwards .
" Teaching someone is not only about getting people to use their body properly and breath right , it is also about giving people the right attitude to free their voice .
You have to look at the voice from all angles . "
But having a wide range does not equal a good singing voice per se , says Ms Kayes .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines " In the latter years of Billie Holliday 's life it was a pretty limited range , which inevitably was due to her years of alcohol and drug use .
But she had this enormous expressivity which she was able to convey in seven to 10 notes , which is actually the range of your average pop song .
" Someone like Amy Winehouse , for example , mostly limits herself to about seven notes in a song .
It 's very difficult at the top of the range because you just can't articulate words up there .
It 's more what I would call a whistling sound . "

Two fishermen have survived for almost a month in shark - infested waters off Australia , by floating in a large icebox after their boat sank .
The men , both from Burma and in their 20s , were on a 12 - metre Thai wooden fishing boat with 18 others when it sank in stormy seas off Australia 's north coast two days before Christmas .
" They had no safety equipment , no beacons , no means of communication and they 'd been drifting for 25 days , " said Tracey Jiggins of Australia 's Maritime Safety Authority .
" For them to have even been spotted in a huge body of water is amazing . "
The men's desk - sized container was noticed by an Australian coastal patrol aircraft on Saturday .
A photograph taken from the plane showed them standing in a high , red - sided icebox of the type used by commercial fishing boats to store their catch .
The pair were waving desperately at rescuers .
The two fishermen were winched on to a rescue helicopter and taken to hospital on Thursday Island , off Australia 's north coast .
" They were desperately keen to get on .
When they got up they skolled [ drank ] two litres of water each within seconds , " the helicopter pilot , Terry Gadenne , told Australian television .
They were hungry and dehydrated after drifting for 25 days during the monsoon season , but were recovering well and would be released later today , hospital officials said .
The pair will be questioned by immigration officials and police .
The Maritime Safety Authority said the rest of the crew would almost certainly have perished .
No further search for survivors is planned .
" The information they provided to us was that they witnessed other crew members in the water , none of whom had any flotation device , so we 've done an assessment and we do n't believe anybody would be able to survive 25 days actually in the water , " said Jiggins .
It was unclear where the Thai - registered fishing boat , crewed by Thais and a handful of people from Burma , sank .
The surviving fishermen may have drifted for hundreds of miles before being picked up 60 nautical miles north - west of Horn Island .
The Torres Strait , between Australia and Papua New Guinea , is infested with sharks and the area is regularly fished by both licensed and illegal fishing vessels , many from Asia .
Out - sourcing development and open - source development may at first appear to be about as far apart as baseball and football .
Both use a ball in a game , but that 's about it .
Yet a closer look from open - source software developers and industry analysts reveals that enterprises using outsourcing for their programming needs could stand to learn some management and process techniques from the open - source community .
For example , one important lesson that outsourcers can pick up from open - source development communities is " the open - source community 's emphasis on asynchronous methods of communication — e- mail , bug tracker , forum , VCS ( version control systems ) update — over synchronous ones — phone , chat , meeting , " points out Josh Berkus , a PostgreSQL core team member and part of Sun 's open - source database team .
According to Berkus , the advantages of asynchronous development include :
If you 're sending e-mail , it does n't matter what time zone the recipient is in .
Synchronous methods often force people to take calls at 6 am or 11 pm , which decreases overall work efficiency and job satisfaction .
Plus , many programmers work odd hours ( at least by preference ) , so you can't even assume that people living in the same time zone will match up .
Asynchronous methods contain their own audit trail .
E-mail , bug trackers and such tools automatically generate a record of what happened ; someone who 's out of synch can catch up with a little reading .
" This trackability also reduces repeat discussions , and managers know better what their staff are doing , " says Berkus .
In contrast , synchronous methods generally require extra effort ( that is , time ) to create a record ; and because someone has to write the record , the task is often skipped .
" Great programmers are often people whose ability to concentrate is high but whose multi-tasking skills are poor , " Berkus points out .
Synchronous methods require interruptions , which has been proven to decrease the overall effectiveness of your best programmers .
Since these programmers do 60 to 90 percent of the work which ends up in the final product , he says , it pays to coddle them .
Everyone hates meetings .
Synchronous methods of communication are often very inefficient , says Berkus .
" They require waiting until everyone is present , which can eat as much as half of meeting time , " he says .
E-mail and Web communication make it far easier for a non-English speaker to read or translate e-mail and Web text than to understand several English speakers chatting on the phone .
Jay Lyman , an open - source analyst for The 451 Group notes the language differences in a global development circles , but adds , " There is also the issue of cultural differences , which must always be considered in such a community , " he says .
Still , from where Berkus sits , asynchronous communication has one disadvantage : Conversations which require a lot of back - and - forth can take days instead of hours .
" This causes open - source developers to either fall back on synchronous [ methods ] — chat , conferences — or to develop a workstyle in which they are constantly working on several tasks in parallel . "
Control and Motivation Problems — and Solutions
Another challenge common to both open - source and outsourcing scenarios is control , Lyman says .
Executives at open - source vendors have the challenge of motivating and steering individuals and groups that are not necessarily motivated primarily by money .
" I think there is a similar challenge in a global outsourcing development community , wherein there is less or no direct contact with members of that community and control is more difficult .
Open - source communities have also illustrated how too much control can breed discontentment or stifle innovation , " says Lyman .
Stormy Peters , executive director of the GNOME Foundation , says that the lessons the outsourcing developer community could learn from open source apply to any virtual team — starting with the preferred toolset .
Peters explains , " Open source software projects tend to rely on e-mail , mailing lists and IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) .
This gives them a lot of advantages not available to teams that work primarily by meeting , phone calls and e-mail . "
By using mailing lists and IRC , says Peters , open - source software projects gain :
Transparency .
All decisions and the discussions that led to them are public .
Who gets what responsibility and why is also visible .
Meritocracy .
Everyone knows who is doing what and how well they are doing .
Empowerment .
Everyone has a voice .
Anyone can join IRC or the mailing list .
History .
The entire project history and status are available to anyone .
Fewer time zone issues .
Since the history is in IRC and mailing lists , people can catch up and join in when they are awake , whenever and where ever that may be .
Language and culture issues .
" I think e-mail is less of a language issue than voice can be , " Peters says .
" I also think the community is very understanding of people who are working hard to express themselves well in English , perhaps because many , many in the community are working in their second language . "
Think your development team could use any of those attrbutes ?
Peters concluded , " I think because people are so empowered , they are less likely to give up when they do n't get an answer .
They are motivated and feel empowered to find answers so getting silence for a day or two ( on one channel ) is a roadblock but not a dead end . "
That alone should get outsourcing companies ' attention .
All too often , outsourced projects have abrupt starts and stops .
Switching to an open - source style asynchronous communications approach may be just what 's needed to get a project on time and on budget rather than floating around with a vague due date .
Do n't Take The Analogy Too Far
Of course , an important fundamental difference between open - source developers and outsourced developers is motivation .
As Dan Kusnetzky , well - known analyst and president of the Kusnetzky Group , says , " The open source community is driven by irritation .
People get irritated over what a piece of code can and can't do and apply their efforts to fix things .
Outsourced developers do exactly what they 're told , the way they 're told to do it , even if they know that the results will be less than optimal . "
Adds Dave Neary , head of Neary Consulting , a free - software , strategic consulting services company , and a leading GNOME developer , " When we talk about ' community , ' we mean it .
I have my doubts whether a supplier / client relationship , coupled with the worker profile in outsourcing companies , is amenable to the kind of emotional implication which is normal in free - software communities . "
" I would personally try to avoid the implication that outsourcing and free software project management have a lot in common , " continued Neary .
" I think many CIOs may see them as similar .
It is , after all , an unseen gaggle of hackers solving problems while you sleep :
The ' code gnomes , ' as an American member of the GNOME community once referred to his European colleagues .
But the management methodology is completely different .
You care what other members of the community do , and rewarding them and recognizing their effort is fundamental to maximizing their participation .
The more people feel like they are part of a family , the more they will contribute and become part of the family .
When people feel that you depend on them and trust them , then they work harder to earn that trust . "
That being the case , Neary has great difficulty in seeing any outsourcing company successfully create that kind of dynamic .
He says , " It is much easier for me to see it happening in great companies , where employees are treated as an important part of a big family , and not as man-hours , interchangeable with Indian or Chinese PhDs who work for below - minimum wage . "
Jennifer Aniston Covers Entertainment Weekly ( PHOTOS )
graces the cover of Entertainment Weekly for their December 12th issue .
The gorgeous celebrity provided some insight into a subject that seems to get a great deal of press - the ongoing reports that she is pregnant .
She would like to have that particular subject drop off the radar and for good reason .
Her biggest fear is that when she is actually pregnant for real , it will be anti climactic .
" I feel like that is in my future and I 'm on the verge of it in someway . "
Jen discussed her recent controversial comments that were blown out of proportion after they appeared in Vogue magazine .
She contends that the magazine misrepresented her " very uncool " remark about Angelina Jolie .
She admits she was disappointed that Vogue went ' tabloid ' on her and used the quote on the cover - making it THE story .
She said " I was bummed .
But you almost expect it .
Big deal .
Done . Next . "
Check out some of Jen 's other recent covers below .
A group of scientists and politicians has accused the International Energy Agency of publishing false data about the growth potential of renewable energy .
The Energy Watch Group claims the IEA “ consistently underestimated the amount of electricity generated by wind power while advising various governments . ”
The group holds the IEA ’s close ties to the oil , gas and nuclear sectors responsible for its “ ignorance and contempt ” towards renewables .
[ social_buttons ]
The International Energy Agency is an intergovernmental organization which publishes reports about future trends of energy generation and use which help governments across the world to chalk out energy production plans .
The Energy Watch group says that the IEA reports glorify fossil fuels deeming them irreplaceable by renewable energy sources .
The group compared the production projections of wind energy that the IEA presented in the past decade to the the actual growth in wind energy generation .
In 1998 , the IEA predicted that global wind electricity generation would total 47.4GW by 2020 .
This figure was reached in December 2004 .
In 2002 , the IEA revised its estimate to 104GW wind by 2020 – a capacity that had been exceeded by last summer .
In 2007 , net additions of wind power across the world were more than four - fold the average IEA estimate from its 1995 - 2004 predictions .
The IEA report predicts a five - fold increase in wind energy from 2006 - 2015 but then assumes an abrupt & unexplained downturn in production .
A Swiss parliament member also notes that IEA derives most of its employees from the oil industry and raised questions about its intent regarding the energy outlook reports .
One has to question the wind energy growth numbers that IEA puts in its reports .
Investments in renewable energy have grown tremendously around the world .
The European Union has been very open about its huge investment plans in renewable energy keeping with the emissions reduction targets and the clean energy targets it has set for 2010 and 2020 .
China has become the largest investor in clean energy , pumping in billions of dollars in building some of the biggest wind and solar energy plants in the world .
Even during this period of economic recession , industrialized nations , like Britain , United States , South Korea and Japan , plan to invest billions in creating jobs by setting up clean energy projects .
In addition , under the new climate treaty more nations would be required to cut carbon emissions and to a greater extent than under the Kyoto Protocol .
More importantly , there is a possibility that the United States would also ratify the treaty which would mean more investments in renewable energy .

It seems that the IEA has left out some very important variables while preparing the energy outlook reports in the past few years .
A global intent to invest in clean energy projects , EU ’s strict renewable energy and emission reduction targets and mandatory targets under the new climate treaty – all these factors would drive investments in renewable energy projects around the world and it seems that the IEA has overlooked these factors – deliberately or erroneously .
But it is very important that such an international body whose reports are followed by governments around the world must stay neutral and not be baised in favor of a particular sector or industry .

How would you spice this ?
Basic recipe :
- Put lentils in pot of boiling water and simmer about 15min
- Sauté some onion & garlic ( and maybe other stuff )
- Add rice to sauteed stuff and stir to coat rice in oil
- Pour in the pre-simmerred lentils , and a bunch of broth
- Keep simmerring about 20 min , adding more broth as it evaporates
I 've done this several times with some variations , like :
- Sauté mushrooms , peppers , and / or prosciutto w/onion + garlic
- Add frozen peas near the end
- Chicken broth , homemade vegetable broth , other brothlike things
... and , different combinations of spices .
But I wo n't say which so as not to bias anyone .
Which spices would you use with this ?

Survey : Americans prefer
Web over papers to read news Agence France - Presse

The Internet has surpassed newspapers as the main source for national and international news for Americans , according to a new survey .
Television , however , remains the preferred medium for Americans , according to the survey by the Washington - based Pew Research Center for the People & the Press .
Seventy percent of the 1,489 people surveyed by Pew said television is their primary source for national and international news .
Forty percent said they get most of their news from the Internet , up from 24 percent in September 2007 , and more than the 35 percent who cited newspapers as their main news source .
Only 59 percent of people younger than 30 years old prefer television , Pew said , down from 68 percent in the September 2007 survey .
The latest survey was conducted December 3 - 7 and released on Tuesday .
Pew did not provide the margin of error .
Remembering the war dead can be a controversial act in Japan
After Japan's air force chief was sacked over an essay in which he appeared to question his country 's accepted role as an aggressor in World War II , the BBC's Andre Vornic reports from Tokyo on Japanese attitudes to the war .
Japan expressed remorse for its wartime actions in 1995 , and followed with another apology a decade later .
But the entry that won General Toshio Tamogami an essay competition described Japan as a victim .
Gen Tamogami's comments suggest revisionist readings of history persist
The essay said Japan had only occupied China to secure rights it had obtained under various treaties .
It also portrayed Korea under Japanese rule as prosperous and safe .
Disputes over wartime history often stir tensions between Tokyo and Beijing , but his swift dismissal should ensure no lasting damage is done to relations between Japan and its neighbours .
Announcing the dismissal on Friday , Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada said it was improper for the general to publicly state a view clearly different from that of the government .
Black vans Comments such as those made by Gen Tamogami suggest readings of history , widely seen as revisionist , persist in Japan .
Black vans known as gaisensha are a familiar , if fairly infrequent , presence on the streets of Japanese cities .
Operated by far - right groups and bedecked with imperial flags , they broadcast military songs and nationalist slogans as they crawl through traffic .
The gaisensha remain a fringe phenomenon , at the crossroads of extreme nationalism and organised crime .
Many in the Asia - Pacific region still recall atrocities by Japanese forces Most Tokyo residents see them as an inevitable nuisance - a case , as they would put it , of " shoganai " ( " It ca n't be helped . " )
They take no more notice of the black vans than of the vociferous crows plaguing the capital 's skies .
The Yasukuni shrine , in the heart of the city , is an altogether more stately affair than the gaisensha .
Contrary to popular belief , the shrine only honours a handful of war criminals , among those millions of Japanese war dead .
But the museum there presents a strikingly different interpretation of history from that familiar to Westerners , Chinese , Koreans , or indeed most Japanese .
There is no mention of the Rape of Nanking - a rampage by Japanese troops through the city of Nanjing regarded in China as a genocidal orgy of violence .
The episode is instead described as a move by Japanese troops to protect the law - abiding Chinese population from bandits and terrorists .
Furthermore , it is said , far from being a colonial oppressor , Japan sought to free Asian nations from Western domination .
' Pragmatists '
There is no doubt that a strand of thought remains active in Japan which rejects official versions of the nation 's past as victor propaganda .
Japan is a pacifist nation under its constitution
The new Prime Minister , Taro Aso , is himself a conservative nationalist .
He has praised Japan in the past as a unique example of a nation with one culture , one language , and one ethnic group .
He has also angered China by describing it as a considerable threat .
Yet that perception is common across the Far East and South - East Asia , where Beijing 's sharply rising military spending is a cause for disquiet .
In fact , as prime minister , Mr Aso has courted both China and South Korea , offering to host a three - way summit in the southern city of Fukuoka .
" He is not anti-China - he just has a loose tongue , " says Tsuneo Watanabe of the Tokyo Foundation think - tank .
Professor Watanabe confesses to being surprised that Mr Aso has not made a single faux pas since becoming prime minister a month ago .
" But in any case , " he adds , " government policy in Japan is made by a core of pragmatists . "
Naivety No Japanese administration , including Mr Aso's , has questioned a landmark 1995 official statement which said that through its colonial rule and aggression , Japan had inflicted tremendous damage and suffering on Asian and other countries .
Formally a pacifist nation under its American - written constitution , Japan is also at heart a passionately pacifist society - sometimes startlingly so .
People here can be heard wishing for world peace in a tone that to Western ears might carry a touch of naivety , like a leaf torn from the book of beauty pageant contestants .
A sign advocating peace - admittedly rusting at the edges - also greets tourists boarding the pleasure boats that ply the waters of Tokyo's Sumida river .
The very gestures that would be considered routinely patriotic elsewhere , such as flying the national flag or playing the national anthem , remain intensely controversial in Japan .
A significant left - liberal strand of public opinion holds both symbols to be inherently fascistic .
Earlier this year , a Tokyo court ordered the city government to compensate 13 school teachers who had been reprimanded for refusing to sing the anthem in class .
The capital 's gaisensha vans continue to make occasional appearances , with their shrill loudspeakers extolling the nation , excoriating its critics , denouncing liberal thought .
But for every black van , or the odd headline - grabbing revisionist statement , a wealth of unobtrusive signs suggests militarism and aggression have been durably expelled from Japan 's collective psyche .

The riots are estimated to have cost businesses in the capital more than $ 1bn
By Malcolm Brabant
BBC News , Athens
Pulsating punk rock was stoking up the black - clad army of students outside the University of Athens , as , yet again , they prepared to march on parliament .
The Stranglers were singing : " Whatever happened to all the heroes ?
All the Shakespearoes ?
They watched their Rome burn . "
The setting was appropriate : the Propylea , as the university 's main building is known , resembles a temple from Greece 's own glorious classical era .
All along Panepistimiou , or University Boulevard , security men in upscale jewellers , boutiques and the Attica department store , hastily lowered the electronic shutters .
The guards at the Bank of Greece retreated behind supposedly impregnable bronze doors , and steeled themselves for yet another assault on the symbols of wealth , prosperity and unbridled capitalism .
Since a policeman shot dead 15 - year - old Alexis Grigoropoulos on 6 December , daily riots are estimated to have cost the entrepreneurs in the capital more than $ 1bn .
Economic crisis
In among the hooded tops and Arab scarves was a man with owlish glasses and an immaculate mane of silvery , white hair .
The economic crisis is huge and Greece is showing , I think , the future for what will happen in other countries
Panos Garganas Panos Garganas is a career protester who has taken part in every annual 17 November march on the US embassy .
That march commemorates the day in 1973 when tanks of the US - backed military dictatorship smashed through the gates of the Polytechnic university and crushed a student uprising .
Whether it is a demonstration to support asylum seekers or to complain about the intrusion of privacy threatened by CCTV before the 2004 Olympic Games , Mr Garganas will be there .
He is a member of the hard left Socialist Workers ' Party and is the total antithesis of the stereotypical rabid Trotskyite : unfailingly polite , articulate , and persuasively reasonable in his arguments .
I asked him to apply some historical context to the most serious civil disturbances in Greece since the fall of the colonels ' military dictatorship 34 years ' ago .
" I think we should see today 's developments in terms of 1989 , " he replied .
" Back then , it was the Eastern bloc that collapsed under the pressure of economic crisis , and popular movements in the streets .
Now we are seeing the same in the West . "
The unrest is fuelled by anger at high unemployment and unpopular reforms " The economic crisis is huge and Greece is showing , I think , the future for what will happen in other countries .
We could say that 2009 , 20 years on , will see the collapse of Western capitalism . "
I asked him if he was not simply looking at the recent unrest through the rose - tinted glasses of an old left - wing romantic .
" Well , yes , of course .
I am all of those things you just said , " he replied .
" But this democracy is failing people and the present revolt is much deeper , it will last much longer , it will affect society much more profoundly . "
" It does mean misery ... in terms of people losing their jobs , their homes and their pensions .
There 's going to be a lot of suffering .
But at the same time people are reacting , not in a resigned way , but with anger and with action and that 's always hopeful . "
The unrest across Greece is no longer an outpouring of youthful anger over the " martyrdom " of a schoolboy in the Athens district of Exarchia .
As Mr Garganas explained , for many protesters it is now a vigorous attempt both to topple the conservative government of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis , and to create waves across Europe .
European fears
Further confirmation came from the mouth of Petros Constantinou , a bearded firebrand wearing wire - rimmed spectacles that might have fitted Leon Trotsky .
Many of the left - wing protesters want to see the government stand down I asked him to justify the burning and looting of shops belonging to people not remotely connected to the death of Alexis Grigoropoulos .
" When we have revolutions , we do n't drink tea in our saloons , we have fights in the streets , " Mr Constantinou shouted .
So should Greece 's European Union partners dismiss this talk of revolution as being little more than extremist rhetoric , or is there something more substantial to fear ?
The riots have clearly unsettled France 's President , Nicolas Sarkozy .
He has postponed plans to reform the curriculum of secondary school pupils in case they ignite copycat protests .
" In the name of symbols , they can overthrow the country .
They are regicidal , " Mr Sarkozy told the French parliament .
" Just look what 's going on in Greece . "
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the head of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , is also deeply concerned and has advised governments to spend more money in an effort to ease the global economic crisis .
In a BBC interview , Mr Strauss - Kahn spoke of 2009 as " really being a bad year " .
" I 'm especially concerned by the fact that our forecast , already very dark ... will be even darker if not enough fiscal stimulus is implemented , " he said .
An improptu public memorial has been set up at the site of the boy 's death " The question of having social unrest has been highlighted by journalists and I can understand that , but its only part of the problem , " he added .
" The problem is that the whole society is going to suffer . "
At present , the demonstrations across Greece are mainly attracting students , high - school pupils , veteran leftist campaigners and members of the so called 700 - euro generation - disenchanted graduates who are unable to break through the ceiling of this nation 's minimum wage .
The working and middle classes are staying away , perhaps because of the petrol bombs and tear gas .
There is neither a co-coordinated plan of action , nor a charismatic revolutionary leader .
But Greek trades unions and university students are now trying to mobilise sympathisers who are watching the troubles on television rather than participating .
Sleeping giant stirring Pay attention to the old - fashioned , Marxist - Leninist Communist Party of Greece ( KKE ) .
Remember them ?
If you are coming to Athens in 2009 , pack a gas mask with your bikini , just in case
Despite the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet bloc , the Greek hammer and sickle has never conceded the demise of its ideology and has maintained a consistent level of support across the country of about 6 or 7 % .
Since 1989 , the KKE has appeared something of an anachronism , but the sleeping giant is stirring .
The communists have been among the more responsible politicians over the past fortnight , condemning the violence and exerting tight discipline over their protest rallies .
Intelligently , they are doing their utmost not to alienate the masses , whereas Syriza , the coalition of the left , supported by younger voters in the last general election , has been accused of stoking the flames .
Foreign income Pay attention also to Greece 's key sources of foreign income next year .
If they fail , then Mr Constantinou 's revolution could attract more foot soldiers .
Tourism and shipping each contribute around 20 % towards Greece 's national earnings .
The Straits of Salamis are filling up with empty , unused cargo vessels
The sight of smoke obscuring the Acropolis is likely to deter American tourists doing a grand Mediterranean tour .
The collapse of sterling against the euro means that British tourists , who help sustain Crete , Corfu , Halkidiki and other package holiday destinations , may choose to get their annual sun fix in Croatia or Turkey .
The desperation of Greek hoteliers will be used by British travel companies as an excuse to drive even harder bargains .
This year , during a break in Corfu , the owner of a quaint clifftop apartment complex told me that his colleagues were struggling to break even , as they were only getting five euros per bed , per night .
The crash earlier in 2008 of British travel firm XL has left scores of Greek hoteliers close to bankruptcy .
Some had been waiting a year for XL to pay their 2007 invoices .
The demise of XL will mean that some island entrepreneurs will lose two years ' income .
If you fly into Athens International Airport , take a look out of the window as you cross the Straits of Salamis between the port of Piraeus and the island of Salamina .
You could get $ 235,000 a day for transporting iron ore - now you can barely get $ 3,000
George Gratsos , President of the Hellenic Chamber of Shipping
This is the location of one of what was arguably the most important sea battle of all time .
In 480 BC , the Athenian navy destroyed the armada of King Xerxes of Persia and thus ensured that Western civilisation evolved under Greek , rather than Asian , influence .
Today the straits are filling up with dozens of cargo vessels , rocking at anchor and going nowhere .
Their owners can no longer afford to run them .
According to George Gratsos , president of the Hellenic Chamber of Shipping , in May of this year , when cargo rates were at their peak , you could get $ 235,000 a day for transporting iron ore .
" Now you can barely get $ 3,000 , " he told me .
That amounts to less than a vessel 's daily running costs .
Greek ship owners , who are amongst this country 's richest and most powerful people , can afford to sit on their enormous financial cushions and ride out the economic crisis .
But what about the 100,000 Greeks who depend on the shipping industry for their livelihoods ?
Most middle class Greeks have been working 16 - hour days to provide the bare necessities of life .
Businesses in Athens are braced for further riots and more damage Many are now facing ruin through no fault of their own .
So how can Europeans stop Greece 's social uprising escalating ?
Well , for a start , they could help by taking a holiday in Greece .
Whatever the dire threats of the would - be revolutionaries , the riots are not going to reach the thousands of idyllic beaches and inspiring archaeological sites .
But if you are coming to Athens in 2009 , pack a gas mask with your bikini , just in case .

WASHINGTON , Dec. 16 ( UPI ) --
The maker of the cold remedy Airborne has agreed to pay $ 7 million to settle allegations by 32 attorneys general that it made false claims about its products .
As a part of its multistate settlement , Airborne Health Inc. agreed to discontinue claims about the " health benefit , performance , efficacy or safety " of its products in preventing and treating ailments , Legal Newsline reported Tuesday .

" Consumers who purchased Airborne to treat their colds were not getting their money 's worth as there is no proof that Airborne can lessen your cold symptoms , " Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said .
The legal news service said the $ 7 million settlement is the largest payment to date in a multistate action involving a dietary supplement producer .
The attorneys general lawsuit , filed by Bob Cooper of Tennessee , claimed Airborne 's marketing materials implied that its products had been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
" Airborne dramatically misrepresented its products as cold remedies without any scientific evidence to back up its claims , " California Attorney General Brown said .
" Under this agreement , the company will stop advertisements that suggest that its products are a cure for the common cold . "
In settling the case , Airborne did not admit to any wrongdoing , the company said in a statement .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. is seeking to hire a merchant ship to deliver hundreds of tons of arms to Israel from Greece later this month , tender documents seen by Reuters show .
The U.S. Navy ’s Military Sealift Command ( MSC ) said the ship was to carry 325 standard 20 - foot containers of what is listed as “ ammunition ” on two separate journeys from the Greek port of Astakos to the Israeli port of Ashdod in mid-to - late January .
A “ hazardous material ” designation on the manifest mentions explosive substances and detonators , but no other details were given .
“ Shipping 3,000 - odd tons of ammunition in one go is a lot , ” one broker said , on condition of anonymity .
“ This ( kind of request ) is pretty rare and we have n’t seen much of it quoted in the market over the years , ” he added .
The U.S. Defense Department , contacted by Reuters on Friday in Washington , had no immediate comment .
The MSC transports amour and military supplies for the U.S. armed forces aboard its own fleet , but regularly hires merchant ships if logistics so require .
The request for the ship was made on December 31 , with the first leg of the charter to arrive no later than January 25 and the second at the end of the month .
The tender for the vessel follows the hiring of a commercial ship to carry a much larger consignment of ordnance in December from the United States to Israel ahead of air strikes in the Gaza Strip .
A German shipping firm which won that tender confirmed the order when contacted by Reuters but declined to comment further .
CHARTERS “ RARE ”
Shipping brokers in London who have specialized in moving arms for the British and U.S. military in the past said such ship charters to Israel were rare .
Israel is one of America ’s closest allies and both nations regularly sell arms to each other .
A senior military analyst in London who declined to be named said that , because of the timing , the shipments could be “ irregular ” and linked to the Gaza offensive .
The ship hired by the MSC in December was for a much larger cargo of arms , tender documents showed .
That stipulated a ship to be chartered for 42 days capable of carrying 989 standard 20 - foot containers from Sunny Point , North Carolina to Ashdod .
The tender document said the vessel had to be capable of “ carrying 5.8 million pounds ( 2.6 million kg ) of net explosive weight , ” which specialist brokers said was a very large quantity .
The ship was requested early last month to load on December 15 .
In September , the U.S. Congress approved the sale of 1,000 bunker - buster missiles to Israel .
The GPS - guided GBU - 39 is said to be one of the most accurate bombs in the world .
The Jerusalem Post , citing defense officials , reported last week that a first shipment of the missiles had arrived in early December and they were used in penetrating Hamas ’s underground rocket launcher sites .

1 )
What is the " What Is Scientology ? "
Spam Attack ?
Put simply , the " What Is Scientology ? " ( WIS ) Spam Attack is an apparent attempt by someone -- either the Church of Scientology , its employees or its sympathizers -- to stifle the speech of people who discuss , on the Usenet Newsgroup alt.religion .
scientology , the past and present wrongful practices and criminal acts of the Scientology organization , its leadership , its corporate entities , and its employees .
This attack has been in progress since May 19 , 1996 , and more than 100,000 posts have been flooded into alt .religion .
scientology to date , in an apparent effort to " harass and discourage [ 1 ] " the regular participants in the ongoing discussions there .

2 ) Who is the " What Is Scientology ? "
Spam Team ?
The WIS Spam Team appears to consist of at least three people ; a man of undetermined age , a young woman , and an older woman .
Investigators have yet to make a complete identification , though certain names seem to keep coming up in the investigation .
In the month of October 1996 , the Spam Team appears to have developed new cover stories , and have been using these new stories to open accounts .
They may also have recruited new personnel .
As investigation turns up new cover stories , they will be included in future versions of this FAQ .
3 ) How does the " What Is Scientology ? "
Spam Team work ?
The WIS Spam Team 's _modus_operandi_ ( M.O. ) is fairly invariant .
As described in the opening paragraphs of this FAQ , they typically open a temporary SLIP / PPP account on an ISP , paying for a month in advance .
The account may remain idle for weeks , while the WIS Spam Team abuses other system 's accounts in the following manner :
They find several open NNTP servers they can abuse .
Once they begin to abuse an NNTP server , they will continue to post through it ( using multiple forged From : addresses ) between a dozen and 2000 articles a night , repeating sets of about 700 different articles ( usually excerpts from the book " What Is Scientology ? " , or old Scientology press releases , always advertising several official Scientology Web sites ) , at a rate of up to ten per minute .
They have been known to post 10,000 articles non -stop over a single weekend , sometimes using more than one account simultaneously .
They will not stop until forced to stop , either by the victimized NNTP server being closed to them , or by losing their account when the ISP identifies it .
Some ISPs have reported closing more than one account at a time , either paid for in cash or using a third - party 's credit card bearing a name other than the name given by the account holder .
Addresses and phone numbers given by the WIS Spam Team are invariably phony .
Put simply , they lie .
They are reported to be very convincing liars .
When the other accounts are closed by the other ISPs , your system 's turn comes around .
4 ) Where does the " What Is Scientology ? "
Spam Team operate ?
At present , the WIS Spam Team operates out of somewhere in the metropolitan Los Angeles area .
There have been small spams not following the standard MO run out of other locations ( including one using bitwise .
net in Boston , and small spams from AOL ) but they seem to be attempts at distraction from the standard pattern .
WIS Spam Team accounts have been closed all over the L.A. area , after being used by the WIS Spam Team to post thousands of articles to alt.religion.
scientology , using NNTP servers all over the world [ 3 ] .
5 ) What ISPs have been victimized by the " What Is Scientology ? "
Spam Team ?
directnet.com , westworld.com , wdc.net , barepower.net , netroplex.com , interline.net , instanet.com , linkonline.net , loop.com , k- net.net , dsphere.com , wavenet.com , internetconnect.net , cyberesc.net , 4 link.net and annex.com are just a FEW of the ISPs who have suffered from hosting WIS Spam Team accounts .
6 ) Does the " What Is Scientology ? "
Spam Team ever just leave an ISP ?
No .
Once begun , these attacks will continue for days ( sometimes weeks ) at a time .
To my knowledge , the WIS Spam Team has never just left an ISP .
They only stop when the ISP closes their account .
7 ) What will happen if I just ignore the " What Is Scientology ? "
Spam
Team while it 's using my system ?
Because the newsgroup under attack , alt.religion .scientology , is one of the most - read Usenet newsgroups , the hounds of virtual hell come down on the WIS Spam Team 's unfortunate ISP for the duration of the attack .
Complaints come pouring in by email , fax , and telephone , along with megabytes of Spam article headers -- which may be useful to match logs against posting times when one tries to identify the offending account , but which tend to clog system administrators ' inboxes .
Some systems have had to spend WEEKS ( and hundreds of person - hours ) identifying the offending account , all the while suffering flames -- by email and posted all over Usenet -- from victimized readers of alt.religion .
scientology , and from other anti-net - abuse activists .
It 's unpleasant , to say the least .
Also , ISPs that demonstrate an inability or unwillingness to stop the WIS Spam Team 's attacks often attract the attention of unsavory commercial Usenet spammers , who flock to those ISPs in the hope of perpetrating their own spams unhindered .
Such customers , and the complaints they inevitably generate , are more trouble than the income from them is worth .
Their activity is likely to further damage your system 's reputation , and you may lose many of your respectable customers as a result .
8 ) Spamming is n't illegal .
Why should I care about the " What Is Scientology ? "
Spam Team ?
Small - scale spamming may not be illegal ; but the kind of spam - flood the WIS Spam Team engages in -- attempting to make impossible the regular use of alt.religion .
scientology -- falls in the category of Denial Of Service Attack , which is clearly illegal under 18 USC sec. 1030 [ 4 ] .
( By the way , section 1030 ( g ) provides for civil actions by injured parties , so once the Spam Team is caught , there is likely to be a long list of Federal civil suits brought against them , as well . )
Furthermore , by using NNTP servers other than those belonging to their ISPs to post thousands of articles without authorization from the owners of those servers ( usually making use of little - known security holes in INN to post through NNTP servers not intentionally left open [ 5 ] -- the equivalent of picking the lock of a stranger 's door to go into his house and make prank phone calls from the stranger 's phone ) , the WIS Spam Team is committing Theft Of Services , also illegal under state laws in every one of the United States .
To compound their criminality , in the course of their attacks , the WIS Spam Team has been known to post ( unauthorized , of course ) through .gov and even .mil NNTP servers -- which is Unauthorized Use of Federal Computing Resources , illegal under 18 USC section 1030 ( a ) ( 3 ) .
The US Department of Energy is currently investigating just such abuses of Federal computing systems at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory .
9 ) I think the " What Is Scientology ? "
Spam Team may have opened an account on my system .
What should I do ?
The FBI is also investigating this ongoing attack .
If you think you may have innocently opened an account for the " What Is Scientology " Spam Team , give a call to one of the following FBI agents , each of whom has been briefed on this case : Agent Hugh McLean Agent Charles Neal Phone : 1-202-324-9164 Phone : 1-310-996-3854 Fax : 1-202-324-6363
And in the meantime , if you have n't already done what I suggested earlier , save yourself a whole lot of wasted time and trouble .
Lock the account now .
If you suspect IN THE SLIGHTEST that you may be a victim of the " What Is Scientology " Spam Team , or if you have opened an account in a manner that fits the M.O. described above , lock the suspect account .
Just lock it .
Do n't send a warning or an inquiry .
These criminals do not respond to warnings or inquiries .
The WIS Spam Team , after they have received past warnings or inquiries , just remained logged on to the ISP 's system 24 hours a day , pumping out the spam as long as they could get away with it , until the account was finally locked and their access was revoked .
If you lock the account and your suspicions are correct , you will probably not hear from the WIS Spam Team again .
Once an account is locked , they do not complain ; when the jig is up , they just move on to another unfortunate provider .
While they have recently begun to return to providers where they had once before held accounts , it was only after having been elsewhere for several months .
If someone calls to complain about the locked account , the odds are good ( unless the WIS Spam Team changes its M.O. , which IS possible ) that it's a legitimate account , and you can simply fix the " technical problem " and everything will probably be all right .
But please do n't take any unnecessary chances .
A few minutes of prevention here can save you many hours of cure .
If the holder of the suspect account does call and complain ( especially if the account has n't been used yet ) it 's probably a good idea to ask for ( and make a record of ) a telephone number you can call back for confirmation that the person calling is indeed the account holder .
You can say that the callback is a necessary security measure .
Then call that number , and confirm that the person who called you is actually at that number , before unlocking the account .
The WIS Spam Team will not give you a legitimate phone number ( except , perhaps , the number of a public pay telephone ) to call back , because it might be used later to identify them .
If you want to confirm the legitimacy of the telephone number , and you do n't have access to a reverse telephone directory or a CD - ROM telephone directory , your telephone company will probably tell you if a particular telephone number is indeed that of a public pay telephone .
10 ) I 'm getting reports from people about the " What Is Scientology " Spam Team using my system , but I do n't know what to do .
How can I identify which accounts they are using ?
How can I stop them from spamming ?
There are a number of ways you can identify the accounts the Spam Team is using : A ) When they set up the account ( or accounts ) they are using , these people gave your staff false names and telephone numbers .
The account may have been opened by one or two women who came into your office and paid cash for a brother / son who was going to visit them for a month ; or a man may have called and opened an account over the phone with a promise to send in a check that has not come ; or a man may have called up and asked you to set up an account " for a friend who was coming to visit " ; or they may simply have opened a " free trial account " , if you happen to offer them .
They were using a credit card ( in a name different from the names they gave for themselves and the account holder ) for a while , but they stopped that practice around July or August of 1996 -- though they may start doing that again at any time , especially if you require a credit card number to open a free trial account .
To identify which accounts are likely to be the Spam Team's , go through your recent new accounts , within the last month or so .
Find out which of them fit these patterns .
Try calling the numbers they gave you at different times of the day .
If you get no answer , or if you get a message that it is a bogus number ( or an office of the Church of Scientology ) , or if the phone company tells you it is a telephone booth , lock the account .
B ) A harder ( but surer ) way is by gathering spam headers and checking the logs for the dialups listed in the NNTP - Posting - Host : header lines against the posting times in those headers , to determine which user matches all the times .
This method is a lot more work , and it takes longer , but once you make the connection , it is certain .
Then shut that account down .
This is the system that several ISPs have used .
C )
The third way may inconvenience some of your legitimate users who may legitimately use outside NNTP servers , but if all else fails , you may have to do what some other victimized ISPs have done -- ask your provider to filter outgoing NNTP connections from your site .
D ) This Spam Team usually likes to operate through the night , because the small ISPs it likes to abuse tend not to have staff monitoring systems late at night , and they are less likely to get caught .
During times when the Spam Team is likely to be active , use network monitoring tools like " netstat " under SunOS to check what ports are active between your dial - in server and the NNTP ports on other machines .
A perl or shell script run from " cron " could easily log this activity with a minimum of mess .
E ) Obtain the Caller - ID information from your dial - in lines .
The Hylafax freeware for UNIX systems ( you can find it at < ftp://ftp.sgi.com/sgi/fax > provides both dial - in and fax - in / out software that 's very powerful and very friendly .
It automatically collects Caller - ID from any modems that support the feature .
It also easily supports mailfax gateways for your users ( billed to their accounts with a bit of programming added ) or only your staff , for faxing forms and bills to your customers .
It also handles configuring modems for dialup and PPP rather well .
F )
Sometimes the simplest measures can be the most effective .
If your modems are external , walk over to them and watch the traffic on the LED 's for a while when the Spam Team is likely to be working .
The perpetrator is almost entirely * transmitting * data , for hours and hours .
This is extremely unusual for dialup lines , which will more frequently download for extended periods .
G)
You can make your system less inviting for the Spam Team if , in your contracts and connection messages on your systems , you remind users that you reserve the right to monitor their activity for security reasons .
Method A is generally the quickest and has proved over time to be the most effective ; but a combination of the other methods may prove to be most useful for you , if you are unfortunate enough to be hosting the WIS Spam Team .
Good luck .
And be careful out there .
Footnotes : [ 1 ]
In 1955 , L. Ron Hubbard wrote in _A_Manual_on_the_Dissemination_of_Material_ ( one of the Sacred Scriptures of the Church of Scientology ) , " The purpose of a lawsuit is to harass and discourage rather than to win .
Do n't ever defend .
Always attack .
Find or manufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace .
...
The law can be used very easily to harass , and enough harassment on somebody who is on the thin edge anyway , well knowing that he is not authorized , will generally be sufficient to cause his professional demise .
If possible , of course , ruin him utterly . "
This practice continues to this day , and the present spam - flood of alt.religion .
scientology is merely the latest means of harassment being employed by this cult .
For evidence that it IS the cult engaging in this harassment , I need only point out that all of the articles being spammed are ( c ) copyright Church of Scientology International , and no legal action is being taken against the perpetrator , while hundreds of persons who have quoted as few as seven lines of Scientology scripture on alt.religion .
scientology received email from hkk@netcom.com < Helena K. Kobrin > , attorney for the Cult , threatening legal action ; and several cases are now pending in Federal courts against persons who quoted larger fair - use extracts of Cult scripture in discussion on alt.religion.scientology [ 2 ] .

The WIS Spam Team has only used its own ISP 's NNTP server once , after having been on that system for a month , just as the account was due to expire ( and its admins had just closed a second account on the same system ) .
It was a sort of parting shot , one last insult added to the injury . [ 4 ]
See < http://www.panix.com/~eck/computer-fraud-act.html> for the text of 18 USC Section 1030 . [ 5 ]
All official releases of INN through 1.4se c2 allow " blind " posting to any group on the server by anyone with posting authorization for any group .
This is fixed in more recent versions .
The latest version is 1.5 -- See < http://www.isc.org/isc/> for details . --

This is justs precious .
I like to think of them dancing in this same formation when they grow up .
DUBLIN / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Irish pig meat contaminated with toxic dioxins could have been exported to as many as 25 countries , including France and the Netherlands , Irish government officials said on Sunday .
The Irish government has recalled all domestic pork products from shops , restaurants and food processing plants because of contamination with dioxin -- which in some forms and concentrations , and with long exposure , can cause cancer and other health problems .
Neighboring Britain , the main export market , has warned consumers not to eat any Irish pork products after tests revealed the contamination .
“ We believe it ’s in the order of 20 - 25 countries .
It ’s certainly less than 30 , ” Chief Veterinary Officer Paddy Rogan told a news conference , speaking about how many countries could be affected , but he did not list all of them .
France and the Netherlands notified Ireland they had received contaminated shipments of meat or processed foods which later turned out to have originated in Ireland , while Belgium received contaminated by - products , officials said .
“ They did n’t contact us until we had gone public , ” Rogan said .
Authorities said 10 farms in Ireland and a further 9 farms in the British province of Northern Ireland had used a contaminated pig feed that prompted Dublin to announce the recall on Saturday .
Britain ’s Food Stands Agency , a government body tasked with protecting public health and consumer interests , said it was investigating whether any contaminated pork products had been distributed in the UK -- a major importer of Irish pig meat .
“ The Food Standards Agency is today advising consumers not to eat pork or pork products , such as sausages , bacon , salami and ham , which are labeled as being from the Irish Republic or Northern Ireland , ” it said in a statement .
British supermarket group Asda , owned by U.S. retail giant Wal - Mart , said it was pulling all Irish pork products from its shelves .
RISKS LOW , CONSUMERS WORRY
The Irish government said on Saturday that laboratory tests of animal feed and pork fat samples confirmed the presence of dioxins , with toxins at 80 - 200 times the safe limits .
Preliminary evidence indicated the problem was likely to have started in September of this year , it added .
The Irish Exporters Association said the total exports of pig meat and related added value products such as pizzas , pies and sandwiches containing pork was about 750 million euros ( $ 950 million ) .
It said 63 percent of this went to the UK .
Britain ’s FSA said it did “ not believe there is significant risk to UK consumers . ”
The Irish Association of Pigmeat Processors said the contaminated pig feed came from one supplier and the source had been contained .
Experts also said the risk to consumers was low .
“ These compounds take a long time to accumulate in the body , so a relatively short period of exposure would have little impact on the total body burden , ” said Professor Alan Boobis , toxicologist at Imperial College London .

“ One would have to be exposed to high levels for a long period of time before there would be a health risk . ”
Irish officials compared the case to a contamination scare in Belgian poultry in 1999 , which has not been found to have had any negative health effects .
They added that pork products would return to the shelves within days .
The European Commission said Ireland had acted well and quickly in recalling all locally produced pork products .
But people in Dublin were worried .
Teresa Moran , 57 , a careworker and mother of five , said : “ I have two pieces of pork in the freezer and I ’m afraid of my life to touch them .
I do n’t know what we are going to do about the ham for Christmas .
We ’ll just have to wait and see . ”
Ireland ’s Food Minister Trevor Sargent said the problem may originate with by - products of baking that are dried to be used as animal feed .
The fuel used in the drying process should be a food - grade oil .
“ We do have our suspicions this time that the oil being used was not food grade and therefore may have led to the contamination which has caused such a crisis throughout the industry but only affecting a small amount of pork . ”

Bloomberg are reporting ( via Der Standard ) that Austrian banks have the biggest exposure to Forex lending in Eastern Europe .
This is hardly breaking news , and I have had working notes for a post on this lying around for months ( here , please excuse the mess , I will append some of this to this post if time permits at the weekend ) .
The issue is simply finding the time to do everything .
Basically I would say that all this business about not devaluing currencies ( and hence imposing wage cuts ) in Eastern Europe is to do with this issue ( also highly exposed are the Swedish banks , and Italy ’s Unicredit ) .
Der Standard cite an as yet unpublished International Monetary Fund report to the effect that Austrian banks have loans outstanding in Eastern Europe equal to about 70 percent of the countryâ€™s gross domestic product , a higher percentage exposure than any other country .
If you are in the business of liking scary quotes , you could try this one ( which comes from the king of scary quotes and dreaded anthropologist ’s grandson – Ambrose Evans Pritchard – but that does n’t make it any less scary :
â€ œThis is the biggest currency crisis the world has ever seen , â€ said Neil Mellor , a strategist at Bank of New York Mellon .
Experts fear the mayhem may soon trigger a chain reaction within the eurozone itself .
The risk is a surge in capital flight from Austria â€ “ the country , as it happens , that set off the global banking collapse of May 1931 when Credit - Anstalt went down â€ “ and from a string of Club Med countries that rely on foreign funding to cover huge current account deficits .
The more sobre version would be this one from Paul Krugman that I keep using :
â€ œThere is a burgeoning economic crisis in the European periphery , â€ Krugman said on the ABC network Dec. 14 .
â€ œThe money has dried up .
Thatâ€™s the new center , the center of this crisis has moved from the U.S. housing market to the European periphery .â€ 
Either way , the economic meltdown in parts of Europe ’s Eastern and Southern periphery is now in the process of working its way back up the pipes and to the core , to Germany in terms of the collapse in GDP growth and exports , and to Austria in terms of stress on the banking system .
Germanyâ€™s economy may have contracted the most in more than two decades in the final quarter of 2008 as the global financial crisis hurt exports and damped spending , the Federal Statistics Office said .
The economy probably shrank between 1.5 percent and 2 percent in the fourth quarter from the third , Norbert Raeth , an economist at the statistics office , said at a press conference in Frankfurt today .
A 2 percent drop would be the worst quarterly contraction since German reunification in 1990 and the most for West Germany since the first quarter of 1987 .

And while I am here , Izabella Kaminska has a timely piece on forex lending exposure in Poland over FT Alphaville .
The situation in Poland is important , since the country is widely regarded as the strongest and least vulnerable of the EU10 economies ( see Christoph Rosenberg , for example ) .
So basically , I would say that rather than being just one more “ meltdown ” in Eastern Europe , if Poland crumbles this will be the last domino to fall , bringing all the rest down in its train – craaaash ( I wrote a longish piece on Poland back in October , here ) .
The Leu and the Forint will need to correct to levels which bring back export competitiveness , and behind them will come the pegs in the Baltics and Bulgaria , bring with them all the west european banks who funded the lending .
We are winning in Iraq , John McCain declared in the presidential debate last week , " and we will come home with victory and with honour . "
This may sound like some perfunctory keep - the - pecker - up stuff from a former military man .
But the Republican candidate , who believes that the " surge " has succeeded in Iraq , also possesses the fanatical conviction that heavier bombing and more ground troops could have saved the United States from disgrace in Vietnam .
On the same occasion , Barack Obama , who seems more aware of the costs of American honour to the American economy , claimed he would divert troops from Iraq to Afghanistan and , if necessary , order them to assault " safe havens " for terrorists in Pakistan 's wild west .
Both candidates sought the imprimatur of Henry Kissinger , the co-alchemist , with Richard Nixon , of the " peace with honour " formula in Vietnam , which turned out to include the destruction of neighbouring Cambodia .
An ominously similar escalation of the " war on terror " has ensured that the next American president will receive a septic chalice from George Bush in January 2009 .
In July , Bush sanctioned raids into Pakistan , pre-empting Obama 's tough - sounding strategy of widening the war in Afghanistan , where resurgent Taliban this year account for Nato 's highest death toll since 2001 .
Pakistan 's army chief vowed to defend his country " at all costs " , and his soldiers now clash with US troops almost daily .
Obscured by the American economy 's slow - motion train wreck , the war on terror has already stumbled into its most treacherous phase with the invasion of fiercely nationalistic and nuclear - armed Pakistan .
Most of the recent disasters of geopolitical machismo could have been foretold .
In late 2003 , when the occupation of Iraq was beginning to go badly wrong , the American journalist Dexter Filkins came across a village called Abu Hishma in the Sunni triangle .
Rubble - strewn and " encased in razor wire " , Abu Hishma resembled , Filkins writes in The Forever War : Dispatches from the War on Terror ( Bodley Head ) , " a town in the West Bank " .
Its terrified residents told him about the local American commander Nathan Sassaman , who bulldozed homes and called in air strikes , and who was fond of proclaiming that " there is no God - I am god here " .
Sassaman sounds like something out of Conrad , the white man in the tropics driven to lunacy by absolute power and extreme isolation .
But , according to Filkins , he is a bright man , even the " embodiment of the best that America could offer " in his desire to bring democracy to Iraqis .
A serious reader of history and anthropology , Sassaman , along with fellow officers , is very impressed by a book entitled The Arab Mind , by Raphael Patai , a Hungarian - Israeli - American academic .
Apparently , it makes clear that the " only thing " the denizens of the Middle East " understand is force - force , pride and saving face " , and Sassaman believes that , " with a heavy dose of fear and violence , and a lot of money for projects ... we can convince these people that we are here to help them " .
Filkins does n't mention that The Arab Mind , originally published in 1973 , was the bible of neocon commentators in Washington and New York cheerleading the Bush administration 's audacious venture : what Condoleezza Rice in the new book by Bob Woodward , The War Within : A Secret White House History 2006 - 2008 ( Simon & Schuster ) , describes as shifting the " epicentre of American power " from Europe , where it had rested since the second world war , to the Middle East .
Widely read in the US military , The Arab Mind later inspired the modus operandi of the jailers of Abu Ghraib .
More surprisingly , respectable intellectuals , journalists and academics echoed its generalisations .
Among these people was the historian Bernard Lewis , who assured Dick Cheney , one of his most devoted readers , that " in that part of the world , nothing matters more than resolute will and force " .
The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman ( who is on Sassaman 's reading list ) exhorted the US to act " just a little bit crazy " , since " the more frightened our enemies are today , the fewer we will have to fight tomorrow " .
Accordingly , Richard Armitage , assistant secretary of state and a relative moderate among the Bush administration 's hawks , told Pakistani diplomats that the US would bomb their country " back to the stone age " if it did not withdraw its support for the Taliban .
The idea that the natives would recognise superior firepower when they saw it seemed to be validated by Pakistani acquiescence , followed by the Taliban 's swift capitulation .
Iraq was logically the next setting for shock - and - awe tactics - Donald Rumsfeld was complaining even before the aerial bombing of the Taliban had finished that Afghanistan had run out of targets .
The Bush administration claimed that Saddam Hussein had to be disarmed to make the Middle East safe for democracy .
But invading Iraq was also an image - making exercise - what Hannah Arendt , commenting on the absence of clear military goals in America 's previous war of choice in Vietnam , described as the attempt by " a superpower to create for itself an image which would convince the world that it was indeed ' the mightiest power on earth ' " .
Busy unleashing his awesome firepower on Iraq , Rumsfeld had no idea what to do after his streamlined army reached Baghdad , apart from letting stuff happen .
Wiser in Battle , the memoir of the US lieutenant general Ricardo Sanchez ( HarperCollins ) , reveals that , as the Iraqi resistance unexpectedly intensified , the defeat in Vietnam began to prey on Bush 's mind , unravelling his syntax as he harangued his commanders in Iraq :
Kick ass ! ...
We must be tougher than hell !
This Vietnam stuff , this is not even close .
It is a mind - set .
We can't send that message .
It 's an excuse to prepare us for withdrawal ...
There is a series of moments and this is one of them .
Our will is being tested , but we are resolute .
We have a better way .
Stay strong !
Stay the course !
Kill them !
Be confident !
Prevail !
We are going to wipe them out !
We are not blinking !
Thomas Ricks , the Washington Post 's Pentagon correspondent , describes in his book Fiasco ( Penguin ) how , after a mob ambushed and killed four American military contractors in Falluja , the commanders were ordered to " go in and clobber " .
Citing strategic and logistical reasons , the military chiefs pleaded for restraint , but they were overruled by the White House : the destruction of Falluja was as essential to the image - making exercise as the carpet - bombing of Vietnam and Cambodia .
The geopolitical consequences as well as the " collateral " damage of the exhibition of US might are succinctly outlined by the titles of recent books - The Forever War , Fiasco and Ahmed Rashid 's Descent into Chaos ( Allen Lane ) .
Rashid is clearly the most despairing among the journalists accompanying the march of folly , even though , as a Pakistani long accustomed to the pretensions and limits of US power in south Asia , he did n't start off with many illusions .
His previous book described how a combination of selfish motives and reckless actions by the US facilitated the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
" Outsiders like me , " he writes in Descent into Chaos , " found it remarkable that a US president could live in such an unreal world , where the entire military and intelligence establishments were so gullible , the media so complacent , Congress so unquestioning - all of them involved in feeding half - truths to the American public . "
The habitual deceivers are often , in the end , the most deceived .
According to Rashid , Pervez Musharraf 's regime in Pakistan may have pulled off one of the biggest swindles in recent history by persuading the Bush administration to part with $ 10bn in exchange for mostly empty promises of support for its " war on terror " .
Most Pakistanis feel a mix of contempt and distrust for the US , which abandoned their country after enlisting it in a proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan .
Confronted with a choice between regressing to the stone age and meeting crazy Uncle Sam 's demands , Musharraf 's regime adopted a policy of dissembling that the then foreign minister outlined as " First say yes , and later say but " .
Since 9/11 , the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , Pakistan 's rogue spy agency , which has long considered Afghanistan as its backyard , has continued to provide sanctuary and military support for the Taliban while occasionally arresting some al - Qaida militants to appease Washington .
Mullah Omar and the original Afghan Taliban Shura , Rashid claims , are serenely resident in Pakistan 's borderlands , along with " a plethora of Asian and Arab terrorist groups who are now expanding their reach into Europe and the United States " .
" I 'm not , " Bush said soon after 9/11 , " going to fire a $ 2 m missile at a $ 10 empty tent and hit a camel in the butt . "
Hitting camels in the butt may have been more useful than disbursing $ 70 m in bribes to warlords such as Abdul Rashid Dostum , whom Rashid revealed in his previous book to be fond of driving tanks over his opponents .
The US coaxed many of Afghanistan 's old villains out of retirement to defeat the Taliban with minimum use of US troops , and then lost interest in the country .
Rashid believes that the US could have done more to help " nation - building " in Afghanistan or at least prop up Hamid Karzai , who last week was reduced to plaintively asking Mullah Omar to return to Afghanistan for the sake of " peace " .
But as Tariq
Ali bluntly clarifies in his new book The Duel : Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power ( Simon & Schuster ) , the post - 9/11 project of " nation - building " in Afghanistan , which prioritised western interests over all others , was always doomed .
It was " a top - down process " , trying to create " an army constituted not to defend the nation but to impose order on its own people , on behalf of outside powers ; a civil administration that will have no control over planning , health , education etc , all of which will be run by NGOs , whose employees will be far better paid than the locals , and answerable not to the population but to their overseas sponsors ; and a government whose foreign policy is identical to Washington's . "
American bombing raids , which have killed hundreds of civilians in Afghanistan , further unite fractious Afghans against foreign usurpers .
Tariq
Ali correctly prescribes scepticism against strategists and journalists who blame Pakistan for increasing attacks on western forces in Afghanistan while disregarding the fact that " many Afghans who detest the Taliban are so angered by the failures of Nato and the behaviour of its troops that they will support any opposition . "
In Pakistan , too , public anger against the US is fuelled largely by the " knowledge that Washington has backed every military dictator who has squatted on top of the country " .
Contemptuously dismissing the alarmist cliché that jihadis are very close to getting their grubby fingers on the country 's nuclear button , Ali points to the deep and persistent unpopularity of religious parties in Pakistan .
The jihadis would only get that far , he asserts , if " the army wanted them to " , which is virtually impossible unless , as may be beginning to happen now , American assaults on the country 's hard - won sovereignty causes deep ideological ruptures within the country 's strongest institution .
Filkins does n't set out any future trajectory for the venture in Iraq .
He reported from the country for the New York Times , but the first - person narrator of The Forever War is less a journalist than an existential hero , eloquent with the pathos of Sisyphean striving , impotence and failure .
Composed in short , often lyrical , sections , Filkins 's book often seems aimed at literary posterity , where it would join such modern classics of war literature as Ernst Junger 's Storm of Steel , André Malraux 's La Condition Humaine and Michael Herr 's Dispatches
Unlike the war in Vietnam , which exercised some of the keenest literary sensibilities in America ( Norman Mailer , Mary McCarthy , Susan Sontag ) , the entanglement in Iraq and Afghanistan has produced , so far at least , a meagre crop of quality journalism .
The Forever War , which generally eschews historical overviews and extended analysis , succeeds more than most recent books in making cinematically vivid and imaginatively coherent the many places of horror and bewilderment that Americans have stumbled into during the " war on terror " .
This is what it is like - its brief confessions of doubt , confusion , panic and weariness seem to say - for an American young man witnessing the terrible violence of places such as Iraq and Afghanistan .
Filkins has the exasperation of the well - travelled and atrocity - hardened journalist with his sheltered compatriots back home .
The attack on the twin towers in New York makes him think that " I was back in the third world ...
My countrymen are going to think this is the end of the world , the worst thing that ever happened .
In the third world this sort of thing happens every day . "
After the cyclone in Orissa , Filkins writes , " the dead were piled so high and for so long that the dogs could n't eat any more " .
But as he strives to share with us the cruelty and tragedy of the world outside the west , he inadvertently reveals his historical innocence as well as hinting at a wider incomprehension of the postcolonial world and the decolonised mind .
" Do Americans imagine , " Jonathan Schell once wrote , " that the people of the world , having overthrown the territorial empires , are ready to bend the knee to an American overlord in the 21st ? "
Even at his most tormented , Filkins does n't really ask this crucial question , though he cannot help but be aware of the Iraqi people 's eagerness to see the back of their " liberators " - to " tell the Americans what they want to hear and they will go away , and we can carry on the way we want " .
In a brilliantly paced account of Falluja , Filkins describes Iraqi children recoiling from American candy as if it were " radioactive " and remarks that the city " was like that from the start , even before the big battle in November 2004 .
Anything the Americans tried there turned to dust . "
This may convey well to an American audience the frustration of their do - gooding representatives in Iraq who alternate bombs with candy .
But Filkins would have advanced a greater appreciation of national or tribal feeling in Iraq if he had explained that residents of Falluja were equally intransigent in 1920 , when the British imperial army had to destroy the city in order to save it .
As perplexed as the British once were about Iraq ( " so complex , its ways so labyrinthine " ) , Filkins writes with obvious fascination about Ahmed Chalabi , the Iraqi expatriate who managed to deceive some of the shrewdest politicians and journalists in America .
In many ways , Chalabi , a chronic conspirator with mysterious allies in Iran , vindicates John Quincy Adams 's warning to his young nation in 1821 against European - style imperialist adventures : by going " abroad " , Adams wrote , " in search of monsters to destroy " , America would " involve herself beyond the power of extraction in all the wars of interest and intrigue , of individual avarice , envy and ambition " .
But Chalabi , for Filkins , embodies Iraq 's vexations rather than American blundering .
" When I looked , " he writes , " into Chalabi 's eyes and saw the mirrors and doors closing , I knew that I was seeing not just the essence of the man but of the country to which he 'd returned .
L'etat c'est lui .
Chalabi was Iraq . "
Whatever may be said about this amiable fraud , he was certainly not Iraq - the country he had barely set foot in for more than 40 years before the US invasion .
Though easily the most original and intense American book yet on the war in Iraq , The Forever War is far from matching the stupendous achievement of Neil Sheehan 's A Bright Shining Lie , which expresses more resonantly the American reporter 's angst while ruthlessly investigating specific national flaws - racism , cold war paranoia , belief in technology - that entrapped the US in Vietnam .
By abandoning the tasks of analysis and introspection , Filkins 's book makes us suspect that the " forever war " might make a new generation of can - do Americans weary , but not wiser .
" I 'd gotten caught up , " he writes at one point , " in the trappings and the pronouncements of officialdom , Iraqi and American . "
It is an admirably honest confession , but not one that the best US journalists covering their country 's last big war would have made .
Arriving in Vietnam in the early 1960s to report what was then a covert US operation , Homer Bigart , David Halberstam , Charley Mohr and Sheehan spent only a few weeks in the fog of official bluster .
Their boldness was especially remarkable because the US media in the 1950s had largely shared a consensus about the dangers of communism with the White House and State Department , which regarded even newspapers such as the New York Times as extensions of foreign policy .
Ignoring the adversarial standard set by Halberstam and Sheehan , many US journalists and commentators in the post - cold - war era have been too eager to uphold their government 's claims .
It is not clear if Filkins was one of the liberal interventionists with a naive faith in the Bush administration 's promise to promote democracy through war .
Certainly his frequent laments about the inept handling of the invasion and occupation of Iraq do not lead him to conclude that an intrinsically bad idea could have been handled much differently .
He can also permit himself the belief that " perhaps in the hideous present some larger good was being born " .
This has the unfortunate echo of Condoleezza Rice 's assertion , as Israel devastated Lebanon in 2006 , that we were witnessing the " birth pangs of a new Middle East " : that is , the Lebanese , bombed into a revolt against Hizbullah , would make their country safe for pro-Israeli and pro-American democracy .
Totalitarian regimes and terrorist groups commonly use violence as a means to large - scale political engineering ; it is more remarkable when democratic countries such as Israel and America do so , usually in flagrant disregard of the lessons of contemporary history .
In A Choice of Enemies : America Confronts the Middle East ( Weidenfeld & Nicolson ) , Lawrence Freedman describes in detail the awful results - the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees , the rise of Hizbullah - of Israel 's previous attempt in 1982 to redraw the map of the Middle East by assaulting Lebanon .
It is one thing for a small country with a perennial existential crisis to believe that , as the Israeli general Moshe Dayan once put it , " it was in our power to set a high price on our blood , a price too high for the Arab community , the Arab army or the Arab governments to think it worth paying " .
But how did the US let its foreign policy become hostage to a strategy of pre-emptive war and brutal retaliation ?
" How , " Freedman asks , " had the United States gotten itself in this position , entangled in the confusing and often violent geopolitics of the Middle East and beset by enemies on all sides . "
This is a bigger story than anyone can tell in one book , and the 600 pages of A Choice of Enemies cover only US foreign policy decisions from 1979 , with the Islamic revolution in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan .
Freedman is forced to skim some important details of the relationship between the US and Israel , whose continuing expansion into the occupied West Bank is probably the greatest source of the so - called Arab rage .
The State Department in 1948 argued passionately against supporting a Jewish state in Palestine .
The Eisenhower administration , which saw Israel as an irritant , undermining the US alliance with anti-Soviet regimes in the Middle East , ensured that the joint Anglo - French - Israeli attack on Egypt would fail .
John F Kennedy sent feelers to Egypt 's fiercely anti-Zionist president Gamal Abdel Nasser .
Lyndon B Johnson was the first US president to manipulate foreign policy in order to bolster Jewish - American support for the Democratic party ; but even he was not able to build his " special relationship " with Israel without encountering strong opposition from American diplomats .
" I could not believe what I was hearing , " Jimmy Carter wrote in his diary after Menachem Begin confided in him his desire to reduce Palestinians on the West Bank to a minority .
Even Ronald Reagan , who believed that God fixed the Middle East as the site of Armageddon , stuck to a cold war policy of close relations with reliably anti-Soviet and oil - rich Arab regimes .
Friendly to Saudi Arabia , Bush Sr was actively hostile to Israeli expansionism .
His secretary of state , James Baker , had only blunt wisdom ( " Forswear annexation .
Stop settlement activity .
Reach out to Palestinians as neighbours who deserve political rights " ) to impart to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , the powerful lobbying outfit for Israel , to which even Obama must now genuflect .
Israel played a very small role in the blunders US administrations made in the late 1970s : to support the Shah of Iran long after his rule became widely despised and unsustainable , and , more fatefully , to mobilise a global Islamic jihad against Soviet communism .
Trying to turn Afghanistan , as Carter 's national security adviser , Zbigniew Brzezinski , exulted , into the " Soviet Union 's own Vietnam " , the CIA chose Pakistan as a logistical base for its anti-communist jihad .
It funnelled money and arms to the ISI , which in turn passed on some of them to its own Islamist protégés ( some of whom are now fighting US and Nato troops in Afghanistan ) .
Radicals from Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Algeria and other Arab countries flocked to Pakistan to contribute to the holy war against atheistic communism .
Freedman 's statistics are a grim reminder of how the blowback from this first global jihad wrecked Pakistan long before it crashed into the west on September 11 2001 .
Pakistan , which had 900 religious schools in 1971 , had " about 8,000 official and as many as 25,000 unregistered madrassas " by 1988 .
But if US officials noticed their indirect sponsorship of radical Islam , they did not care .
As Freedman writes , " the Reagan administration associated terrorism with leftist , secular groups linked to nationalist movements , whether the Irish , Basques or Palestinians ...
Arab militants coming to support the jihad were seen at most as the equivalent of the idealists of the 1930s who joined the International Brigades during the Spanish civil war . "
Freedman recalls , too , some of the other political machinations that have come to haunt present generations : US support for Iraq in the latter 's long war against Iran , which emboldened Saddam Hussein all through the 1980s , and the deliberate indifference to the victims of Iraq 's chemical warfare .
At least in these and other cynical moves , the US could claim the sanction of realpolitik .
Great powers often have to make unpleasant choices to protect their interests ; they have also been known occasionally to thrash ( Reagan in Grenada , Putin in Georgia ) a pesky neighbour or two .
What is startlingly new is the Bush administration 's experiment of intimidating entire peoples as well as governments in the Middle East into accepting America 's worldwide hegemony .
Seven years on , hundreds of thousands are dead , and millions of refugees on the move , while the US seems only to have boosted its old enemies in Afghanistan , Iran and Lebanon , and created formidable new ones in Iraq and Pakistan .
In The War Within , Woodward shows the US president slipping deeper into his own world .
" We 're killin ' 'em !
We 're killin ' 'em all ! "
But not even the Bush administration , which has proved ready to do unspeakable things to its perceived enemies , can kill them all .
It can continue to stage elaborate shock - and - awe spectacles , but if , as is increasingly evident , the target audience refuses to be impressed by them , they are rendered utterly futile - even dangerously counterproductive .
" Force , " as James Baldwin pointed out in the early 1970s during the US bombing of Indochina , " does not work the way its advocates seem to think it does .
It does not , for instance , reveal to the victim the strength of his adversary .
On the contrary , it reveals the weakness , even the panic of his adversary and this revelation invests the victim with patience . "
Apparently routed by heavy B - 52 bombing in 2001 , the Taliban are resurgent , straining the military resources of the US and Nato in Afghanistan to the limit .
In Iraq the strategy based on overwhelming force has proved to be a catastrophic failure , and had to be replaced by General David Petraeus 's new counter - insurgency doctrine that emphasises political over military tactics .
Nevertheless , McCain pledges " victory " in Iraq , whatever that takes , including a 100 - year - long military presence in the country ; threatening Russia , he also seems ready to bomb Iran .
Obama , though keen to withdraw troops from Iraq , upholds the complacently bipartisan consensus about Afghanistan .
But more US troops in the Pashtun heartland may merely underscore the lesson learned at a terrible cost by the British army in 1839 - 42 and 1878 - 80 , and the Soviet army in 1979 - 89 .
" A troop increase , " Rory Stewart recently reiterated in Time magazine , " is likely to inflame Afghan nationalism because Afghans are more anti-foreign than we acknowledge , and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining . "
The violation of Pakistan 's sovereignty threatens to be the most calamitous of recent US misadventures .
A gracious acceptance of the limits of US firepower may not be forthcoming from the next administration , which will face the hard choice to get out or fight on .
Indeed , failure may make it even more determined to maintain the pride of US arms and the image of the mightiest power on earth .
The prospect of humiliation in Vietnam was what prompted Nixon 's devastation of Cambodia , setting the stage for the genocidal Pol Pot .
As Hannah Arendt wrote , " when all signs pointed to defeat " , the goal was " no longer one of avoiding humiliating defeat but of finding ways and means to avoid admitting it and ' save face ' . "
Could smashing up Iran or invading Pakistan become the face - saving formula for the exponents of " shock and awe " ?
Certainly , they see US force impressing the Persian and the Pakistani mind as it apparently has the Arab mind .
And such is the crazy logic of a wounded militarism that , notwithstanding its battered economy , the US may soon be embattled on many more fronts in what is already its most damaging war .

Citizens turned out on the Mall to watch the event on giant screens tomorrow will have a second chance to see the invocation by Gene Robinson , the gay Episcopal bishop , a source at the Presidential Inauguration Committee said .
" Yesterday 's program will be shown on the jumbo screens on the Mall to entertain the assembled crowd .
Tomorrow 's version will include Robinson 's prayer , " the source said .
A spokesman for the Inaugural Committee , Josh Earnest , also said that HBO 's rights to yesterday 's event are limited : the committee owns the copyright to the event , but HBO has a license to broadcast it for six months .
That makes it less likely that the concert will be kept out of the historical record of , for instance , documentaries of the event .

A reader has a problem with religion in her family and she could use your help .
My mother - in - law is starting to indoctrinate my child !
I suppose I may have played some role in triggering what seems to be a recent surge in proselytizing .
In recent months , for the first time , I have discussed my own beliefs openly to my in - laws during meal times , I suppose setting off the warning sirens :
Save the granddaughter !
Save the granddaughter !
On the other hand , she is very involved in her faith so it ’s not exactly a huge surprise she is now teaching my daughter to pray to Jesus and that “ Jesus is coming back . ”
Ick .
I realize the potential for having an ugly showdown with my M - I - L , either in person or through my sweet vulnerable daughter , is all too present .
I do n’t want to hurt my daughter by engaging in categorical prohibitions or by disparaging rejection of this belief system she is now “ trying on for size . ”
I ’ve been trying to embrace the opportunity for discussing a lot of interesting ideas about the world with my daughter , staying real , taking her seriously .
Last night I went so far as to agree to hold hands around the table and “ talk to Jesus ” when she suggested it because it was obvious she really wanted to and I did n’t want to just disengage .
But I had my own things to say to “ Jesus ” — not purely angry or rejecting things , but trying to plant a healthy independence of thought from the inside out .
I ’m really new at this and could use some good feedback .
Does anyone else have some specific methods or experiences with a healthy , child - centered approach to combating proselytizing , given that I think it ’s unlikely my mother - in - law is going to change her ways and I am unwilling to cut off her relationship with my child ?
What do you say to your children when you hear them repeating religious dogma you disagree with ?

Edinburgh 's Holyrood district is among the loneliest places to live , the study says Community life in Britain has weakened substantially over the past 30 years , according to research commissioned by the BBC .
Analysis of census data reveals how neighbourhoods in every part of the UK have become more socially fragmented .
The study assesses the health of a community by looking at how rooted people are in their neighbourhood .
Academics created " loneliness indices " , to identify where people had a " feeling of not belonging " .
Substantial changes
The study ranks places using a formula based on the proportion of people in an area who are single , those who live alone , the numbers in private rented accommodation and those who have lived there for less than a year .
The higher the proportion of people in those categories , the less rooted the community , according to social scientists .
They refer to it as the level of " anomie " or the " feeling of not belonging " .
THE REPORT IN FULL
Changing UK [ 1.57 MB ]
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here Professor Daniel Dorling , who headed the research team at the University of Sheffield , said the measures could also be described as " loneliness indices " .
Comparing the figures from the 1971 census with those in 2001 reveals substantial change .
Every region in the UK , broadly defined by a BBC local radio areas , has seen its communities become less rooted .
Census figures for Northern Ireland in 1971 were unavailable but later census data reveals that this trend is reflected here too .
" Even the weakest communities in 1971 were stronger than any community now , " says Professor Dorling .
The researchers conclude that the increase in anomie weakens the " social glue " of communities .
The result , they suggest , is that neighbourhoods are likely to be less trusting and more fearful .
These trends may be linked to higher likelihoods of fearfulness because we are less likely to see and therefore understand each others ' lives
Professor Daniel Dorling
University of Sheffield
The local radio area with the strongest communities on this measure is Stoke - on - Trent .
Edinburgh has the weakest communities .
Student influence
The data allows analysis at neighbourhood level .
The locality with the shallowest community roots is Holyrood in Edinburgh .
Other places scoring poorly include Headingley in Leeds , the Hyde Park area of London and the university area of Cardiff .
One key factor in reducing the sense of belonging in a community is having a large student population .
An extraordinary and troubling story is told by these maps

The neighbourhoods revealed as having the deepest roots are the Bramhall area of Stockport in Greater Manchester , Charnwood West near Leicester , Sefton on Merseyside , Upminster in east London and Washington in Sunderland .
However , 97 % of communities in the UK have become more socially fragmented over the past three decades .
" These trends may be linked to higher likelihoods of fearfulness because we are less likely to see and therefore understand each others ' lives , " Professor Dorling said .
" The polarisation and segregation processes may also lead to stronger feelings of isolation . "
Immigration impact
The causes of social fragmentation are linked to mobility .
Increased wealth and improved access to transport has made it easier for people to move for work , for retirement , for schools , for a new life .
The decline in marriage , increasing divorce , immigration and a growing student population are also said to be contributory factors .
The areas which have seen the greatest change to community life have also been mapped .
London has been substantially affected with large - scale immigration thought to have had a big impact on traditional neighbourhoods .
The east of Scotland has also experienced a significant weakening in its communities , driven , in part , by the expansion in further and higher education .
Nottinghamshire has been badly affected .
One theory is that once tight - knit colliery communities have been damaged by the decline in the coal industry .
The South West has also seen a substantial social fragmentation .
The rise in the number of holiday homes in the region has been blamed for undermining community life .

A high profile Congressional committee investigation has revealed that , since 2006 , the outgoing Bush administration has dropped or stalled enforcement actions on more than 500 cases of severe water pollution .
According to the Committee chairmen , the situation is now so bad that , “ the federal government ’s Clean Water Act enforcement program has been decimated over the past two years , imperiling the health and safety of the nation ’s waters . ”
The investigation , carried out by Henry Waxman , House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman and James Oberstar , Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee , unearthed new internal documents revealing that hundreds of Clean Water Act violations have not been pursued with enforcement actions .
Depressingly , it also appears that the situation may well be worse than even this damning investigation indicates .
According to Waxman and Oberstar , “ EPA has withheld hundreds of documents from the Committees .
When documents were provided , the EPA redacted the identity of every corporation or individual accused of polluting waterways , as well as the specific waters affected . ”
The majority of the lost enforcement actions occurred in EPA Region 6 , which includes the states of New Mexico , Texas , Oklahoma , Arkansas , and Louisiana , where 138 enforcement cases were dropped .
In EPA Region 8 , which includes the states of Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Wyoming , Utah and Colorado , 106 enforcement cases have been dropped .
The chairmen have already written to president - elect Obama stressing their dismay in the strongest possible terms .
Their message to the new administration is clear – it must “ immediately reverse this pattern of leaving waters unprotected and hiding the mess from the public , and support swift Congressional passage of the Clean Water Restoration Act . ”
Something else for Obama ’s rapidly filling inbox then …

The mother of a prisoner who was found hanged in the segregation cell of a troubled privately run prison after being placed on suicide watch told an inquest yesterday how she repeatedly warned officers of her son 's deteriorating mental state .
The death of Michael Bailey , 23 , at HMP Rye Hill near Rugby in Warwickshire led to the trial and subsequent acquittal of four serving prison officers .
A damning inspectors ' report in the month after his death found conditions at the jail to be " unsafe and unstable " for both inmates and staff .
The inquest jury heard that prison staff admitted to Carol Bailey that her son had been harming himself after she raised concerns over his unkempt appearance and increasingly erratic behaviour .
She told the hearing atIrthlingborough , Northamptonshire , that he had been reciting hymns and had stab marks on his hands and scabs around his neck shortly before his death in March 2005 .
She said she had tried to raise her concerns during a series of telephone calls to staff at Rye Hill .
" I thought she [ a female prison officer ] would deal with it , either pass it on or go and check for herself , not just leave it .
I was worried , very worried .
I was very scared – I did not know what was happening and I had not seen anything like this before with Michael or anybody , " she said .

Two days later , her son , from Ladywood , Birmingham , was found hanged .
He was serving a four - year sentence at the prison when he died , the inquest heard .
He would have been eligible for parole in November 2005 and due for release in 2006 .
The inquest heard that Bailey suddenly changed from being a fit , confident and articulate young man to being subdued and quiet in the days leading up to his death .
He was placed on suicide watch after being described as exhibiting " strange " behaviour – including taking his clothes off in the exercise yard , reciting the Lord 's Prayer and mumbling incoherently .
Tom Osborne , assistant deputy coroner for Northamptonshire , said : " Over the course of a few days beginning on 18 March 2005 through to 24 March , he went from being a fit young man who was looking forward to being reunited with his family to a man who had become anguished , confused and , at times , violent . "
Mr Osborne told the jury that during the inquest , which is expected to last up to six weeks , they should consider if the prison authorities took " reasonable steps " to prevent Bailey from taking his own life .
The inquest was told that Rye Hill had experienced problems with " illicit items " being brought into the category B prison , including drugs and mobile phones .
Stephen Hepworth , who was head of operations at the jail at the time of Bailey 's death , said when he visited him in the segregation unit on 21 March , and witnessed his " strange " behaviour , he thought that he had taken drugs .
Mr Hepworth , who worked as a suicide co-ordinator at another prison before joining Rye Hill , did not carry out a drugs test or search his cell , the jury heard .
When asked why by the family 's lawyer , Leslie Thomas , Mr Hepworth replied : " I do not recall why I did not make that decision . "
Mr Hepworth admitted that , with hindsight , he could have dealt with the situation differently .
The inquest continues .
As President - elect Barack Obama hosted a gala for some of his earliest and most loyal financial supporters Thursday evening , his aides released new information showing the magnitude of their feat :
They raised nearly $ 1 billion for his campaign and other election - related efforts .
The total includes already recorded and estimated fundraising for his campaign , the national convention , his transition and his upcoming inauguration .
That sets a new and dramatically higher bar for future presidential candidates , radically changing the financial definition of a serious bid for the White House .
Roughly three - quarters of the money Obama raised was directly channeled to his nearly - two - year campaign , using old - school techniques as well as an Internet - based operation .

A disclosure report filed late Thursday showed Obama raised $ 111 million from Oct. 16 through Nov. 24 .
That brings his campaign total to $ 770 million , easily more than the combined fundraising for the 2004 election by President Bush and Democratic Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts .
Not including money that was later distributed to his campaign , Obama also helped raise more than $ 100 million for a joint fund he had with the Democratic National Committee .
The party used that money for voter turnout and other election - related activities .
A host committee for the Democratic National Convention in Denver also raised about $ 61 million .
Obama ’s transition and inaugural committees are likely to raise $ 50 million or more .

The flood of money provided Obama crucial strategic advantages in the election , allowing him to deploy resources to compete in traditionally Republican states .
Obama was even able to do what only billionaire Ross Perot had done before : purchase a half - hour of prime - time network television to make an extended closing argument during the final week of the campaign .
His fundraising totals were possible because he rejected public financing of his general - election campaign and its attendant spending limits .
He was the only major - party nominee to do so since major campaign finance measures were passed in the wake of Watergate .
Republican John McCain , who accepted taxpayer money , was limited to spending $ 84 million from September on .
As recently as Wednesday , Obama supporters received an e-mail solicitation on behalf of the Democratic National Committee .
The pitch offered a “ limited edition ” Obama coffee mug in exchange for a contribution of $ 15 or more .

Want :
A guy in North Carolina has the original flying saucer spaceship model from the movie " Forbidden Planet " , and he 's auctioning it off to pay for his bills ( specifically , electricity to power his Christmas lights ) .
The auction is Thursday , and if any BABloggee has $ 100,000 they want to give me , I 'll let you come to my house after I buy the ship and I 'll even let you hold it .
But only for a second .
[ Edited to add : assuming this thing is legit .
Rereading the news article it occurs to me that this guy may be , um , well , not so legit . ]
Oh man .
I would love to have that ship .
" Forbidden Planet " is awesome , a classic .
And it 's a flying saucer !
That rawks !
Someone tell BABloggee Jack Hagerty .
I bet he'd saw off his own leg for that model .
Tip o' the Krell brain booster to Fark .
The thought of people refusing to serve a person of color due to their personal objection to desegregation is now considered indefensible , but refusal of service due to personal religious objections is not a thing of the past .
When I think of refusal of
services the first thing that comes to mind is a story my mother told
me from her childhood when a restaurant in Mississippi refused to seat
her family based on legal racial segregation .
She was a young
child but the memory stuck with her and she shared the story with me
to explain that there was a time when inequality was protected by law
and how that inequality had an impact on her life .
She made certain
to point out that many segregationists justified their bigotry based
on religious grounds .
The thought of people refusing to serve
a person of color due to their personal objection to desegregation is
now considered indefensible and a violation of the law , but refusal
of service due to personal religious objections is not a thing of the
past .
Pharmacists in Washington State can refuse to fill prescriptions ,
for example a prescription for Plan B , if they feel that doing so conflicts
with their religious beliefs .
Pharmacy refusal and refusals of
service are threats to the rights and health of women and defending
against those threats and the erosion of rights that they represent
is a crucial front in the reproductive justice struggle .
Like most people , I thought
that getting a prescription filled was a simple process .
A person
goes to their doctor , gets a prescription , drops it off at a pharmacy
and the pharmacist fills it .
The idea that an insurer would refuse
to cover , a doctor would refuse to prescribe or a pharmacist would refuse
to fill that prescription on religious grounds and that her or his refusal
would be protected by law never crossed my mind until my home state
of Missouri ’s legislature entertained a bill containing protections
for pharmacies earlier this year .
As Amanda Marcotte explored
in her piece Freedom’s
Just Another Word for Punishing Women ,
pharmacy refusal is a key anti-choice tool that has less to do with
protecting religious freedom than protecting misogyny and forcing women
to bend to the will of the religious right .
So how did this happen ?
Shortly after the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 , Congress passed
the Church Amendment
that allows healthcare providers to cite religious grounds in order
to refuse to provide services .
Specifically , the Church Amendment
prevents the government , as a condition of a federal grant , from requiring
healthcare providers to perform or assist in abortion or sterilization
procedures against their moral or religious convictions .
It also prevents
institutions receiving certain federal funds from taking action against
personnel because of their participation , nonparticipation or beliefs
about abortion or sterilization .
Within five years of passage of the
Church Amendment , the majority of states adopted refusal clauses and
refusal clauses have been extended to include assisted reproductive
technologies , contraception and emergency contraception , human embryonic
or fetal research , in vitro fertilization , and stem cell research .

That brings us to the example
of Washington State , where pharmacists can refuse to fill prescriptions
if they feel that doing so conflicts with their religious beliefs .
On April 12 , 2007 , the
Washington State Pharmacy Board adopted rules
requiring pharmacies to ensure that patients are able to get prescriptions
filled on site and in a timely manner .
The rules require pharmacies
to dispense all lawfully prescribed drugs and devices , clarifying that
a pharmacist ’s personal and / or moral judgments have no place at the
pharmacy counter .
On September 27th , 2007 , a judge presiding over a
pharmacy refusal lawsuit issued a preliminary order preventing those
rules requiring pharmacies to fill all lawful prescriptions without
discrimination or delay from taking effect .
As The Northwest Women’s
Law Center pointed
out in their statement about the ruling , the rules were adopted to promote
the health of Washingtonians and the ruling preventing those rules from
being applied put the health of all Washington residents at risk .
Sarah Dunne , legal Director of the ACLU of Washington , pointed out in a
statement issued shortly after the prevention ruling that " The Pharmacy Board rules
strike the appropriate balance between patients ’ rights of access to
medication and pharmacists ’ individual rights .
We hope the court ultimately
will recognize this and reinstate the rules . "
Access to reproductive healthcare
is being denied on religious grounds through refusals to cover prescriptions
too .
One key question is whether a healthcare insurance provider
can refuse to cover services on religious grounds if they receive federal
funds .
Catholics
for Choice
( CFC ) approached that question from the angle of the Catholic healthcare
system and its impact on reproductive healthcare .
Some Catholic
HMOs receive payment for services from federal programs like Medicaid ,
which mandates a provision of family planning services .
In their
report Catholic
HMOs and Reproductive Health Care ,
CFC explored the growth of Catholic managed care and the question of
refusal of services and found that , of the 48 Catholic managed care
plans CFC identified serving some 2.5 million Americans , 25 ( representing
52 % of all the Catholic plans identified ) are providing contraceptive
coverage for enrollees and some of those specify that they will only
cover oral contraception .
The public policy implications
are clear , since coverage is a key factor in access to reproductive
healthcare and federal mandates should protect that access .
But
the CFC report found that there are few formal regulations that require
health plans that refuse to provide family planning services to disclose
this clearly on marketing and enrollment materials .
As a result ,
employers may select a plan and have no idea that it limits or denies
access to reproductive healthcare due to a lack of coverage .
Employees
would then be left to seek reproductive healthcare elsewhere and shoulder
the additional costs or go without that healthcare entirely .
It ’s not as if there are n’t
ways to balance individual freedoms .
In their report , CFC identified
several methods that Catholic healthcare plans may use to make reproductive
health services available to enrollees without compromising their organizations
beliefs .
The key element is distancing the Catholic plan from the direct
provision of and / or direct payment for forbidden services .
The
Catholic plan can contract with non-Catholic providers , such as another
hospital or clinic , to provide the services .
They could also arrange
for the money they receive from enrollees or their employers that goes
to pay for reproductive health services to go through third - party .
Or a Catholic plan may arrange for another insurer to handle payment
and provision of reproductive health services .
So let ’s rewind to my earlier
exploration of going to the doctor , getting a prescription then going
to the pharmacy and getting that prescription filled – things clearly
are n’t as simple as they initially appeared to be .
A woman may
be denied access as a result of her healthcare insurance provider ’s
refusal of coverage , she may have a doctor refuse to treat her or she
may actually make it to the pharmacy only to find that the pharmacist
refuses to fill the prescription on religious grounds .
And access
to reproductive healthcare looks more like a grueling obstacle course
where the game is based on luck and chance than a protected freedom .
Wow
So my first play thru of this its very nice the black and white is impressive , the sounds are dark and scary the controls are nice its a game that makes me want to play it all the way thru and the " MEDALS " are a nice touch .
A very unique concept here and thats what really makes this fun and interesting .
I was glad to have seen and even review this piece as it was highly entertaining and you gave it much effort , Even with the right Attitude and thats what you need to amke something nifty like this , so props to you on that , I wouldnt mind seeing more into this and even more effort but for the most of this it was pretty good stuff .
Sohope this helps good luck I really liked the flash .

The measures aim to improve data sharing between forces Remote searches of suspect computers will form part of an EU plan to tackle hi-tech crime .
The five - year action plan will take steps to combat the growth in cyber theft and the machines used to spread spam and other malicious programs .
It will also encourage better sharing of data among European police forces to track down and prosecute criminals .
Europol will co-ordinate the investigative work and also issue alerts about cyber crime sprees .
Data share
The five - year plan won the backing of the EU ministers at a meeting which also granted 300,000 euros ( £ 250,000 ) to Europol to create the system to pool crime reports and issue alerts about emerging threats .
The ministerial meeting also backed the anti-cyber crime strategy that will see the creation of cross - border investigation teams and sanction the use of virtual patrols to police some areas of the net .
Other " practical measures " include encouraging better sharing of information between police forces in member nations and private companies on investigative methods and trends .
In particular the strategy aims to tackle the trade in images of children being sexually abused .
In a statement outlining the strategy the EU claimed " half of all internet crime involves the production , distribution and sale of child pornography " .
Forces will also take part in " remote searches " and patrol online to track down criminals .
The EU said controls were in place to ensure that data protection laws were not breached as this information was gathered and shared .
" The strategy encourages the much needed operational cooperation and information exchange between the Member States , " said EC vice - president Jacques Barrot in a statement .
" If the strategy is to make the fight against cyber crime more efficient , all stakeholders have to be fully committed to its implementation , " he added .

Cure for cancer may be delayed by years after callous thieves stole top researcher 's laptop
A top surgeon who has dedicated his career to discovering a cure for skin cancer has lost years of critical research after callous thieves stole his laptop .
Tom Chapman , 35 , has spent more than a decade studying how skin cancer manifests and spreads - and believes he was on the verge of a vital breakthrough .
His work was held on a laptop which was stolen when his car was nicked .
Gone : Bristol Hospital registrar Tom Chapman makes an appeal for the return of his laptop containing potentially vital data
He has now made a desperate appeal for the crooks to return his computer - or risk setting back a possible cure for cancer by years .
Mr Chapman said : ' It was all coming together and it 's just caught me at the worst time .
I have backed up bits , but not all of it .
' The laptop was four years old , the speakers do n't work and there 's a crack in the screen .
It is probably worth about £ 5 , but there 's a lot of research information on there .
' The car does not matter , it was a blue 10 - year - old Volvo estate , and I can replace the other things , like the iPod , but if I do n't get this data back it could set me back years .
' No matter how many people you have working on a project like this , it 's something which just can't be replicated overnight . '
Mr Chapman , a specialist registrar in plastic surgery at Frenchay Hospital , Bristol , had been researching growth factors in the spread of melanoma , commonly known as skin cancer .
His research looks at why the cancer , which starts off on the outside of the skin , spreads further into the body and eventually into organs .
He hopes that by discovering why this happens , doctors will be able to stop it and ultimately prevent skin cancer becoming terminal .
But years of hard work were lost when callous crooks broke into the hospital accommodation where he was staying on Tuesday .
Cancer crime :
The thieves broke into accomodation at Frenchay Hospital , Bristol , where Tom Chapman 's car was stolen
The crooks stole Mr Chapman 's Volvo estate , iPod , and , most importantly , the black and silver Compaq laptop his research was stored on .
Much of the information came from looking at skin cancer cells from patients , but Mr Chapman said no patients ' personal data was stored on the computer .
He has now made a public appeal for the safe return of his laptop - which was stored in a leather brown briefcase - in the hope of recovering the lost research .
' I just hope that somebody recognises that it does not have any intrinsic value , ' the doctor said .
' But the information is worth so much to me and potentially to thousands of people who suffer with skin cancer .
' It 's not going to do anybody any good by being thrown away or wiped . '
A spokesman for Frenchay Hospital appealed for the safe return of the computer - adding the research was potentially very important to people suffering from the disease .
' The value of the computer is very small but the research contained on it is worth a lot to Tom and , potentially , to people suffering from skin cancer , ' he said .
' North Bristol NHS Trust is taking this extremely seriously and has significantly stepped up security patrols in the area .
' The Trust security team is working alongside police officers in their investigations and we have asked staff living in hospital accommodation at Frenchay Hospital to be vigilant at all times . '
A spokesman for Avon and Somerset police said it was investigating but no arrests had been made and the car , registration number V245 MOH , had not been found .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Within insurance giant American International Group , but known to only a few people , is something irreverently called the " kill list . "
It was created by AIG 's controller , David Herzog , on Tuesday , Sept. 16 , the wild day when the company plunged toward bankruptcy only to be bailed out instead by the U.S. government .
Very late that night , Herzog , then 48 , sat in the company 's New York City headquarters , brooding about the day 's events .
Robert Willumstad , CEO for only three months , had learned from the Federal Reserve that he was out , on the theory no doubt that the government can't extend an $ 85 billion credit line to a company and leave things in the hands of existing management .
The AIG board had been told that the new CEO was to be Edward Liddy , who had decades before overseen a Sears Roebuck restructuring and then become head of a Sears spin - off , Allstate Insurance .
More important to the crisis at hand , Liddy 's career had made him a business friend of Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson and a member of the Goldman Sachs board .
Minutes before midnight , at 11:54 p.m. , Herzog - called by one former AIG officer " a prince , a straight shooter " - wrote a short e-mail to the deposed Willumstad , first thanking him for having stepped up months earlier to the " difficult challenge " of running the company .
Then Herzog flung his e-mail grenade : " Before you leave , I ask only one thing .
Please clean the slate for Mr. Liddy .
I urge the following dismissals immediately . "
Herzog next listed the names of one vice chairman , two executive vice presidents , five senior vice presidents , and one vice president .
AIG 's general counsel was in the pack , and so were the heads of finance , investments , strategic planning , risk , credit , and human resources .
These executives , according to Herzog , " have shown ... a clear pattern of ineptness that contributed to the destruction of one of America 's greatest companies .
Please , do n't make Mr. Liddy figure this out on his own . "
Herzog thought AIG 's 120,000 employees deserved better than that and also " some sense of accountability " for what had happened .
" We need leadership , " he said , " and these individuals are simply not leaders . "
In the one day before Liddy took over , the authority - shorn Willumstad did not fire any of Herzog 's designees .
In Liddy 's regime , two have left .
One was Richard Scott , a senior vice president , and the other - the highest - ranking executive on the list - was vice chairman and chief financial officer Steven Bensinger , to whose CFO job Liddy promoted Herzog .
The remaining seven executives on his list still work for AIG , as five of them did in fact for longtime chairman Maurice " Hank " Greenberg ( who was forced out by the board in early 2005 ) and his successor , Martin Sullivan ( ousted last June ) .
Asked in mid-December about the midnight blast of David Herzog , new CEO Liddy says it was " one of many information points " he had looked at on his way to making his own decisions about people .
Herzog himself recants .
" At midnight , " he tells Fortune , " after watching a great company crumble , and along with it nine years of my life 's work , I sent an emotional and rash e-mail that I deeply regret .
It was a product of frustration and fatigue .
I disavow it completely , and I have apologized to my colleagues . "
That e-mail was given to Fortune by someone who knows AIG well and thought that any article about its present and future should take note of management 's long - running contribution to its extraordinary problems .
Deciding to publish the e-mail , we sought reactions from the nine people Herzog named .
One person , Brian Schreiber , head of strategic planning , accepted our invitation to comment .
He says angrily that after learning of the e-mail , he asked Herzog to give an example of anything Schreiber had done that had harmed AIG .
" He thought a long time and he could not think of a single example , " Schreiber says .
" He then emphasized that he views me as important to the success of AIG 's restructuring effort . "
Wounded gladiator
At the least , the e-mail episode is a vivid illustration of the extreme stress racking the company .
Vastly global , spread out indeed over 130 countries , AIG is today a sorely wounded gladiator , with a market value that has crashed from $ 180 billion in 2007 to $ 5 billion .
Competitors sensing a kill are attacking the company however they can , trying to poach its best people and customers .
These are n't just AIG 's problems , they 're ours .
September 's $ 85 billion from the government - Plan A , let 's call it - proved to be too little , and the terms of the deal were more than AIG could handle .
So in November the feds moved to Plan B , whose complex parts add up to a mind - bending bailout of about $ 150 billion ( which , to supply some perspective , is more than the assets of Procter & Gamble ) .
This deal includes a $ 60 billion credit line from the Federal Reserve ; $ 40 billion of preferred stock that makes the Treasury a 79.9 % owner of AIG ; and two Fed - sponsored financing vehicles that magically rid AIG 's financial statements of about $ 50 billion of trouble .
The aim of the package , as management sees it anyway , is to keep AIG afloat while it works toward reemerging as a standalone private company and getting Washington out of its life .
The theoretical cost here - $ 150 billion - may be reduced by amounts the government derives from owning AIG .
Most of all the feds are set to be the beneficiary of a big plan , mapped out originally by Willumstad and unfolded by Liddy , for AIG to sell major assets .
These are to include the bulk of both AIG 's noninsurance properties and life insurance companies , for a total of perhaps 20 to 25 different sales .
Completion of the plan , says CEO Liddy , would reduce AIG 's annual revenues from around $ 100 billion to perhaps $ 40 billion and return the company to its roots , property - and - casualty insurance .
Some estimates say the proposed sales could bring in $ 60 billion , an amount equal to the loan portion of the bailout .
Both AIG and the government are burning to make these sales .
But unfortunately , prospective buyers for AIG 's properties - which Liddy calls " our incredibly world - class assets " - are scarce right now .
Many insurance companies that might normally bid have been crippled by investment losses , and acquirers in general can't rustle up financing .
Were it forced to unload quickly , says Liddy , AIG would be looking at fire - sale prices that would benefit no one on the selling side .
So AIG needs breathing room , and Plan B accommodated , extending the term of the government 's main credit line to AIG from two years to five .
Two side parts of the deal even have a term of six years and are " subject to extension . "

America is slightly schizophrenic when it comes to weight .
If you open a newspaper you can simultaneously read that the five skinny women left must need counselling and society is to blame for that but anorexia is genetic even though that gene seems to only be present in middle - class white girls , all while we are the fattest country in the world .
It can be confusing to people outside the US and anyone with a clue .
There is some practical advice that has resulted from 70 years of weight studies ; people who consume fewer calories than they burn lose weight 100 % of the time .
The problem is that people do n't tailor their eating to their metabolisms and that has nothing to do with genes but it may have something to do with society .
Registered dietitians Suzanne Dixon and Dave Ellis work for a ' functional ' food company called AppleBoost Products Inc. and have outlined 15 common sense recommendations that can help keep you thin or even lose weight - if you can stick to them :
1. America is a toxic food environment .
We ’re constantly bombarded by junk food commercials and surrounded by fast food joints .
If you think you ’re unaffected by food marketing , think again .
If you are not seriously committed to healthy eating , you will not eat healthfully .
2 . Get real about being active .
If maintaining a healthy body weight were easy , two - thirds of American adults would n’t be overweight .
The older we get , the more work it takes to live lean .
3 . Reading food labels will not make you healthy .
You do n’t need a label to tell you apples , oatmeal , and carrots are good food choices .
Avoid highly processed foods like chips , cookies and fast foods and you will be healthier .
4 . Do n’t drink your calories .
We ’re wired since the dawn of time to draw calories from food and wash it down with water .
With the exception of an occasional glass of wine , 100 % fruit juice or similar healthy beverage , avoid the usual diet - busting suspects – soda , fruit punch and energy drinks .
5 . Balance eating with what you do .
The number one problem in studies of dieters is that people tend to over - estimate the calories they burn exercising and underestimate the calories they consume eating .
A walk around the block does not burn off a fried chicken dinner .
It takes a lot of exercise to burn even 500 calories .
A fancy coffee drink can cost you those 500 calories .
6 . Eat when you are hungry , stop when you are not : Eating for any reason other than hunger contributes to weight problems .
Learn how to tune into your hunger and turn off eating when you sense fullness .
7 . Find something to do when you are bored .
If frustration or anger triggers your eating impulse , you may need help to better understand and gain control over these common catalysts for binge eating .
If it 's just boredom or a trained response when you watch a movie , change it .
8 . Doing it for health works better than looks :
People who lose weight to increase energy and improve health stick to their healthier lifestyle more effectively than those dieting simply to look better .
Realign your goals for lasting results .
9 . Eat balanced meals and maybe moderate healthy snacks .
Make it three well - balanced meals and snack in - between on vegetables , fruit , and nuts if you must though , if we are being honest , people have been saying this " eat lots of little meals " stuff for 20 years and it has corresponded with ballooning weight .
So maybe just eat three meals and do n't be too clever with snacks .
10 .
When you see someone who looks fit , know that he or she works at it .
Very few are born lucky when it comes to the fat loss lottery .
Stop the pity party and get moving .
11 . Everyone can get healthier .
Start by making a 1 - day commitment to living healthier ; then try to stick with it for 2 days , a week , and then a month .
If you are like most people , after a week you will keep at it because you wo n't want to have wasted the time you already spent .
12 . Quality sleep is a must for effective weight management .
Less than 7 hours of sleep means more cortisol produced by the body .
Cortisol spurs hunger and tells your body to pile on the pounds in response to stress .
Before Edison made the light bulb famous Americans slept 10 hours a night , ate less , burned more calories , spent more time working and were thinner .
Of course , the average life expectancy was 42 then .
So just sleep more and eat less .
13 . Fast food can be addictive .
The sugar , starch , and fat typically found in fast food combo meals trigger the pleasure centers in the brain , which is one reason people return for that next meal .
If you ca n’t envision your life without fast food , you may need to avoid it completely to gain control .
You do n't find many recovered alcoholics or smokers saying they will cut back to once a week .
If you are an addictive personality , go cold turkey .
14 .
The human body responds remarkably well to starvation , so unless you have the discipline to fast for four days every two weeks , a crash diet is unlikely to work .
Temporary diets make the metabolism slow down , not optimize .
It ’s better to eat smaller , healthy meals than to deprive the body of nutrition altogether .
15 . A sedentary lifestyle allows virtually no room for error when consuming food .
If you ca n’t find time to exercise regularly , at least try to move around more than usual .
And eat less .
A letter dated 15 Mar , 1963 , from Disney ’s legal adviser to Mr Sneath , reads : “ Mr Roy Disney ... is frankly shocked that the Governors of the hospital should think themselves free for any reason to go back on the basic terms which were agreed for the acquisitions by Disney of live rights ...
We hope that even at this late stage the governors in reconsideration will come to the conclusion that nothing not even their desire to serve charity justifies bad faith of this kind . ”

This article has been translated into French by Avice Robitaille
If you program for fun or profit , chances are that you know C , C++ , Java , PHP , Perl , Python or Ruby .
These programming languages are all widely known , and , to a different degree , used in commercial applications .
At least some of them can safely be considered mainstream , even if that word has become so overused and misused that has almost lost its original meaning , if it ever had one .
If you are earning your living by coding , it ’s often one of these languages that pays the bills .
Nevertheless , true hackers frequently meander in other directions , exploring and discovering different paradigms and methodologies , sometimes to the most esoteric extremes .
“ The most obvious common ‘ personality ’ characteristics of hackers are high intelligence , consuming curiosity , and facility with intellectual abstractions .
Also , most hackers are ‘ neophiles ’ , stimulated by and appreciative of novelty ( especially intellectual novelty ) .
Most are also relatively individualistic and anti-conformist . ”
– Eric S. Raymond , The Jargon File
Even if you ’re particularly devoted to one of the languages mentioned above , it is normal to be curious about what else is out there .
As the end of the year approaches , I find myself thinking about learning – or at least become acquainted with – some less known , more experimental , programming languages .
I was originally planning on learning another programming language as a New Year ’s Resolution , which is quite common among programmers .
The most difficult task turned out to be choosing a particular language : there are so many out there which makes it very hard to decide .
This article deals with ten possible candidates , and it ’s far from being an exhaustive list .
The programming languages described henceforth are very different from each other , but they all have one thing in common : they all stimulate my curiosity in their own , very different ways .
Haskell
I tried to learn Haskell in the past .
Quietly , I started diving into the multitude of articles , tutorials , overviews and even books about this fascinating academic language which claims to achieve functional purity though remaining extremely useful , practical and efficient .
Sadly , I ’m still not able to fully grasp some of its most crucial concepts , such as monads , but this still does n’t put me off wishing to learn the language .
If you ’ve never enountered Haskell before , I find The Evolution of a Haskell Programmer an amusing and informative read .
Although aiming to be humorous in a way , it serves a very important didascalic purpose : it is one of the most complete collections of the different paradigms and programming approaches Haskell allows .
Besides its very elegant , pragmatic and almost - magical syntax , what really intrigues me about this language is what it offers , in terms of features :
9 different implementations ( multiple compilers and interpreters )
Countless standard libraries packages which can be used to solve any programming challenge
Abundant learning material
Speed that rivals C and C ++
Very mature cross-platform compatibility
The catch ?
It is likely to be very different from any other language you might have encountered before , and that ’s probably the reason why some people find it difficult to learn and master .
That being said , if you are looking for a challenging ( but very rewarding , I believe ) New Year ’s Resolution , you should definitely go for this .
To get you started …
Erlang
Erlang is a concurrent programming language originally developed by Ericsson for their real - time applications .
It goes without saying that with these premise , Erlang seems the most natural answer to all concurrency problems you may encounter in your life as a programmer .
Developing with concurrency in mind feels natural and easy in Erlang , and the performance of Erlang - powered systems can be unmatched .
Quite a few interesting applications have been developed in this language , such as :
CouchDB , a popular distributed , document - oriented database
Yaws , a high - performance web server
even Facebook Chat
The price Erlang adepts have to pay , as Damien Katz ( CouchDB creator and Erlang enthusiast ) points out , is :
Awkward syntax , inspired by Prolog
Weird if expressions
Difficult string operations
No classes or namespaces
… this list could go on .
Damien ’s article is an interesting read , enough to put anyone off learning the language if read superficially .
On the other hand , it provides an invaluable resource for newcomers who wish to be prepared before taking on the challenge of learning Erlang to build their next scalable , concurrent and industry - proof application .

Io
Io is a relatively new programming language by Steve Dekorte which recently surfaced from Google ’s oblivion ( if you tried googling for it a few months ago , you could n’t event find its home page ) thanks to a short vut stimulating article by _why .
It does n’t have the best name for a programming language , that ’s for sure , but it ’s definitely a breath of fresh air in terms of the way it works .
Its unusual , minimalist and yet elegant and powerful syntax reminds of Smalltalk , but the language goes far beyond that .
Io is an object - oriented , prototype - based , message - based and fully - reflective programming language .
This means that you use messages like in Smalltalk , you create objects like in Javascript and every bit of your code can be inspected and passed around as you see fit .
If you think Ruby allows fancy ( and potentially dirty ) tricks like metaprogramming and monkey - patching , Io takes this to a whole different level , imposing virtually no limitation to the programmer .
What ’s truly amazing is that its grammar and syntax are so minimal that you can learn them in literally 10 minutes .
After that , you can start experimenting , first with its extremely small core and then with its extension libraries and bindings .
Io has indeed a lot of potential .
Granted , it ’s still young and under development , but also already quite efficient and suitable for real - world tasks demanding high speed and concurrency .
It is implemented in C , but Ola Bini started to design a similar language called Ioke for the Java Virtual Machine .
To get you started …
PLT Scheme
I stumbled upon the PLT Scheme web site while browsing for different Lisp flavors about a year ago .
At the time , I was determined to learn the rudiments of Lisp and I started reading a few articles and books on this old and yet still popular language .
Although I was originally put off by certain Common Lisp literature , which dismissed Scheme as an almost - heretic attempt to revitalize an venerable language , I soon found out that Scheme – and PLT Scheme in particular – is definitely worthy of attention and interest .
Being a technical writer , I immediately became fond of the PLT Scheme Guide , one of the clearest and most well - organized examples of documentation available for a programming language I ’ve ever come across .
The manual is exquisitely crafted as a Getting Started Manual and a Reference Book at the same time , though remaining pleasant to read sequentially : a rare trait in technical documentation .
Best of all , it ’s free : you simply have no real excuse not to read it .
Besides its excellent documentation , PLT Scheme feels like a fresh and modern implementation of one of the two most important dialects of Lisp .
It ’s cross-platform , it has an extensive collection of packages and a very active community behind it .
After my first attempt to learn Haskell , I felt compelled to try out PLT Scheme and it immediately felt much easier and more user friendly to learn , partly because of DrScheme a dedicated IDE / learning tool optimized to get you started and feel comfortable with the language .
Caveats ?
None , unless you have an adversion for parenthesis , that is .
To get you started …
Clojure
Clojure is the most recent and notable attempt to bring Lisp back to life and ready to face the challenges posed to IT systems by the new century : concurrency and scalability .
Because it runs on the Java Virtual Machine , you also get Java interoperability for free , in a more Lispy flavour .
Although I ’m a bit reluctant to deal with anything related to Java nowadays , Clojure ’s approach makes it more appealing .
Unlike other Lisps ( and Schemes ) you may have encountered before , Clojure comes with some interesting additions :
Despite all this , Rich Hickey became increasingly popular both in the Lisp and Java world for creating such an interesting and well - designed language .
Unlike with many new ( and old ) programming languages , I have yet to find a single blog post or article which is seriously criticizing Clojure in any way .
To get you started …
Squeak
Squeak has become one of the most popular Smalltalk implementations available .
It has been used in some very interesting projects :
EToys , a kids - oriented but powerful development environment built in Squeak , was included as part of the educational sofware suite of the OLPC .
. Seaside is a modern and very productive web framework running on Squeak .
Croquet is a development solution to build complex , multi-user virtual worlds .
If you ask Randal Schwartz , he ’ll explain you why Squeak and Smalltalk are at least worth a look .
Personally , while I ’m attracted by Smalltalk ’s unique approach to programming and its friendly syntax , I am still a bit overwhelmed by the way it works .
Squeak , and Smalltalk in general , runs inside ( literally ) a virtual machine written in Squeak itself .
This means that :
You write your code inside Squeak
You debug , inspect and interact your code inside squeak
You run your code inside Squeak
You can install Squeak on virtually any platform , including mobile phones , fairly easily
Everything lives inside Squeak .
It ’s very weird to picture this without actually trying it , so I suggest you download it and give it a try : it will definitely be an unusual but intriguing experience .
Smalltalk takes programming to a whole different level , which is simply unimaginable for other languages .
In return , it asks you to fully embrace the Smalltalk way of doing things , according to which external text editors , external version control systems and other common tools familiar to traditional programmers simply loose their purpose .
To get you started …
OCaml
Like Smalltalk , OCaml has been getting more attention recently than in the past .
Sure , not everyone is planning to learn is these days , but after reading this article I admit I was eager to give it a proper try .
Despite being statically typed , OCaml offers some of the features which are common in dynamically typed languages like Ruby , such as duck typing , the possibility of creating Domain - Specific Languages and even extending the language syntax with custom operators and constructs .
Additionally , the OCaml Batteries Included project was created as an attempt to bundle a standard set of commonly - used library together with the language core .
Even if this project is still in alpha stage , it definitely looks promising .
To get you started …
Factor
Factor is to Forth what Clojure is to Common Lisp : a reincarnation of an ancient language in a more modern and practical form .
In the specific case , although it borrows from Lisp and Self as well , Factor retains the main characteristics of its ancestor : it ’s stack - based , concatenative and has postfix notation .
While this is enough to put some people off , if you digg deeper you ’ll discover that Factor offers all the most important features available in contemporary programming languages : garbage collection , dynamic typing , an object system , … they ’re just presented in a very different way :
“ Learning Factor is tough .
One reason for this is that Factor is very different from other programming languages .
Programmers today are used to imperative programming languages where data is stored and passed around in named variables ( or function calls , which name their variables ) .
Factor is the opposite of this .
A lot of code tends to be written in a functional style , and even more jarringly , variables are rare , only referenced in a small fraction of words .
Nobody intends to change any of this ; it ’s a feature , not a bug ! ”
– Daniel Ehrenberg , Learning Factor
Like Haskell , Factor demands a completely different programming approach to what you may be used to , but once you get past that , it can be as useful as any other language , if not more .
The Furnace web framework , which powers the Concatenative wiki , is entirely built in Factor and runs on top of a Factor web server .
To get you started …
Lua
Lua ( “ Moon ” in Portuguese ) , is a lightweight and fast scripting language which can be easily embedded in other systems .
Compared to the other languages mentioned in this article , it is definitely the less alien of the lot : if you know a tiny bit of C or Java , you ’ll be able to understand ( and possibly write ) 80 % of Lua code without reading a single line of its documentation .
Despite its simplicity , Lua is considered a multi- paradigm language supporting imperative , functional and even object - oriented approaches .
More specifically , Lua ’s tables provide a simple but powerful way to create arrays , hashes and even classes ( or better , prototypes ) .
Simple ( and multiple ) inheritance is achieved through metatables , which allow calls to undefined functions to be transferred to parent tables .
Lua programs are not interpreted in the traditional way : they are compiled to bytecode and then executed in the Lua Virtual Machine .
As a result , Lua code tends to be executed much faster than other interpreted languages , so fast that “ as fast as Lua ” has become a proverbial expression .
Lua found its niche in embedded applications and games development , basically everywhere there ’s the need to provide a fast scripting language which is also very easy to learn and extend with C or other languages .
To get you started …
Scala
You may not be happy to see Scala in this list instead of other very valid and equally powerful languages for the Java Virtual Machine such as Groovy .
While there was no doubt on whether Clojure should have been included or not , I was a bit hesitant to include Scala .
In the end , I chose to do so simply because Scala fits better in this list than other languages : as you should have noticed by now , I am somehow more inclined to learn functional languages as opposed to their object - oriented counterparts .
Scala is both object oriented and functional .
It offers the best of both worlds : classes , traits and mixins which may be familiar to OOP lovers but also anonymous functions , currying and pattern matching which may please Haskell enthusiasts .
Additionally , it ’s also compatible with Java : so if you use Java for work , trying out Scala for pleasure is definitely the most logical next step , especially if you want to experiment with functional programming in the meantime .
Compared to learning a fully - functional ( no pun intended ) language like Haskell , Clojure or PLT Scheme , learning Scala is definitely easier and will feel less alien .
To get you started …
Epilogue
There are so many interesting programming language out there that it ’s very hard to keep track of all of them .
I hope this list can aid you in the right direction , whichever it may be .
Some people may debate over the very essence of this article : why choosing a programming language ?
Why spending time and energy in a task which may lead to a lot of confusion in your mind and lead you nowhere ?
What ’s the purpose of learning something which may feel totally alien to you ?
A programming language is ultimately just a tool to get your job done .
If you have to write an end - user , desktop GUI application which will always run on Windows and which needs to inteface with Microsoft technologies , you ’ll choose C# over Haskell , there ’s no doubt about that .
Especially if 500 developers in your company already develop in C # and you do n’t , as a matter of fact , have a saying on the matter .
But what if you could choose ?
What if you wanted to develop your own geeky command line application to automate a particular task for yourself , and not because someone else tells you to do so ?
Would you be willing to experiment with something totally different and potentially difficult just for the sake of learning new things ?
If the answer is yes , then you should take a look at this list again .
Not now , maybe not this month or this year , but when you feel the time is right , and give one of these languages a shot .
It may not end well ( so far I attempted to learn Haskell twice , with no luck ) , but I promise you it will be worthwhile , in the long run .
If you already mastered some of these languages already , or even all of them , be assured that they ’re plenty out there ready to be discovered and open your mind even more .
Or , if you prefer , there are a lot of minds out there which may need guidance in learning and discovery .
Help them .
Write articles , tutorials , books , educate and evangelize : ultimately , that will be your greatest reward .
Type Checking with Open Type Functions by Tom Schrijvers , Simon Peyton - Jones , Manuel M. T. Chakravarty , and Martin Sulzmann
We report on an extension of Haskell with open type - level functions and equality constraints that unifies earlier work on GADTs , functional dependencies , and associated types .
The contribution of the paper is that we identify and characterise the key technical challenge of entailment checking ; and we give a novel , decidable , sound , and complete algorithm to solve it , together with some practically - important variants .
Our system is implemented in GHC , and is already in active use .
Related to GHC / Type families , which can be an important optimization technique when specializing the types .
Type families allow greater control over types .
I guess they did n't like having C++ templates having any advantage with associated types .
Personally , it reminds me of some of the power afforded by ML parameterized functors .

see deal Grand Theft Auto IV - PC $ 19.99 on Gamestop
Creating video game entertainment is our passion and we invest a considerable amount of time and effort to release each title , and employ a large number of people in the process .
Having copy protection allows us to protect the integrity or our titles and future investments , but at the same time we have worked very hard to ensure that our solutions do not persecute the legitimate players of our games .
Implemented correctly , SecuROM is the most effective form of disc based copy protection and allows us to manage authenticity on a global level for Grand Theft Auto IV A copy of the game ( retail disc or digital distribution ) and a computer that meets the minimum system specifications is required .
An internet connection , assorted software installations , and certain service registrations are required for activation and use of all the software features .
The minimum system specifications , recommended system specifications , required software installations and other requirements are listed at the end of this document .
You will need an active internet connection to activate the software and the retail disk is required to be in the computer drive in order to play .
In order to upload videos to our internet site and play online multi-player modes , you will also need an active internet connection and accounts with both Rockstar Games Social Club and Games for Window - LIVE .
GTA IV PC also requires a number of software installations , including Games For Windows , Adobe Flash , Internet Explorer , SecuROM and our Rockstar Games Social Club application .
Yes , but to be clear , if you install the game on a computer that is n't connected to the internet , you can perform certain steps to activate your game on another PC with an active internet connection .
Once the game is distributed , information on this method will be available on a GTA IV support page .
We have provided a means whereby users that do not have an active internet connection at home can go to another computer that does have one , and access a support site that will help you through the authentication process .
An active internet connection is required to play multi-player games and upload user - created videos , but the offline single - player mode is always available – even if you are n't connected to the internet .
To save offline gameplay and Achievement point progress related to a particular GFWL Gamertag , you must have logged in with that Gamertag at least once and saved your progress with it .
Achievement points are not tracked in ' offline ' accounts in GFWL games .
Single - player game progress is always tracked and saved .
GTA IV PC uses SecuROM for protecting our EXE until street date has passed , to ensure the retail disk is in the computer drive , and is used for Product Activation of the title .
Product Activation is a one time only online authentication when installing the game .
GTA IV has no install limits for the retail disc version of the game , and that version can be installed on an unlimited number of PCs by the retail disk owner .
You will only need to authenticate the retail disk once per Windows account per machine .
Even if you uninstall and re-install the game , it will not have to be re-authenticated .
There are some unique circumstances under which you may have to re-authenticate the software on a machine .
For example , if you change any two ' major ' components on your PC , i.e. CPU and video card , you will have to re-authenticate the title .
Also , if you install on a different PC or under a different Windows account on the same machine , you will have to authenticate that installation as well , but this is standard to any software needing a serial .
Games for Windows - LIVE and SecuROM will run when the game is running , but not at any other time .
The Rockstar Games Social Club application is required to run in order to launch and play the game .
These components are required to play the game .
As many times as you would like , if using the retail disc version .
( CNN ) --
A new national poll suggests that three out of four Americans feel President Bush 's departure from office is coming not a moment too soon .
Twenty - eight percent of those polled say President Bush is the worst president in U.S. history .
Seventy - five percent of those questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Friday said they 're glad Bush is going ; 23 percent indicated they 'll miss him .
" Earlier this year , Bush scored some of the lowest presidential approval ratings we 've seen in half a century , so it 's understandable that the public is eager for a new president to step in , " said Keating Holland , CNN polling director .
CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider added , " As President Bush prepares to leave office , the American public has a parting thought : Good riddance .
At least that 's the way three - quarters feel . "
Watch how Bush 's farewell polls compare »
The portion who say they wo n't miss Bush is 24 percentage points higher than the 51 percent who said they would n't miss President Bill Clinton when he left office in January 2001 .
Forty - five percent of those questioned at that time said they would miss Clinton .
The poll indicates that Bush compares poorly with his presidential predecessors , with 28 percent saying that he 's the worst ever .
Forty percent rate Bush 's presidency as poor , and 31 percent say he 's been a good president .
Only a third of those polled said they want Bush to remain active in public life after he leaves the White House .
That 33 percent figure is 22 points lower than those in 2001 who wanted Bill Clinton to retain a public role .
" It 's been like a failed marriage , " Schneider said .
" Things started out well .
When President Bush first took office in 2001 , more than 60 percent saw him as strong and decisive .
That impression was confirmed after the September 11th attacks .
The public still saw Bush as strong and decisive when he took office a second time in 2005 .
" But no more .
The public has completely lost confidence in this president , " Schneider said .
Bush has dropped on a number of measures , but possibly the biggest is that only 20 percent say he inspires confidence , Holland said .
" That 's an important figure when the country is facing its biggest economic crisis in a generation , " he added .
When running for the White House in the 2000 presidential campaign , Bush promised to be a uniter and not a divider .
But 82 percent of poll respondents felt that Bush did not unite the country , compared with 17 percent who said he did .
" The vast majority of Americans believe he betrayed his promise to unite the country , " Schneider said .
" He took a country that was divided under President Clinton and he divided it worse . "
Only 27 percent of those questioned in the poll approve of the way Bush is handling his job as president ; 72 percent disapprove .
" President Bush 's job approval rating has been at or below freezing since the beginning of the year , " Schneider said .
" The current 27 percent approval rating is one of the lowest ratings for any president , ever . "
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted December 19 - 21 , with 1,013 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
All About George W. Bush • Opinion Research Corporation
Spore , after more than 10 years of development time , is finally available for the PC and Mac .
The game comes from the mind of the talented Will Wright , the man who gave us The Sims and the original SimCity titles .
No matter what people think about the actual game play , the story now centers around the DRM scheme EA built into the title , and a grassroots movement has begun to tell gamers just how bad the DRM sucks .
The method ?
Bombing the comments on Amazon.com .
Right now the game has 222 customer reviews , with 194 of them giving the game one star .
The game also has nine five - star reviews , two of which were written in 2006 , while the other reviews spend significant amounts of time complaining about the one - star reviews .
The game 's rating sits at 1.5 stars as of this writing .
So what are the people complaining about ?
Taking a look at the review Amazon tagged as " the most helpful critical review , " it 's pretty clear .
" First of all , the game incorporates a draconian DRM system that requires you to activate over the internet , and limits you to a grand total of 3 activations , " the disgruntled user wrote .
" If you reach that limit , then you 'll have to call EA in order to add one extra activation .
That 's not as simple as it sounds , since when you reach that point EA will assume that you , the paying customer , are a filthy pirating thief .
You will need to provide proof of purchase , reasons why the limit was reached ... "
Another gamer was just as blunt .
" The DRM on this thing is less friendly than my recent colonoscopy — you get three installs .
That 's it .
No install returned for uninstallation , or anything else .
You install it three times , then you 're out $ 50 , " he wrote .
" I wo n't rent my video games , EA . "
The backlash against EA 's DRM is n't anything new .
Gamers were complaining about what they had heard about the system back in May of this year .
This caused EA to remove the requirement that the game authenticate online every ten days , changing it to authentication whenever new content was added to the title .
Unfortunately , that does n't seem to be enough change for some users , and the limit on installations is what gamers are now finding most heinous .
Review - bombing Amazon is a particularly nasty way of getting the point across as well ; casual gamers who are n't aware of this campaign may not bother to read the content of the reviews and only assume the game is n't very good .
For developers , the primary goal of DRM is stopping piracy .
The problem is that it does that job poorly , and , as always , it 's the legitimate customers who get stuck dealing with the insanity of having to call EA to ask for more installations after their three are used up .
And while they 're on hold with EA support , the pirates are enjoying copies of a game that works , every time they want to play it , no matter what they do to their computer .
What 's particularly jarring about the situation is that EA 's PR nightmare did n't have to happen at all : the game was live , all over BitTorrent , days before the retail version was available .
When the worst - case scenario has already taken place , why continue to punish the gamers who actually want to support your work ?
It 's hard to advocate bombing Amazon with one - star reviews , but so far nothing has gotten the attention of companies like EA when it comes to DRM .
The three - install limit may have another disastrous effect , giving gamers the feeling that piracy is an acceptable — and almost ethical — way of dealing with EA .
One gamer who spoke with me under the promise of anonymity put it best as he canceled his preorder : " I do n't pay $ 50 for a broken version of a game .
If EA wants to reward the pirates with the best version of the game , why would n't we get the better version [ of Spore ] ? "
Of course , based on our 30 - plus hours with the game and our full review , hardcore gamers may not be missing much .
The game play itself is something of a disappointment .
If you 're on the fence about buying Spore , it may be wise to wait for awhile to see if the current combination of lackluster game play and truly bad DRM changes for the better .
This “ Tree of Life ” sketch is seen in Darwin ’s “ B ” notebook , at a press preview of the new “ Darwin ” exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History November 15 , 2005 in New York City ( Image : Mario Tama / Getty )
Read our related editorial : Uprooting Darwin ’s tree
IN JULY 1837 , Charles Darwin had a flash of inspiration .
In his study at his house in London , he turned to a new page in his red leather notebook and wrote , “ I think ” .
Then he drew a spindly sketch of a tree .
As far as we know , this was the first time Darwin toyed with the concept of a “ tree of life ” to explain the evolutionary relationships between different species .
It was to prove a fruitful idea : by the time he published On The Origin of Species 22 years later , Darwin ’s spindly tree had grown into a mighty oak .
The book contains numerous references to the tree and its only diagram is of a branching structure showing how one species can evolve into many .
“ The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree .
I believe this simile largely speaks the truth … ”
The tree - of - life concept was absolutely central to Darwin ’s thinking , equal in importance to natural selection , according to biologist W. Ford Doolittle of Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada .
Without it the theory of evolution would never have happened .
The tree also helped carry the day for evolution .
Darwin argued successfully that the tree of life was a fact of nature , plain for all to see though in need of explanation .
The explanation he came up with was evolution by …

The sanctity of correcting past mistakes
by Jeremy Hooper
The following text snippet comes from a letter to the editor that was written in 1931 :
So wait , social conservatives -- what 's that about marriage never changing with the times ?
1931 Letter to the editor [ The Daily Gleaner archive ]
Your thoughts
A bit off topic but I wanted to share - I spend way to much time on Townhall.com - but these two columns struck me as odd considering where I read them .
Maybe Townhall ’s target readers might listen and wise up plus I think it 's a step in the right direction : http://townhall.com/Columnists/JacobSullum/2008/12/03/gay_by_force

I LOVE your " very old newspaper article " articles .
This one is great , too .
Apparently , marriage has been under attack for a very , very long time ( I suspect you can find some Roman authors complaining about how young people just do n't know how to set up a household anymore ! )
Posted by : Willie Hewes | Dec 4 , 2008 3:55:23 AM
This article is cute !
And shows an element that we should use and holler and shout from the rooftops : TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE HAS NOT EXISTED SINCE WOMEN BECAME EQUAL TO MEN .
" Traditional Marriage " meant a man owned a woman !
It was her duty to give him a son , so his stuff would stay in the family .
If she refused , he beat and f&cked her until she did , or until she died trying .
Then he remarried .
When the Supreme Court decided it was possible for a husband to R4PE his wife , it was the end of traditional marriage .
The idea of a PARTNERSHIP OF 2 EQUALS BASED IN LOVE is a RADICAL , NEW definition of marriage .
Any woman -- any woman -- who voted for Prop 8 is a raving hypocrite .
Or she really wants to go back to the traditional beatings and r4pes .
Posted by : Strepsi | Dec 4 , 2008 10:43:02 AM
I was reading a couple weeks back some articles written before 1920 about why women should n't be allowed to vote .
This from their very loving , caring , CONTROLLING husbands .
But it 's sanctified , apparently , so that was okay .

Now that I ’m consulting again , I find myself spending a lot of time fixing other people ’s queries .
And I find that the first 15 - 30 minutes of fixing a complex query I spend re-writing the query just so I can see what it ’s doing — and considering what I bill , that ’s rather costly time for formatting that should have been done correctly in the first place .
While I ’m very glad to see that many web developers are discovering the power of complex queries , I ’m not at all happy about how they write them .
A lot common practice seems to be based on conserving keystrokes rather than comprehensibility , rendering a 6 - table reporting query something out of the Obfuscated Code Contest .
The cost of writing unmaintainable queries should be obvious : they are harder to debug , harder to tune , and dramatically increase your costs of training up new staff and / or contractors .
Worse , the query bugs you do n’t catch because of your unreadable queries will often consume 90 % of your system resources and troubleshooting time .
You ’re making your own job harder by writing unmaintainable , unreadable SQL .
To paraphrase a famous quote about Perl : “ Write all of your SQL with the maintainer in mind .
Because chances are , that maintainer will be you . ”
Unfortunately , while a lot of attention has been paid to making procedural / object code well - documented and maintainable in various books , scant attention has been paid to making SQL maintainable .
The only such text I can recall , in fact , came from chapter 2 of O’Reilly ’s PL / SQL book .
So here ’s a few rules for writing maintainable SQL .
Avoid Table and Field Alias Abbreviations
… or use long ones .
I ’d thought that we ’d all left the days of having program variables named “ I ” and “ X ” and “ Y ” behind us in BASIC and COBOL , but apparently not .
For the same reasons you do n’t want to have a global variable named “ p ” , you do n’t want to have a queried table aliased as “ p ” .
Certainly there ’s a reason to use an abbreviated alias for “ persons_referral_type ” if you ’re going to refer to it 18 times in the query , but there ’s no legitimate reason to abbreviate the name of the table “ class ” to “ cs ” .
If you ’re any good as a programmer , you should be typing at least 80WPM , so those extra 4 characters are taking you what , 0.4 seconds ?
Whereas getting “ cs ” for “ class ” and “ cs ” for “ club_status ” mixed up could cost you up to 12 hours of debugging .
Further , if you do have a really long name you need to abbreviate , make the abbreviation long enough to be distinctive .
“ persons_referral_type ” , for example , should be abbreviated “ persreft ” or “ personref ” or “ p_reftype ” or similar , not “ pr ” , which could also refer to “ performance_rating ” .
Make 2nd Referral Aliases and Subquery Aliases Descriptive
Of course , there are times you have to use an alias because you ’re referring to the same table twice in the same query in two different contexts , or because you have a named subquery or expression .
Again , just like a program variable , the rule here is to be distinctive and descriptive , so that someone who is reading the variable deep down in the query knows exactly to what it refers .
For example , if you have two references to the “ status ” lookup table , one from “ person ” and one from “ club ” , the proper aliasing would be “ status AS person_status ” and “ status AS club_status ” , not “ status AS s1 ” or “ status AS cs ” .
The same goes for subqueries .
This is the wrong way to select a correlated summary statistic : ( SELECT MAX ( score ) FROM persons p2 WHERE p2.club = persons.club ) as ms , This is the right way : ( SELECT MAX ( score ) FROM persons AS pers_max WHERE pers_max.club = persons.club ) AS max_club_score , See how much more readable the second version is ?
You do n’t have to run the subquery in your head to figure out what it ’s doing ; the alias tells you most of what you need to know for troubleshooting .
This rule will become even more critical when we get Common Table Expressions in PostgreSQL 8.4 .
Other Rules for Aliases
1. Always use the optional keyword AS .
This both provides a visual que that there ’s an alias , and helps avoid accidentally breaking the query by pasting something between the identifier and the alias or by referring to the original table name and not the alias elsewhere in the query .
2 . Never , ever , ever , reuse the same alias for two different objects in different contexts in the query .
Even if the SQL parser is fine with it , it will drive your maintainer insane .
3 . Never use an alias which is the name of an actual object elsewhere in the database , even if it ’s not used the the query .
I ’ll continue How To Write Maintainable Queries next week .
Belching cows and pigs could start costing farmers money if a proposal to charge fees for air - polluting animals becomes law .
Farmers so far are turning their noses up at the notion , which is one of several put forward by the US Environmental Protection Agency after the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases emitted by belching and flatulence amounts to air pollution .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" This is one of the most ridiculous things the federal government has tried to do , " said Alabama Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks , an outspoken opponent of the proposal .
It would require farms or ranches with more than 25 dairy cows , 50 beef cattle or 200 pigs to pay an annual fee of about $ 175 for each dairy cow , $ 87.50 per head of beef cattle and $ 20 for each pig .
The executive vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation , Ken Hamilton , estimated the fee would cost owners of a modest - sized cattle ranch $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 a year .
He said he has talked to a number of livestock owners about the proposals , and " all have said if the fees were carried out , it would bankrupt them " .
If you have short eyelashes , a drug designed to cure glaucoma will help you .
I ’m talking here about the new product , which is known around the world as Bimatoprost ( in US also sold as Lumigan ) .
Recently the final clinical tests were held in US , which showed that the drug is highly effective at treating glaucoma .
However , the “ side - effects ” of this drug included longer and darker eyelashes .
The developers of the drug were quick enough to realize the potential secondary use of the drug and released another product in addition to the major glaucoma cure .
The second product is a liquid form of the drug , which can help anyone get beautiful eyelashes .
Official registration procedure of the product will be completed in the near future .
I think , lots of women look forward to trying this drug .
( CNN ) -- Less than 24 hours before the presidential election , Kevin Sheen has yet to decide who will get his vote .
i Reporter Kevin Sheen of Nebraska says he has yet to decide on who to vote for .
" I 'm actually still wrestling with moral issues , " says the 29 - year - old registered Democrat , who voted for George W. Bush in 2004 .
Sheen is one of the 5 percent of American voters who are either undecided or could change their mind before Election Day .
It 's not unusual for a small percentage of Americans to be undecided in the final hours before casting their votes .
In 2004 , a CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll released two days before the election showed 3 percent of those surveyed were still undecided .
In 2000 , 4 percent of those surveyed said they were undecided two days before the election .
Watch the psychology behind undecided voters »
This year , the most recent CNN / Opinion Research Corporation Poll shows the number of undecideds is much smaller .
iReport.com :
One year later , still undecided
" In our last poll , we only had about 1 percent who said they were undecided and only about 4 percent who said they might consider changing their minds .
So there is hardly anyone left who could be considered undecided , or even persuadable , " says CNN polling director Keating Holland .
Sheen , of Lincoln , Nebraska , says his vote is coming down to one issue : abortion .
Sheen says he's " definitely pro-life " and he 's trying to decide whether Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain is more in line with his views .
" Neither of them have the track record I would like in a political candidate .
So at this point , it 's me sort of deciding upon , who do I think will be the best representation for if something is able to happen with the issue of abortion , " he says .
iReport : Still undecided ?
What gives ?
Does he hope to make his decision before heading into the polling booth ?
" That 's the plan anyway , " he says .
The presidential candidates and their running mates were visiting more than a dozen states Monday in a final push to try to sway voters like Sheen to their side .
With hours to go in this campaign , polls show McCain trailing Obama by 7 percentage points .

McCain began a seven - state blitz with a rally in Tampa , Florida , on Monday morning .
He then was heading to Tennessee , Pennsylvania , Indiana , New Mexico and Nevada .
McCain ends the day in his home state of Arizona .
Except for Tennessee and Arizona , McCain either trails or is tied in the states he is visiting , according to recent polling .
" There 's one day left until we take America in a new direction , my friends , and we need your help , " he said at a stop in Florida .
Watch " we need your help " »
" McCain 's got to run the table on Tuesday night to really stay in this , or flip Pennsylvania , " said John Avlon , author of " Independent Nation . "
" McCain 's argument about the unified - control Congress -- what the liberal super - majority would do -- is resonating with independents ... but he 's got a lot of ground to make up . "
Obama also began Monday in Florida , a state President Bush won in 2000 and 2004 .
CNN 's latest poll of polls shows Obama with a slight lead over McCain in Florida , 48 percent to 46 percent , with 6 percent unsure .
The Illinois Democrat then headed to two other states that Bush won but where he is leading this year : North Carolina and Virginia .
A ground war for the last undecideds -- and to encourage high party turnout -- ratcheted up in key battleground states .
In Pennsylvania , more than 500 paid Obama staffers and thousands of volunteers are working around the clock for the final push in the swing state .
The smaller McCain camp ground army has 100 paid staff in the state and roughly 15,000 volunteers -- targeting union members who tilt conservative on social issues .
In McCain 's home state of Arizona , iReporter Kyle Aevermann , 21 , is preparing to vote in his first presidential election .
He is one of the few who has yet to reach a decision on his vote , although he knows he will not vote for the state 's long - time senator .
Meet two undecided iReporters »
Aevermann is debating between Obama and Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney , although he acknowledges voting for McKinney might be a " waste of a vote . "
" Until the past few months , I wanted nothing to do with politics and I really have learned to become interested in it , " he says .
But he adds , " I 'm excited for the election to be over with . "
CNN 's Scott Anderson contributed to this report .

" We ca n't put all our energy in one barrel , " says the BP billboard poster .
The slogan is accompanied by fetching images of green plants , wind turbines and the sun .
And BP 's own logo , with its green tagline : Beyond Petroleum .
But this is confection .
Until 2004 , BP was called British Petroleum .
And in the real world of business , the giant energy company continues to plunder most of its profits from - and sink the great bulk of its investment into - barrels of oil .
Who is it kidding ?
Well us , it hopes .
You may have seen another of its posters .
" There 's energy security in energy diversity , " it says .
" BP provides oil , natural gas , wind , biofuels , solar and options . "
Or , reading its recent print adverts , you may have puzzled at what it means by the headline " Hydrocarbons and low carbons living in harmony . "
Let 's get real .
BP likes to say that it is investing $ 1.5 bn ( £ 980,000 ) a year in " alternative energy " .
True , I am sure .
But that word " alternative " is clever .
Delve a little further and it turns out that BP 's alternative energy division includes not just wind and solar and biofuels but also natural gas - fired power stations .
Natural gas may be less polluting than coal and oil , but at the end of the day it 's a fossil fuel filling the atmosphere with CO2 .
Alternative ?
Not by my definition .
Also sheltering in the alternative energy division is BP 's " emissions assets business " , which makes money out of carbon trading , and a venture capital unit .
But even if we lump all this " alternative " activity together , it still only makes up 7 % of the company 's planned $ 21 bn ( £ 13.85 bn ) investment this year .
The remaining 93 % is oil , spiced up with some coal .
Now if BP were new kids on the alternative scene , we might regard 7 % as good progress .
But the sad thing is that BP was making waves in renewables a decade and more ago .
Back then , it was a pioneer among oil companies .
In 1997 , the year the Kyoto protocol was agreed , environmentalists applauded the green initiatives of then - chief executive Sir John Browne .
For a while they looked like deeds rather than just words .
Soon , Sir John was Lord Browne .
But some of BP 's investors got cold feet .
Browne was ousted and the oilmen returned to centre stage .
Take one example of the difference this has made .
Back in 1999 , Browne pulled BP out of its involvement with developing Canadian tar sands – an energy - intensive process with a carbon footprint several times that of conventional oil .
Last year , BP bought its way back into Canadian tar sands .
The current bout of BP greenwash is especially questionable for its British customers and shareholders .
Earlier this month , BP pulled out of wind power in Britain .
And , after years justifying its continued involvement in coal by extolling the potential for capturing and burying carbon dioxide emissions from coal - fired powers , it withdrew from a British government competition to come up with a viable technology .
Yes , BP is continuing with a clean - coal project in Australia ; and yes , it is investing in wind power in the US , in anticipation of a renewables push from president - elect , Barack Obama .
But this niche activity is small fry for a company that just announced profits for just three months of $ 10 bn ( £ 6.59 bn ) .
BP claimed that those profits paid for investment in alternative forms of energy .
Maybe .
But those 13 weeks ' profits also exceeded its anticipated investment in renewables for the next six years .
Is this a company that has stopped putting most of its investment " in one barrel " ?
Is this a company seriously trying to create a world " beyond petroleum " ?
Sadly it is not .
Worst of all , it is a company that appears to be retreating from deeds to words .
• How many more green scams , cons and generous slices of wishful thinking are out there ?

Moon mission inspires India to launch own version of Google Earth
Space - hungry India is planning to launch an improved version of Google Earth using its own satellite system , just weeks after conquering the moon .
Its space agency hopes to unveil a prototype of Bhuvan - the Sanskrit for Earth - by December and launch the programme to the public by March .
Officials claim the mapping system will generate clearer images and zoom into a distance of just 10m .
Sophisticated : 3D Google Earth provides a 3D image of the London Eye
The state - owned service , which will initially cover only India , will be free to use on the web .
' We 've created a lot of value added products out of satellite data of the Indian region ' , Dr. V. Jayaramna , a director at Isra , told the Financial Times .
' We will introduce Bhuvan in phases .
Over the next three to four months , the first lot [ of map data ] will come out and then more in a systematic manner . '
The move comes just weeks after India stepped up its position in the space race with the blast - off of the country 's first unmanned space mission to the moon .
Space contender : India launched Chandralayaan - 1 , its first unmanned moon mission , in October
Chandrayaan - 1 , which was built by the Indian Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) , will create a 3D map of the lunar surface over two years .
India is following in the footsteps of rival China , after the emerging Asian power celebrated its first space walk in September .
' What we have started is a remarkable journey , ' G. Madhavan Nair , chairman of ISRO , said .
Chandrayaan - 1 lunar orbiter is expected to mark the achievement tomorrow as it drops a probe , painted in the colours of the Indian flag , on the moon 's surface .
Earth from space : ISRO s Chandrayaan - 1 pictures the Earth on its way to the Moon
But critics argue that India should address the poverty at home before competing with space leaders including China and Japan .
The latest project has sparked speculation that India will develop its own global positioning system , providing for TomTom - like devices for cars .
It is already working towards a satellite - based global aviation navigation system .
And scientists revealed earlier this week that designs for an Aditya spacecraft to study the sun are nearly complete .
Google Earth displays satellite images of varying resolution of the Earth 's surface , giving users a bird 's eye view of things like houses and cars .
Shortly before I finished writing about my Plans for the next month or two I received the news that my grant request for Perl debugger integration in Padre was postponed but the grant request to Integrating Padre with Parrot and Rakudo was accepted .
So while I was quite disappointed that the Debugger grant was postponed I am glad at least one of my proposals got accepted and I 'd like to thank the people in Vienna . pm as it turns out they are financing it and not TPF .
Actually I am quite surprised and disappointed that TPF did not have the money to finance the quarterly 10,000 USD of grants and that AFAIK they did not say anything about this earlier .
While they have improved TPF still lacks enough transparency .
For example why is there no public mailing list with all the TPF officials subscribed where outsiders like me could initiate project publicly ?
Anyway , I think TPF should start a fund raising drive similar to that of Wikipedia does .
Of course they do n't need 6,000,000 USD .
They could aim at 100,000 USD .
Wait , if they only raised 40,000 USD that would cover the regular grants for the next year .
We have plenty of web real estate to promote the fund drive and I believe there are plenty of Perl users who would chip in with USD 10 - 20 or maybe even more .
Or are we afraid that they are all dead ?
TPF only needs to decide on it , setup the accounting , write up the list of achievements from the previous grants and create an image we can put on our web sites .
I would be glad to put it on CPAN :: Forum and I am quite sure some of the bigger Perl related sites would be ready to do the same .
I would even volunteer to contact all the site maintainers personally and ask them to promote the fund drive .
Joe Armstrong ’s Simple Web Server – Again January 6 , 2009
Ok , armed with my new understanding of anonymous functions , here ’s my latest walk - through of Joe Armstrong ’s Simple Web Server .
As you ’ll recall JA ’s Simple Web Server is factored into three levels :
Level 1 : web_server.erl
Level 2 : http_driver.erl
Level 3 : tcp_driver.erl
We start at Level 1 :
********** web_server : start/1
web_server:start ([ A ] ) ->
% START -UP PROCESS
start_on_port(list_to_integer(atom_to_list ( A ) ) ) .
*** Let ’s call this START - UP PROCESS
*** takes a list containing atom A , which represents a port number
*** calls web_server:start_on_port/1
*** passes in list_to_integer ( atom_to_list ( A ) )
*** list_to_integer(atom_to_list( A ) ) transforms atom A into an integer .
********** web_server:start_on_port/1
web_server:start_on_port( Port ) ->
spawn_link ( fun( ) -> server ( Port ) end ) .
*** START -UP PROCESS spawns process web_server : server /
1
*** Let ’s call this PROCESS A
NOW
We ’re entering PROCESS A
********** web_server : server /1
web_server:server ( Port ) ->
% PROCESS A
S = self ( ) ,
process_flag( trap_exit , true ) ,
http_driver:start( Port , fun( Client ) -> server ( Client , S ) end , 15 ) ,
loop ( ) .
*** Assigns PID of PROCESS
A to variable S
*** Sets trap -exit
*** Calls http_driver :start/3
*** Passes in Port , anonymous function web_server : server /2 , 15
*** Calls web_server:loop ( )
********** http_driver : start/3
*** Drops down to Level 2 and spawns another process .
********** web_server:loop ( )
loop ( ) ->
receive
Any ->
io : format ( “ server : ~p~n ” , [ Any ] ) ,
loop ( )
end .
*** listens for any message
*** prints message
At this point START - UP PROCESS has spawned PROCESS A which calls a function in level 2 , then goes into a receive loop that outputs any message coming into PROCESS A .
Now we ’re dropping down to Level 2
********** http_driver : start/3 ( cont . )
http_driver:start( Port , Fun , Max ) ->
spawn ( fun ( ) -> server ( Port , Fun , Max ) end ) .
*** Spawns process web_server : server /3
*** Let ’s call this PROCESS B
*** PROCESS takes three parameters : Port , Fun , Max
*** Fun is web_server : server /
2
*** Let ’s call Fun FUNA
Now we ’re entering PROCESS B
********** http_driver : server /3
http_driver:server ( Port , Fun , Max ) ->
tcp_server:start_raw_server( Port ,
fun( Socket ) -> input_handler ( Socket , Fun ) end ,
Max ,
0 ) .
*** Drops us down to Level 3
Now we ’re entering Level 3
********** tcp_server:start_raw_server /4
tcp_driver:start_raw_server( Port , Fun , Max , Length ) ->
%%
This server accepts up to Max connections on Port
%%
The * first * time a connection is made to Port
%% Then Fun( Socket ) is called .
%%
Thereafter messages to the socket result in messsages to the handler .
Name = port_name ( Port ) ,
case whereis( Name ) of
undefined ->
Self = self ( ) ,
Pid = spawn_link ( fun ( ) ->
cold_start ( Self , Port , Fun , Max , Length )
end ) ,
receive
{ Pid , ok} ->
register ( Name , Pid ) ,
{ok , self ( ) } ;
{ Pid , Error} ->
Error
end ;
Pid ->
{error , already_started}
end .
*** Calls tcp_driver : port_name/1
*** Looks to see if port_name is registered ( See : http://www.nabble.com/Registered-names-and-pids-td17222546.html)
*** If not , assigns PID of PROCESS B to the variable Self
*** Spawns a new process tcp_driver : cold_start/5
*** Let ’s call this PROCESS C
*** Then listens for { Pid , ok}
*** If { Pid , ok} , it registers Pid under Name
*** Otherwise returns an Error
*** whereis( Name ) returns a Pid , then reports error , process already started
********** tcp_driver : port_name/1
port_name( Port ) when integer ( Port ) ->
list_to_atom ( “ portServer ” ++ integer_to_list ( Port ) ) .
*** Transforms integer value of Port into a the atom postServerXXXX , where XXXX is port number
Now we ’re entering PROCESS C
********** tcp_driver:cold_start/4
tcp_driver:cold_start ( Master , Port , Fun , Max , Length ) ->
process_flag( trap_exit , true ) ,
io : format ( “ Starting a port server on ~ p… ~n ” , [ Port ] ) ,
case gen_tcp : listen ( Port , [ binary ,
% % {dontroute , true} ,
{nodelay , true} ,
{packet , Length} ,
{reuseaddr , true} ,
{active , false} ] ) of
{ok , Listen} ->
% % io : format ( “ Listening on : ~p~n ” , [ Listen ] ) ,
Master ! { self ( ) , ok} ,
New = start_accept( Listen , Fun ) ,
%%
Now we ’re ready to run
socket_loop ( Listen , New , [ ] , Fun , Max ) ;
Error ->
Master ! { self ( ) , Error}
end .
*** Set trap_exit
*** Report start up of new server
*** Listen to gen_tcp: listen /2 ( http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_tcp.html)
Note : gen_tcp: listen /2
“ Sets up a socket to listen on the port Port on the local host . ”
Also Note : FUNA has been passed all the down to tcp_driver : socket_loop /
5
By all means review the cited gen - tcp man page .
Whew !
I ’m approaching brain death .
But at this point we ’ve plunged down through three levels of Joe Armstrong ’s Simple Web Server to discover how he sets up a socket to listen for a request .
Oh yeah , simple for him .
Hope it has n’t been too tedious .
Also , please , please if I ’ve added to the confusion or disseminated nonsense , set me straight .
Next episode we ’ll take a look at how Joe ’s web server processes requests and responses .
‘ Til then .

Tamera Jo Freeman was on a Frontier Airlines flight to Denver in 2007 when her two children began to quarrel over the window shade and then spilled a Bloody Mary into her lap .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
She spanked each of them on the thigh with three swats .
It was a small incident , but one that in the heightened anxiety after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks would eventually have enormous ramifications for Freeman and her children .
A flight attendant confronted Freeman , who responded by hurling a few profanities and throwing what remained of a can of tomato juice on the floor .
The incident aboard the Frontier flight ultimately led to Freeman ’s arrest and conviction for a federal felony defined as an act of terrorism under the Patriot Act , the controversial federal law enacted after the 2001 attacks in New York and Washington .
“ I had no idea I was breaking the law , ” said Freeman , 40 , who spent three months in jail before pleading guilty .
Freeman is one of at least 200 people on flights who have been convicted under the amended law .
In most of the cases , there was no evidence that the passengers had attempted to hijack the airplane or physically attack any of the flight crew .
Many have simply involved raised voices , foul language and drunken behavior .

Django now has fast tests ¶
As of Changeset 9756 , Django ’s test suite is A HELL OF A LOT FASTER .
This was one of the 1.1 Features and probably the one I was looking forward to the most .
Django Unit Tests now run inside of a transaction .
Karen
Tracey did most of the work on this finishing one , and we owe her a huge thanks , and a lot of our time :) .
Her commit message sums up the work better than I can .
Fixed # 8138 -- Changed django.test .TestCase to rollback tests ( when the database supports it ) instead of flushing and reloading the database .
This can substantially reduce the time it takes to run large test suites .
This change may be slightly backwards incompatible , if existing tests need to test transactional behavior , or if they rely on invalid assumptions or a specific test case ordering .
For the first case , django .
test .
TransactionTestCase should be used .
TransactionTestCase is also a quick fix to get around test case errors revealed by the new rollback approach , but a better long - term fix is to correct the test case .
See the testing doc for full details .
Many thanks to : * Marc Remolt for the initial proposal and implementation .
* Luke Plant for initial testing and improving the implementation .
* Ramiro Morales for feedback and help with tracking down a mysterious PostgreSQL issue .
* Eric Holscher for feedback regarding the effect of the change on the Ellington testsuite .
* Russell Keith - Magee for guidance and feedback from beginning to end .
The amazing thing is that you do n’t have to do anything in order to get the benefit from this change .
People ’s test suites will now be running about 8 - 12 x ( ed : was 40 x , but that was a bit much ) faster than before .
Depending on whether you have a larger portion of doctests or unit tests , you will get different speedups .
The Database backend you are using is also import ; MySQL / MyISAM does n’t support transactions , and tests running in SQLite were already much faster , so they do n’t get as much of a percentage gain .
Ellington ’s test suite , which was taking around 1.5 - 2 hours to run on Postgres , has been reduced to 10 minutes .
I tested changing some of our more expensive doctests to unit tests ( and thus getting transaction support ) , and it looks like we can get our suite to run in 3 - 4 MINUTES .
Prior to this change , before every doctest or unittest test case was run , Django would do an entire flush and syncdb of the database !
This was time consuming , and not totally necessary .
Now all unit tests are wrapped in a transaction .
This is a much faster operation on the DB , and that is where the speed gains come from .
People using doc tests are n’t having their tests run inside a transaction , but that is the same behavior as before the change .
If you are curious more about the implementation of this patch , there is a huge discussion on ticket 8138 that shows some of the interesting things encountered during this process .
This patch applies cleanly to Django 1.0 as far as I know , so if you are running tests on any kind of large code base I would recommend either applying the patch in # 8138 , or upgrading to trunk .
This also means that you have one less excuse for not writing or running tests ;)
Well , I ’m back from a long , cloud - ridden , sleep - clotted weekend holiday and ready to blog .
But there ’s a problem : the things that seem to be exercising the residents of Blogadelphia this week do n’t seem very exciting to me .
You want my opinion on Hillary for Secretary of State ?
Do n’t have much of one .
She ’d be fine –I ’ve traveled with her overseas and she ’s a terrific ambassador–but I ’d also be thrilled to see her stay in the Senate and help build a consensus on health care and other issues .
You want to hear me expatiate on the plethora of Clintonians filling the Obama Administration ?
Do n’t have much of an opinion about that , either .
I mean , most administrations are filled with experts who served in previous administrations .
The Bush Cabinet dated back to the Ford White House ( and to the previous Bush Cabinet ) .
The Clintonites Obama has picked , or is considering , are excellent .
I have n’t heard a rumor yet that alarmed me as much as the prospect of Janet Reno ( D - Mars ) as Attorney General during the Clinton Administration ; there has n’t been a name raised or a position offered that seems implausible so far .
And the quiet , disciplined way that Obama has gone about this transition seems nothing but good .
I can honestly say that he ’s probably a much better person than I am :
His tolerance for Joe Lieberman–who questioned his patriotism–is saintly ( and also smart politics ) .
Indeed , the only thing I have a really strong blogometric opinion about today is the letter Ayman Al - Zawahiri has issued , in which the terrorist calls the President - elect a “ house slave . ”
If this is n’t disinformation–and it would be nice if our intelligence community were clever enough to have forged the statement–it is fabulous news for reasons most succinctly described by Richard Clarke :
“ Obama ’s election has taken the wind out of al Qaeda ’s sails in much of the Islamic world because it demonstrates America ’s renewed commitment to multiculturalism , human rights , and international law .
It also proves to many that democracy can work and overcome ethnic , sectarian , or racial barriers .
“ Obama ’s commitment to withdraw from Iraq also takes away an al Qaeda propaganda tenet : that the U.S. seeks to occupy oil rich Arab lands .
His commitment to defeat al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan also challenges their plans .
Most of all , by returning to American values the world admires , Obama sets al Qaeda back enormously in the battle of ideas , the ideological struggle which determines whether al Qaeda will continue to have significant support in the Islamic world . ”
The Zawahiri letter is one of the first real indications we have of the new international state of affairs ( the Ahmadinejad letter of congratulations may also have been a good sign , but was leavened by the author ’s lack of real power and the fact that he ’s running for reelection ) .
The terrorists are now exposed as racists , on top of everything else .
We have many miles to go in Afghanistan and the northern and western precincts of Pakistan , and more blood to shed–and innumerable ways to screw up , since no one has ever gotten Afghanistan right–but the wind seems to have shifted slightly and is now at our back .
Your National Enquirer newspaper has published photos purporting to show Cindy McCain , fragile , lonely beer heiress wife to Senator John McCain , kissing some guy who is n't Senator John McCain !
" Multiple witnesses " caught Cindy and this mystery man " lip locking on several other occasions . "
The guy is " a long - haired man who resembles ' a washed - up ' 80s rock musician , ' " apparently .
Just read the " stunned reaction of an eyewitness " :
" I could n't believe I was watching Cindy McCain passionately kissing and hugging another man ! "
That is the Ben Ratliff pull - quote on the movie poster for the documentary of sad that is the Republican party in 2008 .
Also this all happened at a Moody Blues show in Tempe , Arizona .
A McCain spokesperson declined to comment .
But surely there are lots of brittle - looking 50 - year - old blondes in the Phoenix metro area — is n't that where they all go to spawn ?
Still , this is shocking news for those who thought the marriage between cruel , borderline - emotionally abusive absentee husband and serial - cheater John McCain and lonely , DC - hating , solitary , formerly drug - addicted Cindy McCain was a strong , healthy bond .
Scientists discover the gene that makes some drinkers violent
Researchers have discovered a genetic mutation which increases aggression in drinkers .
Scientists are closer to understanding why alcohol turns some people into violent yobs - while others are more likely to fall asleep at the bar .
Researchers have discovered a genetic mutation which increases aggression and impulsiveness in drinkers .
Dr Roope Tikkanen , one of the researchers from Helsinki University Central Hospital in Finland , said that alcoholism , alcohol consumption and violence were closely related .
' People react quite differently to acute alcohol exposure , ' he said .
' Most individuals become relaxed and talkative , while some - particularly persons who are introverted while sober - become expansively extroverted and aggressive . '
Alcohol was found to increase the risk of impulsive violence among men born with a highly active version of a gene which produces the substance monoamine oxidase A , the researchers found .
Unusually high levels of this chemical are linked to depression and hyperactivity .
The mutation is less likely to trigger violence as people get older , the scientists said .
The findings , which come from a study of 174 men with histories of violence and alcohol abuse , could pave the way for new drugs to stop drinkers becoming abusive .
Gay Romeo is an international dating website and social community for gay , bisexual , and transgender men .
In order to reach out to these men in the 90 or so countries where homosexuality is illegal or not completely legal , the website is offering free premium subscriptions to anyone in one of these countries .
" It 's not easy to change the systems or the cultures they live in .
However , the internet can be of some use .
It 's a way to let gay people know about gay life elsewhere .
And it also gives them the possibility to get in touch with other gays in their country or somewhere else in the world . "
So far the company has given out 27,800 free subscriptions , using SSL encryption with their premium service makes it much safer for them to browse the site , if the government tracks the internet activity of its citizens .

The Chico Peace and Justice Center will no longer offer its garden or ordained ministers for wedding ceremonies , the center announced Jan .
8 . The reason ?
It does n’t want to assist with heterosexual weddings as long as same - sex couples ca n’t get married .
In May 2008 , after the California Supreme Court ruled that the state constitution protected a fundamental right to marry for all couples , heterosexual or not , County Clerk Candace Grubbs announced her office would no longer perform civil marriage ceremonies .
So the CP&JC stepped in , offering services free of charge .
But with the Nov. 4 passage of Proposition 8 , the anti-gay - marriage measure , the center decided to get out of the wedding game .
Susan Tchudi , a member of the center ’s Board of Directors who often performed ceremonies , explained , “ There was so much joy in marrying loving couples , both same - sex and heterosexual couples ; however , I can no longer participate in a system that discriminates against a whole group of people . ”
WHEN WE LOOK at nature , it has become commonplace to see a fastidiously self - regulating system at work : wildebeest trim the savannah grasses , lions cull the wildebeest herds , and vultures clean the bones of both .
Forests take in the carbon dioxide we exhale , use it to grow , and replace it with oxygen .
The planet even has a thermostat , the carbon cycle , ... ( Full article : 2549 words )

日本では、以前と比べると葬儀が簡略化されてきたという人が大勢いますが、千葉の葬儀も例外ではなく、近所の人で葬儀を手伝う葬式組や班といった団体が徐々に無くなっています。
しかし、千葉の市内や郊外、また農村部でも違いがあり、地域によって葬儀の仕方やしきたりが違うようです。
★葬儀社の人と話し合いながら決めましょう→千葉県での葬儀なら【博全社】千葉県に密着した葬儀社
＜どこで火葬をするか＞
一部の調査によると、千葉ではたくさんの人が火葬の時には公共の火葬場を使用しており、民間の火葬場を使う人はほぼわずかで、全体の３パーセントに満たない数です。
一方東京では亡くなる人が毎日大勢いるため、公共の火葬場は予約がいっぱいで、火葬する遺体が山積みになっています。
それで、都心においては民間の火葬場で火葬を行う人がたくさんいます。
＜人気のプランは家族葬＞
千葉の葬儀は、全国的な流行に伴って家族葬で行われ、故人の家族に加えて親しい親族だけで、比較的小規模で葬儀が行われます。
家族葬が主流である点は全国と変わりませんが、参列する人の数には違いがあり、全国の家族葬の平均は３０人程度ですが、千葉では５０人から１００人の間で、参列する人が大勢いることがわかりました。
＜その他の特徴 ＞
千葉の葬儀は他の土地と違って参列する人が多く、千葉県外に住んでいる親戚なども招かれる傾向があり、遺族は葬儀の時に遠方の参列者でも集まれる場所で行おうと考えるようです。
それで、皆の交通が便利な駅の近くの民間の斎場などで、告別式が行われたりします。
The EU and Microsoft have clashed several times over the years
The European Commission has accused Microsoft of harming competition by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system .
The commission said it had reached the preliminary view that the US software giant had undermined consumer choice and infringed EU rules .
Microsoft and the European Union have engaged in legal battles over competition issues for years .
Last year , the EU fined Microsoft 899 m euros ( $ 1.4bn ; £ 680.9 m ) .
Browser battle
In its statement on Friday the Commission said : " Microsoft 's tying of Internet Explorer to the Windows operating system harms competition between web browsers , undermines product innovation and ultimately reduces consumer choice . "
Microsoft said that it was studying the commission 's preliminary finding , and did not rule out requesting a formal hearing .
It has been given eight weeks to reply .
The US software firm controls the majority of the web - browsing market through its Explorer browser .
Analysts say the company has diversified enormously and is now no longer so reliant on its Windows operating system , with revenue coming from Xbox sales and server software .
In February 2008 , the EU fined Microsoft 899 m euros for defying sanctions imposed on it for anti-competitive behaviour .
The penalty - which was then one of the largest imposed by the European Commission - came after Microsoft failed to comply with an earlier 2004 ruling that it had abused its market position .
I 'm old enough to remember when some of the first hard drives , such as the IBM Winchester - two disks with 30 MBs each , hence 30/30 , thus Winchester after the 30/30 rifle - showed up .
I can also recall using cassette - tapes and 8 - inch floppy disks on PCs .
I 've met people in their twenties who are unclear about what cassette - tapes are exactly and floppy disks are rapidly falling away from our collective memory .
Now , it looks like hard - drives will soon be following them into history 's dustbin .
Sound impossible ?
Actually it 's all too possible .
SSD ( Solid State Drives ) have gone from being small and pricey to being roomy and affordable .
At the year 's beginning , you could only find 4 and 8 GB SSDs on inexpensive , Linux - powered netbooks or a 64GB SSD on the expensive Rolls - Royce of laptops , the Macbook Air .
As 2008 comes to a close though .
It 's a different story .
The drives are getting bigger and cheaper .
128 GB drives are now common , 256GBs are on their way , and Toshiba will soon be selling 512GB drives .
You say you want top performance ?
Then you really want a SSD .
In a recent ComputerWorld review of the Intel X25 SSD , a 2.5 - inch form factor 80 GB drive , zipped by a Western Digital VelociRaptor .
The VelociRaptor clocked in with a 250.2MB/sec. burst speed and 105.6MB/sec. average read through using the HD Tach speed tests .
That 's a great time .
The X25 , though , beat it with a 256.7MB / sec. burst speed and what 's far more interesting , a sustained 230.2MB /sec. transfer speed .
SSDs are n't anywhere close to their top performance though .
Micro claims that their next generation of SSDs , due out in the first quarter of 2009 , will hit 1 Gb / sec. throughput .
Put it all together and I can see SSDs putting hard drives out to pasture by 2009's end on desktops and laptops .
After that it may not be long before they start replacing hard drives on servers .
" Impossible ! "
You say ?
Think again .
It seems Google is already putting SSDs into service .
It 's been nice knowing you hard - drives , but it looks like we 'll be saying good - bye to you soon .

Web design consists , for the most part , of interface design .
There are many techniques involved in crafting beautiful and functional interfaces .
Here ’s my collection of 10 that I think you ’ll find useful in your work .
They ’re not related to any particular theme , but are rather a collection of techniques I use in my own projects .
Without further ado , let ’s get started .
Web design consists , for the most part , of interface design .
There are many techniques involved in crafting beautiful and functional interfaces .
Here ’s my collection of 10 that I think you ’ll find useful in your work .
They ’re not related to any particular theme , but are rather a collection of techniques I use in my own projects .
Without further ado , let ’s get started .
Links ( or anchors ) are inline elements by default , which means that their clickable area spans only the height and width of the text .
This clickable area , or the space where you can click to go to that link ’s destination , can be increased for greater usability .
We can do this by adding padding and , in some cases , also converting the link into a block element .
Here ’s an example of inline and padded links , with their clickable areas highlighted to show the difference :
Obviously , the larger the clickable area is , the easier it is to click on the link because there is less of a chance of missing it .
Converting links into block elements makes the text area span the whole width of the container , unless the width is specified otherwise .
This makes it ideal for links located in sidebars .
We can do it with the following code :
a { display : block ; padding : 6 px ; }
Make sure to also add a healthy dose of padding to the links , because converting a link into a block only affects its behavior and width ; adding padding ensures that the link is high enough and has some room to breathe .
2. Typesetting buttons
Attention to every detail is what separates a great product from a mediocre one .
Interface elements such as buttons and tabs are clicked on many times a day by your users , so it pays to typeset them properly ; and by typesetting I mean positioning the label .
Here ’s a couple of examples of the kind of misplaced labels I sometimes notice :
At first glance they look okay , but notice that the text is placed too high because the lowercase letters have been used as a guide to align the text vertically in the center , like so :
However , if we use uppercase letters as well as lowercase letters with ascenders ( “ t , ” “ d , ” “ f , ” “ h , ” “ k ” and “ l ” ) , the balance shifts upwards , making the label appear too high on the button .
In such cases , we should set the type using the uppercase height as a guide – or set it a little bit higher if most of the letters are lowercase .
Here ’s what I mean :
This gives the whole button a more balanced look and feel .
Little touches like this go a long way towards making your interface more polished and satisfying to use .
3 . Using contrast to manage focus
Similarly , you can also manage the focus of your visitors ’ attention with contrast between elements .
Here ’s an example of a post headline and some meta information underneath regarding who posted the article and its date :
All the text is set in black .
Let ’s decrease the contrast between the meta information ( the date and author ’s name ) and the background by putting the text in a light shade of gray :
The highest contrast element here is the headline , so it literally pops out at us .
The other elements fade into the background .
Here , I ’ve chosen the author as the second - most important element , and the date as the least .
The font also differs in size and style , but the contrast level can be very powerful .
Let ’s reverse the order of importance to date , author and headline :
You can see how effective it is in shifting focus : the date now pops out at you , while the headline fades away .
This technique comes in very handy for information - heavy websites , such as blogs , forums and social networks , in which you want to make a lot of information easily scannable while still showing a lot of additional things , like dates .
Fading the extras allows visitors to easily focus their attention on the most important pieces of text .
4 . Using color to manage attention
Color can also be used to effectively focus your visitors ’ attention on important or actionable elements .
For example , during the US presidential election , pretty much all of the candidates ’ websites had the donation button colored red .
Red is a very bright and powerful color so it attracts attention , and it stands out even more when the rest of the website is blue or another colder color .
Warmer tones like red , yellow and orange are naturally bright and so tend to attract the eye .
They also “ expand ” when set against colder colors like blue and green .
This means that an orange button on a blue background looks like it ’s flowing outwards and taking the front seat .
Conversely , a blue button on an orange background contracts inward , wishing to stay in the background .
Here ’s a picture to illustrate :
Here ’s a couple of examples of websites that use color effectively to direct users ’ attention to the important elements :
Function features a “ We ’re Hiring ” link on its jobs page .
To ensure the link is not missed , the designers set it against a red background that pops out from the dark background header , effectively grabbing attention .
Causecast use color effectively .
Four bright pink elements pop out at you : the logo , the feedback link , the donate link and the website description message .
Want the “ About ” blurb on your website to grab the visitor ’s focus ?
Make the background yellow .
Want to make the “ Join ” button stand out ?
Color it orange .
Make sure not to highlight too many elements , though ; if you do , they may get lost in each other ’s company .
5 . White space indicates relationships
One of the most crucial elements in an interface is the white space between elements .
If you ’re not familiar with the term white space , it means just that : space between one interface element and another , be it a button , a navigation bar , article text , a headline and so on .
By manipulating white space , we can indicate relationships between certain elements or groups of elements .
So , for example , by putting the headline near the article text we indicate that it is related to that text .
The text is then placed farther away from other elements to separate it and make it more readable .
Here ’s an example in which white space could be improved :
The text looks all right and is certainly readable , but because the spaces above and below each heading are equal , they do n’t separate each piece of text clearly .
We can improve this by increasing the white space between each section and also by slightly tightening the line height of the paragraphs :
This results in more clearly defined blocks ; we can easily tell which headings go with which pieces of text and can see the separate sections clearly .
Good designers often squint or glance at their work from a distance , which lets them see the blocks of elements separated by white space as they merge together .
If you can not see these groups clearly then you may need to tweak your white space .
6. Letter spacing
Web design is pretty limiting for typographers .
But while there are only a few safe Web fonts and not a great many things you can do to style them , it ’s worth remembering that we do still have some level of control .
“ Tracking ” is a term used in the field of typography to describe the adjustment of spacing between letters in words .
We ’ve got the ability to do this with CSS using the letter - spacing property .
If used with restraint and taste , this property can be effective in improving the look of your headlines .
I would n’t recommend using letter spacing on the body text because the default spacing generally provides the best readability for smaller font sizes .
Here ’s an example of letter spacing in use :
And here ’s the CSS code used for the above examples :
h1 { font - family : Helvetica ; font - size : 27 px ; } h2 { font - family : Helvetica ; font - size : 27 px ; letter - spacing : - 1 px ; } h3 { font - family : Georgia ; font - size : 24 px ; letter - spacing : 3 px ; font - variant : small - caps ; font - weight : normal ; }
The effect can be useful when you want to craft a more aesthetically pleasing or more original heading .
Here , I ’ve used only a couple pixels for letter spacing , but already it makes a big difference to the style of the font .
7. Auto - focus on input
Many Web applications and websites feature forms .
These may be search forms or input forms inviting you to submit something .
If this form is the core feature of your application or website , you may want to consider automatically focusing the user ’s cursor on the input field when the website loads .
This will speed things up because users can start typing right away without having to click on it .
A good example of this is Google and Wikipedia ’s websites .
Upon arriving at Wikipedia.org , the search box is already highlighted , ready to accept text .
To automatically focus on input fields , you ’ll need a little bit of JavaScript .
There are various solutions , and the one you should use depends on the functionality you want to achieve .
The simplest way to do it would be to add the following to your body tag :
< body onLoad=“ document.forms.form_name.form_field.focus ( ) ” >
Your form code should look something like :
< form method = “ get ” name= “ form_name ” action= “ # ” > < input type =“ text ” name= “ form_field ” size = “ 20 ” /> < input type=“ submit ” value = “ Go ” /> </ form >
Now , every time the page loads , the text field called “ form_field ” will be automatically selected , ready for input .
The only problem with this is that if your users want to return to the previous page using the Backspace key , they will be out of luck because they ’ll just be deleting characters in the input field .
Thankfully , Harmen Janssen has another simple JavaScript solution you can find here .
Harmen ’s script allows the Backspace key to go to the previous page when there are no characters left in the input field to delete .
8. Custom input focus
While the default look of form elements suffices for most functions , sometimes we want something a little prettier or a little more standardized across various browsers and systems .
We can style input fields by simply targeting it with an “ id , ” “ class ” or plain old “ input , ” like so :
input { border : 2 px solid # 888 ; padding : 4 px ; font - size : 1em ; background - color : # F8F8F8 ; }
What ’s more interesting is also being able to style the input field when it ’s in focus ; that is , the state it ’s in when it has been clicked .
To do this , we need to attach a “ : focus ” after the “ input ” property :
input : focus { border - color : #000 ; background - color : #FFFE9D ; }
If you ’re using custom backgrounds to style your input field , they may clash with some browsers and operating systems ’ default focus styles .
For example , here ’s a screenshot of a custom - styled form clashing with the default blue OS X glow effect :
In such cases , you could also use the “ input : focus ” property to remove the default styling .
The default blue glow in the screenshot above can be removed by disabling the “ outline ” property :
input : focus { outline : none ; }
The blue glow effect will now be gone :
Obviously you would only want to remove the outline if you ’re replacing it with your own styling , so that you do n’t negatively affect the accessibility and usability of your forms .
9 . Hover controls
Some Web applications have extra utility controls , such as edit and delete buttons , that do n’t necessarily have to be shown beside every item at all times .
They can be hidden to simplify the interface and focus visitors ’ attention on the main controls and content .
For example , these hover controls are used in Twitter when you hover over messages :
These hover controls can be achieved with some simple CSS code , without any JavaScript .
Simply style the < div > with the controls when its parent < div > is in a hover state .
Here ’s the code to hide and show the controls ( using a < div > with the class “ controls ” inside a < div > with the class “ message ” ) :
. message .controls { display : none ; } . message : hover .controls { display : block ; }
When you hover over the “ message ” < div > , the “ controls ” < div > inside it will appear , along with all of its content , giving you the same functionality as shown in the Twitter screenshot above .
There may be an issue with accessibility because screen readers may not be able to read the hidden < div > .
There are plenty of other ways to hide the inner < div > , such as offsetting it with a negative margin that takes it off the page ( e.g. “ left - margin : - 9999 px ” ) , coloring its text the same color as the background or simply placing another < div > on top of it .
This technique should of course be used with restraint because you do n’t want to hide your important controls ; but if used correctly , it can be useful for cleaning up your interface by removing those extra utility links that you do n’t want to show up at all times .
Note that this does n’t work in IE6 , so you ’ll need to override the hiding property in your IE6 - specific style sheet or , if you do n’t have one , simply use the following IE6 - specific code inside the < head > section of your code :
<!--[ if lt IE 7 ] > < style type =" text / css " media= " screen " > . message .controls { display : block ; } </style > <![ endif ] -->
10 . Verbs in labels
You can make options dialogs much more usable by thinking through the labels you use on buttons and links .
If an error or message pops up and the options are “ Yes , ” “ No ” and “ Cancel , ” you have to read the whole message to be able to answer .
Seems normal , right ?
But we can actually speed things up by using verbs in the labels .
So , if instead of “ Yes , ” “ No ” and “ Cancel , ” we have “ Save , ” “ Do n’t Save ” and “ Cancel ” buttons , you would n’t even need to read the message to understand what the options are and which action to perform .
All the information is contained in the button labels .
Using verbs in labels on buttons and links makes the options dialogs more usable because the labels contain all of the information the user needs to be able to make a decision .
To Conclude
Hopefully , you ’ve found a few new techniques that will be useful in your work .
As always , using them effectively comes down to restraint and thoughtful implementation .
For example , controls that appear on hover may clean up your interface , but they will also increase the learning curve because people may not notice these controls at first .
But showing all controls at all times may not be the best strategy either because users would need to scan more things to find what they ’re looking for .
Striking the right balance between what you show and what you hide is a delicate art and is completely in your hands as the designer .
Do n’t use a technique just because it exists : use it if it makes sense in your context . ( al )
More than a point update
Dictate 1.2
Developer : MacSpeech
System requirements : Intel - based Mac ; Mac OS X 10.5.2 or greater ( " Leopard " ) or Mac OS X 10.4.11 ( " Tiger " ) ; Internet connection required for product registration ; MacSpeech - certified noise - canceling microphone ( included )
Price : $ 165 ( buy )
MacSpeech lit up MacWorld 2008 when it showed Dictate , its new voice recognition app that was built upon the powerful Dragon Naturally Speaking recognition engine .
Mac users , used to having access only to much more limited programs like iListen , were ecstatic , and when the program shipped a few months later , it was praised as a huge step forward .
In our review , though , we noted that the program was incomplete .
" Dictate 's main limitation is that it does n't contain a corrections engine ( like Dragon Naturally Speaking does ) , which lets you tell Dictate when it has gotten a word wrong , and then tell it which word you intended , " wrote our own Dave Girard .
" This significantly improves the accuracy of your voice profile over time .
According to the documentation , a ' future version of MacSpeech Dictate will have a Correction feature that will help automate this process . '
The corrections feature is definitely needed , so we anxiously await an update to this .
Ditto for Spelling Mode , which is coming in a free future update . "
That update is now here , and it does bring the promised correction mode and spelling mode .
But even with the free additions , Dictate does not ( yet ) offer entrance into voice computing nirvana .
Bring on the features
In addition to a set of bug fixes , the new Dictate update brings two major new features to the program : spelling mode and corrections mode .
Spelling mode provides a way to enter words character by character using only one 's voice , something that might not at first appear to be overly useful but is , in fact , indispensable to good voice recognition software .
In the section above , for instance , the program was unable to spell " Girard " without assistance .
( Its best guess was " Gerrard , " which is surprisingly good . )
The new mode allows users to switch from dictation to spelling in order to type out proper names , unusual words , or abbreviations .
It 's doubly important in a program like MacSpeech Dictate , because the software has issues — sometimes serious issues — once you use dictation .
More on these in a moment .
The main status window
The big drawback to the spelling mode is that users must explicitly shift into spelling mode and then back to dictation mode every time they need to spell a word .
Given all the other problems in the world , this is n't a huge deal , but dictating a sentence , pausing , saying " spelling mode , " spelling a word letter - by - letter , pausing , saying " dictation mode , " and waiting for the software to switch is not the height of elegant behavior .
In Naturally Speaking for Windows , spelling is integrated directly into the dictation mode .
The other major feature is a correction mode , which MacSpeech refers to as " phrase training . "
When the software makes recognition errors or fails to understand the name of your company ( a real concern when your company is called " Ars Technica " ) , you can use the phrase training feature to teach the software what you meant .
Phrase training in action
Saying " train the words [ phrase in question ] " selects the phrase in question , opens the recognition window , and shows a set of choices about what you might have said .
Any of these can be chosen and edited ; when done , the program learns from your correction and hopefully gets the word or phrase right in the future .
After a couple attempts , Dictate has become a champ at recognizing " Ars Technica . "
Not having this functionality could prove maddening to early users of the software , who found themselves unable to teach the program new words or train it to their particular pronunciation of words already in its dictionary .
Dictate still lacks a good vocabulary browser that allows for viewing , adding , and formatting words , but the fact that the corrections mode is here , and that it works , should make the program far more useful for anyone who gets sick of spelling out their company 's name every time it comes up ( and remember , you could n't do this by voice , either , in the initial version of the software ) .
Though the new update was the product of half a year 's work , MacSpeech has lived up to its promise and delivered the new 1.2 update free of charge to existing Dictate users .
Critics will say ( and have been saying for some time now ) that the product was simply released too early , in that crucial features like these should have been present from the start .
Why was n't Dictate given a bit more time in the oven ?
When we spoke to the company about this issue , we were told that it was a deliberate choice .
Yes , the software might cause some frustration due to a lack of polish or missing features , but it would hardly be a benefit for Mac users who rely on voice recognition to wait another six months in order to use the software .
A limited program with a solid recognition engine was better than no program at all .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Exxon Mobil reported the largest annual profit in U.S. history Friday , making $ 45.22 billion on the back of record oil prices .
But Exxon 's quarterly profit fell over 33 % , as crude prices dropped precipitously in the last quarter as recession spread through the globe .
Exxon ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) , the world 's largest publicly traded oil company , made $ 7.82 billion in the fourth quarter on revenue of $ 84.7 billion .
On a per share basis , the company made $ 1.55 , beating analysts ' estimates of $ 1.45 a share .
Exxon shares rose 1 % on the New York Stock Exchange .
Exxon 's annual profit beat the previous record - $ 40.61 billion - set by the company in 2007 .
The company reported total revenue in 2008 of over $ 477 billion , giving the company a profit margin of about 9 % .
That 's in line with other manufacturing industries , and far below the margins seen in other sectors , such as tech .
The company returns most of its profit to shareholders , distributing about $ 40 billion in 2008 in the form of share buybacks and dividends .
It also said it stepped up its efforts to find oil , spending about $ 26 billion on capital and exploration projects , up 25 % from 2007 .
Some have said the company returns too much money to shareholders and not enough finding new oil , a situation that drives up oil prices for everyone .
Exxon reported a 1 % decline in oil and natural gas production in 2008 .
But the company has argued that it's hard to tap new , lucrative oil fields overseas in the face of rising nationalism .
It has also said other projects were too expensive at the time , a decision that 's been somewhat vindicated given oil 's sharp fall in price .
Oil prices , the driving force behind oil company profits , swung widely in 2008 .
Crude hit a record $ 147.27 in July , as surging global demand and wide investor interest pushed up commodity prices across the board .
But as the credit crisis spread and cracks emerged in the global economy , money fled the oil market .
By December crude traded in the $ 30s .
Although stocks in general and oil stocks in particular have fallen sharply in the last few months , Exxon 's share price has held up quite well .
Exxon shares are down 9 % in the last 6 months , compared to a drop of over 30 % in the broad Standard & Poor 's 500 index .
Analysts have credited the company for a shrewd , if controversial , management style - avoiding lots of spending on expensive projects to find and develop oil when prices were high .
" ExxonMobil 's financial strength continued to support its disciplined capital investment approach in the midst of a growing global economic slowdown , " Exxon chief Rex Tillerson said in a statement .
The recent drop in oil prices recently has also muted calls for a special windfall profits tax - popular during the summer months when crude traded over $ 100 a barrel .
During his campaign , President Obama called for a special tax on oil profits whenever crude went above $ 80 a barrel .
But with oil prices currently trading around $ 40 a barrel , and an unprecedented financial crisis to deal with , legislation targeting oil companies has been on the back burner .
Exxon in the fourth quarter
Exxon said its fourth quarter earnings of almost $ 8 billion were hurt by falling oil prices , higher operating expenses , and charges related to Gulf Coast hurricanes .
Exxon made $ 11.7 billion in the same period last year , and a record $ 13.38 billion in the third quarter or 2008 .
But Exxon , which sells more barrels of refined products such as gasoline than it does crude oil , made up for some of the losses with higher profits on the refined products .
The price for gasoline , diesel , jet fuel and the like did n't fall as much as oil prices in the quarter , so the profitability on those products increased , although marginally .
Exxon made about $ 5.6 billion selling crude oil in the quarter , down from about $ 8.2 billion in 2007 .
It made about $ 2.4 billion selling gasoline and other refined products , up from about $ 2.3 billion in 2007 .
Exxon spent $ 6.8 billion finding and developing new oil reserves in the quarter - up 11 % from 2007 - despite the fall in oil prices .
But it 's not clear if the increased spending is the result of more actual activity or simply higher costs .
Oil prices in 2008
Crude had a wild ride in 2008 .
Oil prices began the year at $ 100 , shot to a record $ 147 during the summer , and hit a low of $ 33 in December .
The rollercoaster had a lot of people asking just what 's going on .
Tight supply and investment money were the most common explanations .
When oil hit $ 147 this summer , demand was strong .
The world was capable of producing just one or two million barrels a day more than it was using .
Investors were scared a supply disruption from a political hot spot would result in a shortage , or worse , demand would outstrip supply .
Higher prices encouraged conservation and an influx of money into finding alternative fuels and more oil .
They also caused great hardship for motorists , which some say contributed to the current recession .
Then the financial crisis hit , but demand did not collapse - only so much conservation can occur in a short period of time - but oil fell enough to bump up the difference between what the world can produce and what it uses to about 3 or 5 million barrels a day .
The investment money fled the market - both in response to the stability that extra oil provides and the need to cover losses as bets across the board soured .
But most analysts say that when the economy recovers , oil prices will spike once again .

Rep . Michele Bachmann won reelection early Wednesday , fending off a challenge from Democrat Elwyn Tinklenberg in a Sixth Congressional District race that came to symbolize the perilous position of Republican incumbents across the nation .
Bachmann held on to a narrow but significant lead over Tinklenberg with 8 of 10 precincts reporting and a dwindling number of areas where he could find enough votes to make up the difference .
Bachmann said Tinklenberg called her and conceded shortly after midnight .
Bachmann credited her victory to her vote against the $ 700 billion financial rescue package and her campaign to open up restricted areas for oil drilling to bring down the price of gasoline .
She said that wherever she went , " those two issues people appreciated , " she said .
Independence Party candidate Bob Anderson was a distant third , but drew enough votes to possibly influence the outcome .
In the Second District , Rep. John Kline declared victory over DFLer Steve Sarvi .
Kline was leading by a wide margin with nearly all precincts counted .
Reeling from criticism for questioning the patriotism of other politicians , Bachmann scrambled in recent days to focus attention on her call to cut taxes , a theme that plays well in the conservative district .
Tinklenberg , who ran as a moderate Democrat and was endorsed by the Independence Party , portrayed Bachmann as an extremist and himself as one who transcended partisan politics .
Late Tuesday , Tinklenberg was counting on votes that had n't been reported yet from university areas of St. Cloud and in Washington County to overcome Bachmann 's edge .
" We really need big numbers there , " he said .
Tinklenberg also expressed surprise that Anderson was winning about one in 10 votes , but was unsure which candidate he hurt more .
Anderson said he believed he had drawn more votes away from Bachmann , saying they were " the two conservatives in this race . "
people who think they are original and unique for having " innovative " opinions , when really the only opinion they have is the opposite of whatever is considered " mainstream " at the time .
these people think they are above everyone else for being so " different , " and thinking they are the shit for not conforming to society when really their whole life revolves around being different JUST to be different so people think they are cool .
Being a hipster basically means THINKING that you can fool people into thinking that you have it all figured out by using reverse - psychology , when really you want to be accepted just as much as anyone else ...
Hipsters just try harder
Ai jus maked a lil mess but Ai kleen it awl up , 'k ?

CIUDAD JUAREZ , Mexico , Jan 19 ( Reuters ) - Shadowy vigilante groups are threatening Mexico 's drug gangs near the U.S. border in retaliation for a wave of murders and kidnappings that killed 1,600 people in this city alone last year .
One group in the border city of Ciudad Juarez pledged last week to " clean our city of these criminals " and said their mission was to " end the life of a criminal every 24 hours . "
The emergence of vigilantes would be a new twist to a vicious drug war that killed 5,700 people in Mexico last year and forced the United States to give hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Mexican government .
Ciudad Juarez , a manufacturing center in the desert across from El Paso , Texas , was the scene of the worst violence in 2008 as drug cartels fought each other as well as staging kidnappings for ransom and extorting businessmen .
In an e-mail to news organizations , the " Juarez Citizen Command " said it was funded by local businessmen sick of abductions and extortion in the city , home to factories that export goods to the United States .
While none of the city 's 1,600 in the last year were undoubtedly the work of vigilantes , a body was found on Jan.
7 with a message next to it that read : " This is for those who continue extorting . "
And six men in their 20s and 30s were shot dead and dumped together in Ciudad Juarez in October with a cardboard sign reading : " Message for all the rats :
This will continue . "
Drug gangs often leave threatening messages with the bodies of their victims , but security officials said those two incidents might have been the work of vigilantes .
Another group , " Businessmen United , The Death Squad " put a video on Internet site YouTube last June threatening to go after kidnappers and criminals in Ciudad Juarez , the biggest city in Mexico 's Chihuahua state .
The video is no longer on YouTube .
" FACELESS , ANONYMOUS "
State officials in Chihuahua said they were investigating who was behind the messages .
" We cannot tolerate the presence of these type of faceless , anonymous groups , " said Manuel del Castillo , a spokesman for the state government .
Retiring CIA chief Michael Hayden said last week that Mexico 's drug violence was possibly a greater problem than Iraq for President - elect Barack Obama .
The U.S. Justice Department also says Mexican gangs are one of the biggest threats to the United States .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has sent tens of thousands of troops and federal police to battle drug gangs but the violence has become worse since he took office in 2006 .
At least two other groups calling themselves vigilantes have sent statements to news organizations in the past two months , one in the northern state of Sonora bordering Arizona , and the other in the Pacific state of Guerrero , home to the beach resort of Acapulco .
In Ciudad Juarez , some residents say they would welcome vigilantes .
" That way they would stop the gangs , the mafia .
People are leaving here because of so many murders , " said David Hinojosa , 30 , who shines shoes in the city .
The city has been rocked by gun battles and beheadings by rival gangs fighting over smuggling routes into Texas , despite the presence of around 3,000 troops and federal police .
But local lawmakers say encouraging vigilantes is a mistake .
Some residents question whether soldiers are moonlighting as hitmen for drug gangs , a charge the army denies .
" People 's reactions are understandable .
But this is not the route we should take to solve things , " said Andreu Rodriguez , an opposition lawmaker and the head of security issues in Chihuahua 's state legislature .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- General Electric shares rallied more than 13 % Tuesday after executives vowed to preserve the company 's dividend and work to maintain its triple - A credit rating - a designation that keeps GE 's borrowing costs lower than almost any company in corporate America and gives it a significant advantage over its competition .
The pronouncements cheered investors who have been worried about the company 's finance unit , GE Capital .
But it is still difficult to understand how GE ( GE , Fortune 500 ) can realistically keep either promise .
Tuesday 's presentation focused only on GE Capital , in an effort to assuage fears about how well or poorly the finance company will weather the current credit storm .
But a few questions still remain .
One great relief was news that GE will preserve its $ 1.24 - a- share annual dividend through 2009 .
But that cash might better be used elsewhere , given the headwinds that GE Capital will face in the coming quarters .
Using GE 's estimates for 2008 , the company will generate $ 15.4 billion in cash from GE and GE Capital , not including asset sales , which are non-recurring items .
It will use $ 12.4 billion to pay its dividend .
In 2009 , the company will generate about $ 14 billion and pay out $ 13.4 billion in the form of a dividend .
That leaves only a slim cash cushion to offset the headwinds faced by GE Capital alone over the next few quarters .
The cash on hand could be scant to cover losses in the company 's wide array of financial services business .
As of the third quarter , GE Capital has issued $ 120 billion in loans to U.S. companies , municipalities and infrastructure projects .
It has issued $ 245 billion in credit to U.S. consumers , mostly in the form of private label credit cards at retailers such as Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , Lowe 's ( LOW , Fortune 500 ) , and the Gap ( GPS , Fortune 500 ) .
It bought $ 13 billion of troubled assets from Merrill Lynch and $ 13 billion in middle market commercial financing from Citibank .
And the loans that it underwrites , it generally holds on its books .
GE has been overly optimistic when it comes to loss reserves .
For example , losses on the U.S. consumer portfolio have jumped 4.13 percentage points since 2004 to 8.15 % , according to the presentation , but reserve coverage increased by only 1.04 percentage points over the same time period to 4.07 % .
GE says it will set aside about 6 % in reserve coverage for 2009 , but the loss picture will sure deteriorate from 8.15 % as consumers grapple with higher unemployment rates and falling home prices .
It is hard to tell how much the company should set aside .
According to GE Capital 's third - quarter earnings report , 38 % of the unit 's assets are considered " level 3 " , which means there is no way to value the asset save mark - to - model accounting .
Nearly all of GE Capital 's liabilities are considered " level 2 " assets , meaning that they are relatively illiquid assets whose value is determined by using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets and models .
As for the triple - A rating , no other banks or finance companies are so richly blessed , and GE Capital certainly does n't seem to have the strength to warrant such an honor .
Most glaringly , GE had to take part in two government assistance programs to shore up faith among potential debt buyers in the long - term bond and commercial paper markets - the FDIC is backstopping its bonds and the Federal Reserve is backstopping its commercial paper obligations .
In press releases announcing that the company would tap these programs , GE said it was participating largely to show support for the government as it moved to restore faith in the credit markets .
During Tuesday 's conference call , the tone had shifted .
Treasurer Kathy Cassidy and GE Capital CEO
Mike Neal said repeatedly that these programs " leveled the playing field " for GE Capital .
One can only assume that they meant against unfair credit markets rather than against other banks , since no financial services competitor is in as privileged position as GE .
Either way , the shift in tone shows that GE has become more willing to acknowledge that the debt markets no longer treat GE or GE Capital as triple - A rated borrowers .
The ratings agencies have blithely ignored these signs that GE is n't truly strong enough to deserve the same credit designation as cash generating machines such as Exxon Mobil ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) and the U.S. government .
And neither the ratings agencies nor GE are willing to talk specifics on how that rating is calculated .
GE will say that it is managing to that rating by drastically deleveraging its balance sheet , hopefully moving to 6 - to - 1 leverage from 8 - to - 1 currently , and changing its debt sources in order to keep Moody 's and S&P happy .
" Our plans reflect a very difficult environment , " GE chief financial officer Keith Sherin said .
" For 2009 , we are targeting to reduce leverage to 6 - to - 1 , lower outstanding commercial paper balance to $ 50 billion , and reduce our overall funding needs . "
But the market wants to know about the quality of the assets on GE Capital 's books , and that is a question that is still open to debate .
Remember if you will that Washington Mutual hit a wall due to bad assets , not high leverage .
GE successfully used Tuesday 's call as an opportunity to lower expectations , a move that Citigroup analyst Jeff Sprague had noted the company needed to take in order to calm markets .
GE lowered guidance just enough so as to prepare markets for a grim 2008 and 2009 , but not so much to scare them from the stock .
And yet , if bearish voices ( and prescient critics ) such as Nouriel Roubini and Lazard CEO Bruce Wasserstein are to be believed , repayment problems will surely continue to roll through the commercial real estate , consumer credit card and overseas markets at much higher levels than GE anticipates .
Moreover , sales of the industrial products for which GE is so well - known could shrink as businesses slash spending and conserve cash , and that could erode the businesses that GE hopes will offset the downsizing of GE Capital .
Let 's just hope that when GE gives its outlook for the rest of the company on Dec. 16 that management still looks realistically hopeful rather than foolishly rosy .
Bettie Page : 1950 's Pin -Up Queen & Dark Angel ( Photos )
Bettie Page 1923-2008
, a famous pin-up girl from the 1950's , died in a Los Angeles hospital of pneumonia on Thursday , December 11 , just one week after suffering a heart attack .
Her rep .
Mark Roesler released the following statement : " She captured the imagination of a generation of men and women with her free spirit and unabashed sensuality .
She was the embodiment of beauty , right up there with Marilyn Monroe . "
The 85 year old former model gained fame in 1955 when she was featured in the centerfold of Playboy magazine , as one of their early Playmates of the Month .
She became known for her fetish modeling and racy pin-up photos .
Page 's signature jet black hair and trademark bangs have reportedly influenced many artist .
She developed a significant cult following in the 1980's that continues today .
Her 1990 's autograph signing sessions netted her $ 200 - $ 300 apiece .
Several cult epic movies were released in 2005 including Bettie Page : Pin-Up Queen and Bettie Page : Bondage Queen .
A private funeral is planned for Tuesday .
She will be buried at Westwood Cemetery in L.A. , just a few feet from Marilyn Monroe .

Applications have moved to the browser and with that come lists of checkboxes .
It can be frustrating to click a list of checkboxes , so many applications like Gmail provide utilities to select items that meet certain criteria .
Solutions exist as browser plugins ( ie. CheckBoxMate , Check All ) , but these have not become mainstream .
As developers , we can mimick the behavior of these browser plugins with jQuery .
QuickCheck is a proof - of - concept jQuery plugin that makes it easier to manipulate lists of checkboxes .
Try a demo here .
QuickCheck adds the following behavior to checkboxes :
When you mouse - down on a checkbox , keep the mouse pressed and drag the cursor over other checkboxes .
The other checkboxes with either become checked or unchecked depending on the state of the first checkbox .
QuickCheck makes it much easier to manipulate lists of html checkboxes .
All you need to know to configure the plugin ( besides how jQuery plugins work ) is the following :
$ ('.multi' ) .quickcheck ( ) ; //
Applies QuickCheck to checkboxes with class ' multi '
$ (': checkbox ' ) .quickcheck ( ) ; //
Applies QuickCheck to all checkboxes
The plugin also has a couple of settings that let you change its behavior :
mode
default :
If the initial checkbox is unchecked , it will check that box and check all boxes that the mouse is dragged over .
If the initial checkbox is checked , it will uncheck all boxes .
" check " : Regardless of the initial checkbox , the mouse will only check boxes it is dragged over .
" uncheck " :
The mouse will only uncheck boxes it is dragged over .
" toggle " :
The mouse will toggle all checkboxes it is dragged over .
mouseup
Once the mouse is released , the plugin needs to know that it should stop selecting checkboxes when the mouse is over them .
Set this to the selector you want this mouseup event to be attached to .
The default is " html " which likely never needs to change .
To use the settings do the following when applying the plugin :
$ ( '.multi' ) .quickcheck ( {mode : " check " , mouseup : " html " } ) ;
Drawbacks and Potential Improvements
This technique has some obvious benefits but it also has some drawbacks .
Here are some quick thoughts on them .
Please add your own throughts in the comments .
Drawbacks
The functionality is not immediately obvious to those used to typical checkbox behavior .
Unlike the browser plugin , there is not a visual box to show what region you have selected .
The mouse must move directly over the box for it to be activated .
This makes it tough to select boxes that are not aligned .
Potential Improvements
Keyboard Shortcuts :
Hold a key while dragging to switch between modes to quickly select / deselect .
" Undo " :
If you drag over a checkbox a second time in the same run , return it to its original state .
Thanks for looking over the plugin .

It was a difficult few weeks of begging and pleading but today it all paid off .
This morning it was announced that GM & Chrysler would receive $ 17.4 billion dollars in loans .
" We were relieved .
It was a major victory " said a GM spokesman , " but we instantly realized that because of the way the books are handled at both companies that $ 17.4 was not a nice even number .
We prefer 5 's and 0's . "
Accountants from GM & Chrysler met today at 8:45 a.m. and determined the money would best be split by 17 .
" This gives each company 8.5 billion .
A much nicer number . "
This left .4 billion unaccounted for .
By 9:00 am a private luxury jet was fully catered and fueled .
Accountants , executives and their families boarded the aircraft at 9:07 a.m. for a two week " business " trip to Maui .
While boarding the luxury liner a reporter caught up to them and asked one executive why they felt now was the best time to leave .
The Executive was half way up the plane stairs and shouted , " We have a lot of work to do .
We need to make sure each penny of the $ 17 billion is spent wisely so we can get through this down - time .
Jobs will be lost , salaries will be reduced .
Together we can squeeze each penny to its fullest but we need time .
See you next year ! "
It was also reported that the executives received a handsome holiday bonus along with a new Lexus .
One factory worker who found out his salary was cut by a third and holiday bonuses for most were not available was shocked at the news .
" I ca n't believe they did n't get American cars . "
About an hour after the flight took off , all GM and Chrysler factories received the following fax from about 32,000 feet .
Being President on 24 was about as stable as being a drummer for Spinal Tap .
Okay , maybe not ALL the Presidents died .
In fact , most of them survived .
But it was n’t exactly a job that lent itself to longevity .
There were nine Presidents in total through 8 seasons of the show , and surprisingly not one of them was named Jack Bauer .
Oh well , maybe in the movie .
In honor of Presidents ’ Day , here ’s a complete list of the Presidents of 24 and what happened to each of them .
1. Unknown , President Harold Barnes ?
( Season 1 )
Here ’s what we know about Season 1 ‘s President .
It was n’t David Palmer who was still a Senator .
So that eliminates one in about 150 million possible candidates .
It could very well have been another person on this list , but it was never mentioned .
Most likely it was a different person .
If you follow the novels , the name Harold Barnes is mentioned as President prior to Season 1 , so most likely it was him .
He ’s described as temperamental , blowing off steam in private so that he could keep calm in public .
2. P­re­side­n­t­ David P­alme­r ( Seasons 2 - 3 )
We first meet D­avid­ Palm­er ( Dennis Haysbert ) in Season 1 during the California Presidential primary .
He is the front runner for the Democratic Presidential nomination and at the time was a United States Senator from Maryland .
Season
One involves J­ack B­auer stopping an assassination attempt on Palmer , and at the beginning of Season 2 we see that he is now the President .
As Commander in Chief , Palmer is seen as a good leader who makes difficult decisions without much hesitation .
At th­e end­ o­f s­eco­nd­ s­eas­o­n , Palm­er is the victim­ o­f biological attack , but is again executing his duties by the start of Season 3 .
However , political scandal surrounds him and he ultimately decides not to run for re-election , again preferring his principles over everything else .
His fate : Palmer w­as­ s­h­o­t d­ead­ b­y­ terro­ris­ts­ at th­e b­eginning o­f Season 5 .
3. Pre­si­de­n­t James Prescott ( Season 2 )
Prescott ( Alan Dale ) , is the Vice - President of the United States for David Palmer in Seasons 2 and 3 .
During Season 2 , Prescott led an effort to invoke the 25th Amendment , believing that Palmer ’s decisions were irrational based on his sudden reluctance to attack three middle eastern countries believed to be behind a failed nuclear strike on the United States .
He used this argument as evidence of his incapability to hold the office .
Prescott gathers the Cabinet members , and by one vote , David Palmer is removed from office under the provisions of the 25th Amendment .
After assuming the presidency , Prescott orders Palmer confined , and orders a military response based on what later was determined to be fabricated evidence .
After the forgery is discovered , Palmer assumes the presidency again .
His fate : Shamed by his actions , Prescott offers his resignation after his coup d’état , which Palmer rejects .
The character is briefly seen in Season 3 , participating in a teleconference with the President .
Fans of the 24 : The Game will also know that Prescott appears as acting President in the video game , while Palmer recovers from injuries incurred at the end of Season 2 .
As far as we know physically , he is fine today .
4. Pre­si­de­n­t John­ Ke­e­l­e­r ( Season 4 )
Senator John Keeler ( Geoff Pierson ) stood against incumbent President David Palmer during Palmer ’s bid for a second term in office in Season 3 .
With the help of Palmer ’s wife Sherry , Keeler uncovered disgracing evidence which he tried to use to blackmail Palmer .
Palmer stood his ground , but he ultimately withdrew from the race after the death of his wife .
Palmer ’s absence virtually guaranteed Keeler a win in the general election .
At the beginning of Season 4 we see Keeler is the new President .
At least until he was injured when a stealth fighter attacked Air Force One .
The plane crashed , killing many passengers .
Although Keeler himself survived , he was revealed to be in critical condition .
During President Keeler ’s incapacitation , the cabinet unanimously voted to invoke the 25th Amendment and appoint Vice President Charles Logan as acting - President .
When last mentioned , President Keeler was still in critical condition and his fate was not resolved when the Season ended .
His fate : Unknown , but Charles Logan would remain in office , meaning Keeler either died from his injuries or was unable or unwilling to resume his duties as President .
5. Pr­es­i­d­ent Cha­r­les­ Lo­­ga­n ( Seasons 4 and 5 )
As mentioned above , V­i­c­e Pr­es­i­d­en­­t C­har­l­es­ L­ogan­­ ( Gregory Itzin ) bec­ame the Pr­es­i­d­en­­t after­ John­­ Keel­er­ fell­ i­ nto a­­ c­oma .
Logan is not portrayed kindly as he is seemingly incapable of making hard decisions quickly or for himself , relying on the recommendations of his advisors .
Additionally , his resolve is weak , as he rarely stands behind a decision he has already made .
If that ’s not bad enough , Logan committed treason , and when it was exposed that he was involved in most of Season 5 ‘s horrific acts , including President David Palmer ’s assassination and the selling of Sentox VX nerve gas to terrorists , he was removed from office .
His fate : Removed from office on charges of obstruction of justice , he was placed under house arrest and confined to Hidden Valley Presidential Retreat .
In Season 6 he was stabbed by his unstable ex-wife Martha in a fit of anger and began to flatline on the way to the hospital .
He survived and returned in Season 8 , but committed suicide after his involvement in a massive conspiracy was revealed .
6. President Hal Gardner ( Season 5 )
After Charles Logan was arrested for his actions , Vice President Hal Gardner ( Ray Wise ) was sworn in as the new President .
We are clued in to these actions at the end of Season 5 .
As a politician , Gardner regularly advised Logan , taking credit for the good ideas and letting Logan handle the bad ones .
This led to distrust from Logan ’s inner circle , which believed Gardner was trying to hijack the Presidency .
In a round about way , I guess he succeeded .
He stayed in office for the rest of Logan ’s term , and it is unknown if he ran for re-election .
His fate : Unknown .
Little has been said of Gardner ’s Presidency .
7. Pres­i­d­ent Way­ne Palmer ( Season 6 )
W­ay­ne P­almer ( Gary Payton , no wait D.B. Woodside ) is a character we first met in Season 3 and is the bro­­t­her o­­f D­avi­d­ P­almer .
He served as David ’s chief of staff following Mike Novick ’s dismissal in Season 2 and by Season 6 he had been elected President of the United States .
Like several 24 Presidents , he was the victim of an attack and suffered significant brain damage as a result of the attempted assassination .
In order to prevent Vice President Noah Daniels from taking premature action against the Middle East , the President ’s doctors brought Palmer back to consciousness so that he could resume his duties .
However , he only served a few more hours before suffering a hemorrhage and falling back into a coma , which he had not woken from by the end of Season 6 .
His fate : Unknown , but like President Keeler he did not retake office , meaning he either died from his injuries or was unable or unwilling to resume his duties as President .
8. P­resi­d­ent­ No­ah D­ani­els ( Season 6 and Redemption )
Noah Daniels ( Powers Boothe ) was the Vice President of the United States under Wayne Palmer .
He became the Acting President of the United States under the provisions of the 25th Amendment due to President Palmer ’s incapacitation from after - effects of an attempt on his life .
He completed Palmer ’s term , but in Redemption we learn he lost his bid for re-election to Senator Allison Taylor .
His fate : Alive and doing okay , other than losing his re-election bid .
9. Pr­esi­dent­ A­lli­so­n T­a­y­lo­r­ ( Redemption and Seasons 7 - 8 )
T­h­e f­irst­ M­­a­da­m­­ President­ , Senator A­l­l­ison T­a­y­l­or ( Cherry Jones ) was sworn in as President­ in Redemption after defeating the incumbent , Daniels , in the general election .
In Redemption we are treated to some uncomfortable scenes between the two .
In her inauguration speech she indicated a firm resolve and a national posture that was different from Daniels ’ .
Her fate : Resigned somewhat in disgrace after being manipulated by Charles Logan into covering up a series of international incidents .
However , she did admit to her role and in the end prevented Jack from being executed , which was nice of her .
So there ’s your round up .
Two dead Presidents , two others at least critically wounded , one privately shamed , two Vice Presidents that faded away , one unknown , and one forced to resign .
Not exactly a great selection of who ’d you want to be running the country .

GE is struggling to get short term financing at a price it wants to pay .
So what does GE do ?
The answer is twofold :
1 ) Borrow from the Commercial Paper Funding Facility
2 ) Pretend this is a good thing .
Consider this ridiculous headline : GE to Sell CP to Fed to Help Unlock Credit Markets .
General Electric Co. , the biggest U.S. issuer of commercial paper , plans to use the Federal Reserve ’s new short - term funding facility , throwing its weight behind the central bank ’s efforts to unlock the credit markets .
“ This is a way for us to demonstrate our support for what the Fed is doing , which is providing all - around liquidity , ” Wilkerson said .
GE 's Disingenuous Pronouncement
GE Sees Shrinking Economy
The U.S. economy will have two or three quarters of “ negative growth ” once global financial systems stabilize , General Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt said .
Financial markets are experiencing the greatest disruption since the 1930s , tightening credit for corporate and consumer borrowers .
GE , the biggest U.S. issuer of commercial paper , said yesterday it plans to use a new short - term funding facility from the Federal Reserve when the program starts next week , throwing its weight behind Fed efforts to unfreeze the credit markets .
Companies should be planning under a scenario of “ what happen if the credit markets are half the size in 2009 , ” Immelt said .
GE still runs the company for its debt to be rated AAA , the highest available , Immelt said .
Financial companies will either become bank holding companies or have the AAA rating , he said .
“ We still believe if you have low cost of funds , good origination , good risk management , there is a role ” for a AAA - rated company , Immelt said .
“ You ’re either one or the other as time goes on . ”
GE Will Cut Costs , Jobs
General Electric Co. is cutting costs , preparing for a new wave of regulation from Washington and embracing manufacturing over financial services as ways out of the economic crisis , its chief executive said Friday .
" Costs will be lower in 2009 than in 2008 , " Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview .
" That will be true across the board . "
Employment will also be lower , he said , declining to name numbers or percentages .
GE 's NBC Universal business group recently announced cuts totaling $ 500 million , ...

Pentagon plans to station 20,000 troops for ' domestic security ' Agence France - Presse

The US Department of Defense plans to deploy 20,000 troops nationwide by 2011 to help state and local officials respond to terror or nuclear attacks and emergencies , The Washington Post said Monday .
Citing Pentagon officials , the newspaper said the plan calls for three rapid - reaction forces .
The first 4,700 - strong unit , built around an active - duty combat brigade , is based at Fort Stewart , Georgia , and is already available for deployment , according to General Victor Renuart , commander of the US Northern Command , it said .
Two additional groups will later join nearly 80 smaller National Guard and reserve units made up of about 6,000 troops to support local and state authorities nationwide , The Post said .
They will all would be trained to respond to domestic chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear , or high - yield explosive attacks .
The newspaper said that civil liberties groups and libertarians had expressed concern that the plan could undermine the Posse Comitatus Act , a 130 - year - old law restricting the military 's role in domestic law enforcement .
Before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , dedicating 20,000 troops to domestic response -- a nearly sevenfold increase in five years -- " would have been extraordinary to the point of unbelievable , " Paul McHale , assistant defense secretary for homeland defense , said in remarks last month noted by the Post .
But the recognition that civilian authorities may be overwhelmed in a catastrophe [ Hurricane Katrina might be used as an example ] prompted " a fundamental change in military culture . "
" The Pentagon 's plan calls for three rapid - reaction forces to be ready for emergency response by September 2011 , " the Post added .
" The first 4,700 - person unit , built around an active - duty combat brigade based at Fort Stewart , Ga. , was available as of Oct. 1 , said Gen. Victor E. Renuart Jr. , commander of the U.S. Northern Command . "
" If funding continues , two additional teams will join nearly 80 smaller National Guard and reserve units made up of about 6,000 troops in supporting local and state officials nationwide , " they continued .
" All would be trained to respond to a domestic chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear , or high - yield explosive attack , or CBRNE event , as the military calls it . "

Dear Neighbour , you 're not invited to my party .
A few weeks ago , a guy moved into the apartment across from me .
I know little about him apart from the fact that he owns cane furniture as I saw him carrying it in .
Last week , when I checked my mailbox , I found that my new neighbour had left me a note stating he was having a party and to let him know if the noise was too loud .
The problem I have with the note is not that he was having a party and did n’t invite me , it was that he selected a background of balloons .
If I were to write a note to my neighbours stating I was having a party and they were n't invited , I would n't add photos of ecstasy tablets and Lucius dancing to show what they are missing out on , I 'd make it clean and simple , possibly even sombre , so they did n’t think , ‘ you prick ’ .

David ThorneMonday 8 Dec 2008 11.04amMatthew SmytheR.S.V.P.Dear
Matthew , Thank you for the party invite .
At first glance I thought it was for a children 's party , what with the balloons , but I realise you probably did your best with what little tools were available .
I would n’t miss it for the world .
What time would you like me there ?
Regards , DavidMatthew SmytheMonday 8 Dec 2008 3.48 pmDavid ThorneRe : R.S.V.P.
Hi DavidSorry the house warming is just for friends and family .
Cheers MatthewDavid ThorneMonday 8 Dec 2008 5.41 pmMatthew SmytheRe : Re : R.S.V.P. Thanks
Matthew , Including me in your list of friends and family means a lot .
I told my friend Ross that you 're having a party and he's as excited as I am .
Do you want us to bring anything or will everything be provided ?
Regards , DavidMatthew SmytheTuesday 9 Dec 2008 10.01 amDavid ThorneRe : Re : Re : R.S.V.P. Hi DavidAs
I said my housewarming is just for friends and family .
Theres not a lot of room so cant have to many people come .
Sorry about that mate .
Cheers MatthewDavid ThorneTuesday 9 Dec 2008 2.36 pmMatthew SmytheRe : Re : Re : Re : R.S.V.P. Dear Matthew , I appreciate that , our apartments are n't very large are they ?
If you 'd like to store some of your cane furniture at my place during the party to make more room , you are welcome to .
I told Ross not to invite anyone else due to the space constraints , so it will just be the two of us and my other friend Simon .
When I told Simon that Ross and I were going to a party , he became quite angry that I had not invited him as well so I did n’t have a choice as he can become quite violent .
Sometimes I 'm afraid to even be in the same room as him .
So , just myself , Ross and Simon .
Simon ’s girlfriend has a work function on that night but might come later if she can get a lift with friends .
Regards , DavidMatthew SmytheTuesday 9 Dec 2008 4.19 pmDavid ThorneRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : R.S.V.P. Wtf ?
Nobody can come to the houswarming party its just for friends and family .
I dont even know these people .
How do you know I have cane furniture ?
Are you the guy in apartment 1 ? David ThorneTuesday 9 Dec 2008 6.12 pmMatthew SmytheRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : R.S.V.P.
Hi Matthew , I understand it's an exclusive party and I appreciate you trusting my judgement on who to bring .
I just assumed you have cane furniture , does n’t everybody ?
Cane is one of the most renewable natural resources we have after plastic .
Every item in my apartment is made of cane , including my television .
It looks like the one from Gilligan ’s Island but in colour .
Do you remember that episode where a robot came to the island ?
That was the best one in my opinion .
Ross rang me excited about the party and asked me what the theme is , I told him I do n’t think there is a theme and we discussed it and feel that it should be an eighties themed party .
I have a white suit and a projector and am coming as Nik Kershaw .
I'm in the process of redesigning your invites for you and will get a few hundred printed off later today .
I 'll have to ask you for the money for this as print cartridges for my Epson are pretty expensive .
They stopped making this model a month after I bought it and I have to get the cartridges sent from China .
Around $ 120 should cover it .
You can just pop the money in my letter box .
Regards , DavidMatthew SmytheWednesday 10 Dec 2008 11.06 pmDavid ThorneRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : R.S.V.P. There is no theme for the party its just a few friends and family .
noone else can come IT IS ONLY FOR MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY do you understand ?
Dont print anything because
Im not paying for something I dont need and didnt ask you to do !
look
Im sorry but i am heaps busy and that night is not convenient .
Are you in Apatrment1 ?
David ThorneThursday 11 Dec 2008 9.15 amMatthew SmytheRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : R.S.V.P. Hello Matthew , No , I 'm in apartment 3B .
We share a bedroom wall so when we 're sleeping , our heads are only a few feet apart .
We should learn morse code and tap to eachother .
I agree that it 's not convenient having a party on a Sunday , but who am I to judge ?
I also agree hat having a particular theme for your party may not be the best choice , it makes more sense to leave it open as a generic fancy dress party ; that way everyone can come dressed as they like .
I 'm going to be a ninja .
If you dressed as a ninja as well , we could perform a martial arts display for the other guests .
I have real swords and will bring them .
If you need help with your costume let me know , I made mine by wrapping a black t- shirt around my face and cutting finger holes in black socks for the gloves .
I do n't own black pants so will spray paint my legs on the night .
Actually , I just had a thought , how awesome would it be if I arrived through the window like a real ninja .
We should definitely do that .
I just measured the distance between our balconies and I should be able to jump it .
I once leaped across a creek that was over five metres wide and almost made it .
Regards , DavidMatthew SmytheThursday 11 Dec 2008 3.02 pmDavid ThorneRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : R.S.V.P. There is no 3B .
I reckon your that guy from Apartment 1 .
Your not coming to my house warming and your not bringing any of your friends .
What is wrong with you ???
The only people invited are friends and family I told you that .
Its just drinks theres no fucking fancy dress and only people i know are coming !
I dont want to be rude but jesus fucking christ man .
David ThorneSunday 14 Dec 2008 9.04 amMatthew SmythePartyHello
Matthew , I 've been away for a few days and have n't been able to check my email .
Flying back later today in time for the party and just wanted to say that we 're all really looking forward to it .
We will probably get there around eleven or twelve , just when it starts to liven up .
Simon ’s girlfriend Cathy ’s work function was cancelled so she can make it after all .
She will probably have a few friends with her so they will take the minivan .
Also , I 've arranged a Piñata .
Regards , David
WE TAKE THE MAGICAL GIFT of consciousness for granted .
From the time I awaken until I fall into a deep , dreamless sleep , I am flooded with conscious sensations .
And contrary to assertions made by philosophers , novelists and other literati , by and large this stream of consciousness does not relate to quiet self - reflection and introspective thoughts .
No , most of it is filled with raw sensations .
Two weeks ago a friend and I climbed a sea cliff above the Pacific surf at Malibu , Calif .
When I am on the sharp end of the rope , my inner critic — that voice in my head reminding me of deadlines , worries and my inadequacies — is gone , is silent .
My mind is all out there — conscious of the exact orientation , shape and texture of the rock , looking for tiny indentations where I can get purchase for my fingers and toes , always aware of how high I am above the last bolt .
One moment I am exquisitely aware of my feet on all too smooth rock , reaching upward with my left hand for a handhold .
The next I am airborne , my right hand bloody , my right rib cage aching .
After catching my breath and shouting to my anxious belayer that I ’m okay , I am filled with adrenaline for having survived yet another fall , ca n’t contain my enthusiasm , and scream .
Today only the bruised rib remains as a testament to how much of the stream of consciousness is pure sensation .
Whether you are weaving on a motorbike through flowing traffic , running in the mountains , dancing to fast rock and roll , reading an engaging book , making love or debating with your friend , your eyes , ears , skin and body sensors paint an engrossing picture of the outside , including your own body , onto your mind ’s canvas .
Animal Consciousness ?
I suspect this feeling is not that dissimilar to the way animals consciously experience their world .
Except perhaps for the great apes and a few other privileged big - brained animals , most species do not posses the highly developed sense of self , the ability to reflect on oneself , that people have .
Most biologists and pet owners are willing to grant consciousness to cats , dogs and other mammals .
Yet our intuitions fail us completely when we consider fish and birds , let alone invertebrates such as squid , flies or worms .
Do they experience the sights and sounds , the pains and pleasures , of life ?
Surely they ca n’t be conscious — they look too different from us , too alien .
Insects , in particular , were long thought to be simple , reflexive creatures with hardwired instinctual behaviors .
No more .
Consider the amazing capabilities of the honeybee , Apis mellifera .
Martin Giurfa of the University of Toulouse in France and Mandyam Srinivasan and Shaowu Zhang , both at the Australian National University in Canberra , trained free - flying bees , using sugar water as a reward , in a variety of complex learning tasks .
The neuroethologists taught the bees to fly in and out of tall cylinders with one entryway and two exit holes .
Each bee had to choose one of two exits to leave the cylinder and to continue her flight .
( In bee colonies , males are a small minority and do only one thing — and that only during the virginal flight of the colony ’s queen . )
These cylinders were staggered into mazes with multiple levels of “ Y ” branch points that the bees encountered before reaching the desired feeder station .
In one set of experiments , the scientists trained bees to track a trail of colored marks , as in a scavenger hunt .
The bees could then follow — more or less — the same strategy in a completely unfamiliar maze .
Amazingly enough , bees can use color in an abstract manner , turning right , for instance , when the branch point is colored blue and left when it is colored green .
Individual animals developed quite sophisticated strategies , such as the right - turn rule , that always led to the goal , though not necessarily by the shortest route .
In humans , the short - term storage of symbolic information — as when you enter an acquaintance ’s phone number into your iPhone ’s memory — is associated with conscious processing .
Can bees remember task - relevant information ?
The gold standard for evaluating working memory is the delayed matching - to - sample ( DMTS ) paradigm .
The subject looks at a picture for a few seconds .
The test image then disappears for five or 10 seconds .
Subsequently , two pictures are shown next to each other , and the animal has to choose , by pushing a lever or moving its eyes , which of the two images was the test picture .
This test can be carried out correctly only if the animal remembers the image .
A more complex version , the delayed nonmatching - to - sample ( DNMTS ) task , requires one additional processing step : choosing the opposite image from the one previously shown .
Although bees ca n’t be expected to push levers , they can be trained to take either the left or the right exit inside a cylinder modified for the DMTS test .
A color disk serves as a cue at the entrance of the maze , so that the bee sees it before entering .
Once within the maze , the bee has to choose the arm displaying the color that matches ( DMTS ) or differs from ( DNMTS ) the color at the entrance .
Bees perform both tasks well .
They even generalize to a situation they have never previously encountered .
That is , once they ’ve been trained with colors , they “ get it ” and can now follow a trail of vertical stripes if a disk with vertical gratings is left at the entrance of the maze .
These experiments tell us that bees have learned an abstract relation ( sameness in DMTS , difference in DNMTS ) irrespective of the physical nature of the stimuli .
The generalization to novel stimuli can even occur from odors to colors .
Insect Intelligence
Although these experiments do not tell us that bees are conscious , they caution us that we have no principled reason at this point to reject this assertion .
Bees are highly adaptive and sophisticated creatures with a bit fewer than one million neurons , which are interconnected in ways that are beyond our current understanding , jammed into less than one cubic millimeter of brain tissue .
The neural density in the bee ’s brain is about 10 times higher than that in a mammalian cerebral cortex , which most of us take to be the pinnacle of evolution on this planet .
In humans , widespread loss of cerebral cortex , as in the vegetative patient Terri Schiavo , leads to an irreversible loss of consciousness .
That is not to say that a cerebral cortex is necessary for consciousness in creatures with a different evolutionary heritage .
Bees live in highly stratified yet flexible social organizations with group decision - making skills that rival academic , corporate or government committees in efficiency .
In spring , when bees swarm , they choose a new hive that needs to satisfy many demands within a couple of days ( consider that the next time you go house hunting ) .
They communicate information about the location and quality of food sources using the waggle dance .
Bees can fly several kilometers and return to their hive , a remarkable navigational performance .
Their brains seem to have incorporated a map of their environment .
And a scent blown into the hive can trigger a return to the site where the bee previously encountered this odor .
This type of associative memory was famously described by French novelist Marcel Proust in la Recherche du Temps Perdu .
Given all of this ability , why does almost everybody instinctively reject the idea that bees or other insects might be conscious ?
The trouble is that bees are so different from us and our ilk that our insights fail us .
But just because they are small and live in colonies does not mean that they can’t have subjective states , that they ca n’t smell the fragrance of the golden nectar or experience the warm rays of the sun or maybe even have a primitive sense of self .
I am not a mystic .
I am not arguing for pan-psychism , for the notion that anything is conscious .
Nor am I assuming that bees can reason or can reflect on their fate as animated cartoon bees .
What this dilemma highlights is that there is no accepted theory of consciousness , no principled theory that would tell us which systems , organic or artificial , are conscious and why .
In the absence of such a theory , we must at the very least remain agnostic about consciousness in these creatures .
So the next time a bee hovers above your breakfast toast , attracted by the sweet jam , gently shoo her away .
For she might be a fellow sentient being , experiencing her brief interlude in the light , shoehorned between this moment and eternity .

CHICAGO – Almost one in five young American adults has a personality disorder that interferes with everyday life , and even more abuse alcohol or drugs , researchers reported Monday in the most extensive study of its kind .
The disorders include problems such as obsessive or compulsive tendencies and anti-social behaviour that can sometimes lead to violence .
The study also found that fewer than 25 per cent of college - aged Americans with mental problems get treatment .
One expert said personality disorders may be overdiagnosed .
But others said the results were not surprising since previous , less rigorous evidence has suggested mental problems are common on college campuses and elsewhere .
Experts praised the study 's scope – face - to - face interviews about numerous disorders with more than 5,000 young people ages 19 to 25 – and said it spotlights a problem college administrators need to address .
Study co-author Dr. Mark Olfson of Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute called the widespread lack of treatment particularly worrisome .
He said it should alert not only " students and parents , but also deans and people who run college mental health services about the need to extend access to treatment . "
Counting substance abuse , the study found that nearly half of young people surveyed have some sort of psychiatric condition , including students and non-students .
Personality disorders were the second most common problem behind drug or alcohol abuse as a single category .
The disorders include obsessive , anti-social and paranoid behaviours that are not mere quirks but actually interfere with ordinary functioning .
The study authors noted that recent tragedies such as fatal shootings at Northern Illinois University and Virginia Tech have raised awareness about the prevalence of mental illness on college campuses .
They also suggest that this age group might be particularly vulnerable .
" For many , young adulthood is characterized by the pursuit of greater educational opportunities and employment prospects , development of personal relationships , and for some , parenthood , " the authors said .
These circumstances , they said , can result in stress that triggers the start or recurrence of psychiatric problems .
The study was released Monday in Archives of General Psychiatry .
It was based on interviews with 5,092 young adults in 2001 and 2002 , but the authors said the results probably hold true today .
The study was funded with grants from the National Institutes of Health , the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the New York Psychiatric Institute .
Dr. Sharon Hirsch , a University of Chicago psychiatrist not involved in the study , praised it for raising awareness about the problem and the high numbers of affected people who do n't get help .
Imagine if more than 75 per cent of diabetic college students did n't get treatment , Hirsch said .
" Just think about what would be happening on our college campuses . "
The results highlight the need for mental health services to be housed with other medical services on college campuses , to erase the stigma and make it more likely that people will seek help , she said .
In the study , trained interviewers , but not psychiatrists , questioned participants about symptoms .
They used an assessment tool similar to criteria doctors use to diagnose mental illness .
Dr. Jerald Kay , a psychiatry professor at Wright State University and chairman of the American Psychiatric Association 's college mental health committee , said the assessment tool is considered valid and more rigorous than self - reports of mental illness .
He was not involved in the study .

Personality disorders showed up in similar numbers among both students and non-students , including the most common one , obsessive compulsive personality disorder .
About eight per cent of young adults in both groups had this illness , which can include an extreme preoccupation with details , rules , orderliness and perfectionism .
Kay said the prevalence of personality disorders was higher than he would expect and questioned whether the condition might be overdiagnosed .
All good students have a touch of " obsessional " personality that helps them work hard to achieve .
But that 's different from an obsessional disorder that makes people inflexible and controlling and interferes with their lives , he explained .
Obsessive compulsive personality disorder differs from the better known OCD , or obsessive - compulsive disorder , which features repetitive actions such as handwashing to avoid germs .
OCD is thought to affect about two per cent of the general population .
The study did n't examine OCD separately but grouped it with all anxiety disorders , seen in about 12 per cent of college - aged people in the survey .
The overall rate of other disorders was also pretty similar among college students and non-students .
Substance abuse , including drug addiction , alcoholism and other drinking that interferes with school or work , affected nearly one - third of those in both groups .
Slightly more college students than non-students were problem drinkers – 20 per cent versus 17 per cent .
And slightly more non-students had drug problems – nearly seven per cent versus five per cent .
In both groups , about eight per cent had phobias and seven per cent had depression .
Bipolar disorder was slightly more common in non-students , affecting almost five per cent versus about three per cent of students .
The US's National Transportation Safety Board is probing an " uncommanded rollback " on a Rolls - Royce Trent 895 engine which affected a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777-200 ER on 26 November , Flight International reports .
NTSB explains that Delta Flight 18 , from Shanghai to Atlanta , experienced loss of thrust on the right - hand engine at 39,000 ft .
Its initial report elaborates : " Initial data indicates that following the rollback , the crew descended to FL310 ( approximately 31,000 ft ) and executed applicable flight manual procedures .
The engine recovered and responded normally thereafter .
The flight continued to Atlanta where it landed without further incident . "
Senior investigator Bill English - due to meet Boeing regarding the incident - is apparently " looking into " the possibility there might be similarities to the Heathrow 777 incident which saw BA038 ( G - YMMM ) suffer reduced thrust in both Rolls - Royce RB211 Trent 895 - 17 engines while coming into land and fall short of the runway .
An Air Accidents Investigation Branch ( AAIB ) report into BA038 concluded " that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted ; most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system " .
It added : " The ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel whilst the aircraft operated for a long period , with low fuel flows , in an unusually cold environment . "
Flight International notes that in light of the AAIB findings , the Federal Aviation Administration back in September " issued an airworthiness directive calling on operators of 777-200 and - 300 aircraft equipped with Trent engines to revise flight manuals to include in - flight procedures for pilots to follow during certain cold - weather conditions and for operations on the ground " .
English and fellow investigators are now examining the Delta aircraft 's flight data recorder " and other applicable data and components " . ®
We ’ve covered Sea Shepherd and their new television show “ Whale Wars ” quite a bit the past couple months , and while we love the organization and the show , we must admit that we cringe every time they make a disastrous mistake on the TV show .
But things are looking brighter for the next season , being filmed currently : Sea Shepherd has brought along a former US Navy Lieutenant , Jane Taylor .
Taylor was also recently honored by PETA for being the sexiest vegetarian in the US Navy along with other sexy vegetarians in other branches of the military .
While Sea Shepherd seems to try to keep an organized ship , I bet it ’ll seem like more of a cruise ship compared to her former adventures at sea .
To all those who comment on this blog and others asserting that Sea Shepherd is a terrorist group , do you now think that this decorated Naval officer is a terrorist ?

Cygnus Systems , Inc. , a company based in Arizona , got into the holiday spirit by suing Microsoft , Apple , and Google for violating a patent it was recently awarded , which covers the navigation and access of files based on representational thumbnails .
Products like Microsoft's Vista , Apple 's Cover Flow feature , and Google 's Chrome browser are cited for infringement .
Cygnus is seeking the typical damages and permanent injunction that prevents further infringement , but is also stating that these big three may not be the only companies it goes after .
The patent in question is US 7,346,850 , called " System and method for iconic software environment management . "
Its abstract describes " a method and system for storing , navigating , and accessing files within an operating system through the use of a graphical thumbnail representing the video display of the active document within the active application . "
In other words , Cygnus ' patent describes features similar to those of Windows Explorer and Apple 's Finder — these applications use scaled - down previews to represent the actual documents being browsed by users .
The patent could also include things like file icons that dynamically update to reflect changes to the contents of their respective documents , as well as Opera 's " Speed Dial " feature , which offers a visual dashboard of easy - access websites .
Cygnus ' complaint even cites the iPhone 's " accompanying iconic file preview and access functionality " and the Safari browser 's tab thumbnails .
A figure from Cygnus ' patent , which describes documents that are opened in applications , but also represented by icons in a browser .
The complaint contains a few discrepancies , however , such as its targeting of Google , which is n't actually making software " within an operating system . "
Also odd is its claim that Google infringed its patent " by making , using , selling , and offering for sale Google ’s Chrome web browser . "
Currently , Google Chrome is offered as a free download for Windows XP SP2 and Vista .
Cygnus Systems , Inc. ( not to be confused with Cygnus Solutions , which gave us open source tools like gcc and Cygwin ) filed its patent on June 8 , 2001 as a continuation of an application originally filed on June 12 , 1998 .
The patent was granted on March 18 , 2008 , and it does n't appear to have taken Cygnus long to begin devising a lawsuit strategy to recover " an award of damages adequate to compensate plaintiff for the infringement that has occurred . "
Notably , Cygnus is also seeking retroactive damages from the date the infringement began .
Microsoft , Apple , and Google are not likely to be Cygnus ' only targets if its lawsuit gets anywhere .
Plenty of other companies and products , such as Adobe , Opera , iPhoto , Windows Mobile , and possibly even web services like Flickr , may all infringe upon some of the broad terms in Cygnus ' patent .
This suit may not get very far , however , considering the caliber of companies ( and their defensive teams ) that Cygnus has chosen to pursue , and the probability that some aspects of the patent were granted despite prior art .
The strange length of time between filing and grant dates of the patent , as well as its broad terms , may also not do Cygnus any favors in these proceedings .
Update
This piece has been edited to reflect the fact that Cygnus Systems , Inc. — the small networking company that filed this suit — has nothing to do with Cygnus Solutions , which produced open source tools like gcc and Cygwin before merging into Red Hat in 1999 .

The following is the most recent official list of the top five most memorable inaugural speeches in the United States history .
Bill Clinton is the only living former president to be featured on this list , and his inaugural speech made in 1993 is now the fifth most memorable .
If Barack Obama , who ’s already proven to be a very good writer even before running for president , is able to make his inaugural speech one of the most memorable , then Clinton ’s memorable speech will go into the toilet before he can carry this honor till the day he dies .
Of course , Bill is still relatively young , and there are going to be more future presidents ahead before he needs to worry about death , but a president as literate as Obama does n’t come quite often .
The public expects Obama to give an excellent speech tomorrow , but is it going to be enough to knock Clinton off the list ?
We ’ll find out in roughly 12 hours .
5 . “ Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal .
There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America . ” — Bill Clinton ’s inaugural address on Jan. 20 , 1993 .
4 . “ With malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation ’s wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations . ”
Abraham Lincoln ’s second inaugural address on March 4 , 1865 .
3 . “ In the long history of the world , only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger .
I do not shrink from this responsibility — I welcome it .
I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation .
The energy , the faith , the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it — and the glow from that fire can truly light the world . ” — John Kennedy ’s inaugural address on Jan. 20 , 1961 .
2 . “ It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government .
It is time for us to realize that we ’re too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams .
We ’re not , as some would have us believe , doomed to an inevitable decline .
I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do .
I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing .
So , with all the creative energy at our command , let us begin an era of national renewal .
Let us renew our determination , our courage , and our strength .
And let us renew our faith and our hope . ” — Ronald Reagan ’s first inaugural address on Jan. 20 , 1981 .
1 . “ Democracy is not dying .
We know it because we have seen it revive — and grow .
We know it cannot die — because it is built on the unhampered initiative of individual men and women joined together in a common enterprise — an enterprise undertaken and carried through by the free expression of a free majority .
We know it because democracy alone , of all forms of government , enlists the full force of men ’s enlightened will .
We know it because democracy alone has constructed an unlimited civilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human life .
We know it because , if we look below the surface , we sense it still spreading on every continent — for it is the most humane , the most advanced , and in the end the most unconquerable of all forms of human society . ” — Franklin Roosevelt ’s third inaugural address on Jan. 20 , 1941 .

The Greens announced their opposition to filtering ( or close to it ) this morning and now the Liberals Shadow Comms Minister Nick Minchin has issued a press release labeling the Government ’s plan as misguided and deeply unpopular .
It reads :
Senator Minchin said nobody of decency disagreed about the importance of working to ensure the online world is safe .
“ The Opposition firmly believes that adult supervision , supported by optional user - end filters , effective law enforcement and education should be front and centre of any efforts to keep children safe online , ” he said .
“ In relation to criminal conduct online , our nation ’s law enforcement bodies must be adequately resourced to monitor and investigate unlawful activity .
“ There is no technical substitute for appropriate adult supervision when it comes to keeping our children safe online and most parents and teachers take that responsibility very seriously and any suggestions to the contrary are patronising and offensive , ” Senator Minchin said .
Minchin also asks what will happen if adequate numbers of Internet users cannot be roped into the live pilot on a voluntary basis .
Will the trial become mandatory or will it be implemented without proper testing ?
He calls on the Gov to re-think its plan to stop providing Australians with free pc- based filters at the end of 2008 .
It ’s good news , but do n’t get excited just yet .
No party position is set in stone and Labor continues to push the plan hard .
The result could still swing either way and if the IIA were to cooperate with the Government , filtering may be introduced without legislative changes according to former EFA Chair Dale Clapperton .
We ’ve got a hell of a lot of work left to do in order to stop net censorship being forced upon Australians and our opposition must only get stronger .
Explain the plan to friends who do n’t know , write your MP , outline your concerns , and show your support if they are from the Greens or Liberal party .
Keep up the hard work —
It ’s paying off .
Last week in Mumbai we witnessed as clear a case of carefully planned mass terrorism as we are ever likely to see .
The seven -venue atrocity was coordinated in a highly sophisticated way .
The terrorists used BlackBerrys to stay in touch with each other during their three - and - half - day rampage , outwitting the authorities by monitoring international reaction to the attacks on British , Urdu and Arabic Web sites .
It was a meticulously organized operation aimed exclusively at civilian targets : two hospitals , a train station , two hotels , a leading tourist restaurant and a Jewish center .
There was nothing remotely random about it .
This was no hostage standoff .
The terrorists did n't want to negotiate .
They wanted to murder as many Hindus , Christians , Jews , atheists and other " infidels " as they could , and in as spectacular a manner as possible .
In the Jewish center , some of the female victims even appear to have been tortured before being killed .
So why are so many prominent Western media reluctant to call the perpetrators terrorists ?
Why did Jon Snow , one of Britain 's most respected TV journalists , use the word " practitioners " when referring to the Mumbai terrorists ?
Was he perhaps confusing them with doctors ?
Why did Britain 's highly regarded Channel 4 News state that the " militants " showed a " wanton disregard for race or creed " when exactly the opposite was true : Targets and victims were very carefully selected .
Why did the " experts " invited to discuss the Mumbai attacks in one show on the state - funded Radio France Internationale , the voice of France around the world , harp on about Baruch Goldstein ( who carried out the Hebron shootings in 1994 ) , virtually the sole case of a Jewish terrorist in living memory ?

PART I : DELUSIONAL DENIAL
KARL :
In hindsight , do you think any of those tactics that were used against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others went too far ?
CHENEY : I do n't ..... On the question of so - called torture , we do n't do torture .
We never have .
It 's not something that this administration subscribes to .
Again , we proceeded very cautiously .
We checked .
We had the Justice Department issue the requisite opinions in order to know where the bright lines were that you could not cross .
... The professionals involved in that program were very , very cautious , very careful -- would n't do anything without making certain it was authorized and that it was legal .
And any suggestion to the contrary is just wrong .
Did it produce the desired results ?
I think it did .
And I think those who allege that we 've been involved in torture , or that somehow we violated the Constitution or laws with the terrorist surveillance program , simply do n't know what they 're talking about .
KARL : Did you authorize the tactics ( dogs , stress positions , sleep deprivation , humiliation ) that were used against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ?...
And on KSM , one of those tactics , of course , widely reported was waterboarding .
And that seems to be a tactic we no longer use .
Even that you think was appropriate ?
CHENEY : I do ...
... I was aware of the program , certainly , and involved in helping get the process cleared , as the agency in effect came in and wanted to know what they could and could n't do .
And they talked to me , as well as others , to explain what they wanted to do .
And I supported it .
KARL : You probably saw Karl Rove last week said that if the intelligence had been correct we probably would not have gone to war .
CHENEY : I disagree with that .
I think – as I look at the intelligence with respect to Iraq , what they got wrong was that there were n't any stockpiles .
What we found in the after action reports , after the intelligence report was done and then various special groups went and looked at the intelligence and what its validity was .
What they found was that Saddam Hussein still had the capability to produce weapons of mass destruction .
He had the technology , he had the people , he had the basic feed stocks .
- Jonathan Karl ( Excerpt : Transcript : " Cheney Defends Hard Line Tactics In Exclusive Interview With ABC News , Vice President Dick Cheney Opens Up About His Hard Line Tactics , " 12.16.2008 ) .
PART II : THE TRUTH
" The U.S. should assert its military dominance over the world to shape “ the international security order in line with American principles and interests , ” push for “ regime change ” in Iraq and China , among other countries , and “ fight and decisively win multiple , simultaneous major theater wars … .
While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification , the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein . ” - ( “ Rebuilding America ’s Defenses : Strategy , Forces and Resources for a New Century , ” The Project for the New American Century [ members include Cheney and Rumsfeld ] , 9.2000 ) .
" Simply stated , there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction . "
- Vice President Dick Cheney , ( Selling The Iraq Invasion , Speech to VFW National Convention , 8.26.2002 ) .
RUSSERT : What do you think is the most important rationale for going to war with Iraq ?
CHENEY : Well , I think I ’ve just given it , Tim , in terms of the combination of his development and use of chemical weapons , his development of biological weapons , his pursuit of nuclear weapons .
RUSSERT : And even though the International Atomic Energy Agency said he does not have a nuclear program , we disagree ?
CHENEY : I disagree , yes ...
We believe [ Hussein ] has , in fact , reconstituted nuclear weapons .
- Vice President Dick Cheney ( Excerpts : Selling The Invasion on " NBC's Meet the Press , " 3.16.2003 )
PART III : YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL A MAN BY HIS SHOES :
" Muntader al - Zaidi who remained in custody Monday , provided a rare moment of unity in a region often at odds with itself .
Glee , even if thinly veiled , could be discerned in much of the reporting , especially in places where anti-American sentiment runs deepest .

November 11 , 2008  --
On a day when Americans honor those who have served their country in the military , many of whom have been wounded , physically and emotionally by war , the FBI told ABC News that it is investigating hundreds of reports of phony heroes who have lied about their military experience or the awards and medals they claim they received for their valor in combat .
" I think it is disgusting , " said Mike Sanborn , a former Marine and the FBI agent currently in charge of tracking down phony war heroes .
Sanborn said he has been alerted to more than 200 cases of phony heroes in the last year and he says the problem is growing because of the two - front war — in Iraq and Afghanistan — that Americans are fighting .
ABC News reported in March that a North Carolina man , who claimed he had served as an Army Ranger on tours in Iraq , Afghanistan , Bosnia , Panama and Grenada and had earned medals , including the Purple Heart , was found guilty of peddling a false military record in order to collect thousands of dollars in soldier disability payments .
Randall Moneymaker 's claims to collect more than $ 18,000 in disability payments were numerous .
In a Veterans Affairs compensation and pension medical exam , he claimed he " had been involved in numerous combat situations , including RPG attacks and firefights , " according to the federal indictment against him .
Topping his claims , Moneymaker said he had the scars from combat service , but federal authorities said the scars match a liposuction procedure he had done .
Moneymaker has been sentenced to three years in jail , according to the Army Times .
" It is despicable for anyone to say they were in the military when they were not and even more despicable to lie about receiving a medal for valor in combat , " said Special Agent Thomas Cottone , Jr , formerly a lead investigator into the illegal use and wearing of military awards and decorations .
Cottone said the Stolen Valor Act , signed into law in December of 2006 , made it easier to prosecute imposters posing as war heroes who lied about their medals .
The law also increased the penalty , and those convicted could face prison time and a fine of up to $ 100,000 , according to Cottone .
Stolen Valor
Just why would anyone fake a medal of honor ?
" It 's self esteem , " said Sanborn .
" If they want to be somebody they 're not , its instant gratification . "
Stolen valor watchdogs say the federal government should have a complete database of veterans and their military histories including the medals they were awarded in order to deter imposters and help federal authorities find and prosecute them .
Doug Sterner , a decorated Army sergeant who served in Vietnam and who maintains the most comprehensive database of military medals in the country , has been advocating for a federally run database for years .
He authored much of the language in a bill pending in Congress that would mandate the Defense Department to maintain such a database .
Sterner says he gets four to six reports per week of phony war heroes who claim medals of valor .
" There are so many that the FBI just can't handle them all , " he said .
Sanborn said that there is limited manpower to address the issue , but nonetheless , " the word is spreading and it 's getting out there that the people that are doing this will be prosecuted aggressively . "

In chapter 9 of my book , Money , Bank Credit , and Economic Cycles ( pp . 789–803 ) , I design a process of transition toward the only world financial order that , being fully compatible with the free - enterprise system , can eliminate the financial crises and economic recessions that cyclically affect the world 's economies .
Such a proposal for international financial reform is , of course , extremely relevant at this time , since the disconcerted governments of Europe and America are planning a world conference to reform the international monetary system in order to avoid future financial and banking crises such as the one that currently grips the entire Western world .
As I explain in detail over the nine chapters of my book , any future reform will fail as miserably as past reforms unless it strikes at the very root of the present problems and rests on the following principles : pp
the reestablishment of a 100 % reserve requirement on all bank demand deposits and equivalents ; the elimination of central banks as lenders of last resort ( which will be unnecessary if the first principle is applied , and harmful if they continue to act as financial central - planning agencies ) ; and the privatization of the current , monopolistic , and fiduciary state - issued money and its replacement with a classic gold standard .
This radical , definitive reform would essentially mark the culmination of the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and real socialism , since it would mean the application of the same principles of liberalization and private property to the only sphere — finance and banking — that has until now remained mired in central planning ( by " central " banks ) , extreme interventionism ( the fixing of interest rates , the tangled web of government regulations ) , and state monopoly ( legal - tender laws , which require the acceptance of the current , state - issued fiduciary money ) — circumstances with disastrous consequences , as we have seen .
I should point out that the transition process designed in the above - mentioned chapter of my book could also permit , from the outset , the bailing out of the current banking system , thus preventing its rapid collapse , and with it the sudden monetary squeeze that would be inevitable if , in an environment of widespread broken trust among depositors , a significant volume of bank deposits were to disappear .
This short - term goal , which , at present , western governments are desperately striving for with the most varied plans ( the massive purchases of " toxic " bank assets , the ad hominem guarantee of all deposits , or simply the partial or total nationalization of the private banking system ) , could be reached much faster and more effectively , and in a manner much less harmful to the market economy , if the first step in my proposal for reform ( page 792 in my book ) were immediately taken : to back the total amount of current bank deposits ( demand deposits and equivalents ) with cash , bills to be turned over to banks , which from then on would maintain a 100 % reserve with respect to deposits .
As I explain in chapter 9 , chart IX - 2 , which shows the consolidated balance sheet for the banking system following this step , the issuance of these bills would in no way be inflationary ( since the new money would be " sterilized , " so to speak , by its purpose as backing to satisfy any deposit withdrawals ) .
Furthermore , this step would free up all banking assets ( toxic or not ) that currently appear as backing for demand deposits ( and equivalents ) on the balance sheets of private banks .
On the assumption that the transition to the new financial system would take place under " normal " circumstances , and not in the midst of a financial crisis as acute as the current one , I proposed in my book that the freed assets be transferred to a set of mutual funds created ad hoc and managed by the banking system , and that the shares in these funds be exchanged for outstanding treasury bonds and for the implicit liabilities connected with the public social - security system ( pp. 796–797 ) .
Nevertheless , in the current climate of severe financial and economic crisis , we have another alternative : apart from canceling " toxic " assets with these funds , we could devote a portion of the rest , if desired , to enabling savers ( not depositors whose deposits would already be backed 100 percent ) to recover a large part of the value lost in their investments ( particularly in loans to commercial banks , investment banks , and holding companies ) .
These measures would immediately restore confidence and would leave a significant remainder to be exchanged — once and for all and at no cost — for a sizeable portion of the national debt , our initial aim .
Dr Rex Moulton - Barrett recently revised my breast augmentation .
I knew I was not happy with the original surgery I had by another surgeon , but I did not know why .
As it turned out , one implant was lower and one pocket was bigger .
The result was the nipples were offset and not at the same height .
Dr Moulton - Barrett fixed the wrong pocket , narrowing it and lifting it .
He pulled the nipples away from the sides so that after the surgery I had a small scar at the edge of the areola and I had matching breasts .
Dr Rex was caring , supportive and answered all my questions .
He helped me feel at ease of any anxiety I felt .
I recovered fast and comfortably . ”

Montel Williams speaks out on medical marijuana
Talk show host Montel Williams has come out and admitted that he uses marijuana as a treatment for his Multiple Sclerosis .
Williams who went public with his MS diagnosis in 1999 , has also founded the Montel Williams MS Foundationto further the scientific study of MS in hope of one day finding a cure .
Williams has stated that he , just as many other MS sufferers have been prescribed pain medications such as Oxycontin , Percocet and others , and he knows from a personal standpoint how addictive they can be .
He says that after a friend told him that medical marijuana could possibly be a successful treatment for the symptoms of his MS , he decided to talk to his doctor about it and now uses the marijuana as prescribed by his doctor .
To read more about Montel ’s struggle with Multiple Sclerosis and his use of medical marijuana check out his new book Living Well Emotionally : Break Through to a Life of Happiness .
Williams along with others are stepping up to try and reform the U.S. marijuana laws to allow seriously ill patients to use medical marijuana when recommended by their doctor .
The Marijuana Policy Project is one of the major organizations rallying against marijuana laws in the U.S.
It was quite interesting to view the laws regarding medical marijuana on the MPP site .
For the most part , bills have been introduced to the legislator but have not been passed .
Another site with great info concerning medical marijuana is Medical Marijuana ProCon which gives the pros and the cons of medical marijuana .
The site is not government affiliated and serves for educational purposes only .
The site also gives educational information regarding medical information including deaths from medical marijuana versus 17 FDA approved drugs and also has information studying pharmaceutical drugs that are based on cannabis .
Did you know that studies have shown that medical marijuana has been proven to help patients with the following illnesses ?
AIDS & HIV , Multiple Sclerosis , Arthritis , Alzheimer ’s and others
This makes it even sadder that the federal government can prosecute medical marijuana patients .
Many health organizations and voters are in support of medical marijuana and are striving to pass laws that will protect patients who use the drug under the recommendation of their doctors to treat their illnesses .
Those opposed to changing the marijuana laws have stated reasons such as addiction and criminal activity , but studies show that In the U.S. , there are more arrests for marijuana possession each year than for all violent crimes combined so even in its illegal state marijuana is still being grown , sold , purchased and used .
Why not reform the laws so that people who need the drug medically can use it legally ?
Money quote from an aide to McCain on McCain surrogate 's bringing up past drug use :
" We did n’t ask him to do it .
He did n’t clear it with us , but obviously he ’s read Senator Obama ’s books . ”
This election really is a classic battle between fear and hope .
All Palin and McCain are offering right now is more fear : fear of a black man , fear of terrorism , fear of the other , fear of Iran , fear of the future , fear of Islam , fear of the truth .
And above all : fear of defeat .
On that last one , they 're rational .
Which side are you on ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
It was just a chance to get his feet wet , but Olympian Eric Shanteau managed to surprise himself .
Eric Shanteau swims Friday , December 5 , in the Short Course Nationals in Atlanta , Georgia .
Shanteau returned to competitive swimming over the weekend for the first time since he was treated for testicular cancer .
He kicked off the U.S. Short Course Nationals in Atlanta with the men's 200 - yard individual medley , clocking 1:42.59 -- a personal best , finishing second to Ryan Lochte , who holds the American record .
Shanteau finished the men's 100 - yard breaststroke in 53.07 , ahead of the 53.81 he clocked in last year 's Short Course Nationals .
Not bad after just a few weeks of training , little rest and no shave .
" For me to go the times I just did is pretty incredible , " Shanteau told CNN .
The 25 - year - old Georgia native drew international attention before the Beijing Games in China when he postponed treatment so he could compete in the Olympics .
There , he swam a personal best in the 200 meter breaststroke on August 13 , finding cancer to be strong motivation , but he did not qualify for the finals .
Just a week later he returned to the United States , where he had surgery August 26 in Atlanta to remove the cancer .
Tests revealed that most of the cancer was successfully removed and that he would not need chemotherapy .
He returned to the water with renewed determination three weeks later , an ambitious feat with a painful ending .
" That did n't work out so well , " Shanteau told CNN .
" I pushed off the wall the first time and I felt everything stretching in my abs , so I got right back out and my coach said to give it another week . "
Six more weeks of intense training and he showed up at the Short Course Nationals , his first competition since Beijing and surgery .
" This experience gave me a very different and new perspective on life -- it's a good one , " Shanteau said .
" As traumatic as cancer can be , there 's a lot of good that you can take out of it .
Appreciate the small things . "
He 's been compared to Lance Armstrong , the world - renowned cyclist who was diagnosed at 25 with advanced testicular cancer .
Armstrong beat the disease before going on to winning the Tour de France a record seven times .
" We talked a couple times , shared stories and got to know each other a little bit and that 's obviously very cool to me , " Shanteau said .
" I looked up to Lance way , way before I had a similar experience . "
Shanteau is involved with Armstrong 's Livestrong Foundation and credits it for much of the support he has received .
" Outside the pool , as far as cancer relates , I could n't find a better group of people to be helping me out with all this , " he said .
Testicular cancer is diagnosed in about 1 in 300 men in their lifetime .
It is the most common form of cancer for 15 - to 34 - year - olds , and one of the most curable if discovered early .
Nearly 140,000 men in the United States are testicular cancer survivors .
Shanteau said cancer often preoccupied him at the Beijing Games , but that he stayed focused once he got up on the blocks .
" It did n't affect any of my racing in Beijing , " Shanteau said .
" It was more exhausting that it was on my mind all the time . "
Is he aiming for the 2012 London Olympics ?
" It 's too far out right now , " Shanteau said , " but it 's definitely not out of the question . "
He prefers to take a day - by - day approach to the sport , with his focus centered on each event -- for now , that 's the 2009 World Swimming Championship in Rome , Italy .
" After that we 'll look to the next one and when you do that sooner or later , four years rolls around and London will be here in no time , " he said .

South Africa 's Red Cross is rushing much - needed medicine to Zimbabwe The United Nations says 978 people have now been killed by the cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe , an increase of 25 % from the last figure given three days ago .
Another 18,413 suspected cases have been reported since August , the report said ahead of the UN Security Council 's first talks on Zimbabwe since July .
The talks ended without agreement on a motion to censure Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe .
Separately , Botswana denied plotting to overthrow Zimbabwe 's president .
The UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( Ocha ) said the worst - hit area was the capital , Harare , with 208 confirmed deaths and 8,454 suspected cases .
The South African Red Cross has sent much - needed medical supplies to Zimbabwe , and has issued an appeal for funds to treat a total of 30,000 people .
The UN has warned that up to 60,000 people could become infected if the outbreak is not contained .
Economic meltdown
The Ocha 's revised death figures were released hours before the UN Security Council met for its first discussions on Zimbabwe since it failed to pass new sanctions on the country 's leaders in July .

The meeting was designed , as UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband put it , to " restart UN engagement on this issue " .
But a motion to censure Mr Mugabe was blocked by opposition from South Africa .
Speaking to reporters after the Security Council 's discussions , Mr Miliband said the council had heard a " devastating report " from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon about " the disintegration of state institutions , the collapse of the economy , the disembowelling of the economic institutions , [ and ] the collapse of health and education services " in Zimbabwe .
" And of course , the symptom of that disintegration is the shocking fact that cholera has returned to Zimbabwe " and was spilling over into neighbouring states , Mr Miliband said .
The Security Council also heard a briefing on the stalled power - sharing agreement between President Robert Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai .
The rivals agreed to form a power - sharing government in September but its implementation has been dogged by disagreements over whose supporters would get key ministries .
The political crisis has aggravated an ongoing economic meltdown that has brought Zimbabwe the world 's highest inflation rate .
In the southern town of Beitbridge , which borders South Africa , 91 people have died from cholera while several more thousand people are believed to be infected .
' Pretext to invade '
On Thursday , Mr Mugabe gave a nationally televised speech saying the outbreak had been contained .
" I am happy to say our doctors are being assisted by others , and the WHO [ World Health Organization ] have now arrested cholera . "
Now that there is no cholera , there is no cause for war

Botswana denies coup claim Reports on failing Zimbabwe
He has accused Western powers , including Zimbabwe 's former colonial ruler Britain , of using the cholera outbreak as a pretext to invade the country and overthrow him .
" Now that there is no cholera , there is no cause for war , " he said .
Other high - ranking officials have accused Britain of deliberately spreading cholera .
Zimbabwe has accused its neighbour Botswana of being involved in a plot to overthrow Mr Mugabe 's government .
Zimbabwean Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa said there was " compelling evidence " that Botswana was hosting military training camps for opposition rebels .
Botswana 's foreign ministry said the Zimbabwean claim was " nothing more than distorted or concocted evidence , none of which is supported by facts " .
Botswana 's President Ian Khama is one of the few African leaders to have publicly criticised Mr Mugabe .

State Sen. John Huppenthal R-Chandler has been charged with criminal misdemeanors for cutting down an opposition campaign sign on Election Day .
He 's accused of theft and altering or destroying a political sign .
A conviction could send him to jail for up to six months .
The nine - term state lawmaker called the charges " a continuation of the sadistic and vindictive smear campaign by the Democratic Party . . . they should drop this and paint a positive vision for the future of Arizona . "
Huppenthal said he had permission from a representative Country Brook Apartments to remove the sign from private property .
" State law is clear ; a property owner is free to dispose of ( campaign ) signs , " Huppenthal said .
The charges stem from a confrontation Huppenthal had with Ruth Levin , a 78 - year - old Democratic activist who told reporters and police that the senator cut down the sign then struggled with her over it before driving off in a Lexus SUV .
Levin reported the incident to Chandler police .
Emily DeRose , spokeswoman for the Democratic Party , said it is uncertain whether Huppenthal had permission , but the real issue is his behavior .
" Our public officials should be held to a high standard of ethical conduct .
People who think it 's okay to steal signs from little old ladies should account for that kind of behavior , " she said .
Records in Santan Justice
Court show the complaint , filed by a Scottsdale city attorney , was originally submitted to Chandler but transferred when that court declared a conflict of interest .
Huppenthal is a former Chandler City Councilman .
A justice court clerk said Huppenthal has not yet been served and no hearing dates have been set .
Huppenthal captured 56 percent of the votes cast to win re-election in District 20 against Ted Maish .
The district includes Ahwatukee Foothills , portions of Chandler and Tempe .
If convicted , the senator could receive up to six months in jail , a $ 2,500 fine and up to three years ' probation .
However , no minimum sentence is required .
" Now I 've got to hire a lawyer , " Huppenthal said .
" I have two daughters and I 'd rather spend the money on them . "

Our troubles with Hank started back when he was CEO at Goldman - $achs .
Hank helped launch the masked bogus financial instruments called " derivatives " which are at the Heart of the Global Meltdown of Banks around our Planet .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Next , at the invitation of GwB , Hank skipped over to the US Treasury , where his months of failures to act made things worse .
When the World Economy had festered to the point of near collapse– a week before Congress was to go home to hit the Campaign Trail — Hank laid a 3 - page Bailout Plan before them , and said , " take it or leave it . "
BTW , if you do n’t take it — while you ’re out of Washington — the World as you know it will collapse .
There will be Rioting in the Streets of America , requiring us to declare Martial Law .
Obediently , Congress swallowed Hank ’s Bailout Pig , whole .
Now , barely a month later , Hank is telling us what he already knew from the beginning : that the $ 700,000,000,000 he got from Congress to Bailout distressed homeowner mortgages could n’t be done soon enough to make any difference .
That ’s why , thus far , his Bailout Czar Neel Kaskari ( also imported from Goldman - $achs ) has NOT bought ONE SINGLE distressed mortgage .
Instead ,
Hank announced : I changed my mind .
This money is only going to Bailout my buddies who are Bankers .
After all , they have lost the most from all this .
Sorry : no money for homeowners !
But not to worry .
Someday it will trickle - down , just like Ronnie Reagan and Uncle Miltie Friedman told us it would .
We ’re going to give the money to big banks to buy smaller banks , so they can become " too big to fail " .
What Hank really means is that he hopes they will become " to big to regulate " .
When Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosie — who had filled Hank ’s playpen with bales of cash — announced that Congress might take back some of Hank ’s money to Bailout the nearly bankrupt US Auto Industry , Hank replied sharply , " NO !
This is my pile .
I swiped it .
You approved it .
It ’s mine !
Go get your own pile to play with from American taxpayers .
They ’re too dumb to care ! "

LIEBERMAN HASN’T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO HIMSELF ….
Joe Lieberman adopted the role of Republican attack dog early on , but as the election draws near , he ’s hoping the political world has a very short memory .
Lieberman , a self - proclaimed “ independent Democrat ” who was chosen by McCain to make the case against Obama at the Republican National Convention in early September , said his comments have been within bounds .
“ When I go out , I say , ‘ I have a lot of respect for Sen. Obama .
He ’s bright .
He ’s eloquent . ' ”
My hunch is , Lieberman sees the direction of the political winds , and hopes to convince Democrats that while he ’s been a McCain sycophant , he ’s always been “ respectful ” towards Obama .
Lieberman , in other words , has to hope Democrats have n’t been paying any attention at all .
The party is supposed to forget , for example , when Lieberman argued that Obama does n’t put “ country first . ”
And the time Lieberman said it was a “ good question ” to ask whether Obama is a “ Marxist . ”
And the time Lieberman ironically accused the Obama campaign of “ sleazy tactics . ”
And the time Lieberman , at the Republican National Convention , falsely accused Obama of trying to undermine the troops
“ Respectful ” ?
Nice try , Joe .
Exposing contact patterns Published : June 13 , 2008 SocioPatterns.org aims to shed light on hidden patterns in social dynamics .
A case in point is the study of contact patterns , which deals with such patterns in contacts among people .
To date , little is known about these patterns .
Although models can help in learning more , measuring real - world dynamics is indispensable for obtaining a complete picture .
However , doing so manually is both laborious and intrusive , and tends to produce unreliable data – yet until recently it was the sole option we had .
Fortunately , emerging technologies such as active RFID devices offer previously unfeasible means for collecting this much needed data .
While collecting data is the first step , making sense of the resulting large amounts of data is the next .
This is where insightful visualizations come into play , as these can expose otherwise invisible features and regularities .
The following movie gives an impression of a first contact patterns experiment and visualization we have been working on .
It is followed by a detailed description .
Experiment set -up
We have been working on an experimental set - up in which we aim to measure the contact patterns of a group of people .
To do so we asked volunteers to wear small tags with integrated active RFID technology , henceforth called the beacons .
These beacons continuously broadcast small data packets .
These packets are received by a number of stations and relayed through a local network to a server for further processing .
The stations are installed in fixed locations in the environment .
The beacons and stations we used were created by and obtained from OpenBeacon.org .
A first medium - sized test deployment of this experimental set - up took place recently ( 26 - 29 May , 2008 ) during the workshop “ Sociophysics : status and perspectives ” in Villa Gualino , in Turin , Italy .
The workshop presentations took place in Sala A , while the participants lingered in the Bar during breaks , and had lunch in the Cafeteria .
All three areas were covered by at least four stations each , as shown on the map below .
The packets from up to 50 beacons were collected continuously for about 75 hours at an overall rate of up to 100 distinct packets per second .
In total about 25 million packets were collected , corresponding to about 200 Mb of compressed raw data .
On - line data analysis and visualization server
In addition to recording data for further analysis – whose results will be posted here in the future – we also developed a real - time visualization system to display some aspects of the observed dynamics .
Our visualization involves a server component and a client component .
The server component processes the beacon packets relayed by the stations .
These packets are typically received by multiple stations at varying strengths .
These reception patterns can be used as a proxy for the physical proximity of two beacons .
A related technique is used in the geo-location feature of the Apple iPod Touch and iPhone , or in services like PlaceEngine .
All calculations are performed in real - time over a sliding window of about two minutes .
The post - processed data are dispatched to the visualization client at regular intervals , as an XML stream .
The on - line data collection and analysis system is entirely coded in Python on top of the Twisted framework and the Numpy library .
Visualization client
The main visualization represents the beacons , the stations , and their relations of proximity as measured by the system .
The beacons are shown as simple discs , which are optionally labeled .
Two beacons are connected by a link if the system detected that they are close to each other .
The length , thickness and transparency of a link are a function of the strength of the link : short , thick and more opaque links represent strong proximity ; thin , transparent links indicate weak proximity .
The size of the discs representing the beacons depends on the number and proximity of other beacons , and specifically is a function of the sum of link weights to other beacons .
The stations are shown as labeled shapes and laid out in a circle that spans the main view .
The size of these shapes varies according to the number of beacons that are close to them .
While the stations are laid out at fixed positions , the beacons are not .
The network of their proximity relations is laid out by using a force - based model .
Beacons repel each other , and the link between two beacons acts as a spring pulling them close to each other .
The stiffness of the spring increases with the proximity of beacons .
Beacons are also pulled towards the stations that see them more often , so that groups of nearby beacons are laid out in the vicinity of the stations that is closest to them .
The result is a first attempt to obtain a rather abstract yet comprehensive visualization of the proximity dynamics .
The movie at the top of this post contains a time - lapse playback of the most interesting periods of one day of the workshop .
Visualization client interface
The visualization client is an Adobe Air application developed in Flex .
The visualization and physics system use ( a mildly modified version of ) the flare visualization toolkit .
The application interface involves a visualization window , a control panel and a number of auxiliary windows .
The visualization itself can be shown full - screen during presentations .
The control panel provides various interfaces to manage the data - sources , the visualization and the physics engine .
The data source is either the server component for real - time visualizations , a simulation for off - line testing , or data files for time - lapse playback .
When using a simulation , an additional window is provided in which the simulated stations and beacons are shown .
When in time - lapse mode , one can activate the recorder , which saves a bitmap file for each rendered frame .
These saved frames were for example used to create the movie at the top of this post .

The differences between wind turbine and ceiling fan blades arise from the contrasting design criteria : the wind turbine is intended to capture high - velocity wind to generate electricity efficiently ; the ceiling fan needs to move air at low velocity with inexpensive components .
To keep drivetrain costs low , a wind turbine must capture the energy in fast - moving air and rotate at relatively high speed — within limits , so as to avoid excessive noise generation .
( Slow rotation would increase the torque and require heavier and more expensive drivetrain components . )
Such high - efficiency energy conversion dictates the use of lift - type turbine blades , similar to airplane wings , of twisted and tapered airfoil shapes .
The blade design creates a pressure difference in wind — high pressure on one side and low pressure on the other — that causes the blades to turn .
A combination of structural and economic considerations drives the use of three slender blades on most wind turbines — using one or two blades means more complex structural dynamics , and more blades means greater expense for the blades and the blade attachments to the turbine .
The ceiling fan , on the other hand , is built to keep the occupants of a room comfortable by moving air gently .
Its engineers work to minimize noise while the fan rotates at low speed ( for safety reasons ) and to keep the construction costs , and therefore the purchase price , low .
Energy efficiency is not a primary concern , because operation is inexpensive — a typical ceiling fan running 24 hours a day consumes about 60 kilowatt - hours a month , for an average electricity cost of about six dollars .
For this reason , most ceiling fans incorporate blades that are comparatively inefficient drag devices ; rotating the pitched blades pushes air vertically out of the way .
Wide , flat blades are inexpensive to build and work well as drag devices .
More blades are better , up to a point , and the usual layout of four or five blades is the result of balancing trade - offs between efficiency and expense .
A 2001 article in Mechanical Engineering chronicled the quest of a man named Danny Parker to create a more efficient ceiling fan .
Parker ’s initial blade prototype looked a lot like a wind turbine blade , but the end result ( because of man­ufacturing , safety and operating concerns ) was a hybrid between a standard ceiling fan blade and a wind turbine blade .

Sarah Palin : A Worthless Bag of Hair
Sarah Palin gave Charles Gibson , of the ABC television network , an exclusive interview .
Here is a quote from Sarah Palin in her ABC interview : “ For Russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic country , unprovoked , is unacceptable . ”
Sarah Palin : A Worthless Bag of Hair
Is that so , Sarah ?
In the interview , she certainly did prove one thing .
She can lie and be dishonest just like the rest of them .
Not only did she show total ignorance of even what US intelligence services now confirm and admit , that Georgia was the aggressor in a campaign of genocide which Russia stopped , but she was totally clueless when questioned about the Bush Doctrine .
Instead , Palin tried make believe she did n’t realize that the interviewer knew she did n’t have a clue what he was talking about .
Gibson :
Do you agree with the Bush doctrine ?
Palin :
In what respect , Charlie ?
Gibson :
Well , what do you interpret it to be ?
Palin :
His world view ?
Gibson : The Bush doctrine , in September 2002 , before the Iraq war .
Palin : I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do is rid this world of Islamic terrorists who are hell - bent in destroying our nation .
There have been blunders along the way , though .
there have been mistakes made , and with new leadership , and that 's the beauty of American elections , of course , and democracy , is with new leadership comes opportunity to do things better .
Gibson :
The Bush doctrine is we have the right of self - defense , preemptive strike against any country we think is going to attack us .
do you agree with us ?
Clearly Palin did not have the foggiest idea what Gibson meant .
This is absolutely huge .
The Bush doctrine of preemption and the National Security Strategy of 2002 was the central element of debate for almost 2 years in the foreign policy community and in the US during the run up to the invasion of Iraq and in the years after .
It was probably the single greatest shift in US foreign policy in a generation , but a possible would - be US President is totally clueless about it .
Here are the interview questions where Palin showed … what is it ?
A total lack of knowledge and stupidity or a deliberate attempt to LIE ?
GIBSON : Let me ask you about some specific national security situations .
PALIN : Sure .
GIBSON : Let 's start , because we are near Russia , let 's start with Russia and Georgia .
The administration has said we 've got to maintain the territorial integrity of Georgia .
Do you believe the United States should try to restore Georgian sovereignty over South Ossetia and Abkhazia ?
PALIN : First off , we 're going to continue good relations with Saakashvili there .
I was able to speak with him the other day and giving him my commitment , as John McCain 's running mate , that we will be committed to Georgia .
And we 've got to keep an eye on Russia .
For Russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic country , unprovoked , is unacceptable and we have to keep ...
GIBSON : You believe unprovoked .
PALIN : I do believe unprovoked and we have got to keep our eyes on Russia , under the leadership there .
I think it was unfortunate .
That manifestation that we saw with that invasion of Georgia shows us some steps backwards that Russia has recently taken away from the race toward a more democratic nation with democratic ideals .
That 's why we have to keep an eye on Russia .
To the contrary , we have to keep our eye on YOU , Sarah Palin !!!
We need to determine if you are either a pathological LIAR or just a stupid , incompetent , ignorant bag of hair .
Further in the situation with Georgia :
PALIN : Well , you know , the Rose Revolution , the Orange Revolution , those actions have showed us that those democratic nations , I believe , deserve to be in NATO .
Putin thinks otherwise .
Obviously , he thinks otherwise , but ...
GIBSON : And under the NATO treaty , would n't we then have to go to war if Russia went into Georgia ?
PALIN : Perhaps so .
I mean , that is the agreement when you are a NATO ally , is if another country is attacked , you 're going to be expected to be called upon and help
Such statements about hypothetical situations from a candidate show an extreme lack of good judgment and sense , not to mention it 's saber rattling at its very worst .
The international community is also fully aware that Georgia cannot properly be described as a democratic nation by anyone ’s standards , other than Washington ’s in whose case “ democratic ” can merely be defined as a puppet state willing to do whatever Washington commands .
Meanwhile the corporate media continues to try to influence the voting public by conducting inaccurate polls , reporting significant gains for the McCain / Palin ticket .
This is despite the fact that many more new Democrats are being registered as opposed to Republicans .
Nationwide , there are about 42 million registered Democrats and about 31 million Republicans according to statistics compiled by The Associated Press .
The Democrats have posted big gains in many competitive states , including Nevada , New Hampshire , Iowa , Colorado and Florida .
They have also been targeting historically Republican southern states .
Since 2006 , the Democrats have added 167,000 voters in North Carolina , while the Republicans have added 36,000 .
Although it appears there was a bigger gain for McCain than for Obama , the prior lack of enthusiasm among Republicans is likely causing an inflated rate of survey respondents identified as independents .
CBS polls show most of the movement came to McCain from undecided voters , people who were probably holding back from declaring for McCain .
Despite that , the overall spike in Republican sampling among all three polling agencies is still an inaccurate reflection of the electorate .
Given how important polls can be in the coverage of the race , even a slight assist to McCain during a period in which he is exciting the Republican base could help him solidify a new narrative in the race , regardless of the facts on the ground .
The corporate media is trying to promote Sarah Palin as their star , as the newest sensation .
However , all the non-verbal cues given out during the interview indicated that Palin realized she was entirely out of her league in discussing foreign affairs , having been shown for her total and complete ignorance and incompetence .
Obviously this is the reason the Republicans did n’t want Palin giving any interviews as this one interview clearly demonstrated that Palin fails miserably in all areas , in other words , she is a worthless bag of hair .

A Foreign Ministry spokesman has dismissed the European Union 's ( EU ) criticisms over the execution of a man found guilty of spying for Taiwan , and said he was sentenced after a " just and fair " trial .
Wo Weihan , a 59 - year - old medical scientist , was executed on Friday for passing information on the mainland 's missile guidance systems to a group linked to intelligence agencies in Taiwan .
The EU has issued a statement , condemning the execution and saying that China had ignored repeated calls by the EU and several of its member states to defer it .
The criticism came after China postponed a meeting with EU leaders because some European countries ' leaders had planned to meet with the Dalai Lama .
Ursula Plassnik , foreign minister of Austria - Wo 's daughter is a citizen of that country - said the execution should be considered " a premeditated affront by the entire EU " .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang responded , saying China is " strongly dissatisfied with and opposed to ( the accusation ) " .
In a statement issued on Sunday , Qin asked the EU to correct its mistakes immediately and stop passing remarks and taking actions that tantamount to interfering in China 's judiciary 's works .
" China is governed by the rule of law , and Wo was a Chinese citizen .
Evidence proved his crime
The accusation against the Chinese judiciary is a direct interference in China 's judicial sovereignty , it tramples the spirit of the rule of law and undermines the basis of healthy development of bilateral talks on human rights , " Qin said .
On the Dalai Lama controversy , European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said he hoped good relations with China would continue .
" We hope that there will be wisdom on the part of China and also on the part of Europe to overcome this problem , " he said .
But despite insisting that Sino - EU relations were very important , he told RTL radio on Sunday that European politicians had the right to meet whoever they wanted .
Wu Baiyi , a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , reacted to the statement , saying that if Europe wanted to maintain good ties with China , its leaders should have long - term strategic considerations , especially while working together to resolve the global financial crisis .
" Some European politicians should first ask themselves if meeting with the Dalai Lama would help them solve the economic problems . "
Wu said China and Europe have a common interest : to resolve the financial crisis .
At the G20 summit held in Washington last month , China said it hoped a new global financial system would take shape in which the developing countries would have a greater say .
That proposition is in conformity with the EU 's wish to see a multilateral world , Wu said .

U.S. consumer prices in October registered their largest single - month decline since before World War II , a broad - based drop that creates a new challenge for policy makers : avoiding a bout of deflation , a prolonged period of falling prices throughout the economy .
The odds of such an event are still considered small by most economists .
But the mere risk puts added pressure on Congress and the incoming Obama administration to quickly advance a large fiscal stimulus plan .
It also increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve ...
Last week , the New York Times wrote about Changes at change.gov :
The policy section of the transition site was removed without notice just days after Change. gov went live shortly after the election .
At the time a spokesman for the Obama - Biden transition effort said they were “ re-tooling ” it .
There was an almost instantaneous outcry from bloggers and other advocates of transparency in government who noticed disappearance .
At least one site posted a complete archive of the old Agenda pages .
( Increasing transparency , by the way , is a key feature of Mr. Obama ’s government reform agenda , according to the site ’s “ Ethics ” page . )
The changes , as it turned out , were mostly to tone down the partisan politics of the policy documents as published during the campaign .
But the lesson remains : when public documents can be changed without notice , it ’s essential for the public to be able to see what changed , and why .
There ’s a profound and simple tool that the Obama administration can use to improve government transparency .
It ’s something that ’s enabled worldwide collaboration among software developers , and whose relevance for content development has been definitively demonstrated by wikipedia : Revision control .
Not only does revision control allow a community to work independently on a common project , it makes it possible to review the changes .
There ’s a primitive form of revision control in word processing products like Microsoft Word , but we need more than that , especially for documents that bring together the work of multiple independent authors .
For change.gov , the wikipedia model might work : logging of every change , with only authorized participants allowed to make changes , but everyone ( the public ) able to review and comment on associated discussion pages .
The real holy grail , of course , would be to provide revision control on all government regulations , and eventually , on legislation .
This would no doubt be fought tooth and nail by lobbyists who do n’t want their fingerprints on the final result , but that ’s precisely why it would be such a breakthrough .
And that ’s also why I suggest that the Obama team start with change.gov : demonstrate that the system works , that it has enormous benefits in transparency , and work from there .
Of course , there are major technical and workflow obstacles .
Many of the documents in question are probably worked on independently as Microsoft Office files , with bulk merges that obscure the history .
What we really need are distributed revision control tools .
There ’s a lot of good work happening in this area in the software development community ; it would be fascinating to see it extended to collaborative document development .
( Of course , shared editing a la Google Docs is coming to Microsoft Office as well , so perhaps the point of leverage is for Google to improve the revision control capabilities in Google Docs , starting an arms race with Microsoft .
Once the tools are in place , the social pressure to use them has a point of leverage . )
Like so many things that go under the rubric of “ change , ” I ’m sure that there would be many complications to this proposal , many problems I have n’t thought of .
Many current assumptions and processes would need to be challenged , and some of the challenges would take us down dead ends .
But that ’s what change is all about .
If it was just like the present , it would n’t be change .
I ’d love your thoughts both on the general proposal and specific ideas for implementation .
P.S. I wrote on this same subject about a year and a half ago , in a post entitled Why Congress Needs a Version Control System .
It was Karl Fogel who first put this idea into my head , and that post explains his thinking .
There are also some comments there from 2007 that may provide more grist for the discussion .
Abdirahman Ahmed was a prominent politician in Kismayo An Islamist militia has executed a Somali politician who they accused of betraying his religion by working with non-Muslim Ethiopian forces .
An Islamist spokesman in the port of Kismayo told the BBC that Abdirahman Ahmed was shot dead on Thursday .
Mr Ahmed was also accused of spying for Ethiopian forces , said to be backing the forces of warlord Barre Hiraale in trying to recapture Kismayo .
He is believed to be the first politician executed by the Islamists .
Ethiopian forces are pulling out of Somalia , two years after they intervened to try to oust Islamists from the capital Mogadishu .
But their mission to prop up the interim government is widely regarded as a failure as various Islamist group have recently advanced and once more control much of the country .
A group of hardline Islamists retook the coastal city of Kismayo last August .
Islamist authorities in the city stoned a 12 - year - old girl to death for adultery in November , although her aunt said she had been raped .
In Mogadishu , thousands of people have gathered at the football stadium , a former Ethiopian base , to celebrate the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces .
Talks about power - sharing between moderate Islamists and the government earlier resumed in neighbouring Djibouti .
' Denied body ' Relatives of Abdirahman Ahmed - also known as Waldiire - told the BBC he did not have a lawyer present during his trial in a Sharia court .
They say he was arrested about a week ago and they were informed of his death sentence on Thursday morning .
Different Islamist groups now control much of the country Sheikh Hassan Yakub - the spokesman for Kismayo's Islamist administration - told the BBC's Somali Service that Mr Ahmed had admitted during his interrogation that he worked with those backed by Ethiopia .
This , he said , was the basis for the court 's opinion that he had changed his religion .
The relatives said they had asked the authorities to allow Mr Ahmed to go into exile .
But he was executed after afternoon prayers on Thursday .
After the shooting , his brother pleaded to be able to bury his body , however , he was told the burial had already been done .
Mr Ahmed used to be the spokesman for the Jubba Valley Alliance - one of the factions which battled for control of Somalia during the 1990s .
Earlier this month , Mr Hiraale and his fighters took some towns from the hardline Islamist group al - Shabab in Gedo region , north of Kismayo .
Observers at the time said Mr Hiraale was being armed by the withdrawing Ethiopian troops - an allegation he denied .
Al - Shabab is on the US list of terrorist groups .

One lump or two ?
How a hot cup of tea in the hand makes us friendlier towards strangers
Fancy a cuppa ?
Handing someone a hot cup of coffee or tea can trigger positive associations in the brain meaning that you 're more likely to trust that person
If you want to make a good first impression on someone , give them a steaming cup of tea or hot chocolate .
Scientists have found that we feel more positively towards a stranger if we have a warming drink in our hand .
The extraordinary discovery could help explain why so many people offer a hot drink when a visitor comes to their house .
Researchers are unsure why physical warmth changes the way we view other people 's personalities .
But they suspect that we are programmed to seek out warmth - and that a hot drink triggers a host of positive associations in the brain .
Dr John Bargh , a professor of psychology who led the study at Yale University , said : ' It appears that the effect of physical temperature is not just on how we see others , it affects our own behaviour as well .
' Physical warmth can make us see others as warmer people , but also cause us to be warmer - more generous and trusting - as well . '
In the study , 41 volunteers were briefly tricked into holding either a warm cup of coffee or iced coffee as they went up in a lift to the laboratory , one by one , for the experiment .
Once in the laboratory , they were handed a pack of information about a stranger and asked to assess his personality .
Although every student was given the same description , their opinions varied enormously depending on whether they had been given a hot or a cold drink .
' People who had briefly held the hot coffee cup perceived the target person as being significantly warmer than did those who had briefly held the cup of iced coffee , ' the authors of the study report today in the journal Science .
However , the warmth of a drink made no difference to their descriptions of other personality traits .
That suggests a hot drink makes other people seem warmer - but not more intelligent , successful or attractive .
In a second study , 53 volunteers were asked to hold heated or frozen therapeutic pads under the guise of a medical product evaluation .
After filling in a questionnaire about the pads , they were offered the choice of either a drink for themselves , or a voucher they could give to a friend .
People who had held the hot pack were more likely to ask for the gift voucher , while those who held the frozen pack tended to keep the gift .
The researchers believe physical warmth may unconsciously ' prime ' the brain into feeling more positive .
Other studies have suggested that the same region of the brain is involved in processing information about physical warmth and the warmth of people 's personalities .
Past surveys have shown that people feel colder when they are miserable and isolated - and believe the temperature is higher when they have positive , happy thoughts .
People who received a mild electrical current to a motor control area of the brain were significantly better able to learn and perform a complex motor task than those in control groups .
The findings could hold promise for enhancing rehabilitation for people with traumatic brain injury , stroke and other conditions .
The study is presented in the January 20 , 2009 early online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , and was conducted by researchers at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
The research team from NIH 's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ( NINDS ) worked in collaboration with investigators at Columbia University in New York City and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore .
Motor skills , which are used for activities from typing and driving , to sports , require practice and learning over a prolonged period of time .
During practice , the brain encodes information about how to perform the task , but even during periods of rest , the brain is still at work strengthening the memory of doing the task .
This process is known as consolidation .
Subjects in this study were presented with a novel and challenging motor task , which involved squeezing a " joy stick " to play a targeting game on a computer monitor , which they practiced over five consecutive days .
During practice , one group received 20 minutes of transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) and the other group received only a 30 second " sham " stimulation .
tDCS involves mild electrical stimulation applied through surface electrodes on the head , and works by modulating the excitability , or activity , of cells in the brain 's outermost layers .
In this study , Dr. Cohen and his team directed tDCS to the primary motor cortex , the part of the brain that controls movement .
Over the five - day training period , the skill of the tDCS group improved significantly more that that of the control ( sham ) group , apparently through an effect on consolidation .
During the three month follow - up period , the two groups forgot the skill at about the same rate , but the tDCS group continued to perform better because they had learned the skill better by the end of training .

Hi everybody , this was my surprise project , achivy.com my first startup , my first ruby on rails project :)

A team led by Craig Pikaard , Ph.D. , WUSTL professor of biology in Arts & Sciences , has made a breakthrough in understanding the phenomenon of nucleolar dominance , the silencing of an entire parental set of ribosomal RNA genes in a hybrid plant or animal .
Since the machinery involved in nucleolar dominance is some of the same machinery that can go haywire in diseases such as cancer , Pikaard and his collaborators ' research may have important implications for applied medical research .
Nucleolar dominance occurs when nucleoli , protein - rich , dense regions of RNA within the nucleus , form on the chromosomes inherited from one parent , but not on the chromosomes inherited from the other parent .
Expression of ribosomal RNA genes drives the formation of these nucleoli .
The hybrid , a result of a cross- breeding of two different species , always " chooses " to express the ribosomal RNA genes of one particular parental species , regardless of whether that species happens to be the maternal or paternal parent .
Ribosomal RNAs , or rRNAs , are a major component of the ribosomes , the protein manufacturers of the cell .
Because rRNA genes are highly redundant , cells use nucleolar dominance to control the dosage of ribosomes in an organism .
According to Pikaard , if researchers could harness the silencing machinery involved in nucleolar dominance to limit the expression of rRNA genes , they could potentially slow the growth rate of tumor cells and thereby slow the progression of diseases like cancer .
In cancer cells , nucleoli are conspicuously large because of a dramatic increase in the transcription of rRNAs , which in turn leads to an increase in the production of ribosomes .
This escalation in ribosome activity means that the cell can synthesize proteins at an alarmingly rapid rate , which contributes to the out - of - control cell proliferation that is the disease 's trademark .
Completely silencing all ribosomal genes would not be a viable therapeutic approach for cancer patients because ribosomes are necessary for survival .
But Pikaard and his collaborators ' research suggests that small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) can direct silencing agendas that are much more sophisticated than an all or nothing approach .
" Dr. Pikaard 's study demonstrates the potential of a plant model system to yield important molecular details on how cells silence large clusters of genes , " said Anthony Carter , Ph.D. , who oversees gene regulation grants at the National Institutes of Health 's National Institute of General Medical Sciences , which partially supported the research .
" His findings on the control of a major class of RNA found in all cells offer new insights into gene silencing mechanisms . "
Pikaard and his collaborators ' work , which was published in Molecular Cell on Dec. 4 , is also one of the first to demonstrate how siRNAs can play a role in controlling the dosage of vital genes .
The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation .
The weird and the wacky
Nucleolar dominance is considered an " epigenetic " phenomenon .
Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression that arise from changes in the " packaging " of DNA rather than modification of the underlying DNA sequence itself .
Because these changes do not follow the normal rules of genetics , Pikaard refers to them as the " X - files of biology , " unusual events that are not easily explained nor predicted .
Although biologists have been studying nucleolar dominance since the 1920s , this phenomenon remained largely unresolved until recently , when Pikaard 's lab reversed an old dogma .
Up until this point , researchers had presumed that nucleolar dominance was all about turning on one set of parental ribosomal genes .
In 1997 , Pikaard and his colleagues made headlines with an experiment that used chemicals to inhibit the two - pronged method cells employ to silence genes -- DNA methylation , which adds chemical flags to genes , and histone modification , which alters the proteins that act as spools for DNA .
The chemical inhibitors of silencing turned on the previously unexpressed set of parental genes , thereby demonstrated that the underlying mechanism of nucleolar dominance turns genes off , not on .
Since then , Pikaard and his collaborators have been working to disentangle the complex machinery behind this epigenetic on - off switch .
Using RNA to fight RNA
To determine the pathway regulating nucleolar dominance , Pikaard 's team exploited a naturally occurring cellular mechanism known as RNA interference ( RNAi ) .
Pikaard likens RNAi to a " search and destroy mission . "
Fragments of RNA known as small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) prevent specific genes from being expressed by guiding cleavage of matching RNA strands .
Once these RNA strands are cut into smaller pieces , they can no longer be translated into proteins .
RNAi has high specificity because the target RNA strand must have a genetic code that is complementary to the siRNA 's nucleotide sequence .
In nature , cells use RNAi to silence " junk DNA , " noncoding regions of the DNA , and " selfish DNA " such as virus - derived retrotransposons ( jumping genes ) that can be detrimental if activated .
In the lab , Pikaard and his collaborators use RNAi to " knockdown " expression of target genes .
Using a hybrid of two species of Arabidopsis , the plant version of a lab rat , Pikaard 's team knocked down expression of genes coding for products that prior research had suggested might be involved in silencing .
By knocking these suspects down one by one and assessing whether nucleolar dominance had been disrupted after each knockdown , Pikaard and his collaborators were able to determine which proteins and RNAs were necessary to keep the silenced parental genes off .
New clues
The RNAi knockdowns identified several new players necessary for the silencing machinery in nucleolar dominance to function , and also highlighted the key role of siRNA .
First in the pathway is RNA - dependent RNA Polymerase 2 ( RDR2 ) , which prepares a stretch of RNA for DICER - LIKE 3 ( DCL3 ) , an enzyme that chops up RNA transcripts into smaller segments .
These smaller fragments of RNA become siRNAs , which then guide the de novo cytosine methyltransferase , DRM2 , to the targeted genes .
DRM2 is required to put a methyl group , a chemical flag that signals for silencing , on ribosomal genes that had been active in the parental genome .
MBD6 and MBD10 , methylcytosine binding proteins , then adhere to the segments of DNA that have been methylated by DRM2 .
At the same time , HDA6 , a histone deacetylase , modifies the proteins that act as spools for the DNA .
The end result of this convergent , siRNA - mediated pathway is the large - scale silencing of hundreds of clustered rRNA genes that span millions of basepairs of DNA .
Nucleolar dominance occurs on a scale second only to X - chromosome inactivation , a process by which one of the two copies of the X - chromosome present in female mammals is randomly inactivated .
Although nucleolar dominance is on a sub- chromosomal scale , it is , at least to date , " the largest scale gene silencing phenomenon that clearly seems to involve siRNAs , " says Pikaard .
Pikaard explains , " siRNAs are not just regulating the selfish DNA or the junk DNA , but they 're regulating the really essential genes too . "
He believes that siRNAs might be the key to understanding the choice mechanism underlying which parental genes get switched off and which get left on , and he and his collaborators plan to investigate this possibility in future research .
" The truth is out there , " says Pikaard .

LIMA ( Reuters ) - Peru ’s top court has ruled that workers cannot be fired for being drunk on the job , a decision that was criticized by the government on Wednesday for setting a dangerous precedent .
The Constitutional Tribunal ordered that Pablo Cayo be given his job back as a janitor for the municipality of Chorrillos , which fired him for being intoxicated at work .
The firing was excessive because even though Cayo was drunk , he did not offend or hurt anybody , Fernando Calle , one of the justices , said on Wednesday .
Calle said the court would not revise its decision , despite complaints from the government .
“ It ’s not a good idea to relax rules at workplaces , ” said Labor Minister Jorge Villasante .
Celso Becerra , the administrative chief of Chorrillos , a suburb of Lima , denounced the ruling .
“ We ’ve fired four workers for showing up drunk , and two of them were drivers , ” he said .
“ How can we allow a drunk to work who might run somebody over ? ”

I can't wait to see what Rove says ....
Via HuffPost :
On Monday , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI )
issued a subpoena to Karl Rove , requiring him to testify regarding his
role in the Bush Administration 's politicization of the Department of
Justice , including the US Attorney firings and the prosecution of
former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
The subpoena calls for Rove to
appear at deposition on Monday , February 2 , 2009 .

Rove has previously refused to appear in response to a Judiciary
Committee subpoena , claiming that even former presidential advisers
cannot be compelled to testify before Congress .
That " absolute
immunity " position was supported by then - President Bush , but it has
been rejected by U.S. District Judge John Bates .
President Obama has
previously dismissed the claim as " completely misguided . "
" I have said many times that I will carry this investigation forward
to its conclusion , whether in Congress or in court , and today 's action
is an important step along the way , " said Rep. Conyers .
Noting that the
change in administration may impact the legal arguments available to
Mr. Rove in this long - running dispute , Mr. Conyers added , " Change has
come to Washington , and I hope Karl Rove is ready for it .
After two
years of stonewalling , it 's time for him to talk . "

Europe 's biggest onshore wind farm plugged itself into the grid today to provide enough electricity for up to a million people in northern Portugal .
A total of 120 windmills are dotted across the highlands of the Upper Minho region of Portugal as one of western Europe 's poorer nations continues to forge its reputation as a renewables champion .
" Europe 's largest onshore wind farm is now fully operational , " a spokeswoman for France 's EDF Energies Nouvelles , which co-owns the farm , announced this morning .
The two megawatt turbines on each windmill deliver electricity to a single connection point with the electricity grid and should supply around 1 % of Portugal 's total energy needs .
A second , smaller wind farm is already functioning nearby , giving a combined output of 650 gigawatt hours per year .
" That is above 1 % of national consumption , " said Nuno Ribeiro da Silva , head of the VentoMinho company that runs the farm .
That would provide enough energy for 300,000 homes , or most of the northern city of Viana do Castelo and its surrounding districts , he told the Publico newspaper .
Portugal 's mixture of government enthusiasm , subsidies and special tariffs has turned it into one of the focal points of renewables development in Europe over the past five years .
The world 's largest solar photovoltaic farm is being built near the southern town of Moura .
The Moura solar farm , which will include a research centre , should be twice the size of any other in the world when it is fully up and running in two years time .
Portugal also recently inaugurated the world 's first commercial wave power plant in the Atlantic Ocean off Aguçadoura , using technology developed in Scotland .
The country is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels and has set a target of obtaining 31 % of energy needs from renewables by the year 2020 .
That is more than twice the UK target .
It also uses its subsidies policy to insist that manufacturers of turbines and solar panels set up production plants .
" By 2010 we will have 5,000 MW of wind energy installed , meaning we will have increased it tenfold in just five years , " economy minister Manuel Pinho said .
" This is another step towards putting our country in the vanguard of what is being done with renewable energy . "
Portugal , which claims to be one of the world 's top five renewable energy countries , provides subsidies of up to 40 % for new projects .
The world 's largest onshore wind farms are in the United States , with the Horse Hollow farm in Texas providing more than 700MW .
These will soon be dwarfed by proposed offshore wind farms of up to 5,000 MW each .

# 41 : Monster Outlets to Go
Perhaps the most frustrating part about traveling with so many electronic gadgets is the challenge of finding public outlets .
Monster ’s Outlets to Go Power Strip is the perfect work around for this problem .
Tim Leffel of Practical Travel Gear notes :
With a compact , flat design , these outlet strips enable you to use your laptop , charge your phone , and still have one space to share with that guy walking around looking behind all the tables for an outlet .
Or when you ’re in a cheap hotel room that is stingy with the outlets ( or hides them behind heavy furniture ) , this will save some crawling and cursing .
The 3 - outlet model I tried out is a mere 8.9 inches ( 22.6 cm ) and it wraps around itself for easy packing .
All the 3 - prong outlets lie flat , so it ’s very compact and weighs about as much as your average cell phone .

If the inside of your travel gear bag looks like a bowl of overcooked pasta , whip that mass of power cables into shape .
Enter the Cableyoyo : a simple , effective , cable - organizing device .
And , at less than $ 5 ( US ) , it ’s a must - have for flashpackers .
The Cableyoyo ’s cool design is ultra - thin so the cord cannot overlap when coiled .
This neat coiling ensures that you can pack the most cord into the smallest amount of space and still keep it truly untangled and untwisted when extended .
The ultra thin design also means it packs easily into those narrow pockets in a laptop bag or your pocket , with little bulging .

# 45 : Flexible Jumpdrive
Forget lugging around multiple card readers and flash drives .
IOGear ‘s Flexible Jumpdrive is a :
5 - n- 1 Pocket Drive Reader / Writer [ that ] looks like your typical USB 2.0 flash drive , until you flip up the back flap and expose the hidden port .
This is where you slide your Secure Digital ( SD ) or Multimedia Card ( MMC ) from your camera , PDA or MP3 player , or any other compatible electronic device .
Once the card is in the port you can transfer data or images to and from the card and your computer at speeds up to 480 mbs .
There ’s no driver necessary , and it works with both PC and Mac platforms .
And swapping out cards eliminates the need for multiple flash drives .

# 50 : IronKey Military Strength Flash Drives
We could easily file this under “ essentials for traveling professionals ” and maybe we should .
Flash drives are such a critically important tool in the flashpacker ’s arsenal , that only the best , most reliable and secure drive will do .
Up to $ 250 for the 8GB model but worth every penny , the IronKey gets the job done :
Like you , the US Military wanted portable but secure storage , and the guys at IronKey stepped up .
They ’ve developed the perfect solution that ’s one - part thumb - drive , and two parts Mission : Impossible .
Their thumb drives hold up to 8 Gigabytes of data , but includes a hardware encryption chip that scrambles the data so as to be completely unreadable without a password .
Passwords can be hacked , but not the IronKey .
It ’s built to withstand attacks both virtual and physical .
10 incorrect password attempts , and the encryption chip self - destructs , making the contents of the flash drive totally unreadable .
The contents of the drive are filled with epoxy , so if a hacker tries to physically access the chips , he ’d more likely damage them instead .
Even if he did get access to the memory chips , they ’d be worthless without the encryption chip .
Electron - shielded , even a scanning electron microscope can’t get inside .

Why Guys Marry Some Girls ( but Not Others )
All men have a secret wedding checklist : five traits they look for in a woman that say she ’s worth walking down the aisle for .
He wo n’t pop the question without ’em .
By Beth Whiffen
______________________
It happens all the time : A guy spends months , even years , in a long - term relationship with a girl he really digs .
But after dropping the I - do n ’t - see - myself - ever - getting - married bomb , he suddenly turns around and ties the knot with a new chick .
The factors that tip a dude from steady relationship to “ till death do us part ” seem like the ultimate unsolved mystery … especially when you ’re in a solid LTR and are n’t sure if your guy is even considering marriage .
It all comes down to some elusive qualities women have a hard time understanding but men are always on the lookout for , explains Willard Harley Jr. , Ph.D. , author of I Promise You : Preparing for a Marriage That Will Last a Lifetime .
“ Part of what makes him want to get married is chemistry and passion , but it ’s also about certain actions and behaviors that are more concrete than you ’d think , ” says Harley .
Below , we clue you in to five crucial traits that separate the girls men date from the ones who make them want to set a date .
Tie - the - Knot - Trait 1 : She ’s Exciting and Always Evolving
You know how every season finale of your favorite TV show ends with a million unanswered questions and you ca n’t freaking wait for the next one ?
Well , a girl can give her guy that same thrilling mix of exhilaration and anticipation by surprising him .
“ She does this by being spontaneous and a little unpredictable , taking on new interests all the time , and revealing different facets of herself , ” explains Alon Gratch , Ph.D. , author of If Love Could Think .
By never letting life get static , this woman busts the myth that being married means feeling humdrum .
“ She makes being with her an adventure , as if there ’s always a new idea or activity just around the bend , ” says Gratch .
“ With most of my girlfriends , I feared that we ’d run out of things to talk about if we spent too much time together .
But when I met my fiancée , Gwen , I kept discovering new layers to her .
One day she came home from work with a stack of cookbooks ; the next week she told me stories about how she loved designing outfits in high school .
She ’s full of small surprises . ”
— Brett , 29
“ I dated a lot of girls who liked pushing boundaries , but it all seemed a little forced .
My wife ’s sense of adventure , however , comes from within .
She ’s naturally driven to challenge herself by trying new things .
That ’s the kind of girl you want to marry .
If you are n’t continually fascinated by each other , it wo n’t last . ” — Rob , 38
“ The thing that makes my fiancée so captivating : She takes risks .
I do n’t mean she bungee jumps off bridges .
It ’s more that when a new opportunity comes along — a different facet to her job or the chance to meet new people at an event or party — she grabs it and proceeds .
Her boldness makes her enchanting . ” — Bob , 27
Tie - the - Knot - Trait 2 : She Really , Really Loves Sex
No big shocker here — a chick who enjoys twisting the sheets will always have a hopping social life .
But when a woman makes the effort to have really connected sex that involves both body and mind , she goes from great girlfriend to marriage material in his view .
“ Men crave sex that ’s erotic , but they also want sex that makes them feel deeply bonded , ” says Gratch .
In other words , it ’s not all about wowing a guy with pretzel - like positions ; a big part of having amazing booty is paying close attention to his mind - set and moods during the deed so sex reaches a higher , almost spiritual level .
Another thing that makes them think of the M word : when a woman is actively committed to keeping the passion on high boil .
“ A guy ’s biggest fear is that the great sex that made him think you were The One will fall by the wayside , ” explains Douglas Weiss , Ph.D. , author of The 7 Love Agreements : Decisions You Can Make on Your Own to Strengthen Your Marriage .
“ A woman who puts effort into maintaining that sizzle is a dream come true . ”
“ To make sure that the awesome sex we had when we first met did n’t lose its passion , my wife came up with this idea for regular ‘ sex bets . ’
For example , she ’d bet me that I could n’t make her climax several times in a row , or I ’d challenge her to initiate action in a semipublic spot .
We have never fallen into a rut , and our competition keeps us feeling connected . ” — Jamie , 30
“ My fiancée did this terrific thing when we first started having sex :
After we were finished , she ’d tell me how good I made her feel , that she really liked how I felt against her skin .
It made me want to tell her what I liked too .
Guys are n’t supposed to admit it , but opening up about how sex affects us emotionally actually enhances the physical side of things . ”
— Paul , 28
“ My fiancée was up - front from the start about her desire for an extremely satisfying sex life ; she never had any hang - ups about taking charge in bed or proposing out - there activities that a lot of women would be afraid to admit they were curious about .
I could tell I was n’t getting ensnared in the classic bait - and - switch marriage that so many guys fall into — you know , when the action slows to a halt a year after you become husband and wife . ” — Russ , 34

Security researchers have uncovered weaknesses in low - assurance digital certificates that create a means for miscreants to mount more convincing man - in - the - middle ( MITM ) attacks .
MITMs involve a hacker planting himself between two parties in a dialogue , relaying messages between them and effectively controlling the conversation .
The approach might be used , for example , to trick a user into handing over online banking login credentials in the mistaken belief that they are talking directly to a financial institution .
Normally untrusted certificates from an unknown issuer are used by fraudster sites in these kind of scenarios .
This would generate error messages or warnings that flag up possible problems , at least to the more internet - savvy .
These types of warnings disappear if miscreants add a legitimately - issued certificate into the mix .
You might think security credential firms would be wise to this kind of ruse and in most cases they probably are but security blogger Eddy Nigg discovered that he was able to get a low - assurance digital certificate for Mozilla.com .
The certificate was issued by a reseller of digital certificate firm Comodo .
Nigg was shocked that the approach was successful .
" Five minutes later I was in the possession of a legitimate certificate issued to mozilla.com - no questions asked - no verification checks done - no control validation - no subscriber agreement presented , nothing , " he writes .
" With the understanding about MITM attacks , the severity of this practice is obvious .
No encryption is worth anything if an attacker can implant himself between the client and the server .
With a completely legitimate and trusted certificate , the attack is perfect .
No warning and no error . "
Nigg got the idea of asking for a certificate in the name of Mozilla after obtaining another certificate from the same reseller in the name of his own firm , Startcom , in order to investigate a separate fraudulent reminder email problem .
Comodo revoked the offending certificate after Nigg posted his findings on the mozilla.dev.tech.crypto mailing list and in a blog posting , with screenshots , here .
An incident report on the issue has been filed with Mozilla .
In a statement , Comodo said that it had suspended the reseller involved in the incident as part of a wider investigation .
The certificates were obtained by a competing Certificate Authority ( “ CA ” ) attempting to demonstrate a perceived vulnerability in one of our Registration Agent ’s ( “ RA ” ) systems and procedures .
In this isolated incident the certificates were issued as a result of the RA ’s automatic DV mechanism being bypassed by an accident on their part .
Fortunately the CA did not intend to and did not use the certificates in a commercial setting .
As soon as Comodo discovered the error with the certificate , the certificate was revoked and the RA ’s account with Comodo was suspended eliminating any chance that the mistake could be repeated .
Comodo immediately launched an internal investigation to find the cause of the mis-issued certificate .
The mis-issued certificates are anomalies .
Comodo and its partners issue thousands of correctly validated certificates each month .
The RA ’s account will remain suspended until Comodo is satisfied that the certificates issued were the result of unintentional errors made by the RA and that any vulnerability in the RA ’s systems and procedures has been eliminated .
Possible shortcomings with low - assurance certificates are well known and are the reason vendors offer more expensive extended validation certificates , where checks on a users ' bona - fides are made .
That low - assurance certs might be issued without any checks whatsoever does however come as something of an eye opener .
Comodo said that it was pushing for minimum standards for domain validation ( DV ) certificates .
The problem illustrated in this unfortunate event highlights the vulnerability inherent with DV certificates .
All DV certificates are theoretically susceptible to this man in the middle ( MITM ) exploitation .
While the CAB Forum , which was founded by Comodo , has established guidelines for highly validated Extended Validation ( “ EV ” ) Certificates , no minimum standard has been adopted .
Earlier this month at the CAB Forum ’s most recent meeting , Comodo put forward a minimum standard for all SSL certificates which , if adopted , would eliminate this MITM attack .
DV certificates ' susceptibility to MITM attacks is well known .
Minimum standards are well overdue .

Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling gave a press conference early yesterday morning .
They look more like Laurel and Hardy every day - the know - it - all fat man and the nervier thin man .
The chancellor ought to have a silly hat and a smile both anxious and ingratiating .
I pictured them on the doorstep of a fine mansion .
The lady of the house plans to hire them to move her grand piano .
" Are you sure you are experienced at moving pianos ? "
" Why , yes , ma'am , very experienced . "
" Because this piano is a priceless heirloom . "
" You may be sure it will be safe in our hands , ma'am . "
The British piano might once have been a Steinway , but you know what happens next .
Most of all the two men looked tired , as if they had just arrived from Aberdeen on an all - night bus .
Gordon Brown more or less had , having got back from the Middle East in the small hours - no , the medium hours - of yesterday .
He had bags under his eyes .
Alistair Darling 's face was drawn and saggy .
He has aged 10 years in 18 months .
They gave the impression of men who are not even sure if they are awake .
Will this all turn out to be some terrible dream ?
Or is the reality proving worse than the original nightmare ?
As always , the prime minister tried to convince us that the problems were worse abroad .
And he was " angry " with the Royal Bank Of Scotland , whose management team could have spent 24 hours a day feeding £ 50 notes into a shredder without wasting a fraction of what they lost in toxic loans .
If you have an overdraft of £ 5 they 're down on you like a ton of bricks .
But if you want a couple of billion - hey , no problem !
" Yus , I am angry with RBS and what happened , " the prime minister told us .
But he did n't sound angry .
He sounded tired .
" We have got to realise that anger is not enough . "
He liked that line , so he said it again .
Rhetoric was not enough either , he said .
Glad he realises that .
Someone asked if the government had any idea how much money it might need to save the banks .
Was n't national bankruptcy a real possibility ?
He grew very tense .
Tired but tense .
" I utterly dispute what you are saying .
I would urge you to be very cautious in the remarks you make . "
If he had n't been so weary , it might have been a threat .
" Be careful , sonny .
I know where your editor lives . "
There was a brief flash of life when he welcomed the former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke back to David Cameron 's front bench lineup .
" He supports our policy on Europe and on VAT , and is probably quietly supportive on many other policies , " the prime minister said .
So he was n't too fatigued to stick in a party political skewer .
But in the distance we could hear splintering wood and the jangling clang of piano strings .
Intelligence officials say 100,000 troops will be taken from duties on Afghan border if India begins ' unwanted conflict '
Senior Pakistani intelligence officials have threatened to end military operations against Islamist militants along the country 's Afghan border if India deploys troops on their eastern frontier .
In a rare briefing to senior local journalists , intelligence officials said the coming days would be " crucial " and threatened to pull out all the troops committed to the " war on terror " in the event of " an unwanted conflict " with India .
" We will not leave a single troop on the western [ Afghan ] border if we are threatened by India , " an official was reported as saying .
Pakistan currently has more than 100,000 soldiers engaged in operations in the semi-autonomous tribal zones where senior international militants connected to al - Qaida , local extremists and a significant proportion of the Taliban 's leadership are thought to be based .
The Pakistani operations , largely funded by the United States , are seen by Nato commanders as vital to keep open supply lines to their troops in Afghanistan and to block , or at least hinder , movement by militants across the porous Afghan - Pakistan frontier .
" These statements are aimed at sending a clear message to the US to intervene to defuse the situation , and that if India wants to use these tragic events as a pretext for a border conflict then that will not be tolerated , " said Rasul Bakhsh Rais , professor of political science at Lahore University of Management Sciences .
" They are saying that if Pakistan has to choose between fighting India and fighting the militants , then it will fight India . "
There are fears of a breakdown of the recent peace process between the nuclear - capable countries .
After a bloody attack on India 's parliament by militants linked by New Delhi to Pakistan in 2001 , troops faced off across the Indian - Pakistan border throughout most of the following year with fierce artillery duels across the shared border of Kashmir .
Washington , concerned about the distraction from efforts to contain Islamist extremism in the region , brokered a peace deal and encouraged a subsequent thaw .
The two countries have fought three wars since achieving independence .
Pakistan 's government condemned the Mumbai assault as a " barbaric act of terrorism " and denied any involvement by any state institutions .
But the groups that have been named by India as having some responsibility for the attacks , the Pakistan - based
Lashkar - e- Taiba and Jaish - e- Muhammad , both have longstanding relationships with Pakistan 's security establishment .
Islamabad has also been forced to backtrack on a promise to send the chief of its main intelligence service , the military Inter - Service Intelligence ( ISI ) to India to help with the investigation .
Confusion over the dispatch of Lieutenant General Shuja Pasha to India , announced by Pakistan 's prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani last week , has revealed the tension between the military establishment and the civilian government in Pakistan , local analysts say .
A lower ranked official will now travel instead .
The mix - up has been blamed on " miscommunication " by Pakistan 's president , Asif Ali Zardari .
" The very fact that they wanted to send the head of the ISI shows how much the [ civilian government ] want to cooperate , " said Tariq Fatemi , a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington and Brussels .
" But the decision was taken without due recognition of the ground reality in Pakistan , that is to say without consultation with the military and other political players . "
Mohammad Sadiq , a spokesman for the Pakistani government , dismissed reports of tensions as " humbug " .
" Everything is very much in sync , " he said .
Pakistan is making efforts to rally international diplomatic support .
Yesterday its foreign minister , Shah Mehmood Qureshi spoke by telephone to his counterparts in China , Turkey and the United Arab Emirates as well as to the EU foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , Sadiq said .
Pakistani analysts and commentators have insisted that India has been too hasty to blame Islamabad for the attacks .
Many in Pakistan believe that New Delhi is using Pakistan as a scapegoat and are calling for an independent international commission of inquiry .
" There was a massive intelligence failure on the part of India , " said Rais .
" The Pakistani government does not want another conflict .
They have two insurgencies to deal with and enough other problems already . "
Pakistan 's long history of using militants to further foreign policy objectives , initially against Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan in the 1980s and then subsequently in Kashmir , means their current claims of innocence are greeted with scepticism .
In recent years Pakistan has tried to rein in groups such as Lashkar - e - Taiba , prime suspects for the Mumbai attack , or Jaish - e - Muhammad , blamed for the 2001 attack on the Indian parliament , but it is unclear how much effort has been made to control the extremists , nor if those efforts have been successful .
A Pakistani official yesterday suggested that one possibility was a " rogue " militant group , pointing out that the ISI itself had been bombed recently by extremists .
' State within a state '
Pakistan 's Directorate for Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , was founded in 1948 by a British army officer seconded to the fledgling country 's military forces after independence .
The agency became known for involvement in domestic politics , a trend accelerated by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto , father of Benazir Bhutto , who set up a political wing .
In the 90s , the ISI set up or encouraged a number of jihadi groups as irregular proxies fighting Indian troops in Kashmir .
Recent efforts to dismantle or downgrade these groups have proved ineffective , with Pakistan itself suffering regular bombings .
The ISI also aided the Taliban in the 90s and is alleged to have contacts with Afghan insurgents .
Though frequently called a " state within a state " , retired and serving officers insist the ISI is fully integrated into the military chain of command .
It is staffed by regular army officers as well as some contractors and civilians , and is the means by which Pakistan 's military projects its power internally and overseas .

New school text book encourages religious discrimination
Turkey ’s Ministry of Education has introduced a school text book which Christian Solidarity Worldwide says encourages discrimination of the country ’s small Christian community , despite growing international concern over increasing violence against non-Muslims in Turkey .
The book , Primary Education , History of Republic Reforms and Ataturkizm , Lesson Book 8 , is aimed at thirteen year olds and was published this year by Devlet [ State ] Books .
The controversial text describes missionary activity as a threat to national unity by destroying national and cultural values through converting people to another religion .
The text accuses missionaries of using natural disasters , such as earthquakes , to serve their own interests and warns children of the subversive aims of missionaries as well as tips on how to recognise their activities .
A spokesperson for the Alliance of Protestant Churches of Turkey said : " To the Turkish State and society , the words ‘ missionary activity ’ encapsulates not only the work of foreign missionaries , but all Christian activity in the country .
" The state and various groups have for years , through endless disinformation , spread the belief that Turkish Christians are part of a secret foreign plot to destroy Turkey .
" This is the same twisted mindset that has led to numerous attacks on our churches by young people who are convinced that we are CIA agents or similar . "
Local Christian communities form less than one per cent of Turkey ’s population of 70 million people .
Concerns are growing that the education system is further marginalising the indigenous Christian population .
The Turkish Government has used state - initiated campaigns to influence public opinion over Muslim apostates and Christian activities in Turkey since the year 2000 .
The authorities have informed security and military forces about missionary activities , sponsored and disseminated reports , conducted seminars , preached sermons in mosques , published sensationalist articles in the press and ordered state officials to speak publicly about the dangers posed .
In 2006 and 2007 there were a number of fatal attacks against Christians , including the grotesque murders in April 2007 of two Turkish Muslim - background Christians and one German missionary in Malatya .
Shortly after these murders , Niyazi Guney , from the Ministry of Justice , declared before the Justice Commission at the Turkish Grand National Assembly that missionary activities in Turkey were more dangerous than terrorist attacks and likened their activity with the end times of the Ottoman Empire .
CSW ’s Advocacy Director Alexa Papadouris said she was " deeply concerned " over the " destructive content " of the compulsory school text book .
" It is extremely distressing to see that the Turkish Government has not taken proactive steps to address increasing attacks on Christians , but instead continues to promulgate disinformation about the small Christian community , " she said .
" CSW calls on the European Union to urge the Turkish authorities to respect and promote religious freedom for all , at every level in Turkish society , particularly in the media and in educational material .
" Moreover , we call on the European Union to continue to address with Turkey the issue of violent attacks against religious minorities , seeking guarantees that the perpetrators of violence will be brought to justice through the courts in accordance with due process of law . ”

A recently laid - off tech employee Friday opened fire inside the Santa Clara office where he used to work , police said , killing three people , including the CEO and another top executive — and sparking a massive dragnet throughout the Bay Area .
Santa Clara police identified Jing Hua Wu , 47 , of Mountain View as the man who shot to death two men and one woman with a handgun before driving off in a silver sport-utility vehicle , believed to be a rented Mercury Mariner .
Wu remained at large late Friday , and police warned he should be considered armed and “ extremely dangerous . ”
Friday ’s violent scene erupted just before 4 p.m. , when police say Wu arrived at SiPort , a small semiconductor company at 3255 - 7 Scott Blvd . and opened fire .
Wu , an engineer , had apparently lost his job either Friday morning or Thursday , Santa Clara police Lt. Mike Sellers said .
When police arrived , the gunman already had escaped and was initially believed to be on his way to Mountain View , where police had staked out his home into the night .
Other reports indicated he may have been headed to an airport .
Late Tuesday , police identified the two men killed as Sid Agrawal , the company ’s chief executive , and Brian Pugh , vice president of operations for the company .
The identity of the third victim had not been released as of early today .
SiPort is a relatively small company that specializes in developing digital radio semiconductors .
It raised at least $ 20 million in venture capital last year .
Park Square , the complex that includes SiPort ’s offices , was in lockdown immediately after the shooting as more than two dozen police officers blanketed the sprawling facility and cordoned off the buildings near Octavius Drive .
Workers , meanwhile , huddled inside their offices as police with guns drawn cased the area .
Throughout the night , officers stopped and questioned employees in their vehicles as they left the complex .
And , hours later , employees in neighboring businesses were still shaken .
“ I was on the computer and a co-worker was going home , and we heard this commotion , ” said Linh Nguyen , a mechanical engineer who works next door at Excel Precision .
“ People were running inside our building , strangers , I did n’t know who they were .
They were very upset , they looked disturbed and then we that three people had been shot . ”
When Nguyen looked outside , he saw armed officers .
So Nguyen and others locked their doors and waited .
“ It ’s very unreal to me , ” said Nguyen , who added he did n’t know anyone who worked at SiPort .
“ With all these people being laid off , I mean , I know people are upset , but it ’s hard to imagine that anyone would do this . ”
Friday ’s deaths were the third , fourth and fifth homicides this year in a city not accustomed to such spasms of violence .
“ It ’s certainly a tragedy any time someone feels like this is an action they have to take , ” Santa Clara Police Chief Stephen Lodge said .
“ These are truly innocent people whose lives were taken .
It ’s just not right . ”
In his SiPort biography , Agrawal is described as having more than 25 years of experience at both startups and established tech companies .
He had held positions at Adobe Systems , Intel and Bell Labs , as well as at Alliance Semiconductor , Layer Five Networks and Synaptics .
Reached by a Mercury News reporter an hour after Friday ’s shooting , his wife said she had not yet heard from her husband , and was worried that he had n’t been picking up his cell phone .
Agrawal ’s family could not be reached later in the evening , after his identity was released .
Pugh also is listed on the SiPort biography as having 25 years of experience in semiconductor operations .
He attended the University of California - Berkeley and Stanford University and had previously worked at Samsung and IBM .
According to a national study on workplace violence , such crimes account for 20 percent of all violent crime .
Although most workplace violence is not fatal , an average of 500 homicides occur in U.S. workplaces each year .
Friday ’s homicide by a worker who may have been upset about losing his job appears to be the first reported in the South Bay since the economy began to turn sour .
Wu , in some news reports , was said to have a wife and two children .
He is described as 5 - foot - 11 and weighing 170 pounds , with black eyes and black hair .
The Mercury Mariner he is believed to be driving has a license plate of 6CJU602 .
People who encounter
Wu are urged to keep their distance and call Santa Clara police immediately at ( 408 ) 615-4700 .
If
Wu is in another city , witnesses should call 911 to reach that city ’s police department .

Weather Underground co-founder William Ayers , who made headlines last year during the U.S. presidential race for his controversial links to Barack Obama , was turned back at the Canadian border Sunday night .
The Weather Underground , a radical 1960s anti-Vietnam War group , was responsible for a number of bombings in the United States in the early 1970s .
Ayers , an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago , had been scheduled to speak last night at the Centre for Urban Schooling at the University of Toronto 's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education .
" I do n't know why I was turned back , " Ayers said in an interview yesterday from Chicago .
" I got off the plane like everyone else and I was asked to come over to the other side .
The border guards reviewed some stuff and said I was n't going to be allowed into Canada .
...
If it were me , I would have let me in .
I could n't possibly be a threat to Canada . "
The Ayers case could n't be discussed specifically , said Anna Pape , a spokesperson for the Canada Border Services Agency .
But she added that border officers can deny entry into Canada if an individual has been involved in such things as criminal activity , human rights violations or organized crime .
NDP Immigration critic Olivia Chow plans to write Immigration Minister Jason Kenney to get him to grant Ayers permission to return to Canada and give his lecture .
Kenney 's office referred questions on the case to Minister of Public Safety Peter Van Loan 's office .
No one from Van Loan 's office was available to comment late yesterday afternoon .
Ayers said he has been back and forth to Canada frequently in the past , attending speaking engagements in Ottawa , Toronto and Vancouver .
In fact , he said his passport is full of stamps of all the places he has travelled to , including several stamps from Canada .
This , however , is n't the first time Ayers has been refused entry into Canada .
In July 2005 he was supposed to give a lecture to teachers at the University of Calgary but was denied entry then .
Ayers rose to notoriety in the late 1960s with the Weather Underground , which claimed responsibility for bombings at the U.S. Capitol , a Pentagon rest room and New York City police headquarters .
In 1969 Ayers and others – known then as the Weathermen – were involved in Chicago protests known as the " Days of Rage . "
Ayers , one of a number of people charged by federal authorities , spent 10 years as a fugitive .
The charges against Ayers were eventually dropped in 1978 .
Ayers was back in the news in the summer when Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin suggested that then - Democratic presidential candidate Obama hung around with domestic terrorists like Ayers .
Ayers had hosted a meet - the - candidate coffee session at his home for Obama in 1995 during his run for the state senate .
They had also worked together on Chicago school reform and served on a charity board together .
Nowadays Ayers is praised for his work in educational reform .
Having written or edited more than a dozen books , he was named Chicago Citizen of the Year in 1997 and has advised Chicago 's Mayor Richard M. Daley on school reform .
Jeffrey Kugler , executive director of the Centre for Urban Schooling , is deeply disappointed in the turn of events .
" It 's kind of ironic the day before Barack Obama is going to become president , this is what the Canadian border security has done , " said Kugler , who believes Ayers was turned back because of a 1969 conviction after an anti-war demonstration .

The Zimbabwe dollar now seems to have lost all its appeal , and calls for the adoption of a foreign currency to replace the struggling monetary unit and put an end to the country 's crippling hyperinflation are becoming louder .
" We have to accept the economy has been ' dollarised ' and all companies should be registered to trade in hard currency , " Obert Sibanda , president of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce , told the state - run The Herald newspaper on 19 January .
Dollarisation , or the use of a foreign currency - not necessarily the US dollar - in parallel to , or instead of , the domestic currency , has long been a daily reality for most Zimbabweans .
Record - breaking inflation has made them reluctant to accept the local currency , preferring either to trade in a more stable currency , or to barter .
They could not get their hands on their Zimbabwe dollar savings and salaries even if they wanted to - banks have been limited by law to a ceiling on withdrawals that no longer covers the cost of a loaf of bread .
The US dollar and South African rand are in use across the country , while Botswana 's pula is favoured in Bulawayo and the west of the country , the Zambian Kwacha is used in the northern areas , and the Mozambican metical in Mutare and the country 's eastern regions .
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe ( RBZ ) had already endorsed semi-official dollarisation in September 2008 by introducing ' Foreign Exchange Licensed Warehouses and Shops ' when some 1,000 retail outlets and 250 wholesalers were permitted to trade in foreign currency .
In a statement released earlier in January 2009 , the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions ( ZCTU ) demanded that " all workers should be paid in foreign currency , given the fact that shops are now selling their goods in foreign currency - even those that have not been licensed to do so . "
The ZCTU was previously opposed to introducing foreign exchange as legal tender , but the reality on the ground has caused it to reconsider .
" Workers are even forced to pay rentals and fares in foreign currency ... public hospitals can now charge for their services in foreign currency , but the majority of workers who utilise these hospitals do not earn in foreign currency . "
Various reports in the local media this week noted that a draft economic recovery plan , purportedly issued by the RBZ , had said : " It is imperative that Zimbabwe informally adopts the rand alongside the Zimbabwe dollar " , in a bid to stem the rampant economic crisis .
However , RBZ governor Gideon Gono distanced himself from these reports by telling The Star newspaper , a South African daily published in Johannesburg : " The Zimbabwean dollar will not be overtaken by any other currency , formally or otherwise , now or at any point in the future . "
Stop printing money
Zimbabwe 's out - of - control hyperinflation has become the symbol of its unprecedented economic decline , and most people simply treat the two local currencies ( original and " revalued " ) as beyond salvation .
Prices double every 24.7 hours ...
Shops have simply stopped accepting Zimbabwean dollars .
The monthly inflation rate passed the 50 percent mark - the threshold for defining ' hyperinflation '- in March 2007 ; in January 2009 the RBZ issued the world 's first 100 trillion dollar note .
" Since then , it 's gotten much worse , " said Steve Hanke , professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , in the US , and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute , a Washington - based think - tank .
The latest official RBZ figure , dating back to July 2008 , put year - on - year inflation at more than 231 million percent .
In the absence of credible official statistics , Hanke developed a hyperinflation index for Zimbabwe and in an article in the December 2008 issue of the financial magazine , Forbes Asia , put the annual inflation rate at around 6.5 quindecillion novemdecillion percent - 65 followed by 107 zeros .
" Prices double every 24.7 hours , " he noted .
" Shops have simply stopped accepting Zimbabwean dollars .
" A report released by the Cato Institute in June 2008 - Zimbabwe , From Hyperinflation to Growth - said the RBZ 's money machine was the source of the hyperinflation .
" The government spends , and the RBZ finances the spending by printing money .
The RBZ has no ability , in practice , to resist the government 's demands for cash ...
To stop hyperinflation , Zimbabwe needs to immediately adopt a different monetary system , " the report said .
The RBZ sees itself in a different light , as evidenced by its strategic vision : " to become the financial cornerstone around which Zimbabwe 's economic fortunes and developmental aspirations are anchored ... the pursuit of the Bank 's vision will express itself through leadership in the formulation , implementation and monitoring of policies and action plans for fighting inflation , stabilisation of the internal and external value of Zimbabwe 's currency and of the financial system in a manner that gives pride of achievement to Zimbabweans across the board .
" Most economists agree that ditching Zimbabwe 's discredited currency would help pave the way to recovery .
" This is an idea we have been suggesting for years .
We need to tie up the Zimbabwe dollar with a stronger currency , " Zimbabwean economic analyst John Robertson told IRIN .
" We need the confidence in the South African rand to help us out of economic problems .
" According to Dawie Roodt , a government finance expert in South Africa , the benefits to Zimbabwe would be considerable : " First of all , they would be importing the South African inflation rate .
The Zimbabwe inflation problem is purely a Zimbabwe dollar issue , so over time the inflation rate would be equal to the inflation rate in South Africa .
" This would mean the adoption of real interest rates , allowing banks to resume lending - essential to kick - start the country 's ailing industrial sector .
The notion of adopting the rand is not new to the region : the Common Monetary Area ( CMA ) of the rand fixes relative values of the currencies of neighbouring Namibia , Lesotho and Swaziland to the South African unit .
But Roodt cautioned that there was also a downside : " The most obvious [ drawback ] of using another currency is that you lose control of monetary policy , " and Zimbabwe would also be adopting South Africa 's monetary framework .
The legal tender could also become an issue of sovereignty and national pride , which , he commented , were sensitive matters .
" You do n't have the president 's picture on the currency .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
The chairwoman of a Chinese dairy company went on trial on Wednesday over a tainted milk scandal that has killed at least six children and made thousands ill .
Tian Wenhua , 66 - year - old former general manager of the now bankrupt Sanlu Group , pleaded guilty to charges of “ producing and selling fake or substandard products , ” state - run Xinhua news agency said .
Tian appeared with three other company executives at a court in Shijiazhuang , capital of northern Hebei province .
It was unclear whether they could face the death penalty .
“ ( Tian ) may face a maximum penalty of death for producing and selling contaminated baby milk food , along with three of her senior managers at the Shijiazhuang Intermediate People ’s Court , ” the official China Daily said on Wednesday .
But the Xinhua report said the maximum sentence for the charges was life imprisonment .
Executives at Sanlu , partly owned by New Zealand ’s Fonterra group , failed to report cases of Chinese children developing kidney stones and other complications from drinking milk adulterated with melamine for months before the scandal broke in September .
Melamine , an industrial compound used in making plastic chairs , countertops , plates , flame retardants and even concrete , has been added to food to cheat nutrition tests due to its high nitrogen content .
Another 17 people involved in producing , selling , buying and adding melamine in raw milk have gone on trial in the last week .
At least six children have died and more than 290,000 made ill from the contaminated milk , battering already dented faith in China - made products and prompting massive recalls around the world .

Tian told the court on Wednesday she learned about the tainted milk complaints from consumers in mid-May , Xinhua quoted her as saying .
The company set up a working team led by Tian to handle the case , but did not submit a written report about the milk powder to the Shijiazhuang city government until August 2 , Tian said .
The Shijiazhuang government did not report the case to higher government authorities until a month later , prompting speculation authorities sought to avoid a scandal upsetting Beijing ’s Olympic Games in August .
STIFF SENTENCES LIKELY
China , seeking to restore battered credibility in its food , drugs and products , is likely to pass stiff sentences if the four are convicted .
Zheng Xiaoyu , former head of the food and drug watchdog , the State Food and Drug Administration , was executed last year for taking bribes and dereliction of duty in the wake of a series of drug safety scandals .
In the lead - up to the high - profile trial and after repeated promises that China has put a lid on the problem , fresh quality scares have surfaced .
The melamine scare has also prompted quality inspectors to test tableware “ following reports that some products contained poisonous ingredients , ” Xinhua said on Wednesday in a separate report .
More than 1,500 boxes of Chinese biscuits exported to Hong Kong and Singapore had also tested positive for melamine , local media reported on Tuesday .
China ’s Health Ministry on Wednesday promised to build a “ pre-emptive ” monitoring system to stamp out the use of black - listed non -food additives that have led to health scares involving eggs , seafoods , and sweets in recent years .
“ We used to rely on crackdowns ( to solve food problems ) ... but now we are combining punishment with prevention with more stress on the latter , ” Su Zhi , a senior quality supervision official in the Ministry of Health , told Xinhua .
But the baby milk formula scandal has also opened up a festering debate about appropriate compensation for victims and their families .
Along with Sanlu , 21 other local dairy companies that were found to have produced melamine - tainted milk have pledged 1.1 billion yuan ( $ 161 million ) to compensate victims and cover medical costs for affected children , a report posted on the Dairy Association of China website ( www.dac.com.cn) said .
Some 900 million yuan would be paid in cash compensation to victims , and the rest placed in a fund for medical treatment , the report said .
But terms , which include a 2,000 yuan ( $ 293 ) one - off payment for victims with “ mild symptoms , ” have been greeted with skepticism .
“ I ’ll never accept that amount , ” Wu Yanfang , a mother whose 16 - month - old girl still has a stone in her kidney , told the China Daily .
Mr Calderon has deployed thousands of soldiers to fight the drug cartels
Mexican authorities have accused an officer in the presidential guard of being a spy for a drug cartel .
Army Maj Arturo Gonzalez Rodriguez has been placed under house arrest for 40 days while he is investigated .
He is accused of selling information about President Felipe Calderon 's movements to the Beltran Leyva cartel for payments of up to $ 100,000 .
Mr Calderon has deployed thousands of troops and police against the cartels in an increasingly bloody war .
An official in Mr Calderon 's office said Maj Gonzalez was not part of the elite army detachment providing close protection to the president , Associated Press news agency reported .
Maj Gonzalez was detained as part of " Operation Cleanup " , in which more than a dozen high - ranking police and government officials have been arrested on similar charges of collaborating with drug cartels .
Nearly 5,400 people have been murdered in drugs - related violence this year and Mexico 's top prosecutor has said that the violence is likely to worsen in 2009 as drug gangs split and fight for turf .
Last week , the decapitated bodies of eight soldiers were found in a town near Acapulco .
Their heads were discovered stuffed into plastic bags outside a shopping centre .
Bush on the invasion of Iraq leading to al - Qaeda presence : ' So what ? '

In an interview with a reporter following a shoe being thrown at his head , President George W. Bush had a snippy answer for the fact that al Qaeda did n't take a stand in Iraq until he invaded : " So what ? "
Bush spoke with ABC's Martha Raddatz following the shoe incident in Baghdad , which reportedly left White House spokesperson Dana Perino injured during the melee that ensued as the Iraqi journalist who threw the shoe was being subdued .
During the interview , Bush says his legacy will " take time , " but includes No Child Left Behind and " 52 months of uninterrupted job growth , " then speaks about his role in " protecting " America after 9/11 .
He mentions that al Qaeda has turned out to be a problem in Iraq .
Raddatz points out that al Qaeda did n't choose to make Iraq a base to fight from until after the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
Bush 's response ?
" Yeah , that 's right .
So what ? "
" Surely your legacy will be largely about this war , " Raddatz says .
" Talk to me about how that feels being here . "
" There have been no attacks since I have been president , since 9/11 , " he replies .
" One of the major theats against al Qaeda turns out to have been Iraq .
This is where al Qaeda said they were going to take their stand .
This is where al Qaeda was hoping to take ... "
" But not until after the U.S. invaded , " Raddatz interrupts .
" Yeah , that 's right , " Bush says .
" So what ?
The point is that al Qaeda said they 're going to take a stand . "
Bush also told Raddatz that he was n't insulted by the Iraqi journalist who hurled shoes at him .
" I thought it was interesting , I thought it was unusual to have a guy throw his show at you .
But I 'm not insulted .
I do n't hold it against the government .
I do n't think the Iraqi press corps as a whole is terrible .
And so , the guy wanted to get on TV and he did .
I do n't know what his beef is .
But whatever it is I 'm sure somebody will hear it . "

Home prices down in 90 % of Bay Area ZIP codes
Home prices in 90 % of the Bay Area have fallen - declines often are by double - digit percentages , and upper - end neighborhoods are not immune
Realtor Pam Cole hangs a sign in front of a house about to hit the market at $ 495,000 in Livermore , Calif. , on Thursday , Nov. 6 , 2008 .
Home prices per square foot in Livermore 's 94550 ZIP code , where this three - bedroom , two - bath property is located , are down 17 percent compared to last year which represents the midpoint of price changes in the Bay Area .

It 's bad all over .
Home prices have declined in more than 90 percent of Bay Area ZIP codes over the past year , often by more than double digits , according to a Chronicle analysis .
And even the handful of ZIP codes where prices rose barely eked out single - digit increases for the most part .
" Prices are off virtually everywhere , " said Andrew LePage , an analyst with MDA DataQuick , a San Diego research firm , which provided sales information culled from county records .
The analysis compared price per square foot paid for existing single - family homes during the three months ended Oct. 15 to the price paid in the same period last year .
This metric was picked rather than median home prices , because the median can be skewed by the number of homes that change hands at the high or low ends of the market .
" The vast majority of Bay Area neighborhoods , even along the coast , have seen prices come down 10 to 20 percent from peak levels , and in many cases from year - ago levels , " LePage said .
" There are ( a few ) pockets of relative strength in higher - end areas , but they are not pockets of immunity .
They are not shielded from the forces pushing down home prices across the Bay Area and the state . "
Those forces are well known : the implosion of subprime mortgages that triggered a foreclosure onslaught ; the credit freeze that has made getting a mortgage harder and more expensive ; the vicious circle that declining home prices trigger more foreclosures and that foreclosures force down prices ; and the economic crisis that is causing people to lose jobs and retirement savings .
More than 70 percent of Bay Area ZIPs saw prices fall by more than 10 percent - often by considerably more than that .
The mid-range price decline on a per-square - foot basis around the nine counties was 17 percent .
" No ZIP code is an island , " said Christopher Thornberg , a principal with Beacon Economics in Los Angeles .
" These markets are linked .
Of course the chaos on one end is going to affect somewhere else . "
Randall Kostick , general manager of Zephyr Real Estate , one of the largest brokerages in San Francisco , agreed .
" There is no housing market that is immune from economic forces , " he said .
To be sure , because real estate is intensely local , there is significant variation among the levels of depreciation , even within the same city .
For instance , Oakland had some of the best - and worst - performing ZIP codes in the Bay Area .
Rockridge 's 94618 , where the square - foot price rose 7.5 percent ( from $ 531 to $ 571 ) , was one of only nine ZIP codes in positive territory .
But in the city 's flatlands , the story was entirely different .
ZIP 94621 was the second worst in the whole Bay Area , down 63.7 percent to $ 118 a square foot , compared to $ 325 a year ago .
Not surprisingly , the areas where prices fell the furthest had the most homes that had been repossessed by banks .
Price per square foot fell most drastically - by ranges up to 70 percent - in foreclosure - heavy suburbs and exurbs such as Richmond , Antioch , Vallejo , San Pablo , East Palo Alto and parts of Oakland .
There 's an obvious reason for the correlation :
Banks want to hurry up and sell repossessed homes , so they offer them at fire - sale prices .
Richmond 's 94801 ZIP , which includes the notorious Iron Triangle , had the steepest price plunge , a 68.8 percent drop from $ 311 per square foot to $ 97 .
The median price fell roughly in sync , down 72.2 percent from $ 403,000 to $ 112,000 .
In the first nine months of the year , a stunning 7 percent of all homes in the ZIP were foreclosed upon .
But it is noteworthy that even areas that are relatively immune to foreclosures experienced price drops .
Take the East Bay's Albany , known for its small - town ambience , good school system and Solano Avenue 's mile - long array of restaurants and shops .
Banks repossessed just seven homes in the first nine months of this year , or .014 percent of the housing stock .
But prices there were down 9.9 percent from $ 580 per square foot to $ 522 .
Of 189 ZIPs where at least 20 homes were sold in the time period , only nine , or 4.7 percent , saw prices increase in the period .
Even after factoring in ZIPs where fewer homes traded hands does n't make a big change .
In all 236 ZIPs , just 24 , or 10 percent , experienced price appreciation .
All the ZIPs where prices rose were in affluent areas .
The ones that were excluded for too few sales were in such places as Sea Ranch , Ross and Atherton , where just a handful of homes were sold .
" I think it 's incredibly impressive for any ZIP to be up at all , " LePage said .
One of the few standouts was the 94114 ZIP in San Francisco , home of Noe Valley , where houses go for well over a million dollars , designer strollers clog the sidewalks , posh shops peddle handmade ethnic tchotchkes , and the Google bus regularly cruises the streets .
But even that ZIP did n't enjoy the double - digit appreciation that became de rigueur during the real estate boom .
Instead Noe Valley prices were up 6.8 percent year over year , from $ 893 a square foot to $ 954 .
Thornberg said the drops are a natural consequence of prices getting grossly overinflated during the real estate bubble .
" Home prices in California have to fall 40 percent to 45 percent just to get back to its historic levels of unaffordability , " he said .
" If it 's 45 percent overall , for the upper - price areas , that might mean a 25 percent to 30 percent drop ; for the lower - priced areas , 60 percent to 65 percent . "

94114 Noe Valley 's housing market is a rarity - prices are up , and Adam Woollerson is happy to have paid 5 % over the asking Adam Woollerson and Lindsay Clark went house - hunting in Noe Valley four years ago and then again this summer .
It was a whole different ballgame this time around .
" Back then , on one property we bid 40 percent over asking ; we were one of 28 bids , and we were ninth on the list , " said Woollerson , a project manager at Levi Strauss .
Now there are fewer rivals who are ready , willing and able to bid on homes that go for a median price of $ 954 a square foot , up 6.8 percent from last year .
( The sales median was $ 1.32 million . )
This time , Woollerson and Clark , a value recovery manager for Goodwill , found a two - story Edwardian with parking and knew right away it was the house for them .
As one of three offers , they ended up buying the house for $ 1,525,000 , 5 percent over the asking price .
Their experience shows that Noe Valley , one of only a handful of ZIPs where prices on a per-square - foot basis rose year over year , still has sufficient cachet to bring in multiple offers .
But it 's still nothing like the go - go days .
" Any property that has any abnormalities or anything unusual is just a really hard sell , whereas before people would have said , ' That 's all right , we can fix it , ' " said Duncan Wheeler at Zephyr Real Estate , who was the couple 's Realtor .
" If there is one thing wrong with these houses , they sit for a really long time . "

There are signs Livermore 's housing market is getting healthier , but Phil Fleming has to sell now to pay for his father 's care
When he was in college in 1959 , Phil Fleming worked one summer for a construction crew building a house in Livermore for his dad , also named Phil .
Now the elder Fleming , 92 , a retired engineer from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , has had to move to a nursing home .
Phil Fleming , who lives in Colorado , is putting the home on the market this week for $ 495,000 to help pay for his father 's care , which costs about $ 7,500 a month .
Does he feel trepidation about selling in the current market ?
" I think I would be really dumb not to , " Fleming said .
" We have to take the hand that is dealt us .
This is not the opportune time , but it happens to fall at the time that Dad needs the nursing care . "
The three - bedroom , two - bath rancher is listed at $ 495,000 , in line with the current median sales price for Livermore 's 94550 ZIP code .
Prices there have fallen 16.9 percent compared to last year , which puts it squarely in the mid-range of Bay Area price changes .
Fleming has spent the past month having a slew of work done to make the home more appealing to buyers : fresh paint , new landscaping , new carpets - repairing all the little things .
There are some signs that the Livermore market is getting healthier .
Fleming 's agent , Pam Cole of Re / Mac Accord , noted that there are 218 homes now on the market , 80 fewer than a year ago .
" It 's all about supply and demand ; if we have fewer homes ( for sale ) , that 's very good , " she said .
Within the 94550 ZIP , 73 for - sale homes , about one third of the total , are short sales ( being sold for less than is owed on the mortgage ) or bank - owned foreclosures .
Such homes tend to drive down prices for everyone .

94806 Housing values in this San Pablo and Richmond ZIP code are in the cellar , but Vicki Barthell hangs tough on her asking price Vicki Barthell has had her home on the market since mid-2006 , shortly after her husband died .
" I want to get out from under the big house payment , get the load off my back and get into a mobile home , " said Barthell , 67 , who had to go back to work as a call center operator despite battling ovarian cancer .
A couple of years ago , the three - bedroom , two - bath house with a separate cottage was appraised at $ 600,000 and that 's what Barthell started off asking .
Now the price is $ 512,500 .
That 's high for the 94806 ZIP , which comprises all of San Pablo and a bit of Richmond , where Barthell lives .
The median sales price there is $ 221,750 .
The per-square - foot price has fallen 40.7 percent since last year .
Has Barthell considered cutting the price to bring it more in line with the area ?
" I 'm standing firm , " she said .
" I 'm not going to give it away .
It 's more than the average house for this area : I have a big backyard , landscaped with a gazebo ; I have a huge entertainment patio ; my husband did everything custom in the house . "
Barthell is competing with some extremely motivated sellers - the banks that own half of all the homes for sale in her ZIP code , and the borrowers who are desperate to unload their homes as short sales ( selling for less than is owed on the mortgage ) .
Out of 396 homes currently for sale in the 94806 ZIP , only 49 - 12.4 percent - are regular owner sales , according to Carylon Dopp , a Realtor with Security Pacific Real Estate who works in the area .
Half of the homes for sale are bank - owned foreclosures ; slightly more than a third are short sales Barthell 's Realtor , Gary Torreta of Security Pacific Real Estate , said there have been no offers in the 14 months he has been the listing agent .
" If they 're not in line price - wise , even with a nice property , it 's a daunting task , to say the least , " he said .
" If this were bank - owned , they would have this property on the market for $ 300,000 to $ 350,000 . "
But Barthell does n't want to hear that .
" It will sell because people are taking the flyers , " she said .
" As soon as this economy turns around , I know it will sell . "

Parachutes recovered from sea after the launch of space shuttle Endeavour on the STS - 126 mission are seen suspended from a hanging monorail system at the Parachute Refurbishment Facility at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
The parachutes are used to slow the descent of the solid rocket boosters that were jettisoned during liftoff .
The monorail will transport each parachute into a 30,000 - gallon washer and a huge dryer heated with 140 - degree air at 13,000 cubic feet per minute .
One pilot , one drogue and three main canopies per booster slow the boosterâs fall from about 360 mph to 50 mph .
After the chutes are cleaned and repaired , they must be carefully re-packed into their bags so they will deploy correctly the next time they are used .

Oh man this goes down into the annals of corruption :
Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois was arrested by federal authorities on Tuesday morning on corruption charges , including an allegation that he conspired to effectively sell President - elect Barack Obama 's seat in the United States Senate to the highest bidder .
Mr. Blagojevich , a Democrat , called his sole authority to name Mr. Obama 's successor " golden , " and he sought to parlay it into a job as an ambassador or secretary of Health and Human Services , or a high - paying position at a nonprofit or an organization connected to labor unions , prosecutors said .
He also suggested , they said , that in exchange for the Senate appointment , his wife could be placed on corporate boards where she might earn as much as $ 150,000 a year , and he tried to gain promises of money for his campaign fund .
If Mr. Blagojevich could not secure a deal to his liking , prosecutors said , he was willing to appoint himself .
Incredible .
Blagojevich was already under investigation .
And then he tries to sell Obama 's Senate seat ?
I do n't think I 've ever seen anything like this .
This dude tried to auction the Senate seat of the President - Elect of the United States .
Wow .
They have n't even invented a machine that can calculate the Fail Factor here .
I do believe we have gone to Interstellar Fail .
Intergalactic , perhaps .
The Smithsonian Institution hasÂ always beenÂ considered one of most prestigious museums in the world .
Â
It houses some amazing works Â including the “ Portraits of America ’s Presidents . ”
So , Â what ’s a more fitting way to kick off the inauguration weekend than with the Smithsonian ’s National Portrait Gallery unveiling and inducting Shepard Fairey ’s symbolic “ Hope ” image of Barack Obama .
( previously announced here . )
AM was invited to come along all - accessÂ and document the historic unveiling ceremony .
The elegant brunch reception in the Smithsonian courtyard preceded the unveiling as Shepard mingled with the “ who ’s who ” that were in town for Inauguration week .
Â
From members of congress , to senators , to CEOs , everyone crowded around Shepard to express their excitement and their gratitude for his work on the campaign .
Read more and see all the pics after the jump !
It was a moving moment as the museum unveiled the image that inspired a nation of voters .
Afterwards , the media swarmed around the Shepard and Amanda Fairey as fans lined up to have their pictures taken with the stunning portrait of the soon - to - be President .
As the reception came to a close , the museum handlers whisked away the portrait to it ’s next destination : the “ New Arrivals ” wall .
This was where Shepard “ greeted ” by a full team of security … fortunately for Mr. Fairey , he was wearing a suit . =)
Thanks to the generosity of art collectors Heather and Tony Podesta ( in honor of Tony Podestaâ€™s mother , the late Mary K. Podesta ) , the “ Hope ” image will now be a part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian for future generations to experience .
Martin Irvine of the Irvine Contemporary was credited for dedicating the timeÂ and effort to make this possible .
With a retrospective of Faireyâ€™s work opening on February 6 at the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art , ( Do n’t worry , we ’re covering it ) and works already represented in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London , this historic induction into the SmithsonianÂ further cements Shepard Fairey ’s place in art history .
AgainÂ weÂ congratulate Shepard Fairey for this tremendous achievement !
LED Lighting Could Be a Botox Replacement
November 6th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Few people will argue that LED lights are particularly attractive , but they may just be able to make you more attractive .
German researchers reported last month that people who received several weeks of treatment under LED lights experienced a lessening of skin wrinkles similar to what is seen with Botox treatments .
The researchers ’ study points out that LED lights penetrate the skin and cause changes in sub-surface tissue by changing the molecular makeup of a layer of water on elastin ( the protein that provides elasticity in skin ) .
So in addition to being an energy - efficient form of lighting , we can now also refer to LED lights as a safe alternative to rat poison injections .

Memorize these facts :
With them you can find any two - digit cube root .
For example , what ’s the cube root of 12,167 ?
1. Express the number in six digits ( 012167 ) .
Take the first three digits ( 012 ) and compare them to the blue cubes above .
Find the largest cube that ’s less than your three - digit string , and write down its root .
Here , 012 is between 8 and 27 , so we write down 2 .
2 . Match the last digit of the number ( 7 ) to the last digit of a blue cube above ( here , 27 ) .
Write down the root of that number ( 3 ) .
That ’s it .
Put the two digits together ( 23 ) and that ’s your root : 233 = 12,167 .
This works for any perfect cube between 1,000 and 1 million .
“ Yes , a long time .
I ’ve seen GM do a lot of things .
Water pumps – massive failure in the late 60’s and early 70’s .
Broken motor mounts – when they failed the throttle would go wide open … a fun ride .
Implementation of emission controls – the plugging of the vacuum lines to the EGR valves .
IMHO this is where everything started going bad .
GM cars began to have more driveability problems than ever before .
Worse , problems became harder to diagnosis .
We sold a lot of cars during the 70’s ; some good , some not so good .
The Chevy Vega was the worst .
Then came the X cars and we lost all direction .
About 1982 , I was talking to a GM rep .
He said they expected a 30 percent major failure rate in that model year .
I said , “ You mean , if I have 1000 cars , 300 will need an engine or transmission ? ”
He said yes , and I believed him .
They knew they had huge quality problems , but viewed them as a cost of doing business .
There were terrible rust problems , worse on pickup trucks .
Try and find an 83 on the road .
Good luck .
We had four cylinders ( 2.5 ) engine failure at lifter gallery : head gasket failures .
231 V6 : timing chain failure .
And I will never forget the GM V8 and V6 diesel engines– and not in a good way .
The V8 required an overhaul about every 18 to 24 months .
Big money rigs would stick together .
The V6 had more head problems than anything .
Did you know if a shop rag is left on top of the piston of a V6 diesel and the engine fired up it looks like it is snowing inside the shop ?
True story .
Let ’s not forget the GM metric thm 200 ; this underpowered transmission “ powered ” the Grand National .
On the positive side , we had the bulletproof thm 400 ( 3sp ) auto .
Great trans !
The thm 350 was also very reliable .
I did love the Buick Grand National and the GMC Typhoon .
I ’m not going to say they were reliable , but wow !
Were they fassssssssssst .
Then came the mid-80’s .
Talk about losing your way !
We had transmissions that would not shift ; when you take them apart , you could n’t find any viable failure .
The reps told of being in restaurants wearing the GM lapel pin and asked if they worked for General Motors .
They ’d respond that they worked for General Mills .
This was the time of the [ Pontiac ] Fiero .
I considered it a modern - day Corvair ; it leaked everywhere and would catch fire and GM did not know why .
The mid-80 ’s brought in electronic repair orders and the storing of repair histories .
Most of the time , you still [ to this day ] had to keep a paper file on hand .
The 80’s also brought the famous “ customer satisfaction index , ” on which we are all rated and live and die by .
They ’ve revised it from time to time , but they always ask the wrong questions or make it too long or too confusing .
And GM sends them all back to the dealer .
I ’m not sure if all they do with them is tabulate the score ; I do n’t think anyone at GM reads them .
They want the dealer to handle everything .
I ’ve worked in dealers with a poor score and ones with a very high score .
It ’s very hard to satisfy a customer that was stuffed into the car and ca n’t afford it or we ca n’t fix it … something that happened a lot during the 80’s .
Not so much any more do we hear “ the car is commercially acceptable ” or “ GM is aware of the problem and engineering is working on a fix ”
The came the 90’s , and paint would blow off of your GM carwhile driving down the road .
GMC had trucks that ran on natural gas ; we could not fix them .
Who can forget the 700r4 transmission ?
They lost the sun shell and then would n’t move .
No reverse .
Nothing .
These days , we have some very good and reliable vehicles .
We still fix cars , but we do n’t have the major failures that we had in the past .
I feel that GM has a future– if we can get past this problem they are facing .
How to do it ?
I do n’t know .
And through all these years , one thing has remained constant : we still work on leaks , squeaks and rattles .
These three complaints have remained consistent .
I ’ve always worked for GM dealers .
I ’ve never owned any other vehicles but GM .
I ’ve driven many types of other cars and see things on them that show up on GM cars about 5 years later .
GM is always a day late and a dollar short .
This business has been good to me .
I am not rich but have gotten by .
Do I think they should be bailed out ?
I ’ve pondered this for weeks .
My job depends on GM being viable .
Part of me says help them out .
But part of me says the marketplace must find it ’s own level .
I still do n’t know .
I do know no one from Congress or GM has asked me . ”
TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
It ’s a smashing sort of therapy for the stressed : a Japanese entrepreneur is offering those strained by the financial crisis a chance to vent by hurling crockery against a wall , and then paying for it .
In a corner of Tokyo ’s bustling electronic gadget shopping district , a group of chiropractors , led by Katsuya Hara , dish out plate - smashing therapy from a truck named “ The Venting Place . ”
And the cost depends on how much you need to destroy -- small cups can be smashed for 200 yen ( $ 2 ) each , while bigger dishes go for 1,000 yen ( $ 11 ) .
“ To break something , as all of us know from experience , is something extremely exhilarating and it helps bring down pent - up anger , ” Hara said , adding that the majority of his customers are professionals stressed out due to work and the financial crisis .
“ We hope to become the new way businessmen and women relieve their stress , ” Hara said .
Stressed - out customers don protective gear , choose the crockery they want to smash and then hurl it at concrete slabs set up inside the truck .
“ Life is pretty complicated and there are a lot of things to worry about right now so this was refreshing .
I now feel like I can start afresh again tomorrow , ” said Masaki Ogawara , a 35 - year - old salesman who flung tableware -- along with expletives -- inside the vehicle .
IT consultant Shigeo Sasaki , who also vented his anger at some crockery , said the dish - therapy was a great antidote to the strains of work .
“ It ’s recession here and recession there .
All everyone talks about is the recession .
I was feeling pent up stress and looking for a way to release some of that when I had the good fortune to come across this place , ” Sasaki told Reuters .
But for those who are worried that they are creating waste by smashing crockery , Hara says do n’t stress .
All the shards of the broken tableware are recycled to make more cups and plates , which are destined to be used for more anti-stress therapy .

The government will soon launch nano computers for Rs500 only , for students .
Human resources development minister Arjun Singh will launch a prototype of the specially designed portable computers in Tirupati on February 3 , and they will be in the market in six months .
Though technology for the computers has been developed by the Indian Institute of Science ( IISc ) , Bangalore , and Indian Institute of Technology ( IIT ) , Chennai , they will be manufactured in collaboration with private firms .
“ A lot of testing is being done to ensure the technology works properly .
The computer can be an ideal gift for children , ” said higher education secretary RP Aggarwal .
While one may see it as an poll gimmick to woo young voters , going by the time of launch , the ministry of human resource development said the computer is India ’s answer to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’s $ 100 laptop .
Robert Gibbs will be named the White House press secretary , a top Democratic official said .
Exclusive : Gibbs will be WH press secretary
Robert Gibbs , a top aide to Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) on his campaign and in his Senate office , will be named the White House press secretary , a top Democratic official said .
Gibbs was usually the senior official on Air Obama , the campaign plane .
As communications director of Obama 's Senate office , Gibbs was a key strategist in Obama 's rapid move to the national stage .

Transition planning is still at an early stage and the job has not been formally offered or accepted , officials said .
The announcement is likely to be viewed favorably by reporters because Gibbs has unquestioned authority , access and institutional memory .
Gibbs — a 37 - year - old native of Auburn , Ala . — became familiar to viewers during the campaign for his sunny steeliness during frequent appearances on morning shows and A - list cable news programs .
From his July promotion announcement : “ Robert Gibbs , one of Senator Obama ’s longest - serving and closest aides , has been elevated to Senior Strategist for Communications and Message , taking on a broader strategic portfolio for the Fall campaign while continuing to serve as senior communications aide travelling with Senator Obama . ”
The " podium job " makes the White House press secretary instantly famous around the world as the face and voice of Washington .
Surrounded by barbwire fencing , the anonymous yet massive building on West Military Drive near San Antonio ’s Loop 410 freeway looms mysteriously with no identifying signs of any kind .
Surveillance is tight , with security cameras surrounding the under - construction building .
Readers are advised not to take any photos unless you care to be detained for at least a 45 - minute interrogation by the National Security Agency , as this reporter was .
There ’s a strangely blurry line during such an interrogation .
After viewing the five photos I ’d taken of the NSA ’s new Texas Cryptology Center , the NSA officer asked if I would delete them .
When I asked if he was ordering me to do so , he said no ; he was asking as a personal favor .
I declined and was eventually released .
America ’s top spy agency has taken over the former Sony microchip plant and is transforming it into a new data - mining headquarters — oddly positioned directly across the street from a 24 - hour Walmart — where billions of electronic communications will be sifted in the agency ’s mission to identify terrorist threats .
“ No longer able to store all the intercepted phone calls and e-mail in its secret city , the agency has now built a new data warehouse in San Antonio , Texas , ” writes author James Bamford in the Shadow Factory , his third book about the NSA .
“ Costing , with renovations , upwards of $ 130 million , the 470,000 - square - foot facility will be almost the size of the Alamodome .
Considering how much data can now be squeezed onto a small flash drive , the new NSA building may eventually be able to hold all the information in the world . ”
Bamford ’s book focuses on the NSA ’s transformation since 9/11 , with the impetus for the new facility being a direct ramification of those attacks .
At the time , the NSA had only about 7 percent of its facilities outside the Washington D.C. / Baltimore area .
But the realization that additional attacks could virtually wipe out the agency catalyzed a regional expansion .
` See “ Secret Agency Man , ” November 5 , 2008 .
`
The new facility is a potential boon to the local economy since it ’s reportedly going to employ around 1,500 people , but questions remain about whether there will be adequate oversight to prevent civil - rights violations like Uncle Sam ’s recent notorious warrantless wiretapping program .
The NSA would suggest the facility ’s ability to sort through surveillance data is one of America ’s top defenses against terrorist threats , but the NSA ’s presence comes with concerns that abuse of its secretive power could see the agency become akin to the “ Thought Police ” of 1984 , George Orwell ’s classic novel depicting the nightmare of a total surveillance society — and all for nothing .
Even as the facility is completed , a new government - backed report has concluded that data surveillance is an ineffective method for identifying potential terrorists or preventing attacks .
So just what will be going on inside the NSA ’s new San Antonio facility ?
Bamford describes former NSA Director Mike Hayden ’s goals for the data - mining center as knowing “ exactly what Americans were doing day by day , hour by hour , and second by second .
He wanted to know where they shopped , what they bought , what movies they saw , what books they read , the toll booths they went through , the plane tickets they purchased , the hotels they stayed in …
In other words , Total Information Awareness , the same Orwellian concept that John Poindexter had tried to develop while working for the Pentagon ’s ` Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency` . ”
Bamford details how Hayden , now head of the CIA , had originally leaned toward being overprotective of civil rights , not wanting to see the NSA revisit the scandal - ridden era of the 1970s and the violations of “ Project Shamrock . ”
But 9/11 altered Hayden ’s philosophical direction 180 degrees .
The Total Information Awareness project supposedly died when the plan was exposed , Poindexter resigned , and Congress cut off further funding .
But Bamford and others have reported that the project simply migrated to the NSA , “ an agency with a far better track record than DARPA for keeping secrets . ”
The NSA remembers the Alamo
The NSA was waffling on selection of a home for its new facility when the City of San Antonio sent a mission to NSA headquarters in January 2007 to lobby for it , part of a continuing effort to woo the agency .
On January 18 , Microsoft announced its selection of San Antonio for a new data center .
The NSA followed suit three months later .
Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff was part of the effort to entice the NSA to choose San Antonio .
He says talks centered on economic factors and what the city could do to facilitate the NSA ’s plans .
“ They ’re pretty tight on what they do ; they do n’t share that information with you , ” says Wolff .
“ I hope that the administration will be addressing `civil - rights violations` , and I hope they ’re correcting those concerns . ”
Bamford writes about how NSA and Microsoft had both been eyeing San Antonio for years because it has the cheapest electricity in Texas , and the state has its own power grid , making it less vulnerable to power outages on the national grid .
He notes that it seemed the NSA wanted assurance Microsoft would be here , too , before making a final commitment , due to the advantages of “ having their miners virtually next door to the mother lode of data centers . ”
The new NSA facility is just a few miles from Microsoft ’s data center of the same size .
Bamford says that under current law , NSA could gain access to Microsoft ’s stored data without even a warrant , but merely a fiber - optic cable .
“ What the Microsoft people will have will be just storage of a lot of the email that is being sent .
They keep this email — I do n’t know why — and there should be some legislation saying how long it should be kept , ” said Bamford in a phone interview last week .
“ The post office does n’t keep copies of our letters when we mail letters ; why should the telecom companies or the internet providers keep copies of our email ?
It does n’t make sense to me .
But there ’s no legislation .
So they need a place to store it , and that ’s where they ’re storing all this stuff . ”
( Microsoft did not return a call for comment before press deadline . )
The new NSA facility boosts the agency ’s already formidable presence in South Texas , where they have 2,000 employees on the Medina Annex of the Lackland Air Force Base — mostly Signals Intelligence , or Sigint , specialists , who use cutting - edge technology to intercept anything from faxes to emails and satellite communications .
NSA ’s new facility also gives the agency easy access to UTSA ’s Institute for Cyber Security and the school ’s Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security .
The ICS was founded in 2007 with a $ 3.5 - million grant from the Texas Emerging Technology Fund to continue efforts to protect American communities against cyber- attacks , with the CIAS — a think tank launched in 2001 — being rolled into the ICS .
All of this led U.S. Representative Ciro Rodriguez ( D - San Antonio ) to declare San Antonio “ the center of cybersecurity , in the country and the world . ”
ICS Founding Executive Director Ravi Sandhu acknowledges some synergy between the NSA presence in San Antonio and UTSA ’s cybersecurity work .
“ Cybersecurity in the public domain has largely been about defense , but there ’s certainly an attack component to it .
To some degree , the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence agencies are now starting to talk about the attack component in the public domain , ” says Sandhu .
Sandhu says UTSA ’s cybersecurity students are recruited by many of San Antonio ’s local employers and does n’t doubt that NSA is one of them .
“ Recruiting is one end … but it ’s an attractive thing for NSA employees `too` .
They can further their education — they can do degrees part - time , they can do advanced degrees … so there are advantages beyond direct recruitment of NSA students . ”
Does automated data mining even work ?
While the opening of the NSA ’s massive new data center heightens existing civil - rights concerns , a new report from the National Research Council questions whether such data - mining is even effective .
Sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security and the National Science Foundation and released in October of this year , the report suggests that pattern - based data - mining is not even a viable way to identify terrorists .
The 352 - page study — “ Protecting Individual Privacy in the Struggle Against Terrorists ” — concludes that identification of terrorists through automated data - mining “ is neither feasible as an objective nor desirable as a goal of technology development efforts . ”
It also says inevitable false positives will result in “ ordinary , law - abiding citizens and businesses ” being erroneously flagged as suspects .
“ Actions such as arrest , search , or denial of rights should never be taken solely on the basis of an automated data - mining result , ” says the report .
The question , then , is how rigorously will human analysts vet such information before alleged leads are pursued , and who has oversight of the process ?
“ Part of the problem is … jurisdiction over national - security issues is very divided in Congress .
You have the Homeland Security committee , the Justice committee , but , of course , you also have some basic issues — government oversight , appropriations , ” says Professor Fred Cate , the NRC committee member who wrote most of the report and who serves as director of Indiana University ’s Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research .
“ So I think in some ways one of the issues is the need for a more streamlined oversight system so that somebody takes responsibility for it . ”
Cate says the migration of the TIA project to the NSA is part of the problem .
“ Because so many different agencies are involved and because there are no consistent oversight mechanisms , it ’s very hard `to monitor` .
And Congress created a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board , and then it did n’t like the way it created it initially , so then it recreated it with more powers , but it never confirmed any members to it , ” says Cate .
“ So for the past year , there ’s been nobody in that critical position .
So I think one immediate step for Congress and the new president will be to nominate members and get them confirmed . ”
The lack of clearly delineated oversight remains a vital yet unsolved issue .
Senator Jay Rockefeller ( D - W.Virginia ) , Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , would appear to be the Congressman with the most power to pursue such oversight .
“ Eisenhower warned of the military - industrial complex , but now it ’s mostly the security , industrial complex ; it ’s these people that build all the hardware and software for Homeland Security and Intelligence and all that , ” says Bamford .
“ As far as I can see , nobody has a handle on how many contractors are out there , what they ’re doing , how much money ’s going to them , how much is useful , how much is wasted money . ”
Cate says the NRC committee is not necessarily opposed to data - mining in principal , but is concerned about how it ’s carried out .
“ The question is can you do it and make it work so that you do n’t intrude unnecessarily into privacy and so that you reach reliable conclusions . ”
Bamford writes in the Shadow Factory of how the NSA ’s Georgia listening post has eavesdropped on Americans during the Iraq War , including journalists , without a warrant or any indication of terrorism .
He also reports on NSA eavesdropping on undecided members of the United Nations Security Council in the run-up to the vote on the Iraq War resolution , with the Bush regime seeking information with which to twist the arms of voting countries .
The spying was only revealed due to British Parliament whistleblower Claire Short , who admitted she ’d read secret transcripts of UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan ’s confidential conversations .
“ The UN people have been aware of `NSA eavesdropping` for a long time , but there ’s not much they can do about it , ” says Bamford .
A common response to concerns about data surveillance is that those who keep their noses clean have nothing to worry about .
But the reach of the NSA ’s surveillance net combined with lack of oversight and the political paranoia escalated by the 9/11 attacks means that almost anyone could wind up on the terrorist watch list .
“ The principal end product of all that data and all that processing is a list of names — the watch list — of people , both American and foreign , thought to pose a danger to the country , ” writes Bamford .
“ Once containing just twenty names , today it is made up of an astonishing half a million — and it grows rapidly every day .
Most on the list are neither terrorists nor a danger to the country , and many are there simply by mistake . ”
Bamford reports that consequences of being on the list could include having an application for a Small Business Administration loan turned down ; having a child ’s application to one of the military academies rejected ; or , because the names are shared with foreign governments , being turned away after landing in Europe for a vacation or business trip .
All without ever being told why .
A senior intelligence official concerned about the situation told Bamford “ the system is a disaster , ” adding that the list at the National Counterterrorism Center is n’t even compatible with the NSA and CIA systems .
“ They could be snooping on just about anything right now and not be accountable and be able to hold their hands up and go , ‘ Our system does n’t track that , ’ when in many cases the system does , but the code is so convoluted you could never know it , ” says the official .
Bamford also reports on Uncle Sam ’s skyrocketing use of “ national security letters ” for obtaining personal information .
The NSLs , which do not require probable cause or court approval , jumped from 8,500 in 2000 to 143,074 between 2003 and 2005 , according to a 2007 Justice Department inspector general ’s report .
Under the revised version of the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act , it ’s not only a crime for any company to refuse to cooperate , it ’s also become a crime for company officials to even disclose their cooperation .
“ There was a lot of pressure by the FBI in ’ 94 to have CALEA enacted … but the Clinton Administration was in favor of doing all that , ” says Bamford .
The question for us then becomes who , if anyone , is watching the watchdogs ?
One organization devoted to such duty is the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a San Francisco - based non-profit whose mission is to protect electronic civil liberties .
Reducing the use of NSLs to gag and acquire data from online service providers is one of the planks in EFF ’s proposed privacy agenda for the new Obama administration .
“ The issue here is that when people are gagged , you ca n’t talk about it and `people` do n’t know what kind of abuses there are , ” says EFF media - relations coordinator Rebecca Jeschke .
The EFF privacy agenda also includes repealing or repairing the FISA Amendments Act , reforming the Electronic Communications Privacy Act , and reform of the State Secrets Privilege , the latter which has been used by the Bush regime to shield its electronic surveillance activity from judicial review .
The EFF filed a lawsuit against the NSA in September on behalf of AT&T customers who were victims of warrantless wiretapping , with defendants including President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and NSA Director Keith Alexander .
The EFF also filed suit against AT&T — until this summer headquartered in San Antonio , the telecom giant still maintains a sizable presence here — for participating in the illegal surveillance program , and is challenging the FISA Amendments
Act passed by Congress in July — which gave retroactive immunity to the telecom companies — as being unconstitutional .
“ Where I disagreed was the immunity to telecommunications entities … and that ’s why I could n’t support something that provided for the immunity provision , ” says U.S. Representative Charlie Gonzalez ( D - San Antonio ) of the FISA Amendments Act .
“ We had something that we thought in the House was good , and then the Senate did their own thing .
But I was never happy with the inclusion of the blanket - immunity provision to telecommunications entities , because I thought it relieved them of a responsibility and duty that they owe as corporate citizens . ”
Gonzalez added that he thinks “ there ’s still tremendous shortcomings in the law when it comes to making sure that you do n’t have abuses of the authority of eavesdropping . ”
The Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington , D.C. , a public interest research group whose mission is similar to EFF ’s , is suing the Department of Justice for access to documents authored by government lawyers regarding President Bush ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
These opinions , prepared by the Office of Legal Counsel , provided the legal rationale for Uncle Sam to wiretap American citizens in the United States without court approval .
On October 31 , a federal judge ordered the DOJ to provide for independent judicial inspection of documents relating to the program .
The latest news in Uncle Sam ’s ongoing surveillance scandal happens to come from the FBI ’s involvement with the NSA .
The Washington Times reported in November that Supervisory Special Agent Bassem Youssef , who oversees the FBI ’s role in the NSA ’s warrantless surveillance program , says the FBI engaged in unlawful acts while carrying out that surveillance .
Youssef , who now fears career retaliation for stepping up as a whisteblower , is due to testify with the Justice Department .
Whether or not the new Obama administration will enact any demonstrable change in the personnel and policies that created the civil - rights violations of recent years remains a question mark .
“ Everything I ’ve seen so far with Obama has not been focused on change .
It ’s been focused on bringing back the old Clinton Administration or continuing the same , ” says Bamford , noting the President - elect ’s decisions to nominate Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State and keep Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense .
Bamford mentions Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold as someone he feels would fight for greater accountability .
“ That ’s a person I would like to see rewarded for making the right decision , instead of people being rewarded for making the wrong decisions , ” says Bamford of Feingold ’s record in voting against the revised FISA Amendments
Act and being the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act .
Bamford ends
The Shadow Factory by quoting Senator Frank Church , the first chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , during the original hearings on the NSA in the 1970s .
“ If a dictator ever took charge in this country , the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny , and there would be no way to fight back , because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government , no matter how privately it was done , is within the reach of the government to know .
Such is the capability of this technology , ” said Church more than three decades ago .
That technology now sees its latest evolution occurring at the shadowy building on San Antonio ’s West Military Drive . •
One of the core tenets of Mormon faith is that the dead can be baptized into the faith after their passing .
Baptism of the dead evolved from the beliefs that baptism is necessary for salvation and that the family unit can continue to exist together beyond mortal life if all members are baptized .
Mormons trace their family trees to find the names of ancestors who died without learning about the restored Mormon Gospel so that these relatives from past generations can be baptized by proxy in the temple .
For Latter - day Saints , genealogy is a way to save more souls and strengthen the eternal family unit .
Original records -- about 2.4 million rolls of microfilm containing 2 billion names that have been traced -- are locked away behind 14 - ton doors in the Granite Mountain Records Vault , a climate - controlled repository designed to survive a nuclear impact that is built into the Wasatch mountain range , about 20 miles southeast of Salt Lake City .
The practice has not been without controversy , however .
In the mid-1990s , there was a backlash when it was uncovered that the names of about 380,000 Jewish Holocaust victims had been submitted for posthumous baptism by what church historian Marlin Jensen calls " well - intentioned , sometimes slightly overzealous members . "
In 1995 , the church agreed to remove the names of all Holocaust victims and survivors from its archives and to stop baptizing Jews unless they were direct ancestors of a Mormon or unless they had the permission of all the person 's living relatives .
However , Jewish names have periodically been discovered since the 1995 agreement , including that of Holocaust survivor and Jewish human rights activist Simon Wiesenthal , which was found and removed in 2006 .
Catholics and members of other faiths have also been upset at the practice .
Despite the controversies , the Mormon archives are a boon to professional and amateur genealogists .
Copies of the original microfilms are freely available at the Family History Library in Salt Lake City , which is the main repository , and they can be ordered at smaller regional Family History Centers .
The records include vital records ( birth , death and marriage certificates ) , wills and probate records , land records , town or county records , church records and more .
Much of the information is online at FamilySearch.org , which has several types of databases :
The International Genealogical Index ( IGI ) consists of two kinds of information : primary records typically gathered by Mormon missionaries and transcribed and indexed by Mormon and non-Mormon volunteers ; and copies of ordinances provided by members of the church .
The Ancestral File has more than 35 million names organized into families and pedigrees .
The information is not sourced , though typically you can find the name and address of the person who submitted the information so you can contact the submitter for further information .
The Ancestral File stopped taking submissions in 2003 ; new submissions are added to the Pedigree Resource File .
Anyone can submit information to the Pedigree Resource File ; like the Ancestral File , the submitter 's name is indicated .
The church created an index for every person counted in the 1880 U.S. census , the 1881 Canadian census and the 1881 British census .
These records are freely available online , and images can be accessed at the Family History Library or a Family History Center .
Other records online through FamilySearch.org include the Social Security Death Index , which has the names of deceased individuals who had a Social Security card and whose death was reported to the Social Security Administration after 1962 ( when the database began ) ; and the Vital Records Index , which has birth , death , christening and marriage records for select localities in Mexico and Scandinavia .
In 2001 , the LDS Church collaborated with the Ellis Island Foundation to build the American Family Immigration History Center and the Ellis Island Web site , which has the names of 22 million passengers and crew members who arrived in New York through Ellis Island between 1882 and 1924 .
And in 2002 , the LDS Church began an ambitious plan to scan and put online all of the billions of records in the Granite Mountain Vault , with volunteers creating indices to the records .
Because of technological advances , a project once estimated to take 120 years may be finished in the next 10 years .
A 61 - year - old woman from Exmouth in Devon changed her name to Saxon Knight to mark her retirement .
Mrs Knight , formerly Janice Glover , said : " To me retirement is the start of a new life so I decided I would get a new name too .
I chose Saxon because I love the UK .
In a stunning turn of events , the US music industry has ceased its long - time litigation strategy of suing individual P2P file - swappers .
Instead , with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo acting as a broker , the RIAA has signed voluntary " graduated response " agreements with major Internet service providers .
Those currently on the receiving end of an RIAA lawsuit , though , will have to see it through to the ( very ) bitter end .
The Wall Street Journal ( subscription ) broke the story , and Ars has confirmed all details given in the piece .
Europe - style graduated responses
While the agreement itself comes as a surprise after years of lawsuits that have numbered in the tens of thousands , the contours of the deal remain comfortably familiar .
Europe is leading the way in hashing out graduated response programs , and the RIAA plan sounds like a mix of the current British and French approaches to the issues .
As in Britain , the deal is voluntary , has no official government enforcement , and will not have ISPs passing user information on to the RIAA .
Instead , the RIAA notifies ISPs about suspected infringement using IP addresses ; the ISP then privately looks up its subscriber information and forwards a notice telling the person to stop .
But , as in France , penalties are coming ( the voluntary UK scheme is currently " notification only " ) .
They remain undefined at the moment , though the RIAA confirms to Ars that they will include account suspension for users who continue to share files illegally .
The key difference between Europe and the US is the lack of government pressure .
New York Attorney General Cuomo did make it clear to the music industry that the lawsuits have been unhelpful and that he hoped to see a different approach , but nothing like the government pressure to cut a deal that we have seen in the UK or France has been mooted here .
Which leads to the obvious question : what do ISPs get out of the deal ?
They are n't under any serious pressure to act on this if they do n't believe it to be in the interests of their companies or subscribers , but the RIAA makes clear that several leading ISPs are already on board .
But they do get a tremendous goodie bag under the Christmas tree : congestion relief .
ISPs have been worried about P2P traffic , especially on access networks ( and especially on upstream access networks in cable systems ) , but the " net neutrality " debate and the Comcast P2P case at the FCC have limited the options that American ISPs can take .
The solution many appeared to settle on was nondiscriminatory bandwidth capping ; that is , do whatever you want with your connection , use any protocol or application , but you only get a certain amount of monthly capacity .
Suddenly , ISPs gain a tremendous new tool .
One study in the UK showed that most people sharing music would stop when made aware that their activity was being tracked and that they were not , in fact , anonymous .
Should that hold true in the US , ISPs would presumably see massive decreases in P2P traffic .
The customer notifications can be blasted out by e-mail , making the whole process quick and easy for ISPs .
As is usual for these sorts of schemes , questions still remain about what sorts of judicial processes will be in place to contest notifications and penalties , and what happens to a household Internet connection when Dad finds his access canceled even though he 's never shared a file in his life ?
The end of lawsuits
For now , though , the graduated response program will have one immediate effect .
The file - sharing lawsuits will largely come to a halt , though the RIAA tells us it reserves the right to go after people who continue to ignore the notifications .
That means colleges and universities no longer have to worry about " pre-litigation notices " and a stream of subpoenas seeking student info , dead grandmothers and kids in housing projects wo n't be hit up for $ 4,000 settlements , and an unbelievably brutal public relations disaster will basically come to an end .
As for current cases , tough luck ; the RIAA intends to see them through .
But what about Jammie Thomas , the single mother in Minnesota who found herself the most public face of the RIAA litigation campaign after the first full trial for illicit file - swapping ?
Thomas ' trial is actually over , and the judge has vacated the original decision .
The RIAA is seeking to have that original verdict restored , but if that fails , the RIAA will have to prosecute Thomas all over again in order to squeeze any cash out of the handful of songs she was accused of sharing .
Would they do it ?
An RIAA spokesperson tells us , " If the appeal is granted and an appeals court agrees with the jury in the original trial , she 'll continue to be held liable . "
Reading between the lines , we might expect the case to go away if that original verdict is not reinstated .
A step in a better direction
News about the entire program will be controversial , but we think it 's a big step in a better direction .
The lawsuit campaign largely ends .
Initial notifications about file - swapping will be purely informative , not punitive .
The move does not introduce ISP filtering ( notifications are generated by the RIAA ) , and neither does it pass user information from ISPs back to the music industry .
It should eventually remove most of the reasons ISPs have trotted out to defend discriminatory traffic shaping .
The Interwebs may get a bit faster .
Interesting new music services that the RIAA has recently allowed , like Last.fm and the Amazon DRM - free music store , mean that more legal choices are available as a " carrot " to complement the new " stick . "
The real question here is twofold .
First , how will file - swappers respond ?
No doubt plenty will dig in , encrypt everything , switch to obscure protocols , or start using direct download services .
A pretty tremendous percentage of casual users , though , will curtail their activity after receiving their first notice , especially once the ISP sanctions are finalized .
Second , how will other industries respond ?
Music is traded freely on the Internet , but in terms of volume , video content is the real target .
The movie business will want in on the arrangement .
After that , e-book vendors might demand ISP assistance , and so will the makers of crochet patterns ( which turn out to be traded surprisingly often online without permission ) .
So long as two conditions are met , though — no ISP has to do any filtering , and a workable judicial process is in place to oversee the complaints and handle appeals — even widespread use of the program by many industries might not turn out to be a big deal , either for users or ISPs .
Industry would police the ' Net , turn over the information , not get user information in return , and be accountable to some sort of oversight / appeals body .
It could be a lot worse .
Plenty of " ifs " are involved in the new project , and there are plenty of unanswered questions .
But the deal certainly sounds better than what preceded it , and not just " better " in the sense that it 's better not to stab yourself in the hand than to stab yourself .
Combined with the music industry 's recent moves toward voluntary blanket license models , it 's at least possible that the long - running Cold War between music fans and the major labels will undergo some global warming of its own .
Now , who do we talk to about putting out some better music ?

The pair , aged in their 20s , are recovering in the Thursday Island Hospital , off the tip of the Cape York Peninsula , the Seven Network reported .
The men , dehydrated and exhausted , were spotted on Saturday by a routine border patrol and were soon plucked from the ocean by an Emergency Management Queensland helicopter flown by pilot Terry Gadenne .
" When we winched down the rescue crewman into the water , the guy in the esky leapt out , " Mr Gadenne told Seven .
" He was desperately keen to get on and pulled him ( the rescuer ) down into the water , so he was pretty keen to get away from the ocean .
" When they got up ( into the helicopter ) they skolled two litres of water each within seconds . "
The men said 18 other people were on board a 10 - metre wooden fishing vessel when the boat sank , Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokeswoman Tracey Jiggins said .
" They said when it sank they all went into the water and they did n't have any floatation device , " she said .
" It 's remarkable that they survived , and that they were spotted by Coastwatch who were on a routine flight over the Torres Strait .
" Given that they have been in the water 25 days , our Rescue Coordination Centre Australia has made an assessment that they would not be able to survive for that period of time without any form of a flotation device , " she said .
Ms Jiggins did not know what food the pair had or what they did while inside the ice box .
News
Ltd reported the men survived by drinking rain water that gathered at the bottom of the box and by eating pieces of fish that were also in the container .
The pair could not say exactly where the boat sank , Ms Jiggins said .
Immigration officials have been sent to Thursday Island to investigate whether the boat was being used for fishing or a people - smuggling operation , Seven said .
A spokeswoman for the Thursday Island Hospital told AAP she could not discuss the medical condition of the men .
In July last year three Australian men spent 15 hours clinging to an esky after their boat sunk off the central Queensland coast .
The trio sang songs and kept each other awake during the ordeal , while one of the men plugged a hole in the bottom of the esky with his finger because the men were afraid bait could leak out and attract sharks .
AAP and Arjun Ramachandran
Blassius Hanczuch , a friend of Jambor , said the doctor later blamed himself for saving Hitler 's life .
He said : " In 1916 they had their hardest fight in the Battle of the Somme .
For several hours , Johan and his friends picked up injured soldiers .
He remembers Hitler .
They called him the ' Screamer ' .
He was very noisy .
Hitler was screaming ' help , help ' .
You want to make Christians look bad ?
Ask them to explain what happened to a person like Mahatma Gandhi — a kind , non-violent , respected , revolutionary , non-Christian man — after he died .
Honest Evangelical Christians will tell you what they believe :
He ’s currently rotting in hell .
Atheists and Jews and gay people will suffer the same fate , too — unless they convert .
( And since these Christians “ love ” you , they ’ll do whatever it takes to “ save ” you from the misery . )
It does n’t make them very popular , of course , but if accepting Jesus ’ divinity is the only path to heaven , then those who do n’t believe in it have to suffer forever …
Right ?
That seems downright cruel and unusual for anyone with a decent moral sense … and yet , it ’s supposed to be a cornerstone principle for Bible - believing Christians .
So why are the results of a recent survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life so different from that idea ?
Charles M. Blow writes about the survey in today ’s edition of The New York Times .
Blow says that , according to this survey :
Sixty - five percent of respondents said … that other religions could lead to eternal life …
Pew asked them to specify which religions .
The respondents essentially said all of them .
And they did n’t stop there .
Nearly half also thought that atheists could go to heaven — dragged there kicking and screaming , no doubt — and most thought that people with no religious faith also could go .
Did respondents not understand the question ?
It seems like they did .
Perhaps other factors played a role :
As Alan Segal , a professor of religion at Barnard College told me : “ We are a multicultural society , and people expect this American life to continue the same way in heaven . ”
He explained that in our society , we meet so many good people of different faiths that it ’s hard for us to imagine God letting them go to hell .
In fact , in the most recent survey , Pew asked people what they thought determined whether a person would achieve eternal life .
Nearly as many Christians said you could achieve eternal life by just being a good person as said that you had to believe in Jesus .
If you read the article , you may be as shocked as me when you see the percentage of Christians who said “ living life in accordance with the Bible ” is what it would take to achieve eternal life .
I thought the number would be substantially higher .
A more visual breakdown of the Pew Forum ’s survey is below :
It seems like many religious Americans actually find value in a basic Humanist principle : being good for goodness ’ sake .
They ’d rather judge people based on their actions , not their dogma .
I ’m glad to hear it .
( CNN ) --
The mother of a woman who gave birth on Monday to octuplets said her daughter already has six children at home and was undergoing fertility treatment .
Dr. Karen Maples is part of the large team of doctors and nurses that helped deliver the octuplets .
The Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday that Angela Suleman said her daughter had the embryos implanted last year , resulting in the eight births .
" They all happened to take , " Suleman told the Times .
" I looked at those babies .
They are so tiny and so beautiful . "
The woman declined to have the number of embryos reduced when she discovered she was carrying multiples , the Times reported .
The six older siblings range from ages 7 to 2 , according to the newspaper .
Suleman said she was concerned about her daughter 's homecoming because her husband , a contract worker , is due to return to Iraq .
In the meantime , the mother , who remains unidentified , appealed for privacy while she recovers from giving birth , medical officials said Thursday .
In her written statement delivered by Dr. Karen Maples of the Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center in California , the woman who delivered eight babies in five minutes said she would soon make public the details of her " miraculous experience . "
" We understand that you are all curious about the arrival of the octuplets , and we appreciate your respect for our family 's privacy , " she said .
" The babies continue to grow strong every day and make good progress .
My family and I are ecstatic about all of their arrivals . "
" Needless to say , the eighth was a surprise to us all , but a blessing as well , " she added .
The six boys and two girls -- ranging in weight from 1 pound , 8 ounces to 3 pounds , 4 ounces -- are doing well following their Caesarean - section delivery at the Bellflower hospital , doctors said .
They were born nine weeks premature .
Dr. Mandhir Gupta , a neonatalist , said all but one of the octuplets are now breathing on their own .
That baby might be taken off breathing equipment Friday .
Caring for eight premature babies is a challenge .
Duties are being shared by a large team of hospital nurses and doctors for the time being .
Two nurses have been assigned to each child , and all the babies are receiving fluids , proteins and vitamins intravenously , Gupta said .
" We feed them .
...
We change diapers .
...
When they cry , we console them , " Gupta said .
" When the mom comes and touches the babies , you can definitely see their expression on their faces and body .
They are very happy . "
The babies , who are being referred to by letters of the alphabet , will remain in the hospital for at least seven more weeks .
Baby H made headlines for its surprise appearance during the delivery , which took months of preparation by a team of doctors , nurses and respiratory therapists .
Watch a report on babies ' progress »
The mother will not be able to hold her babies for another week , Gupta said .
They are still fragile , developing intestines , he said .
Doctors initially thought the mother was pregnant with seven fetuses .
She was hospitalized seven weeks ago and ordered to bed rest .
During the seven weeks , a team of 46 physicians , nurses and other staff members prepared for the births .
When they started the delivery Monday , they were in for a surprise .
" After the seventh baby was born , we were taking a sigh of relief , " Maples said .
" It was a surprise of our life when we in fact discovered there was an eighth baby , " she said .
" We never had an assignment for baby H nurse or baby H doctor .
We just had to go on the fly and figure out what to do . "
" Baby G nurse stepped up .
We handed off the baby to baby G nurse .
She then delivered that last baby to the neonatologist of the baby F . "
" It was all wonderful because of the teamwork and the training we did before , " Maples said .

According to several respected economists , the economy is close to complete melt down .
Paul Krugman writes :
1 . The economy is falling fast .
We 'll see what tomorrow 's employment
report says , but we could well be losing jobs at a rate of 450,000 or
500,000 a month .
2. Infrastructure spending will take time to get going -- a new
Goldman
Sachs report suggests that projects that are " shovel - ready " are
probably only a few tens of billions worth , and that a larger effort
would take much of a year to get going .
Meanwhile , it 's very
questionable how much effect tax rebates will have on consumer demand .
So it may be hard for stimulus to get much traction until late 2009 --
and that 's even if Congress goes along , which may be a problem given
all the bad analysis and disinformation out there .

So here 's what I 'm wondering : will it , in fact , even be possible to
pull the economy out of its nosedive before unemployment goes into
double digits ?
I 'm starting to wonder .
Former Treasury secretary and Alcoa chairman Paul O'Neill is even more pessimistic .
Here 's what he said in a recent interview :
If the United States does n't get its finances in order , the coming
years will make the current recession " look like a child 's birthday
party , " said former Treasury secretary and Alcoa chairman Paul O'Neill .

" We 're headed for the wall at lightning speed .
And every day that we
do n't deal with that set of problems is another day closer to
absolutely vaporizing our economy , " he said .
" Not to overstate the problem . "
Nouriel Roubini , professor of economics at the Stern School of Business , New York University warns of the horrors of stagflation :
In the next few months , the flow of macroeconomic and earnings news
will be much worse than expected .
The credit crunch will get worse ,
with de­leveraging continuing as hedge funds and other leveraged
players are forced to sell assets into illiquid and distressed markets ,
leading to further cascading falls in prices , other insolvent financial
institutions going bust and a few emerging market economies entering a
full - blown financial crisis .
The worst is not behind us : 2009 will be a painful year of a global
recession , deflation and bankruptcies .
Only very aggressive and
co-ordinated policy actions will ensure the global economy recovers in
2010 rather than facing protracted stagnation and deflation .
Check out our interview with Noam Chomsky for his take on the economic crisis .

Does anyone else think it is time to boot Bush out of office early ?

The cave drawings accompanying Gideon Rachman ’s article entitled ‘ And now for a world government ’ clearly illustrate a widespread misconception .
It also demonstrates the cunning of one world - propagandists in the crafting of their arguments .
We are shown typical Palaeolithic artistry : horses , warriors , deer and , portrayed on the very same rocky surface , a globe .
It is almost admirable were it not so deviously cunning , to bundle within a single image the primitive with the ‘ modern ’ and by doing this , considering the latter as the logical conclusion of the former .
Rachman explains :
‘ For the first time since homo sapiens began to doodle on cave walls , there is an argument , an opportunity and a means to make serious steps towards a world government . ’
This statement may be considered as the basic assumption out of which a lot of these globalists ’ musings emanate .
Point of departure is always the human journey , that once upon a time began with cave - scribbling tribes scattered aimlessly on the planet surface , in the course of time crystallizing into sophisticated city - states , in turn evolving into nation - states - and finally , approaching present - day , culminating into one world - state , eclipsing all of the above .
It sounds logical , treacherously logical .
As we take a closer look at this line of reasoning however , we immediately encounter difficulties .
The logic as it turns out , is not so logical after all - and besides , without long term historical precedent .
History is certainly littered with tyrants and their attempts to bring about overarching supranational states .
And without exception , their enterprises eventually failed , forcing freedom loving people throughout history to build firewalls against tyranny , at the same time compelling the elite to refocus their eyes on more modest ambitions .
After the Roman Empire had collapsed , other , smaller kingdoms emerged out of its ruins , who in turn left no method unused to enslave their populations .
This goes for the Greeks , the Babylonians , and almost every other system with imperial designs .
The Egyptian kingdom , once a vast and powerful culture , grew to be just a shadow of its former self at the beginning of our calendar .
Charlemagne established the great Frankish empire only to unwittingly lay the groundwork for the establishing of sovereign states , like Germany and France .
We have only to study history in order to counter the mythology of a gradual evolution towards a one world system .
There is no evidence supporting an historic , chronological pattern of progression from the small to the great .
More often than not it is the other way around , for excessive power tends to provoke resistance .
There is however a great deal of evidence in support of an elite , propagandising some sort of natural calling of nations to outgrow its borders in order to melt into a larger international system .
It is the tyrant ’s argument .
And it has hideous , dangerous lumps growing all over it .
Not only is globalism being presented as something unavoidable , as a force of nature that is beyond anyone ’s ability to resist , it is also being portrayed as beneficial to the world .
Are we to overcome our ‘ global difficulties ’ we must give up our hard - fought freedoms and surrender them to the world state that , after all , is looking out for our best interests .
The cave drawings in Rachman ’s publication do not so much reflect reality , as they represent very effectively the elite ’s view of reality .
This view is not the only falsehood looming on the horizon .
Every tyrant or tyrannical system has used certain pretexts to destroy liberty and crush dissent , deeming all means justified to accomplish its stated goals .
It was either the threat by an outside force - a spectre haunting the woods around the village - or some natural disaster the gods had in store for us if we did not increase our offerings .
It is no different in our time , where the spectre manifests itself as a bearded boogieman and the impending doom comes in the form of anthropogenic global warming .
Who knows , the expected unfreeze may expose Osama Bin Laden out of his cryonic suspension in the process .
The insincerity of the arguments for a one world system is the new world order ’s Achilles ’ heel - and the infowarrior ’s greatest weapon .
In order to adequately maintain control , the elite must make use of feigned , fictitious events along which these policies can be guided .
Real natural calamities are loose canons , as are genuine external threats , because they often times ( though not always ) refuse to align with the designs of the elite .
Therefore by exposing these falsehoods , we automatically expose the mindset behind them .
The truth is the elite ’s biggest problem that refuses to go away ; it ’s the pebble in their shoe and , possibly , their future undoing .
The German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels already said it in an unguarded moment :
‘ The truth is the mortal enemy of the lie , and thus by extension , the truth is the greatest enemy of the state . ’

American medicine is already in a crisis mode when it comes to geriatric care , and the problem will only become worse unless new approaches are found , experts say .
“ There ’s been a drastic decline in the number of geriatricians  and just 300 new ones are being trained each year  yet the number of people over 65 will double in the next 20 years , ” Dr. Atul Gawande , a surgeon at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston and an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health , said in an interview .
“ Those who work in geriatric care are among the worst paid in the health care system .
Is the time I spend as a surgeon excising a patient ’s cancer worth 10 times more than the time the primary care doctor spent finding the cancer in the first place ? ”
Dr. Gawande , who examined the problems of medical care for the aged last year in The New Yorker , pointed out that as we grow older , “ we do n’t get one problem at a time . ”
“ People with multiple problems need time , and that is not cheap and is currently not paid for by medical insurance , ” he said .
“ It ’s not possible to address five different problems in a 20 - minute visit . ”
Corona launched the “ Corona Beach Tour ” in London yesterday with the first of three beach - themed parties in European cities .
The parties are being used as a platform to promote beach conservation .
[ social_buttons ]
During the London premier party , Israeli model Bar Refaeli showcased beachwear and a limited edition organic line of beach bags from designer Custo Barcelona .
The bags will be sold to benefit beach preservation .
“ The Corona Beach Tour will recreate in each of the selected cities the atmosphere of an idyllic beach in winter time , from white sand and palm trees to bar tenders in swimsuits and Hawaiian tikki bars , ” Corona ’s press release reads .
“ The events will attract many celebrities in support of this initiative , a promising start to a beach preservation movement from Corona Extra . ”
I wonder what organization they ’re planning on donating the money to — Surfrider International ?
Greenpeace ?
After all , global warming is the top threat to all our beaches .
Corona and Refaeli will stop in Berlin and Milan later this month .

The actual article , though , was written by Pam Derringer , was a pretty balanced piece ( although it obviously could have been more in - depth ; given length and time constraints , she talked to as many people as I think could have been expected , including a Sun spokeswoman , two analysts from different analyst companies , the chair of Apache Software Foundation , a Sun customer , and so on ) .
I ’m not sure I ’d agree with Jim Jagielski when he claims that Sun has the “ best and brightest business people in the world , ” though .
As I said in the article , and as I ’ve said before , I have nothing but the highest respect for many of Sun ’s engineers , especially those who work on Solaris .
But their business people ?
I ’m not so sure they have the best and brightest … in fact , I think that ’s one of Sun ’s greatest problems right now .
Compare that with the job that Mark Hurd has done with HP , or with the work done by the executives at my employer ( IBM ) , and I ’m not so sure a strong case can be made for the excellence of Sun ’s business folk .
( I mean , how many people still believe that the $ 2 billion dollars which Sun spent to acquire Cobalt Networks , or the $ 4 billion dollars which Sun spent to acquire StorageTek , or the $ 1 billion dollars which Sun spent MySQL , were all good ideas ?
Sun is currently valued by the market at $ 2.4 billion dollars ! )
My bigger concern at the moment , however , is what happens if Sun gets purchased by a rival or by a corporate raider and gets broken up for parts ?
Since November 19th , when Sun ’s stock price crashed through $ 3.27 ( and has hit a low of $ 2.60 recently ) , it has been trading for less than its per -stock cash value .
I say that not out of a sense of Schadenfreude , but out of concern about what happens if someone decides to buy the company , lay everyone off , and even after paying all of its debts , the resulting cash left over would be more than cost of completely buying the company — all of the real estate , the inventory , and the patent portfolio would all be pure profit .
It ’s the last I ’m most concerned about ;
Sun has a very large patent portfolio !
What if it fell into the hands of a patent troll ?
What damage could be done to not just Linux and the OSS comunity , but the software industry as a whole ?
Suppose Sun really does have patents that read upon many of NetApp ’s products ?
If those patents fall into the hands of a patent troll , NetApp would no longer be able to negotiate a peace settlement based on its patents ( if they survive the on - going patent re-examination process ) that read on ZFS , since the patent troll would no longer be making any products based on ZFS .
Maybe somewhere in Sun ’s patent portfolio , there are patents that read on the GNOME and KDE desktops , but since Sun is trying to ship those with its Project Indiana / Open Solaris dekstop , it ’s not bothering to assert them at this time ?
What if a patent troll , perhaps one funded by Microsoft , gets their hands on those patents ?
One final scary thought .
Sun ’s current market cap : $ 2.40 billion USD .
Sun ’s cash on hand : $ 2.63 billion USD .
Microsoft ’s current cash on hand : $ 19.71 billion USD .
I can just imagine Steve Ballmer saying , “ Chris , take it out of petty cash .
I have an itsy - bitsy little acquistion I want to make … .
Now I can embrace and extend Java all I want !
And you know those term - limited , non-Open Source TCK licenses Sun gave to OpenJDK developers — not any more !
They ’re gone , within a year , the next time Red Hat needs to get the license renewed ! ”
Could it happen ?
What do you think ?

Central banking has been a corrupt , mercantilist scheme and an engine of corporate welfare from its very beginning in the late 18th century .
The first central bank , the Bank of North America , was " driven through the Continental Congress by [ congressman and financier ] Robert Morris in the Spring of 1781 , " wrote Murray Rothbard in The Mystery of Banking ( p. 191 ) .
The Philadelphia businessman Morris had been a defense contractor during the Revolutionary War who " siphoned off millions from the public treasury into contracts to his own … firm and to those of his associates . "
He was also " leader of the powerful Nationalist forces " in the new country .
The main objective of the Nationalists , who were also known as Federalists , was essentially to establish an American version of the British mercantilist system , the very system that the Revolution had been fought against .
Indeed , it was this system that the ancestors of the Revolutionaries had fled from when they came to America .
As Rothbard explained , their aim was
To reimpose in the new United States a system of mercantilism and big government similar to that in Great Britain , against which the colonists had rebelled .
The object was to have a strong central government , particularly a strong president or king as chief executive , built up by high taxes and heavy public debt .
The strong government was to impose high tariffs to subsidize domestic manufacturers , develop a big navy to open up and subsidize foreign markets for American exports , and launch a massive system of internal public works .
In short , the United States was to have a British system without Great Britain . ( p. 192 )
An important part of the " Morris scheme , " as Rothbard called it , was " to organize and head a central bank , to provide cheap credit and expanded money for himself and his allies .
The … Bank of North America was deliberately modeled after the Bank of England . "
The Bank was given a monopoly privilege of its notes being receivable in all tax payments to state and federal government , and no other banks were permitted to operate in the country .
It " graciously agreed to lend most of its newly created money to the federal government , " wrote Rothbard , and " the hapless taxpayers would have to pay the Bank principal and interest . "
Despite these monopolistic privileges , a lack of public confidence in the Bank 's inflated notes led to their depreciation and the Bank was privatized by the end of 1783 .
But Morris did not give up on his scheme .
He recruited a young Alexander Hamilton to serve more or less as his political puppet within the Washington administration .
( Rothbard called Hamilton " Morris 's youthful disciple . " )
In fact , the reason why Hamilton became Treasury secretary , despite having no reputation at all in the field of finance , was the recommendation by Morris to George Washington .
( During the Revolutionary War , when he was an aide to Washington , Hamilton took the time to write Morris a 30 - page letter proclaiming that he agreed with every one of his ideas about protectionist tariffs , corporate subsidies , and a government - run bank to finance them . )
Morris and his fellow Nationalists wanted a king - like chief executive who would rule over a mercantilist empire , just as the king of England ruled over his mercantilist empire .
They , of course , would be the ones to advise and instruct the " king " and benefit financially from such an empire .
So their young protégé Hamilton commenced his seven - year crusade to overthrow the first US constitution — the Articles of Confederation — by calling for a new constitutional convention to supposedly " revise " the Articles of Confederation .
At the convention , Hamilton laid out his ( really Morris 's ) plan : a permanent president who would appoint all the governors and who would have veto power over all state legislation .
Under such a plan , state sovereignty would have been destroyed , and there would have been no escape from the central government 's high taxes , protectionist tariffs , heavy debt , and foreign - policy imperialism — the agenda of the Nationalists .
The Hamilton / Morris plan was defeated , of course , as was the proposal made at the convention to include a central bank among the delegated powers to the federal government .
But the government was more highly centralized , as " the Nationalist forces pushed through a new Constitution " and " were on their way to re-establishing the mercantilist and statist British model … " ( p. 193 ) .
They begrudgingly acquiesced in a Bill of Rights in return for the anti-Federalists ' support for the new Constitution .
And most importantly , writes Rothbard ,
A critical part of their program was put through in 1791 by their leader , Secretary of the Treasury , Alexander Hamilton , a disciple of Robert Morris .
Hamilton put through Congress the First Bank of the… .
United States …. modeled after the old Bank of North America [ whose ] …. longtime president and former partner of Robert Morris , Thomas Willing of Philadelphia , was made president of the New Bank .
In making his case to President Washington for the constitutionality of a central bank , which had been explicitly rejected at the constitutional convention , Hamilton invented the idea of " implied powers " of the Constitution .
These were " powers " that were not expressly delegated to the federal government in the document , but could be " implied " by clever lawyers like Hamilton .
This of course became a roadmap for the total destruction of constitutional limitations on the powers of the federal government .
The First Bank of the United States " promptly fulfilled its inflationary potential , " Rothbard writes in his History of Money and Banking in the United States ( p. 69 ) .
It issued millions of dollars in paper money and demand deposits " pyramiding on top of $ 2 million in specie . "
The Bank invested heavily in the US government , and " The result of the outpouring of credit and paper money by the new Bank of the United States was … an increase [ in prices ] of 72 percent " from 1791 – 1796 .
Northern merchants provided the main political support for Hamilton 's Bank , whereas southern politicians like Jefferson supplied most of the opposition to it , seeing it as nothing more than a vehicle for financing an American version of the corrupt British mercantilist system , which would be destructive of liberty and prosperity .
They were right , of course , and remain right to this day .
A number of sleepwalkers have been acquitted of murder charges .
Sixteen years ago , the Canadian Supreme Court upheld the acquittal of a man who had said he was sleepwalking when he drove 14 miles , stabbed his mother - in - law to death and seriously injured his father - in - law .
In Arizona , it was claimed that a man was sleepwalking when he stabbed his wife 26 times , and he was acquitted on the ground he was temporarily insane .
Teachers , students at shuttered Houston charter school pack up State says Jesse Jackson Academy owes $ 3.2 million
A handful of teachers and families turned out at the Jesse Jackson Academy this morning to clean out their classrooms and get their transcripts to take to a new school .
The Houston charter school , which is run by the husband of Democratic state Rep. Alma Allen , was ordered closed Thursday by the Texas Education Agency .
The campus , at 5400 Griggs , must remain closed until it resolves several bookkeeping issues , state officials said .
The campus , along with its sister school in Fort Worth that was closed last month , owes the federal government $ 3.2 million in misappropriated federal grants .
Teachers at the school had n't gotten paid for about two months .
" We 're all in shock about what 's going on , " said teacher Wanda Thomas .
" We had no knowledge of anything that was said or done . "
A few employees were on hand to help students get copies of their records Friday and to suggest other campuses that they might attend .
" We 're just helping the students .
Nobody 's helping the teachers , " Thomas said .
Mother Pamela Lawal said she is n't sure what school her 17 - year - old son Manjaroe will attend .
He has enjoyed attending the Jesse Jackson Academy since August , she said .
" He was doing a really good job .
He was really happy , " she said .
" The children received a lot of one - on - one attention . "
This teaches students the value of education , she said .
" It 's a test .
We 've got to move on from here , " Lawal said .
Officials with the school , including Principal Lawrence Allen Sr. , did not return calls seeking comment .
Lawrence Allen 's son is Lawrence Allen Jr. , a Houston Independent School District administrator and the city 's representative on the State Board of Education , which approves charter schools .
Commissioner Robert Scott write in a letter Thursday that the school may be able to reopen if it resolves all the outstanding issues .
If not , the charter will be revoked , he warned .
Charter schools are public campuses that are funded by tax dollars but are free from many of the regulations of traditional campuses .
About 82,000
Texas students attend one of the 450 or so campuses operated by the charter holders .
David Dunn , executive director of the newly formed Texas Charter Schools Association , said that maintaining quality in the charter school movement is extremely important .
" It 's all about the kids , " he said .
" It 's critical that we provide high - quality operations for kids .
But it 's broader than that .
We have to run tight ships and run sound financial operations . "
Jesse Jackson earned an " acceptable " rating under the state system for charter schools that serve a large percentage of at - risk students , but it was flagged in 2005 for irregularities on the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills .
Texas Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson said the state does n't like disrupting students ' school year like this but officials had no other option .
" They 've been warned .
They 've been told , " she said .
HISD officials said they are prepared to enroll the displaced students in several nearby campuses , including Jones , Worthing and Sterling high schools .
Jones and Worthing are rated " academically unacceptable " by the state .
Sterling has an " acceptable " rating .
" We 've got plenty of space , " HISD spokesman Norm Uhl said .
" We 'd be happy to have them . "

There have been further riots in Greece in protest at the killing by police of a 15 - year - old boy eight days ago .
Violent clashes broke out in the capital , Athens , on Saturday evening following a day of largely peaceful vigils for Alexandros Grigoropoulos .
Youths threw petrol bombs at banks and the police station where the officer charged with the teenager 's killing was based .
Police responded with tear gas .
At least 70 people have been injured in the protests sparked by the shooting .
The unrest has spread throughout the country , and has prompted calls for Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and his government to stand down .
Mr Karamanlis has vowed not to be swayed by protests , insisting Greece needs experienced leadership at a time of economic crisis .
' Murderers out '
The BBC's Malcolm Brabant in Athens says the clashes on Saturday evening have been the most serious disturbances for several days .
The protesters used laser pointers to target police for attack
New generation flexes muscles Have Your Say The protests in memory of Alexandros Grigoropoulos 's death last Saturday in Exarchia had begun peacefully .
Students of the school the teenager had attended held a silent vigil during the day in Syntagma Square .
Hours later , hundreds of others brought candles to the site , while others gathered at the site of the shooting .
But later , about 100 youths hurled volleys of petrol bombs and rocks at a police station in the Exarchia district , where the officer , who shot him and has now been charged with murder , was based .
The protesters chanted " murderers out " .
Wearing hoods and masks , the protesters then turned their attention to a commercial area near the National Technical University of Athens , known as the Polytechnic , overturning cars and setting fire to three banks .
Several shops and an office of the environment ministry were also attacked .
Riot police positioned at street corners in the area responded by firing tear gas at the protesters .
Several restaurants in Exarchia had already closed early in anticipation of the violence .
Many shop owners meanwhile boarded up their windows as night fell .
Police subsequently charged the vigil in nearby Syntagma Square , when those taking part refused to move further away from the parliament building and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier .
Meanwhile in Greece 's second city of Thessaloniki , dozens of youths vandalised a gymnasium during a demonstration , according to the AFP news agency .
Broader complaints
Our correspondent says anger at the killing of the teenager has developed into a widespread sense of anger at Greece 's government over the past week .
Some semblance of calm had returned to Athens on Saturday Thousands of Greeks have taken to the streets across the country , repeatedly clashing with police and vowing to overthrow the government .
Many have identified themselves as anarchists happy to use violence in what they say are legitimate protests against the government .
Some , though , have welcomed the return of a semblance of calm prior to the violence on Saturday evening .
In Athens , Mayor Nikitas Kaklamanis greeted Christmas shoppers with the city 's brass band .
" People came up to me and were telling me that it was the first time they had smiled in days , " the mayor told the Associated Press .

LITTLE FALLS , N.Y . 
Most people do not believe that Tim Dufel can push 2,000 tons of steel all the way across New York State .
Is n’t the old Erie Canal dried up , they ask him , its locks broken , its ditch filled in and forgotten ?
They ask these questions even on days like this one , when Mr. Dufel is standing in an orange life vest , watching brown water flood Lock 16 here and lift his loaded barge like a toy battleship in a bathtub .
“ Sixty percent of the people I meet have no idea the Erie Canal is even still functioning , ” Mr. Dufel said .
He is assistant engineer on the tugboat Margot and an owner of the New York State Marine Highway Transportation Company , one of the largest shippers on the canal .
After decades of decline , commercial shipping has returned to the Erie Canal , though it is a far cry from the canal ’s heyday .
The number of shipments rose to 42 so far this year during the season the canal is open , from 15 during last year ’s season , which lasts from May 1 to Nov. 15 .
The time for New Year ’s resolutions is here , and many people have a goal to pay down their debt .
One tool that may help with your goal is this : A Web site called DebtGoal .
DebtGoal is a site that helps you develop a customized plan for getting out of debt .
Here is what a press release I received from the company said :
Debtgoal is much like a WeightWatchers plan for debt reduction .
It ’s an online consumer application that helps make paying down debt easy and efficient .
The site takes into account all of a customer ’s debt ( credit cards , student loans , car loans , mortgages , etc. ) and provides a clear , customized plan to help them pay down credit card debt in the most efficient , easiest way possible .
I checked out the site , and entered in some hypothetical debt .
I really liked the visual I got showing how much money I could save if I made certain additional payments on top of the base plan that DebtGoal offered :
For those who do n’t know where to start when it comes to how to pay down debt , DebtGoal offers a great jumping - off point .
You can get personalized help and information , as well create a debt reduction plan that is tailored to your needs .
Also nice :
You can keep track of your progress to see how well you are doing .
Overall , I think DebtGoal is an excellent resource and tool .
It provides a visual doable illustration of what you need to do in order to pay down debt .
Do you have any tools that you use to pay down debt ?

Camp KDE
Takes off in Jamaica
In a warm Jamaica some thirty KDE developers have gathered for the first Camp KDE .
The healthy growth of the KDE community created the need for a combined North / South American meeting .
The release event showed it is possible .
It has been a year since the KDE 4.0 release event by San Fransisco , and we see many of the faces we saw back then at Google headquarters .
Little taste of where we are
Last year has been an exciting journey for the KDE community .
The 4.0 release was made to some joy and some criticism .
But the release increased activity and resulted in a fast growing number of contributors and code commits .
Thus the 4.1 released around Akademy brought many improvements .
Now it is the upcoming release which aims for the general public .
And again the American community event is in the sweet spot , we will be releasing the KDE 4.2 software suite a couple of days after we leave the golden island of Jamaica .
Of course this meeting is not only about the 4.2 release , far from it .
It is about continuing what we started last year .
We will continue to grow and create great software .
And have fun while doing it .
A look at the hotel
The location for this event is amazing .
Most of us have traveled a long way , and arriving in Jamaica after such a journey is very rewarding .
It is a beautiful country and even late at night , it is warm and we can sit outside .
Many arrived rather late , and met the others at the beach .
Many went for a swim and there was a KDE Plasma meeting held in the Caribbean sea - the water is lovely .
wet developers
As usual at KDE events there is a large variety of developers .
There are PIM people , Edu developers , Plasma developers .
We have them in every colour and taste .
There are some Pardus developers looking for bonding with the KDE community .
Of course , besides enjoying each others company , food and the weather , work is in progress already .
There is wireless and power everywhere , even at the beach .
As is often the case the heavy network usage proved too much for the network , but after persistent efforts of the organisers we got connected again .
After being introduced to several kinds of fruit we never knew existed by a great Jamaican breakfast we started to move to the conference room .
Working developers
Wade introduced us to the conference , outlining the reasons for this meeting .
Then Winston Wellington , the owner of Travellers Beach Resort and founder of the Negril Education Environmental Trust told us how results of our work are affecting this place .
This organisation is dedicated to educating the Jamaican people by bringing cheap computers and books to them .
This year alone they opened several libraries with thousands of books and over fourty computers .
As Wade concludes , it is often easy to forget what happens with the software we develop .
We worry about text drawing , widgets and memory usage - here the results are applied and used to help improve the life of people .
After Wade 's introduction several developers gave a talk .
Those will be covered in a separate article available in the coming days .
Conference area
When the last talk was over a big group of contributors went to town under supervision of our " security team " ( Roger Pixley and Dmitri Dawkins ) .
After a visit to the supermarket for drinks we had a portion of the famous Jamaican Jerk Chicken alongside the road .
Eating chicken , sitting on benches between the Caribbean sea on one side and the road with a reggae party going on on the other side .
That is how life is around here .
Returning at the hotel , one group went to the beach and sat on the benches just before the hotel ( 2 metres from the sea ) .
Accompanied by various kinds of Jamaican rum , juice , good company and a warm sea , the evening was great .
A second group went out for pizza but was less lucky .
A local pizza place had a hard time serving the whole group .
So it took a while to get food , but in the end they joined the others on the beach with their belly full .
Sunday again offered talks about various topics .
During and between talks developers went downstairs to the beach for a swim and we also had a great lunch .
Supplies for a perfect Sunday evening in Jamaica ( yes , Ade will bake cookies )
While this article is being finished your author is looking out over the beach , watching the community enjoy the waves and have a good time .
This must be one of the most enjoyable KDE meetings ever ...
You can count on more articles , blogs , inspiration and of course code resulting from this event !
