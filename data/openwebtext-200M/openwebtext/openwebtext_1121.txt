In the struggle to free the Mars rover Spirit from a sand trap , NASA engineers are bringing out the reserve troops .
A second , lighter duplicate rover slid into a sandbox for testing this week , delaying any attempt to free Spirit by as much as three weeks , to mid-September .
Spirit has been stuck in a sandpit for nearly four months .
Since late June , engineers have been trying to determine the best moves to extricate it by driving a test rover around a sandbox at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in California .
Rover engineers had earlier announced that they were almost done with the testing and would be ready to move Spirit around 10 August , but they backtracked in a meeting on 6 August .

“ We ’ve come up with additional tests that we want to do , and additional computer modelling that we want to do as well , ” says rover project manager John Callas at JPL .
“ Now we ’re looking at the middle of September . ”
Coarser sand
One cause for the delay is the difference between the duplicate rover ’s performance in the sandbox and the actual rover ’s driving on Mars .
The test bed contains a sand cocktail that supposedly approximates the flour - like soil in which Spirit is stalled .
But engineers noticed that the test rover actually did worse driving through the simulated sand than Spirit did during its last few drives on Mars .
“ The loose , fluffy soil we have here on the ground is worse than what there is on Mars , ” Callas told New Scientist .
Engineers are filling a second test bed at JPL with crushed aggregate , a heavier , courser material .
“ It gives us a second data point , ” Callas says .
“ We do n’t know exactly what we have on Mars , so we ’re trying to explore as best we can with the resources we have on the ground . ”
Another question is how the weaker Martian gravity affects the rover ’s driving .
The first duplicate rover , which comes fully equipped with a scientific payload and a robotic arm , “ is as close to flight [ i.e. , Spirit ] as anything we have on the ground ” , Callas says .
On Earth , Spirit weighs about 180 kilograms , but on Mars – whose gravity is about three - eighths that on Earth , Spirit weighs just 64 kilograms .
Lower gravity
So engineers have decided to test a second mock rover .
That rover is lighter because it does not carry scientific instruments or a robotic arm .
“ It ’s what we call SSTV - Lite , or Surface System Testbed Vehicle - Lite , ” Callas says .
It has been around since the beginning of the five - year mission , and was used to help Spirit ’s twin , Opportunity , enter Endurance Crater in 2004 .
This “ lesser - known fourth sibling ” weighs in at 73 kilograms , so it should act more like the rovers do under Martian gravity , says Callas .
“ We ’ll be able to explore the effects of gravity and the effects of soil choice on the results that we ’ve collected , ” Callas says .
With a failed front - right wheel , a rock under its belly , and a history of amnesia , Spirit is in delicate shape .
So scientists are dragging their feet to make sure its first step is the strongest possible .
“ Our very best chance at getting Spirit out will be our very first chance at getting Spirit out , ” Callas says .
“ We want that first try to be the highest probability success manoeuvre …
That ’s why we ’re doing all this testing . ”
A nonlethal device best known for beating back pirates off the coast of Somalia was deployed by local police in San Diego at political gatherings , and even at a competition to build sand castles , according to a local publication .
" The [ Long Range Acoustic Device ] was stationed by San Diego County Sheriff deputies at a recent town hall forum hosted by Congresswoman Susan Davis ( D - San Diego ) in Spring Valley and at a subsequent town hall with Congressman Darrell Issa ( R - San Diego ) , " East Country Magazine reported after reviewing official records .
It was also parked at a local sand - building competition along the beach .
Though the Long Range Acoustic Device can be used for hailing , it has also been employed as a weapon , most prominently in 2005 by a cruise ship , which used it to ward off attacking pirates .
In fact , the device , which was developed after the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 , is designed precisely for that sort of mission .
It can permanently damage hearing , depending on how it 's used .
Deploying the Long Range Acoustic Device to local events has provided ammunition to critics of Police Sheriff Bill Gore , who was the agent - in - charge of the FBI 's infamous 1992 Ruby Ridge siege .
In response to questions posed by East Country Magazine about use of the technology , Gore said that officers had the appropriate training and that the device 's use as a deterrent is just a " precaution in case you need it . "

It has been nearly a month since the car - buying frenzy of the Cash for Clunkers program ended , and many area auto dealers are longing for the good old days of July and August .
Like consumers nationwide , Massachusetts residents rushed to take advantage of the federal voucher program , which offered them up to $ 4,500 on old gas - guzzlers to be put toward the purchase of new , more fuel - efficient vehicles .
About $ 65 million worth of vouchers were handed out statewide during the monthlong program that ended Aug. 24 .
But once the federal money dried up , so did the sales rally .
Now , customers at dealerships like Silko Honda in Raynham are few and far between , and inventory is once again accumulating .
Manager Adam Silverleib said business was “ pretty intense ’ ’ as a result of the federal stimulus program , with the dealership hustling to accommodate customers and handle the piles of paperwork required for them to receive reimbursement on vouchers .
“ Now we ’re kind of back to where we were in the spring , ’’ he said .
In an attempt to draw customers back to showrooms , some dealers are offering new incentives , albeit none as enticing as a $ 4,500 for a rusting junker .
Silko , for example , is promoting 2.9 percent financing on new Accords , along with other deals on its website .
Nationwide , customers snatched up 700,000 new cars , most of them foreign - made , and the government ended up paying out nearly $ 3 billion toward the purchases .
But from the start , analysts predicted that Cash for Clunkers would not boost sales for the year .
September ’s sales swoon seems to be making their case .
Car sales are usually slow after Labor Day , but because of the recession consumers this year are especially reluctant to say yes to major purchases .
To make matters worse for dealers , most are still waiting for voucher reimbursements .
“ It was probably , in the end , a complete waste of taxpayer money , ’’ said John Wolkonowicz , a senior auto analyst at IHS Global Insight , Lexington forecasting firm .
“ The dealers , who were supposed to be the primary beneficiaries , many were forced into cash flow problems because the government did n’t pay them in a timely fashion . ’’
From the outset , there were problems with the Car Allowance Rebate System .
It was supposed to start July 1 but was delayed until July 24 .
The rules were complicated , and the list of qualifying vehicles and other requirements changed repeatedly .
And in addition to the formidable paperwork , the government website set up to process the deals kept crashing , creating a backlog .
Ray Ciccolo , president of Village Automotive Group , which operates eight Boston - area dealerships , said he has received $ 400,000 from the government , but that is only half of what he is owed .
Ciccolo was in Washington last week to hear Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood address the National Automobile Dealers Association .
Ciccolo said LaHood pledged to have all claims paid by the end of this month .
“ There is n’t much you can do except wait , ’’ Ciccolo said .
That does not mean that Ciccolo and other dealers in Massachusetts condemn the program .
Several said they were grateful for it because it helped them quickly move inventory and brought in a barrage of unexpected customers .
Richard White , general manager at Cityside Subaru in Belmont , said the dealership sold 52 cars through the program and that he has been reimbursed for 51 .
His biggest problem has been trying to rebuild inventory since it ended .
“ By every measure , the program was extremely successful for us , ’’ he said .
The Department of Transportation said it has approved 83 percent of dealer rebate applications and was working through snags to process the rest .
Robert O’Koniewski , executive vice president of the Massachusetts State Automobile Dealers Association , which represents 441 dealerships , estimated that most are probably still owed money .
“ This program was very good at getting product off the lot , but there have n’t been long - term benefits , ’’ he said .
“ Dealers are reporting that showrooms are pretty dead right now . ’’
Wolkonowicz said the fall slowdown may have been worsened by the program because many buyers came out early to take advantage of the program instead of waiting until now to shop .
In Raynham , Silverleib is relying heavily on longtime customers ready for a new model .
But he is realistic about the state of the auto business , and skeptical that the economy is out of the woods .
“ Speaking as someone on the front lines , we ’re still in a recession , ’’ he said .

Van Jones Getty Images WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The White House environmental adviser under fire for inflammatory statements made before he joined the administration resigned after what he called a " vicious smear campaign against me . "
Van Jones " understood that he was going to get in the way " of President Obama 's agenda , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Sunday .
The resignation was disclosed without advance notice by the White House in a dead - of - the - night e-mail on a holiday weekend .
It came as Obama is working to regain his footing in the contentious health care debate .
Jones , who specialized in environmentally friendly " green jobs " with the White House Council on Environmental Quality , was linked to efforts suggesting a government role in the Sept. 11 attacks and to derogatory comments about Republicans .
Gibbs said Obama did not endorse Van Jones ' comments but thanked him for his service .
" What Van Jones decided was that the agenda of this president was bigger than any one individual , " Gibbs said on ABC's " This Week .
Recent news reports cited a derogatory comment Jones made in the past about Republicans , and separately , of Jones 's name appearing on a petition connected to the events surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks .
That 2004 petition had asked for congressional hearings and other investigations into whether high - level government officials had allowed the attacks to occur .
" On the eve of historic fights for health care and clean energy , opponents of reform have mounted a vicious smear campaign against me , " Jones said in his resignation statement .
" They are using lies and distortions to distract and divide . "
Howard Dean , former head of the Democratic National Committee , told " Fox News Sunday " that he thought Jones " was brought down " and that his resignation was " a loss to the country . "
Jones said he has been " inundated with calls from across the political spectrum urging me to stay and fight . "
But he said he could not in good conscience ask his colleagues to spend time and energy defending or explaining his past .
Jones said in an earlier statement that he did not agree with the petition 's stand on the Sept. 11 attacks and that " it certainly does not reflect my views , now or ever . "
As for his other comments he made before joining Obama 's team , Jones said , " If I have offended anyone with statements I made in the past , I apologize . "
Despite his apologies , Republicans demanded Jones quit .
Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana said in a statement , " His extremist views and coarse rhetoric have no place in this administration or the public debate . "
Missouri Sen. Christopher " Kit " Bond said Congress should investigate Jones 's fitness for the job .
Fox News Channel host Glenn Beck repeatedly denounced Jones after a group the adviser co-founded , ColorofChange.org , led an advertising boycott against Beck 's show to protest his claim that Obama is a racist .
The president of Beck 's media organization , Christopher J. Balfe , said the commentator had begun focusing on Jones ' " radical beliefs " on July 16 , before the group started taking on Beck .
But James Rucker , the organization 's executive director , has said Jones had nothing to do with ColorofChange.org now and did n't even know about the campaign before it started .
Jones , well - known in the environmental movement , was a civil - rights activist in California before shifting his attention to environmental and energy issues .
He is known for laying out a broad vision of a green economy .
Conservatives have harshly criticized him for having left - wing political views .
Nancy Sutley , who heads the White House environmental council , said Jones " had been a strong voice for creating jobs that improve energy efficiency and utilize renewable resources . '

From commercial to artistic … these photographs have something in common…along with a strong visual impact they have a an amazing sometimes fun idea behind them .
It will make you smile , or meditate on certain issues but it wo n’t leave you indifferent .
Introduction
Like CPUs , graphics processors have seen remarkable growth in their performance over the last few generations .
In fact , they have grown so fast that the hardest job in the industry is not in finding new ways to improve their performance further but to find new tasks to use up all that massive processing power !
Just take a look at how far we have come in 3D graphics !
Year Model Pixel Fill Rate
( MPixels / s ) Texture Fill Rate
( MTexels / s ) Memory
Bandwidth 2006 GeForce 7900 GTX
10,400 15,600 51.2 GB /s 2007 GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB 10,400 41,600 62.21 GB /s 2008 GeForce 9800 GTX +
11,808 47,232 70.4 GB /s 2009 GeForce GTX 285 20,736 51,840 158.98 GB / s
In a space of just four years , NVIDIA 's top graphics card models have doubled in pixel fill rate and more than tripled in texture fill rate and memory bandwidth .
With so much processing power , the latest graphics cards from NVIDIA or ATI have no problem handling super - high resolutions and even " expensive " 3D features like anti-aliasing .
As a result , both NVIDIA and ATI have encouraged developers to make use of their graphics processors for general purpose computing .
This has resulted in the development of codecs and tools that allow the encoding and decoding of high resolution videos using the graphics processor .
Even distributed computing projects have jumped on the bandwagon , developing clients that make use of the graphics processor 's tremendous processing capability .
That 's not the limit of what the GPU can do though .
NVIDIA recently revealed their OptiX ray tracing engine , which allows you to harness the tremendous processing power of NVIDIA 's Quadro graphics cards to render complex 3D scenes .
Both NVIDIA and ATI graphics processors are based on a unified architecture with programmable stream processors that can handle not only traditional graphics ( vertex , geometry , texture ) processing but also general purpose computing operations .
However , NVIDIA have an ace up their sleeves that currently gives them an edge over ATI and that ace is called PhysX .
What Is PhysX ?
PhysX refers to both the proprietary realtime physics engine , as well as the Physics Processing Unit ( PPU ) developed by AGEIA , a fabless semiconductor company that specialized in the acceleration of physics calculations for use in video games .
Founded back in 2002 , it was acquired by NVIDIA in February 2008 , a fact we actually predicted way back in 2006 !
Even back then , we could see that it made sense for NVIDIA ( or ATI ) to buy over AGEIA and their PhysX technology .
Buying AGEIA allowed NVIDIA to integrate PhysX into CUDA ( Compute Unified Decide Architecture ) , the parallel computing architecture used in their GPUs .
In one swoop , all NVIDIA graphics processors from the GeForce 8 series onwards were instantly able to accelerate physics calculations for games and applications that supported the PhysX engine .
Instead of using a dedicated PhysX PPU , NVIDIA uses some of the stream processors in the GPU to process the physics calculations .
This allows NVIDIA to divert some of their GPUs ' tremendous processing power to physics calculations without using a separate PPU .
The result ?
Physics acceleration by the GPU at no additional cost .
Of course , PhysX is NVIDIA 's proprietary technology .
Only NVIDIA graphics cards are capable of accelerating games and applications that support PhysX .
This gives them an important leverage over their competitor , ATI , who has made a remarkable comeback on the back of their Radeon HD 4000 series of graphics cards .
As popular as the current ATI graphics cards , they cannot accelerate games and applications that support PhysX .
But just how important is PhysX acceleration ?
That 's what we are about to find out !

Fidel Castro loses his right - hand - man as Juan Almeida Bosque dies from heart attack
Juan Almeida Bosque , a comrade - in - arms of Fidel Castro since the start of his guerrilla struggle more than a half - century ago , has died of a heart attack .
A statement in government media on Saturday said the 82 - year - old died around 11:30 pm on Friday night in Havana .
One of three surviving rebel leaders who still bore the title ' Commander of the Revolution , ' Almeida was a major figure in the battle to overthrow Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista , and through the early years following the Jan. 1 , 1959 , triumph of the Cuban revolution .
Brothers in arms : Juan Almeida Bosque stands with the Castros - Raul , centre , and Fidel right - during a celebration in 1996
Cuba declared a national day of mourning for Sunday and ordered all flags flown at half - staff .
A bricklayer who began working at age 11 , Almeida was the only black commander among the rebel leaders .
After the overthrow of Batista , he served in several military posts and was often seen at public events in his uniform alongside Castro until the Cuban leader fell gravely ill in the summer of 2006 and finally resigned the presidency in February 2008 .
Although Almeida also cut back on work in recent years , he was a mainstay at public events beside Castro 's younger brother and successor , President Raul Castro .
Almeida joined the fight against Batista 's dictatorship in March 1952 as a young law student at the University of Havana , where he met Fidel Castro , another aspiring attorney .
Almeida was at Castro 's side a year later , on July 26 , 1953 , when Cuba 's future president led an armed attack on the Moncada , a military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago .
It was a disaster and Almeida and both Castros were sent to prison .
But that failure launched the revolutionary battle that triumphed five - and - a - half years later .
Passionate : Juan Almeida Bosque talks to a reporter in 1959
Almeida and other survivors of the offensive were freed in May 1955 under an amnesty granted to the young revolutionaries .
He accompanied the Castros and others comrades to Mexico , where they formed a guerrilla army .
They returned to Cuba in December 1956 on the American yacht ' Granma ' and launched their battle from the island 's eastern Sierra Maestra .
Almeida , the Castro brothers and Argentine - born Ernesto ' Che ' Guevara were among only 16 who survived the landing , in which most of the rebels were killed by government troops .
' No one here gives up !'
Almeida shouted to Guevara at the time , coining an enduring slogan of the Cuban revolution and ensuring his place in Cuban communist history .
As a guerrilla leader , Almeida later headed his own front of military operations in eastern Cuba .
Committed : Raul Castro , right , and Vice President Juan Almeida Bosque attend the 50th anniversary of the Cuban revolution in Santiago de Cuba this January
His military exploits earned him the title ' Comandante de la Revolucion , ' reserved for top leaders of rebel troops under Fidel Castro 's command in the 1950s .
Now only Ramiro Valdes and Guillermo Garcia hold the distinction .
In recent decades , Almeida was a highly visible member of Cuba 's ruling elite .
With his full head of white hair and mustache , he sat on the Communist Party 's politburo and serving as a vice president on the Council of State , the country 's supreme governing body .
The government statement on his death called him 'a paradigm of revolutionary strength , solid convictions , bravery , patriotism and service to the people . '
It said Almeida 's body would not lie in state , in accordance with his wishes , and funeral arrangements would be announced later .
Looking well : Juan Almeida Bosque pictured in December 2007
Authorities were organizing a ceremony Sunday in his honor at the monument of Cuban revolutionary hero Jose Marti on Havana 's Revolution Plaza and at other locations around the country , including Isla de la Juventud , an island off Cuba 's mainland where Almeida once was imprisoned with the Castro brothers .
Almeida also composed traditional Cuban music and wrote about his years behind bars and in the mountains .
Details of his personal life were always closely guarded , and it was not clear how many survivors he had .

Actor Bryan Cranston kisses his award for outstanding lead actor in a drama series for " Breaking Bad " at the 60th annual Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles September 21 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mike Blake
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Bryan Cranston won the Emmy Award as best actor in a TV drama on Sunday for his role as a terminally ill high school teacher who cooks crystal methamphamine on the side in the AMC series “ Breaking Bad . ”
Cranston scored a surprise victory in a six - way race against last year ’s winner , James Spader of “ Boston Legal ; ” as well as Jon Hamm of “ Mad Men ; ” Hugh Laurie from “ House ; ” Michael C. Hall of “ Dexter ; ” and Gabriel Byrne from “ In Treatment . ”
Cranston was formerly best known as the goofy dad on the long - running Fox family comedy “ Malcolm in the Middle , ” a role for which he earned four Emmy nominations but never won .
Barack Obama asks supporters to commit to attending community events on health care .
Obama urges backers to fight ' lies '
In an unusual e-mail appeal , President Barack Obama is asking millions of his campaign supporters to commit to attending at least one community event on health care this month .
Obama writes that opponents of his health care plan are “ filling the airwaves and the Internet with outrageous falsehoods to scare people into opposing change . ”
Advertisement
“ And some people , not surprisingly , are getting pretty nervous , ” he warns .
“ So we 've got to get out there , fight lies with truth and set the record straight . "
The e-mail shows up as being from “ President Barack Obama , ” with the subject line : “ This is the moment . ”
“ Home is where we 're strongest .
We did n't win last year 's election together at a committee hearing in D.C .
We won it on the doorsteps and the phone lines , at the softball games and the town meetings , and in every part of this great country where people gather to talk about what matters most , ” Obama says .
“ And if you 're willing to step up once again , that 's exactly where we 're going to win this historic campaign for the guaranteed , affordable health insurance that every American deserves . "
The drive is run by Organizing for America , the new name for the Obama grass - roots organization , now a project of the Democratic National Committee .
The e-mail clicks through to a commitment form , with the notice : “ Once you commit to attending an event , we 'll be in touch to let you know about upcoming events near you . ”
Here is the full text for the e-mail :
[ Name — ]
For one month , the fight for health insurance reform leaves the backrooms of Washington , D.C. , and returns to communities across America .
Throughout August , members of Congress are back home , where the hands they shake and the voices they hear will not belong to lobbyists , but to people like you .
Home is where we 're strongest .
We did n't win last year 's election together at a committee hearing in D.C .
We won it on the doorsteps and the phone lines , at the softball games and the town meetings , and in every part of this great country where people gather to talk about what matters most .
And if you 're willing to step up once again , that 's exactly where we 're going to win this historic campaign for the guaranteed , affordable health insurance that every American deserves .
There are those who profit from the status quo , or see this debate as a political game , and they will stop at nothing to block reform .
They are filling the airwaves and the internet with outrageous falsehoods to scare people into opposing change .
And some people , not surprisingly , are getting pretty nervous .
So we 've got to get out there , fight lies with truth , and set the record straight .
That 's why Organizing for America is putting together thousands of events this month where you can reach out to neighbors , show your support , and make certain your members of Congress know that you 're counting on them to act .
But these canvasses , town halls , and gatherings only make a difference if you turn up to knock on doors , share your views , and show your support .
So here 's what I need from you :
Can you commit to join at least one event in your community this month ?
In politics , there 's a rule that says when you ask people to get involved , always tell them it 'll be easy .
Well , let 's be honest here : Passing comprehensive health insurance reform will not be easy .
Every president since Harry Truman has talked about it , and the most powerful and experienced lobbyists in Washington stand in the way .
But every day we do n't act , Americans watch their premiums rise three times faster than wages , small businesses and families are pushed towards bankruptcy , and 14,000 people lose their coverage entirely .
The cost of inaction is simply too much for the people of this nation to bear .
So yes , fixing this crisis will not be easy .
Our opponents will attack us every day for daring to try .
It will require time , and hard work , and there will be days when we do n't know if we have anything more to give .
But there comes a moment when we all have to choose between doing what 's easy , and doing what 's right .
This is one of those times .
And moments like this are what this movement was built for .
So , are you ready ?
Please commit now to taking at least one action in your community this month to build support for health insurance reform :
Let 's seize this moment and win this historic victory for our economy , our health and our families .
Thank you ,
President Barack Obama

September 16 , 2009 ( San Diego ) – San Diego County Sheriff ’s Department notified media today that it would hold a demonstration of its highly controversial “ sonic weapon . ”
What was demonstrated , however , was only the loudspeaker capability of the device — a feature which has effectively been used in search - and - rescue operations and to broadcast messages during a sandcastle contest .
The sonic weapons switch , capable of emitting tones loud enough to damage ear drums or worse , has now been “ disabled , ” Sheriff ’s Lieutenant Ed Musgrove informed the media at the end of the event .
( View our video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulkl5Lw5gm8)
But concerns remain .
“ If you accidentally flip that switch and someone is within a 30 - foot range , they can have their eardrums burst , bleeding in the inner ear , and it can result in an aneurysm or death , ” reporter Kim Dvorac from Examiner.com said in an interview on KCBQ radio ’s Rick Amato show last night , citing a source in the Department of Defense http://www.amatotalk.com/podcasts/AMATO-09-15-09-HR1.mp3 .
“ The officers shown at this town hall meeting ( for Susan Davis ) were using this within 30 feet of townhall attendees and other officers , ” she added .
Dvorac published two stories on the Sheriff ’s deployment of LRADs ( long - range acoustic devices ) after East County Magazine ) broke the story on Friday http://www.eastcountymagazine.org/?q=node/1874 , creating a firestorm of controversy .
As we reported , LRADs have been used to repel insurgents in Iraq and to prevent piracy of ships aboard the high seas .
Dvorac , who said she has spoken to various sources who have served in the Middle East and who are familiar with the use of LRADs , added this clarification .
“ They are also using this over in Iraq and Afghanistan to target terrorists in crowds , to take them out and save people around them …
This can be pointed directly at you and it will burst your eardrums , but the person on the right or left will not be harmed by this . ”
She added that she could find no support in her research or among experts interviewed for use of LRADs as crowd control devices — the use for which Sheriff Gore says he purchased the device .
Our story , a joint investigation with Liberty One Radio , sparked a flurry of comments critical of the Sheriff , drawing national media coverage .
USA Today picked up the story , along with major conservative and liberal blogs .
At a Sheriff ’s debate Saturday co-hosted by ECM editor Miriam Raftery and KCBQ Radio ’s Rick Amato , the crowd turned unruly when a question about the sonic weapons was posed by Dvorac .
Three other candidates for Sheriff condemned Sheriff Bill Gore for approving LRADs at public rallies .
In the debate , Gore confirmed that “ the crowd was purchased as a crowd dispersal ” that was “ held in reserve ” as “ a non-lethal type of device to disperse crowds should there be the need … ”
Other alternatives would include pepper spray – an analogy that quickly drew references to the recent pepper - spraying of guests by a Sheriff ’s deputy at Democratic Congressional candidate Francine Busby ’s fundraiser .
Gore also stated in the debate that the LRAD “ does n’t burst eardrums ” and said volume and frequency are controlled on the side of the device .
At a demonstration today held at a Sheriff ’s station in San Diego , however , Musgrove told the media that “ essentially what this is is just a voice amplification system . ”
He said the device has been used to broadcast information in English and Spanish at a sandcastle building event in Imperial Beach and its directional sound capabilities have been used to successfully locate missing people during search and rescue efforts in East County ’s canyons and mountains .
The LRAD is more effective than a hand - held microphone for broadcasting messages , he added , because it can reach beyond 300 meters .
Asked if there has been much opposition to the device , he replied , “ We ’ve gotten really little feedback from the public , ” adding that feedback from law enforcement personnel has been positive .
“ I do n’t think this thing is controversial , ” he stated later .
Asked if the LRAD could hurt someone ’s eardrums , the Sheriff ’s representative confirmed , “ Absolutely , any device that amplifies sound can …
When you get into the red area , the manufacturer recommends not having someone in front of it for 75 meters , 200 feet . ”
He defended the device as a “ good acquisition ” and confirmed it was purchased with a Homeland Security grant .
Asked by another reporter if it could be used to disperse crowds , he replied , “ This particular device can do that , however ours , we ’ve disabled that and taken it out completely . ”
Whether that meant the switch has been removed , or merely turned off , however , was not clarified .
Musgrove insisted the device is only being used for good .
" So , it will never be used in San Diego as a weapon ? " asked 10 News ' Ariana Duarte .
" No , not by the Sheriff 's Department , no , " Musgrove replied .
http://www.10news.com/news/20931535/detail.html
All three candidates running against Gore for Sheriff criticized the Department for purchasing the LRAD .
“ They are very , very lethal weapons , ” said Jay LaSuer .
“ they are military weapons .
They have no place in law enforcement .
Why in the name of God you would take one when a United States member of Congress has invited people to come speak about health debates that ’s going on right now , I do n’t know .
Probably the majority of these people are Medicaid recipients , so you probably have terrorists on walkers , ” he quipped , then turned to Gore : “ You have deployed a weapon to be used potentially against American citizens … shame on you . ”
“ I do n’t think it belongs in our arsenal , ” said Jim Duffy .
“ Why was it at that forum ?
It should never have been purchased and secondly , should not have been deployed in that environment . ”
He further criticized the $ 40,000 cost ( including a training program ) as a waste of taxpayer money .
Bruce Ruff , the third candidate , faulted Gore for buying “ whiz - bang gadgetry with your money . ”
He noted that deputy sheriffs were not protected ( a photo showed deputies close to the device with no protective earphones ) .
KCBQ radio host Rick Amato suggested that the Sheriff targeted what the Department viewed as “ crazy right - wing racist extremists showing up with teabags ” at the town hall forums .
Dvorac noted that Congressman Duncan Hunger ( R - Alpine ) was also speaking at Darrell Issa ’s town hall forum in Vista , where the LRAD was deployed .
“ The Congressman was unaware , ” Dvorac said .
She added “ Hunter , who actually served in Iraq , knows of these weapons and was quite concerned that this was not the place for these weapons . ”
Issa was also unaware that an LRAD was present at his rally , Dvorac stated .
She defended the public ’s concern over Sheriff Gore ’s deployment of the LRAD at public rallies .
“ If he ca n’t handle this type of situation , or will handle it in the same manner that he handled the Ruby Ridge incident , people have a right to question that , because this is about their safety and the safety of the community , ” she said , referring to Gore citing his Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination in refusing to testify during an inquiry into the Ruby Ridge incident in which he participated as a member of the FBI S.W.A.T. team and head of the FBI ’s Seattle office .
Dvorac called use of the device as a loudspeaker “ overkill . ”
She observed , “ A P.A. ( public address ) system would be a lot cheaper than the $ 40,000 the Sheriff ’s office put out for this device … and there is a lot of training required that you need to know going in and using something of this nature …
I would hate to see kids at a sandcastle contest and something disastrous happens .
There is always the opportunity .
It ’s been explained to me by people who are familiar and have actually used and handled it , that you could brush up against it and a switch could go off , and this could result in death . ”
The reporter confirmed that the manufacturer American Technology Corporation in San Diego , markets the device on its website for use against terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan , and to repel pirates .
She concluded , “ They do n’t market this as something you can use at the beach for kids with a sandcastle building contest . ”
Roaring : Among big cat fans the roar is the ultimate form of communication .
Only the great cats can roar ; that is , the tiger , lion , jaguar and leopard -- but not the snow leopard .
The ability to roar is what differentiates a ' great ' cat from a ' big ' cat .
In great cats the structure of bones supporting the larynx , and anchoring the throat and tongue , ( called the hyoid ) is connected with an elastic ligament as against more bone .
This can be stretched by up to a third ( eight or nine inches ) , so opening the air passages and allowing the roar to be produced .
Though the snow leopard has this modification it is in a somewhat primitive form and that cat has never been recorded as roaring .
Utilised in long - range communication the roar is infrequently used .
Easily heard for over 3 km , it advertises location and warns away other tigers , or attracts them when the search for a mate is on .
Sometimes it is sounded after a successful kill , but never during the actual attack which is carried out in silence .
Lions may be extend their roaring so it continues for one or two minutes ; this encourages members of the pride to join in .
The roar of the solitary tiger is usually very short in duration .
Mating is when roaring is heard most often ; tigers are at their noisiest when on heat and breeding .
During a roar the ears are laid back and rotated so the backs are visible , the nose wrinkles and the eyes narrow .
Moans : Roars may be preceded with a long , low moaning noise .
Softer versions of the moan are used in communication between mother and cubs .
Growls and Snarls : Growls and snarls are easily the most common form of communication , with the growl being aggressive , while the snarl is defensive .
The tigers shown on this page and the next are both snarling .
Growls can turn into a hissing or spitting very similar to that produced by a domestic cat .
Purring :
This is something of a dilemma .
Some people claim to have heard it in the tiger , but many experts feel it is almost certain that tigers do not , and cannot purr in the same way that the small cats can .
Chuffing or Prusten : The ' chuff ' or ' prusten ' is considered to be a friendly and non-threatening alternative to purring .
In German , prusten means to sneeze , snort , or suddenly burst out laughing .
This low - intensity sound is produced by holding the mouth closed and snorting through the nostrils .
In the wild prusten is used when two tigers meet on neutral territory , while captive tigers sometimes start to use it with keepers .
Pook :
Another unusual sound which may be made is the ' pook ' .
This is very similar to the sound made by the sambar , a favourite prey animal of the tiger .
Because of this fact some experts think it may be a form of mimicry .
By imitating the deer the tiger could elicit a reply , so locating the precise whereabouts of lunch .
Local hunters also believe that the Amur ( Siberian ) tiger imitates the wapiti deer by producing the roaring of a stag during mating season .
These ideas are still to be proven and those who disagree point out it is equally likely any attempt at mimicry could spook the prey .
Other sounds :
The tiger 's range of sound is quite wide and they also meow , grunt and make a type of woofing noise .

When 3dfx started showing off the original Voodoo Graphics 3D accelerator card , many people thought the trade - show demonstrations had to be cheating , with an expensive hidden 3D workstation actually producing the graphics .
( Ten years earlier , people had thought the same thing about the Amiga . )
But 3dfx 's Voodoo Graphics card was real , and it was a few long steps ahead of anything 3dfx 's competitors could manage .
If 3dfx had never existed , though , we 'd still have 3D graphics cards today .
They would n't necessarily be much slower than they are now , either .
Almost - true - 3D games like Doom and Duke Nukem 3D had already sold zillions of copies by the time the 3dfx cards arrived , and the original Quake came out the same year as the first Voodoo .
And there were a hatful of other graphics - card companies - PowerVR , Rendition , S3 , Matrox , and the obviously - never - going - to - be- major - players Nvidia and ATI - all beavering away at 3D accelerators for arcade games and home PCs .
This is how technology often develops .
If someone sees a demand , they 're usually not the only one to see it .
The precise sequence in which people come up with inventions , though , can sometimes make a very big difference .
Take trains , for instance .
Trains have some great strengths , but they 're not good at climbing hills .
Robert Stephenson did n't think a locomotive would ever be able to pull a load up a grade steeper than 1 in 100 .
Later locos proved him wrong , but unless they 're fitted with cog -drive contraptions , even modern trains still need pretty flat tracks .
A locomotive 's pulling power is limited not by its engine - power or gearing , but by the small contact patches between the steel driven wheels and the steel rails .
Steel - on - steel gives you a lot less traction than rubber - on - tarmac - or possibly even rubber - on - dirt .
Once the rails are built , a railway is a very economical way of moving people and goods .
But the building stage is a nightmare .
Laying flat tracks across Europe and the USA was a very , very serious undertaking .
When a railway crosses a river you need a bridge .
Where it meets a mountain range you need cuttings , tunnels and probably a lot more bridges .
The US railways had to cover huge distances , and cut costs by building lots and lots of wooden trestle bridges instead of sturdier , less flammable masonry or iron bridges , but every process for laying rails across a country was ruinously expensive .
( Around this time , there was a speculative frenzy in Britain called " Railway Mania " .
Shares in railways - under - construction traded far above any sane estimate of their value , and lots of shares were sold in completely fraudulent ventures .
The most obviously fake proposed railways were the ones that promised long , as - the - crow - flies runs of track through roller - coaster countryside .
They would have needed a dozen or two Millau Viaducts , at the very least . )
A lot of cuttings and tunnels and bridges could have been avoided , or at least been a great deal simpler and less expensive , if someone had come up with motorised road transport - trucks - before they invented trains .
Exactly one invention made trucks , and automobiles , possible : The pneumatic tyre .
There were , you see , roadgoing " steam carriages " long before the internal - combustion engine became practical .
People were making steam carriages very early in the history of the railway - only shortly after someone figured out that locomotives probably should n't have legs .
There 's no reason why a steam - powered truck can't work well ; steam cars were quite popular in the early days of the automobile , and a big heavy - duty steam truck with a trailer or three could run on widely - available fuels like coal or wood , just like a steam train , instead of refined petroleum .
( Steam cars generally did run on refined petroleum , because liquid fuel is easy to deliver to a burner .
It 's not practical to have to shovel coal into a firebox to keep your car going , but a huge steam truck could work OK that way . )
Early steam carriages , though , all ran on ordinary wooden cartwheels , with solid iron or steel hoop " tyres " shrunk onto them for durability , not traction .
Cartwheels with or without metal tyres are only moderately dangerous when your carriage is pulled by sure - footed animals .
If you start trying to get a vehicle to go , stop and turn entirely through its wheels , though , the miserably low strength and adhesion of those sorts of wheels puts very serious limits on your steam carriage 's performance , and safety .
( Steam carriages also had a distressing tendency to explode , not least because boiler construction and operation was still a very young art .
As everybody who 's read J. E. Gordon 's classic works on strong materials and structures knows , it actually took engineers a while to figure out that box - shaped boilers were a bad idea .
Stationary , shipboard and locomotive boilers also did n't have to put up with rough treatment ; jiggling a questionably - constructed boiler around on top of cartwheels running on rough roads is a good way to make it angry .
But the same technological advancements that made locomotive and ship explosions a rarity would have worked on steam - carriages too , if only they had decent tyres . )
Solid rubber tyres had existed for years by the time the steam carriage was invented , but solid rubber tyres are scarcely better than steel - rimmed cartwheels for a vehicle with a built - in engine , as opposed to one that 's pulled by animals .
They protect the road from damage , not the vehicle and passengers .
The basic cartwheel structure actually hung on well into the early automobile days .
The original Ford Model T ran on wooden " artillery wheels " , which are essentially just cartwheels upgraded to tolerate lateral loads .
But the Model T had pneumatic tyres , which make all the difference .
A fellow called Robert William Thomson invented a rather impractical pneumatic tyre in 1846 .
His " Aerial Wheels " were a step in the right direction , and apparently even quite durable , with the critical advance of a rubber inner tube filled with compressed air , but with an outer casing made of leather .
The Aerial Wheel was n't meant for wheel - driven vehicles , though , because those barely even existed in 1846 .
The first pedal - driven " boneshaker " bicycles , which were so named because of their steel - shod wheels and lack of any kind of suspension , were still 20 years away ; the famous penny - farthing arrived about another decade later again .
Thomson intended the Aerial Wheels only to make horse - drawn vehicles ride more smoothly and make a lot less noise , and they apparently achieved this very well .
All of the pieces were in place for proper pneumatic tyres in the 1840s , but nobody put them together .
If someone like Thomson had constructed an inner - tube tyre with an outer layer made from tough rubber instead of leather , the job would have been done .
You need to vulcanise rubber to make it tough enough to work as a tyre for powered vehicles , but Charles Goodyear figured out how to do that around 1840 .
News did n't move as fast then as it does now , but even if it took a few years for someone to learn about the Aerial Wheel and vulcanised rubber , and a few more years to come up with a working product , you 'd think there would have been a rubber pneumatic tyre ready to be displayed at the Great Exhibition of 1851 .
But it was actually not until 1887 , some 41 years after Thomson 's Aerial Wheel , before John Boyd Dunlop invented the thin - walled inflatable bicycle tyre that led to proper car tyres .
( The final part of the recipe for the " modern " tyre is internal reinforcement to stiffen the tyre and stop it from , for instance , folding over on hard cornering .
It took until 1904 for the first cord - reinforced tyres to hit the market .
The modern " steel - belted radial " tyre has steel - wire reinforcements that 're wound at right angles to the tyre 's direction of travel , which has a number of benefits , including better road traction and lower rolling resistance .
Older " bias - ply " tyres have only diagonal windings , which makes them less rigid ; for low - speed off - road motoring , this is actually a good thing . )
So far as I can see , there really was n't much stopping someone from coming up with a quite effective pneumatic - tyred steam carriage in , say , 1850 , when the USA only had a twentieth of the railways that it would have by 1890 .
If this had happened , a lot of passengers and goods would have ended up being moved via steam - truck on cheap roads , rather than via iron - horse on expensive rails .
And if a tyre - inventor had put their thinking caps on a few decades earlier still , the train may never have taken off at all .
We 'd doubtless still have some sort of trains today , but we probably would n't have nearly as many railways , and the 19th century would have been very different .
It would have given an easier outlet to the desperate pressure to have some way , any way , to move great quantities of goods and people overland .
Nobody would have bothered spending fortunes to cut tunnels through mountains when they could just run a road over them .
As it was , the railways stole a march on the roadways .
By the time someone made a car that was steered with a wheel instead of a tiller - but which still ran on bloody cartwheels - the world already had enough railways to reach to the moon .
In computing , there was a critical trains - or - trucks moment in 1981 .
That was the year when IBM made their original " Personal Computer " , and went completely against their nature by giving the new PC an " open architecture " .
Mere months later , Compaq made the first " clone " PC , and the rest was history .
If IBM had n't made this strangely charitable move , the PC platform simply would n't have existed .
Perhaps that would have made some kind of Apple the global standard ; perhaps Acorn or Commodore or , heck , Sinclair or someone would have ended up dominating .
Perhaps by now there 'd still be five different equally - popular platforms , so economies of scale did n't apply as much and a decent desktop computer would still cost $ 5000 .
Could be worse , though .
You could be trying to get to a LAN party in a steam carriage .
A wave of violence targeted at anti-mining protesters has ripped through Cabañas in north - eastern El Salvador , and Pacific Rim Mining Corporation , the mid-size Canadian company which has spent millions in its effort to exploit the area ’s ample gold deposits has remained curiously silent on the attacks .
A wave of violence targeted at anti-mining protesters has ripped through Cabañas in north - eastern El Salvador , and Pacific Rim Mining Corporation , the mid-size Canadian company which has lost millions in its effort to exploit the area ’s ample gold deposits has remained curiously silent on the attacks .
Last month , Marcelo Rivera , a prominent anti-mining activist , community leader and FMLN member was forcibly disappeared by unknown assailants .
Though many organizations immediately denounced his disappearance , police failed to act quickly enough to alter his fate .
Rivera ’s disfigured body was found dumped in a well two weeks after he was last seen alive .
Rivera was well - known in Cabañas .
He headed a local community center and founded Amigos of San Isidro , an organization that formed part of the main coalition of groups that opposed the re-opening of the El Dorado mine , where Pacific Rim intends to set up shop .
According to the Salvadoran daily , Diario Co-latino , Rivera ’s funeral was attended by hundreds of “ children , youth and elders all crying at the same time . ”
" He fought against the mining threat from the perspective of a teacher , a cultural promoter , a director of a community organization , and as a political leader " , says Francisco Piñeda , a local environmentalist , also quoted in Co-latino .
Instead of merely sending a signal , Rivera ’s murder has marked the start of an open season against anyone openly opposed to the El Dorado mine .
On Monday July 28 , parish priest Father Luis Quintanilla was traveling from Victoria to Sensuntepeque after his weekly radio broadcast when his vehicle was forcibly pulled over by three men wearing ski masks .
According to published video testimony , Quintanilla and narrowly escaped under a nearby fence after his assailants were distracted by Quintanilla ’s own inadvertently ( or not ? ) triggered car alarm .
Before the roadside assault , Quintanilla had already been the target of threats .
The priest had received a volley of cell phone text messages , one of which read : “ Extermination : you ’ve been warned to stop f**king around .
You better shut your mouths if you do n’t want us to shut them once and for all . ”
Another said : ” Extermination > you mother - f** kers better stop stirring people up if you do n’t want to end up like Marcelo .
We ’ve got eyes on you . ”
Last week , the government ’s Human Rights Ombudsman , Oscar Luna , held a special press conference to denouce threats made against three reporters at Radio Victoria , a community - based radio station out of Cuidad Victoria .
News gatherers Ludwin Iraheta , José Beltrán , and Vladimir Ayala , ages 17,18 , and 20 years old respectively , received messages over the course of the past month stating , “ you ’re on the list , ” and “ you ’ll be next . ”
The most threatenening stated , “ Be careful , because they spoke too much in San Isidro , ” a direct reference to the Rivera assassination .
The Radio Victoria staff have been among the most prominent voices to denounce the proposed gold mine plans , and they were the first to denounce their friend Marcelo ’s disappearance .
After his death , they are calling for a full investigation .
Rivera ’s assassination , the assault on Father Quintanilla and the ongoing threats accent a already tense climate in a place which saw voting suspended in San Isidro during January ’s legislative election after allegations emerged that Mayor José Ignacio Bautista from the ARENA party was contracting voters across the nearby border with Honduras to stack the polls in his favor .
When a re-vote was held a week later , Bautista won .
Rumors of fraud fell to a murmur in this isolated rural town of 10,000 , but open scars remained in the wake of the election battle .
Mining Rights , Mining Wrongs
The prospect of re-initiating gold mining - as - economic - development - strategy in El Salvador has stirred passions on both sides of the debate .
Mining advocates mostly hail from the ARENA and PCN political parties — heirs of the deathsquad - sponsoring governments of the 1980’s .
The two parties rule 100 % of the Mayor ’s offices and Municipal Councils in the Cabañas Department .
Together , they carry big sticks in the national Legislative Assembly , where PCN deputies have been the chief sponsors of revamping the El Salvador ’s relatively restrictive mining laws .
Ex -President Francisco
Flores ’s environmental ministry issued a series of exploration permits to two gold mining companies in 1996 — the first such permits to be issued in decades .
But last year , cracks in ARENA ’s traditional rural power base emerged when ranchers in Cabañas noticed that the plentiful springs they used to water crops and livestock were mysteriously drying up .
Upon investigation , ranchers found what local people long had suspected : the exploratory drill holes utilized by Pacific Rim to estimate gold deposits were re-channeling underground streams and drastically impacting the aquifer .
Under its exploration permit issued by the Saca government , Pacific Rim drilled hundreds of holes , each one carefully documented by the company itself , with meticulous data made available for stockholders ( and anyone else ) to see on its website .
This , aghast residents asked , and the company has n’t even begun mining ?
The movement opposed to Pacific Rim ’s presence in Cabañas had been active since 2005 , but as the truth about exploratory holes began to ripple through Cabañas , participation in anti-mining events burgeoned .
Residents became active through a combination of community and faith - based organizing .
They spoke about the impacts of the holes , and explained the dangers of cyanide leach mining on the water table .
The leap was not a hard one to make for folks who had already seen their water disappear .
Soon , the conservative Archbishop of San Salvador , Fernando Saenz Lacalle , was declaring , “ Not one drop of cyanide should enter El Salvador . ”
“ " We are a very small and densely populated country that has already suffered enough . "
In response , Pacific Rim attempted to buy public support — or at least quell resistance with a PR campaign touting the virtues of " Minería verde , " or “ green mining ” campaign touted the benefits of mining projects on local development .
Worried about the potential effectiveness of such a campaign , the National Roundtable Against Metallic Mining was born .
Word crawled up the political ladder , and ex-President Tony Saca and the ARENA leadership were caught in a bind .
Behind in the polls to a charismatic TV host named Mauricio Funes and facing the most contentious election in 25 years , a virtual mutiny was taking place in ARENA circles .
The party ’s leadership was forced to decide between issuing mining permits to Pacific Rim and risking a fissure in its well - oiled Cabañas electoral machine .
The other option was to abandon the party ’s traditional pro-business stance and suture the ecological and political wounds inflicted by Pacific Rim to preserve the possibility of electoral victory .
Saca banked on the electoral victory .
One week before the election he announced that no new excavation permits would be offered to Pacific Rim .
( Note : late enough in the campaign that no offended donor could recoup any donations )
Amid rumors that Pacific Rim would sue El Salvador under foreign investor protection rules outlined in the Central American Free Trade Agreement , Saca responded soundly : “ I would rather pay the $ 90 million than issue the permit . ”
( A defeatist attitude , considering that no suit had yet been filed .
Meanwhile , the San Salvador - based Center for Trade and Investment Research , CEICOM , declared that the government had the evidence to defeat any case brought against it , and that win or lose no payment should be made . )
Saca ’s new found role as bulwark against foreign corporate intrusion and defender of the public interest may have surprised some who had followed his politics during the course of his five year term .
After all , Saca ’s own 2004 campaign was predicated on reaping the benefits of international investment that CAFTA would rain on El Salvador .
But Saca ’s turnaround on mining only highlights the severity of the political crisis he and the rest of ARENA faced ( and still face ) in Cabañas generally and San Isidro specifically .
Pacific Rim , for its part , has been facing its own crisis before and since the election .
Much of the company ’s business model was built around the promise of return on its El Dorado holdings .
With public opinion , the Catholic Church , and the current government opposed to El Dorado , the company is now banking on a $ 77 million dollar arbitration claim in the CAFTA courts .
The company recently announced its third straight loss year .
Its shares on the NYSE are trading at 22 cents .
Pacific
Rim liquidated its holdings in another mine to gain cash .
The company ’s FY2009 report glibly revealed that the COO and CEO have been released .
The President and CEO have taken large pay decreases .
The Current Wave of Violence
With the election firmly in rearview , mining advocates in Cabañas have little incentive for good behavior .
The current wave of violence and politically motivated assassination is equivalent to a form of social cleansing — an extra-judicial form of exterminating the political enemies of Cabañas ’s ruling elite .
It is unclear what role Pacific Rim has had in the recent wave of violence , but the company ’s curious silence and it ’s refusal to denounce violence against anti-mining activists has led people in Cabañas to wonder whether the company , in addition to its arbitration suit , is not also seeking other forms of retaliation .
“ We want a professional investigation .
These [ perpetrators ] are people paid for by those in power and economic interests like Pacific Rim are present , ” said Elín Jordan , a member of the Community - radio Network , ARPAS .

A team of divers has recovered nearly $ 23 million worth of gold from the icy waters off Argentina 's south - eastern coast , a source close to the recovery operation said .
The cargo of gold and silver sank in January on board a ship named the Polar Mist , which disappeared off Argentina 's Patagonian coast in bad weather .
A marine recovery outfit raised the haul from the depths of the south Atlantic and transported it to an Argentine customs facility , where it was weighed in front of a federal judge , the source said .
The ill - fated vessel sank on January 18 at a depth of 80 metres , around 40 kilometres off the coast of Santa Cruz , prompting a search for its 9.4 tonnes of gold and silver .
After months of negotiations between the shipment 's owners and insurers , the C - Sailor search ship located the wreck on June 23 and confirmed the cargo was still aboard .
The Polar Mist was scheduled to make a stop in Punta Arenas , a port in Chile 's southern tip , and then head north to Santiago .
The load was to be flown from the Chilean capital to Switzerland .
The British insurance company Lloyd's , which insured the cargo , hired Dutch recovery company Mammoet to locate the ship after it disappeared .
Mammoet in turn contracted C - Sailor for the job .
In July , divers from the C - Sailor recovered the first of nine baskets of the precious cargo from the ocean bottom .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
In America today , prices are just as likely to be falling as rising .
For the first time since the 1950s , consumer prices are actually lower than they were a year earlier .
The Labor Department reported Friday that the consumer price index was unchanged in July .
In the past year , the CPI has fallen 2.1 % , the largest drop since 1950 .
See full story .
It 's mostly energy prices that have fallen over the past year , but it 's not entirely a story about oil .
Non-energy prices have risen just 1.8 % in the past year , one of the slowest gains since the 1960s .
The last time non-energy prices rose so slowly , the Federal Reserve was sounding alarm bells about deflation .
That 's one big reason that the Fed kept interest rates so low in 2003 and 2004 .
Is the Fed going down the same perilous path again ?
Will the Fed keep rates low for too long ?
That 's the worry of people who fear that inflation may still emerge as the greatest danger to the nation 's long - term economic health .
There 's one big difference between then and now , however .
Asset deflation .
In 2002 and 2003 , home prices were rising almost 11 % .
The Fed 's low interest rates were fueling the housing bubble .
Today , home prices are falling at a 10 % annual rate .
The Fed 's low interest rates are n't fueling much of anything .
There are other big differences too , that might suggest inflation wo n't be a worry for a while .
Unemployment is at 9.4 % , about 4 or 5 percentage points above its natural level .
With unemployment so high , workers have no ability to demand higher wages .
Only about two - thirds of the nation 's manufacturing capacity is operating .
Utilization in other industries , such as construction and retail , is also very low .
With so much slack capacity and so much competition , no firm can raise prices .
Inflation rates wo n't stay flat forever , but it does n't look like they 'll be soaring out of control any time soon .

Plug -in Prius conversions are great .
Excellent fuel economy , not much in the way of emissions and more tech than a Cray XMP .
Trouble is , you can't go very fast on electricity alone because Toyota limits the Prius to a top speed of 34 mph in all - electric mode .
Not any more .
The guys at Plug In Conversions have developed software that 'll let you do 70 mph in a plug - in Prius running on battery power alone .
Install the kit with one of the company 's pricey plug - in conversions - and you have to , because the software does n't work with anyone else 's conversion - and your fuel economy could hit as much as 170 mpg .
“ What we ’re essentially offering is all - electric performance for about 25 miles at highway speeds , ” company founder and president Kim Adelman said .
“ The car is no longer limited to 34 miles per hour , all - electric .
This also allows a Prius to perform much like the Chevy Volt , but for a much lower cost . ”
Assuming you already own a Prius , of course .
If you do n't , then the Volt is probably cheaper .
Plug In Conversions calls the software " a breakthrough " because it is the first time a plug - in hybrid can run at highway speeds on the battery alone .
These guys , located in Poway , Calif. , are building on the fine Southern California tradition of hot - rodding cars by applying it to 21st century auto tech .
Gotta love 'em for it .
The software is based on technology developed by Ewert Energy Systems .
Other plug - in conversions might let you achieve 52 mph on electric power , but Ewert co-founder Andrew Ewert says they do so by using a " forced stealth mode " that requires the electric motor to run faster than is recommended .
They also require drivers to stop and restart the car before the gasoline engine can engage , a move Ewert says can compromise safety and emissions .
" Our system allows the gas engine to turn on instantly , when needed , and allows us to initiate controlled engine warm - up at any time to meet strict emissions standards , thus eliminating the traditional problems of a cold start , " he said .
If you 're a hypermiler , or someone who simply wants to boost your fuel economy , Plug In Conversions has you covered there , too .
Install the software kit with one of the company 's plug - in conversion kits and you 're looking at as much as 170 mpg - a figure the company says has been confirmed by tests ( shown in the picture ) at Argonne National Laboratory .
The conversion ain't cheap , though .
The kit , now in its third generation , replaces the Toyota 's 1.3 kilowatt - hour nickel metal hydride battery with a 6.1 kilowatt - hour pack .
It costs $ 12,500 .
So is a Prius decked out with all this tech cheaper than a Volt ?
That depends .
General Motors has n't said what the Chevrolet Volt range - extended EV will cost when production begins late next year , but GM is widely believed to be aiming for $ 40,000 .
Toss in the $ 7,500 tax credit the car is expected to earn you and the bottom line is $ 32,500 .
A new Prius , on the other hand , starts at $ 22,000 .
The Plug In Conversions software is expected to cost between $ 2,000 and $ 2,500 when it becomes available later this summer .
Add in the plug - in conversion kit and your final price is at least $ 36,500 .
Adelman told Edmunds.com that most people who opt for a plug - in conversion do n't start with a new car , so their cost is far lower .
UPDATE 4:15 p.m. Eastern June 11 : A couple of points to address questions raised by commenters :
@ The Voice .
We 've written about the Raser H2 .
Twice , in fact .
You can find a those stories here and here .
@thebike45 : Good point about the battery warranty / lifespan ; that was our mistake for omitting it .
The battery is warrantied for three years and its expected lifespan is 10 years .
The battery recharges in six hours using a 110 - volt line .
As for the plug - in MPG figure , " miles per gallon " is commonly used to state the fuel economy of plug - in hybrid vehicles , with the term specifically used by Argonne National Laboratory in this report titled " Test Procedures and Benchmarking Blended - Type and EV - Capable Plug - In Hybrid Vehicles . "
As another commenter noted , nowhere in the piece do we say " lithium ion " battery , though we do know the term applies to several types of battery chemistries .

The Human / Dog Hybrid photos that resurface and make the rounds every now and then on email sharing lists and blogs are back .
I remember seeing this photo shared a few years ago .
The human dog hybrid is a real photograph , not shopped , of one of the works of Australian sculptor , Patricia Piccinini .
It ’s her interpertation of what a creature would look like if human and animal DNA were successfully combined .
The sculpture is actually from 2002 - 2003 and it ’s name is “ The Young Family ” and is part of a larger collection of work called “ We Are Family . ”
In March , Paltalk Holdings leveled a hefty $ 90 million lawsuit against software giant Microsoft .
Paltalk 's claim centered on two of its patents , which create a solution for computers to effectively communicate with one another in online - gaming situations .
As it turns out , Paltalk 's claim stood on strong enough legs for Microsoft to settle the case for an undisclosed sum , midway through the trial , in June .
Paltalk certainly has an opportunity to cash in .
Now , Paltalk has its sights set on a number of other game - industry heavyweights , including Sony Computer Entertainment and several of its divisions , Activision Blizzard , NCsoft , Turbine , and Jagex .
At issue , again , is Paltalk 's computer - to - computer synchronization patents , which , as noted by Paltalk 's lawyer Max Tribble as part of its Microsoft suit , involve " technology for ways to control interactive applications over multiple computers . "
Paltalk 's current suit does n't shy away from the high - profile games in each of the aforementioned company 's catalogues .
Games specifically named in Paltalk 's suit that are purportedly in violation of the company 's patents include Guerrilla Games ' Killzone 2 , Evolution Studios ' Motorstorm , EverQuest I and II , Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare and World at War , World of Warcraft , Guild Wars , Lord of the Rings Online , and Runescape .
Notably , Paltalk 's suit notes that Sony , Activision , and Blizzard had previously been licensees of the technology , which it bought from Mpath Interactive in 2001 .
The suit notes that as early as 1997 , Sony had allegedly used Mpath 's technology as part of its Web site The Station .
Likewise , Activision had allegedly begun using the technology in 1997 , while Blizzard had purportedly employed the same patents since 1995 .
Due to what it claims to be a willful violation of its patents , Paltalk is seeking damages that total three times what they would normally be against Sony , Activision , and Blizzard .
The company has also petitioned the court to prevent the companies from continuing to violate its patents , among other requests .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Under pressure to take steps to restore faith in the markets , the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday proposed to ban " flash trading " and impose new regulations on credit - rating agencies .
The SEC proposals would to stop the practice of exchanges " flashing " an order it receives to some of its participants , rather than seeking out a seller in a competing exchange or marketplace , and would tighten up on credit raters that were considered key contributors to the economic crisis because of their excessively glowing outlooks for subprime - backed securities .
Seeking to solve an inequity in the trading systems , commissioners voted unanimously to propose barring exchanges and trading platforms from allowing their high frequency trader clients to see data about stock orders one second or less before the market gets the information .
This so called " flash trading , " system permits high frequency traders to get information just before it becomes public .
The SEC also voted unanimously to introduce a variety of rating agency rules , including a measure that would require corporations to disclose " pre-ratings " obtained from rating agencies before a rating firm is actually selected to conduct a rating .
The pre-rating measure is intended to eliminate a practice known as " ratings shopping , " in which an investment bank hired by a corporation privately solicits preliminary ratings from multiple agencies for a securitized product and then only pays for and discloses the most favorable rating received .
The provision seeks to help investors gain a better picture about the corporation 's security rating .
Raters would have to disclose who paid for their ratings and whether it or any of its affiliates provided any services to the corporation receiving the debt rating .
The commissioners also agreed to adopt a rule -- supported by the White House -- that will require raters to disclose to its competitors its data and process for determining a particular credit rating .
Rival raters receiving the data would need to use it to produce a secondary rating .
The agency 's goal would be to have multiple ratings for the same product , which would improve the credibility of the ratings .
All three measures were expected after SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro indicated in August that the commission was expected to consider the rules .
" The changes being considered today will benefit investors in many ways , " Schapiro said .
" The rules we are proposing or adopting will help address conflicts of interest , and prevent ratings shopping , which have to do to improve the reliability of the ratings process . "
The agency also proposed a series of other credit - rating agency measures , including a provision that would have rating agencies disclose their entire history of ratings within a year for corporate paid ratings .
The measure would seek to provide investors with information about whether a cozy relationship exists between the corporation seeking the rating and the rating firm issuing it .
It expands on an existing disclosure rule which requires raters to provide a 10 % rating sample of its rating history .
Raters sought a one - year lag before its historical information is disclosed because they believed more frequent disclosure would hurt their ability to obtain and retain businesses .
Flash trading
With the existing flash - trading approach , potential sellers use high - speed technology to see the buy order and respond within a fraction of second .
If no buy order takes place , the exchange will route the offer to other markets .
Already some exchanges are voluntarily prohibiting flash trading .
Nasdaq said in early August that it was eliminating flash orders .
However , Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , said he was pleased with the proposal , which he said would enshrine the prohibition .
Schumer had pressed SEC to ban flash trades early August .
" This ban , as proposed , is pretty much water - tight and should not be weakened by the commission as the rule - making process goes forward , " Schumer said .
" This proposal will once and for all get rid of flash trading , which , if left untouched , could seriously undermine the fairness and transparency of our markets . "
Credit - rating agencies
However , Schapiro 's credit rating agency proposal also has many critics , who believe corporations will still find ways to get confidential preliminary ratings without disclosing that fact .
Sean Egan , a founder of Egan Jones Rating Co. , said major raters may not give the corporation or the investment banker representing it a written pre-rating once the disclosure rule would go into effect .
Instead , he said , a rater could quietly give the pre-rating " orally , " to the corporation 's banker , perpetuating the system of pre-rating .
The SEC is also proposing that corporations disclose any changes in a credit rating on a material change form 8 - K that would be filed with the agency .
The regulator is also proposing to rescind an agency rule that exempts raters from certain securities - act liabilities .
Kathleen Casey , GOP commissioner at the agency , indicated that the agency may be over - doing it with so many conflict of interest prohibitions .
" It will lead to further costs and anticompetitive effects , " said Casey .
" Higher - quality ratings will come when investors punish raters by going to their competitors if they continue to misrate securities . "
Rating agencies have come under stinging criticism for their role in the financial crisis , in part because many of the leading firms gave AAA ratings -- the highest mark available -- to problematic mortgage securities made up of subprime loans .

A founder member of the Fathers 4 Justice protest group has won an eight - year battle over access to his daughter .
Jonathan Stanesby , 44 , was jailed for two months last year for climbing on to Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman 's roof dressed as a superhero .
He also cuffed himself to ex-Children 's Minister Margaret Hodge to protest that he could only see his daughter one weekend every two weeks .
But following an agreement with his ex-partner , he has now obtained joint custody of his daughter .
Stanesby said yesterday : " My daughter is now living with me half the time and she 's chuffed - it's what we 've always wanted .
I 'm obviously elated but I 'm also very bitter about the whole experience .
It destroys your life .
I 'm still paying fines , I 'm still in debt , and I 'll probably never be able to go back to the work I loved now that I 've been to prison . "
The Fathers 4 Justice stunts began after Stanesby and his partner split in 2000 .
Stanesby , from Ivybridge , Devon , fought for shared residence and said : " I had a spacious house , I had great references , I was a registered childminder , the perfect picture of a dad .
Then I went to court and I was completely and utterly humiliated .
" I was so angry - I left it a week then I climbed on to the Plymouth Courts ' roof .
With Fathers 4
Justice , I do n't want to see something I 've started go to pieces so I 'll continue .
But my family comes first - that was always the reason in the first place . "
Traditional religious leaders in India have been left scratching their heads in amazement at new developments in the country .
A cult of sorts is forming in the country , with their beliefs centered around the Godess , Radha .
Apparently , men are dressing up and living as women to be more like Radha , the godess lover of Krishna .
One of those men is retired railway worker from New Delhi .
V K Saxena , 72 , said :
“ I ca n’t put it into words properly but I feel more holy dressed as a woman .
The Lord told me he wanted me as his bride . ”
When asked what he thought of the new practice of dressing in women ’s clothing to be closer to God , Senior priest Mohammad Ahangar replied : “ There are many ways to be closer to the Lord without trying to be his girlfriend . ”
Bridging the gap .
Memristors can integrate with existing computing hardware .
( Image : J. J. Yang , HP Labs )
In the 18 months since the “ missing link of electronics ” was discovered in Hewlett - Packard ’s laboratories in Silicon Valley , California , memristors have spawned a hot new area of physics and raised hope of electronics becoming more like brains .
Now the same team have upgraded a standard silicon chip with a layer of memristors to show that the novel component can play nicely with existing computing hardware .
That suggests it may not be long before they reach the market .
And that in turn is good news for manufacturers , who need to find a new way to keep computer power growing : the methods that have shrunk computers in recent years look to have reached their limits .

Decreasing returns
Memristors behave a bit like resistors , which simply resist the flow of electric current .
But rather than only respond to present conditions , a memristor can also “ remember ” the last current it experienced .
That ’s an ability that would usually require many different components .
“ Each memristor can take the place of 7 to 12 transistors , ” says Stan Williams , head of HP ’s memristor research .
What ’s more , it can hold its memory without power .
By contrast , “ transistors require power at all times and so there is a significant power loss through leakage currents ” , Williams explains .
A memristor ’s memory of its last current can be read by watching how it creates a new memory as it responds to a new current .
They are made from a double layer of semiconducting titanium dioxide – the pigment in white paint .
Memristor array
Williams and his colleagues patterned 10,000 memristors on top of an ordinary CMOS chip .
“ The biggest technical challenge for building the hybrid circuit was the fact that the CMOS circuit had a highly irregular surface , ” says Williams .
Even bumps only one ten - thousandth of a millimetre high would be too large , so complex physical and chemical polishing was required .
The memristor array is made from a criss - crossing grid of 100 - by - 100 conducting wires .
Each junction between two wires sandwiches titanium dioxide and acts as a memristor .
A series of copper connections link the guts of the original chip with its new memristive top coat .
Flexible chip
That new memristor array can take over some tasks of the CMOS circuit beneath .
“ The new hybrid system lifts the data - routing network and the switches out of the CMOS plane , ” says Williams .
“ This will greatly free up the space on the CMOS layer for more devices , effectively increasing the density of circuits , ” he says , without the need to shrink the transistors any further .
Adding the memristors has given a fixed silicon chip similar properties to a field - programmable gate array , a kind of chip that can be physically reconfigured on the fly to prototype new circuit designs without building many fixed designs , says Williams .
It has also proved that memristors can integrate with standard silicon hardware .
Learning machines
The similarities between memristive circuits and the behaviour of some simple organisms suggests the hybrid devices could also open the way for “ neuromorphic ” computing , says Williams , in which computers learn for themselves , like animals .
Wei Lu , a memristor researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , says the new device is a “ significant step forward ” in the development of nanoelectronic circuits .
Showing that nanoscale memristors can be made on top of existing chips “ will certainly stimulate additional interest from the semiconductor industry and academia ” , he says .
The speed of such hybrid devices needs to improve , Lu adds .
“ However , continued development of the memristor devices may fundamentally change the way we design and fabricate integrated circuits in the future . ”

Today , a federal appeals court ruled that former Attorney General John Ashcroft may be held liable for the wrongful detention of people held as witnesses after the 9/11 attacks .
The ACLU filed the lawsuit .
Snip from New York Times :
In a harshly worded ruling handed down Friday , a three - judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals called the government 's use of material witnesses after Sept. 11 " repugnant to the Constitution and a painful reminder of some of the most ignominious chapters of our national history . "
The court found that a man who was detained as a witness in a federal terrorism case can sue Ashcroft for allegedly violating his constitutional rights .
Abdullah Al - Kidd , a U.S. citizen and former University of Idaho student , filed the lawsuit in 2005 , claiming his civil rights were violated when he was detained as a material witness for two weeks after 9/11 .
Appeals Court Rules Against Ashcroft in 9 / 11 Case ( NYT )
The court also ruled that the federal material witness law can't be used to " preventively " detain or investigate suspects .
The ACLU represents al - Kidd in the case , al - Kidd v. Ashcroft .
Snip from their press release :
Writing for the majority in today 's decision , Judge Milan D. Smith , Jr. , wrote , " Framers of our Constitution would have disapproved of the arrest , detention , and harsh confinement of a United States citizen as a ' material witness ' under the circumstances , and for the immediate purpose alleged , in al - Kidd 's complaint .
Sadly , however , even now , more than 217 years after the ratification of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution , some confidently assert that the government has the power to arrest and detain or restrict American citizens for months on end , in sometimes primitive conditions , not because there is evidence that they have committed a crime , but merely because the government wishes to investigate them for possible wrongdoing , or to prevent them from having contact with others in the outside world .
We find this to be repugnant to the Constitution , and a painful reminder of some of the most ignominious chapters of our national history . "

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
As California marked its second day of a new fiscal year without a budget agreement , the state government moved ahead on Thursday to issue billions of dollars in “ IOUs ” in order to avoid a cash crisis .

California faces a financial stranglehold after lawmakers failed to balance the budget by the start of the state ’s new fiscal year on Wednesday , leaving a $ 26.3 billion deficit .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican who declared a fiscal emergency to force lawmakers to tackle the financial crisis , minced no words on Thursday in lambasting lawmakers for their failure .
“ In four weeks , in the last four weeks , instead of negotiating and coming to a budget agreement , they decided to debate and to debate and to have hearings and more debates and more hearings and finger - pointing and assigning blame .
At the end of the day , they have n’t accomplished anything , ” Schwarzenegger said at a press conference in Los Angeles .
Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg said state leaders need to cool their heated rhetoric of recent days and that he would work with other top lawmakers over the weekend to narrow differences over balancing the budget .
Democrats who control the legislature cannot pass a budget on their own .
They agree with Republicans that deep spending cuts are needed but want some taxes increased .
Republicans are holding firm against tax increases and Schwarzenegger has sided with them .
“ In my view we ’re making significant progress , ” Steinberg told reporters in the state capital of Sacramento .
“ It ’s time that we get this done . ”
California ’s finances have been battered by the recession , rising unemployment -- which hit 11.5 percent in May -- and the lengthy housing downturn .
NO CHECKS IN THE MAIL
Under California ’s plan to issue IOUs in lieu of paying some bills immediately , finance officials in Sacramento approved paying interest on the IOUs at a rate of 3.75 percent .
Controller John Chiang plans to issue $ 3.36 billion in IOUs this month so the state has cash for $ 10.9 billion for priority payments , including money owed to investors holding state debt .
“ IOUs are a sign that the state is being fiscally mismanaged , ” Chiang said .
“ That clearly creates implications for further downgrades of California credit ratings . ”
The state agreed to redeem the IOUs , technically registered warrants , beginning on October 2 .
The first tranche of IOUs will go mainly to taxpayers who are owed tax refunds .
“ We anticipate printing about 28,742 registered warrants today worth about $ 53.3 million , ” said Chiang spokesman Jacob Roper .
Companies doing business with the state , local agencies and individuals on financial aid such as the disabled , elderly and college students could be in line for the IOUs , raising uncertainty amid already worrisome economic conditions .
“ We do n’t really know exactly what ’s going to come out of this , ” said Art McCoy , owner of French Fry Xpress , a Milpitas , California firm that delivers food products to state prisons .
Bank of America and Wells Fargo will accept the warrants , which Chiang ’s office planned to begin processing immediately on Thursday .

The U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday advised people receiving IOUs from California to check with their banks about possible fees or delays in receiving funds .
The Fed warned the warrants will not be subject to the normal , federal check - hold limits and could be subject to extended holds .
The U.S. central bank also warned that because California will likely return unpaid any registered warrants it receives before the payment date , depositors of the warrants may be subject to returned - deposit fees if their banks attempt to collect these warrants before they are payable .
If customers rely on these funds to make other payments , they may be subject to overdraft or bounced - check fees if warrants are returned .
REASSURING WALL STREET
California ’s finance officials are aiming to reassure the municipal debt market in anticipation of having to sell up to
$ 9 billion in short - term debt after a budget is approved .
But Wall Street has its doubts .
“ Absent a credible budget revision package , we believe the state may suffer insufficient investor confidence in its finances to successfully place such an offering , ” Standard & Poor ’s said on Wednesday .
S&P also warned that if California ’s budget is not settled soon , the state ’s A - credit rating , already the lowest of any of the 50 states , is at risk of falling .
State Treasurer Bill Lockyer ’s office is pessimistic it will be able to sell short - term revenue anticipation notes ( RANs ) for state cash - flow needs as it had planned because of the budget turmoil .
Revenue anticipation warrants remain an option , but would be more expensive for the state .
“ We ’re exploring a variety of avenues to increase the potential market for our short - term cash - flow borrowing , ” Lockyer spokesman Tom Dresslar said .
“ The way the fiscal picture looks at this time , RANs do not look likely . ”

Tesco Clubcard customers are being offered vouchers for CT scans Tesco has been criticised for offering vouchers for health scans through its Clubcard loyalty scheme .
The Society of Radiographers ( SOR ) wants the promotion stopped , saying it is " inappropriate " for the retailer .
It says the CT scans involve a risk from exposure to radiation which is not made clear to Clubcard customers before they take up the offer .
Tesco says the firm that provides its service employs qualified staff and explains any risks to customers .
' Unnecessary anxiety ' SOR chief executive Richard Evans says private scans increase the ranks of the " worried well " - people whose scans uncover abnormalities which later turn out to be benign .
There 's no evidence of any harmful effect from that kind of exposure
Dr John Giles , Lifescan medical director " I would n't want to underplay the sense of relief if something positive and dangerous is found and dealt with in good time , " he said .
" However , for every one of those there 'll be an untold number who are taking up a GP appointment slot for no real reason , who are suffering unnecessary anxiety . "
SOR recognises that Lifescan - the firm providing the service for Tesco - is a reputable company operating within radiation regulations .
However , it thinks it is inappropriate for a retailer such as Tesco to get involved in promoting CT scans .
It is also concerned that Tesco is effectively subsidising them by offering £ 40 worth of Lifescan vouchers for every £ 10 worth of points under its Clubcard Deals scheme .
Early diagnosis Tesco said that Lifescan employed " qualified professional staff to advise on and undertake all scans , providing all customers with a full explanation of the service and any risks involved " .
Lifescan also rejects the SOR criticisms and says since its launch in 2003 it has helped to save the lives of more than 2,000 people in the UK through early diagnosis .
Lifescan medical director Dr John Giles says low doses of radiation are involved .
" If someone was going to have a heart scan , a low dose lung scan and a colon scan , the total dose which they'd get from that examination would be something in the order of 10 milliseverts , and that 's exactly the same as you would get living in Cornwall for 12 months , just living there , " he said .
" There 's no evidence of any harmful effect from that kind of exposure , otherwise I suppose we'd have to have health warnings up on the signs driving into Cornwall . "
Regulation Lifescan also insists that it always gives patients a full explanation of what the tests involve and that nobody is tested until they are clear about what will be done and why .
But SOR says some of this information should be provided at an earlier stage to Tesco Clubcard customers - a position backed by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment .
Nearly two years ago , the committee advised the government that there was little evidence that the benefits of having a scan outweighed the risks for people without symptoms .
Chairman Professor Alex Elliott said : " They need to make clear the potential detriment to individuals from CT scans since they are tacitly encouraging take - up . "
The government held a consultation into the recommendation of the committee 's report last summer but has not yet announced whether it will make any changes to the regulation of CT scan providers as a result .
A Department of Health spokesman said : " We are currently looking at other evidence on this complex area presented in the consultation and hope to issue a response shortly . "

The Walls Came Tumbling Down
These are heady days for the free culture movement ; the atmosphere of expectancy reminds me a bit of the time before the Berlin Wall came down .
iTunes has abandoned DRM under market pressure , and the RIAA admits that DRM is effectively dead .
The entire iTunes library , some ten million tracks , is now DRM - free , and they ’ve dropped all tracks which were unavailable without DRM .
The Pirate Bay conviction was followed by the Swedish Pirate Party getting seats in the European Parliament .
The Pirate Party controls the single largest block of support among Swedes in their twenties , and my guess is that pirate parties will gain comparable strength throughout the EU countries .
Steve Ballmer seems to be caving on cooperation with the open source community , offering Microsoft driver source code for the Linux kernel so the Penguin - heads can more effectively design Microsoft - compatible desktop accessories .
Quite a change from the days when Gates was ranting about “ communism ” and Microsoft was threatening Linux with infringement lawsuits .
The phrase “ if you ca n’t beat ’em , join ’em ” comes to mind .
Google ’s free Chrome operating system , coupled with browser - based applications , offers to destroy the proprietary operating system where Linux could n’t .
As my fellow C4SS commentator Tom Knapp puts it , the era of paying for operating systems is now officially over .
And Jeff Bezos , in the face of the backlash over Kindle ’s remote deletion , aka theft , of books ( by Orwell no less ! ) that customers had paid for , has apologized for the “ stupid ” and “ thoughtless ” move and promised that it will never happen again .
The latest gambit by the Copyright Nazis , Associated Press ’s attempt to make web aggregators pay for “ content ” on pain of being sued ( even when such “ content ” consists only of a hyperlinked headline ) is almost certainly doomed to fail in a spectacular manner .
The specifics amount to a kind of DRM :
“ The microformat will essentially encapsulate AP and member content in an informational ‘ wrapper ’ that includes a digital permissions framework that lets publishers specify how their content is to be used online and which also supplies the critical information needed to track and monitor its usage . ”
Yeah , THAT should work really well .
AP Chairman William Dean Singleton is defending the policy in decidedly belligerent and combative language .
First he warned “ We can no longer stand by and watch others walk off with our work under misguided legal theories ” ( i.e. , the theory that providing a snippet and a hyperlink is covered by the Fair Use doctrine ) , and then he announced that he ’s “ done talking about it . ”
But I suspect he ’ll be adopting a much meeker tone before long .
A business model based on suing online news sources ( not to mention search engines ! ) for linking to your stories makes New Coke look like a work of genius .
It ’s about like a record company threatening to sue if you mention the name of an album when you recommend it to your friends ( as an article at Dvorak Uncensored put it , AP is “ ready to be the new RIAA ” ) .
Some newspapers are already threatening to cancel their AP membership in response to the controversy .
My guess is that within a year , even the AP will admit that the strategy backfired catastrophically , and they ’ll just about curl up in a fetal position at the thought of ever trying it again .
It ’s like the proprietary culture people are TRYING to relegate themselves to the ash heap of history as quickly as possible .
What ’s the next step–helicopters airlifting refugees from the roof of Microsoft headquarters in Redmond , or CNN crews filming a statue of Bill Gates being pulled down ?

[ Continuing his series of GameSetWatch - exclusive interviews , Jeriaska sits down with the Atlus staffers behind the PlayStation Portable localization of the original Persona RPG , discussing its new translation , re-introduced side quest , cultural specifics , and more . ]
When Atlus first introduced Megami Ibunroku Persona to English - language audiences back in 1996 , the game received various modifications intended to appeal to game players outside of Japan .
Revelations : Persona for the Playstation featured new portraits to make the protagonists look more reminiscent of American TV shows , along with Westernized character names .
A lot has changed in the priorities of game localizes since the mid-'90s , as demonstrated by Shin Megami Tensei : Persona , which is being released both digitally and on UMD for the Playstation Portable console .
Not only have portraits and character names been reverted to match the Japanese version , an entire side quest that was removed from the Playstation localization , the notoriously difficult Snow Queen episode , has been reintroduced .
Here to relate their various experiences localizing the title for its upcoming English - language release are Atlus USA 's Yu Namba , Nich Maragos and Scott Strichart .
In this interview on the subject of translating the portable role - playing title , they observe what flaws from the previous translation needed to be corrected and which quirks were brought along for old times ' sake .
Thank you for offering your time to this interview on the subject of your work on the localization of Shin Megami Tensei : Persona .
To offer an indication of your backgrounds at Atlus , can you tell us which titles in the Shin Megami Tensei series have you worked on previously and how would you describe your role on this title for the PSP ?
Yu Namba , Project Lead : I ’ve worked on all the SMT titles since Persona 2 , minus DemiKids and Devil Summoner 2 .
Besides my role as the project lead of SMT : Persona , I translated the majority of the Snow Queen event text .
Nich Maragos , Editor : I ’ve worked on both the Raidou Kuzunoha games , Persona 3 and Persona 3 FES , Persona 4 , and Devil Survivor .
On Persona PSP , I edited the event dialogue and NPC dialogue , and later pitched in a little on the mountain of demon negotiation dialogue .
Scott Strichart , Editor : My previous SMT work includes Persona 4 and Devil Survivor .
My role on both Devil Survivor and Persona 1 has been to edit the metric ton of demon negotiation text involved in the game .
This was such an involved process that translator James Kuroki and I still were not done with these files by the time Nich had completed the main storyline .
How have you gone about finding actors for the game 's cinematic cutscenes ?
YN : We put a great deal of time into the process of selecting voice actors , and in this case we endeavored to select different actors than in the other more recent Atlus games .
The English translation of Persona for the Playstation might be described as a noble effort , but short of perfect .
There are some funkily translated lines that seem to have stuck with people though , for instance " Mark danced crazy . "
Have you retained any of these lines , simply for the sake of tradition ?
NM : I do n’t see how any man with blood in his veins could localize Persona 1 at this point and not have Mark dance crazy .
There ’s one other specific allusion we retained in the storyline parts , although it ’s not quite as offensive as it used to be .
SS : I was actually asked to play the original Playstation version before the project began for reference , and I encountered a line spoken by the Yakuza demon that I screen - capped for the express purpose of retaining it .
That line stands out like a sore thumb , so I ’m sure you ’ll recognize it if you find it .
I guess it could be considered homage to how far our company ’s localizations have come in the past decade .
When Revelations : Persona was released , a number of modifications were made to character names and portraits to make it seem like the story was set outside of Japan .
Have all of these changes been restored for the PSP title ?
SS : All the portraits , names , and places have been reverted .
Nich and I worked to keep the text as Japanese as it was originally intended to be .
Over the course of the series ' localization history , the name of the game 's antagonist has gone from Guido Sardenia in Revelations : Persona to Guido Kandori in Persona 2 .
Other parts of the Japanese - language script , such as the name of the school " St. Hermelin , " might pose challenges to situating the game in a particular geographical setting .
How have you dealt with these issues on the new title ?
NM : There was some discussion at the start of the project about whether to maintain ties where we could to Persona 2 : Eternal Punishment ’s script , but in the end we decided to wipe the slate clean .
All the characters have their proper names , including Takahisa Kandori .
This process started a little bit in Persona 3 ’s localization : Eternal Punishment referred to Nanjo as “ Nate Nanjo ” as a sort of compromise while still remaining faithful to Persona 1 by referring to his company as the Trinity Corporation .
But in Persona 3 , they simply went with the Nanjo Group rather than Trinity , and we ’re taking that approach further with Persona PSP .
As for St. Hermelin , that was actually faithful to the original even back on the PSX , and remains so for the PSP script .
Several other location names have been corrected , though , to better flag up the Hindu motif running through a lot of the story .
Were there many instances where you needed to depart from the Japanese - language script ?
SS : Sometimes Japanese games have cultural references in their text that do n’t always translate to North American shores very well .
For instance , when “ Mark dances crazy , ” many of the demons insult him by comparing his dance to a traditional Japanese loach scooping dance .
Unless you ’re steeped in Japanese culture , you are n’t going to know what the heck that is , or why it ’s an insult .
In these situations , we have to keep the spirit of the line , but make the insult make sense to a player in this region .
This is where we get to flex our creativity a little .
YN : There was a character who spoke like a Japanese 80 ’s pop star .
I did my best to keep the “ outdated celebrity ” speech style , but it was impossible to do a straight translation .
Yukino , a character introduced in the original Persona , figures prominently in the story of Persona 2 .
Did your knowledge of the character 's behavior in the later installment of the series at all influence how you went about translating her dialog for this game ?
YN : Yukino is a very dependable girl , although hot - blooded and sometimes scary .
When I translated her lines , I tried to make her sound like a younger , less mature version of Yukino in Persona 2 .
In more recent installments of the Persona series , the line between what might be called reality and fantasy has been fairly clearly drawn .
There is the reality of the high school drama taking place in Gekkoukan or Inaba , and then there is the supernatural element of the Dark Hour or the Midnight Channel .
Do you feel it detracts from the storyline of Persona for the lines between reality and fantasy to be less clearly drawn , or does it have its own narrative advantages ?
NM : I ’m not sure the difference is as clear - cut as you describe it .
In Persona 3 and Persona 4 , the supernatural elements still have a dramatic effect on the “ everyday lives ” of the characters .
In Persona 3 , as the cast learns about the problem of the Shadows , one by one they leave their everyday lives to move into the dorm , where they form a sort of new family based on their common cause .
Meanwhile , Persona 4 starts with the Midnight Channel claiming the life of someone Yosuke cares a great deal about , and its characters also struggle with integrating their battle with normal life .
Used either way , the sudden appearance of the supernatural into a normal world sets up a mystery that is slowly revealed over the course of the game .
Setting aside the supernatural elements to their own special location does n’t radically alter that setup for the story .
How would you describe the Snow Queen quest , perhaps the greatest departure from the structure of Revelations : Persona ?
YN : Each and every one of us has bad things about ourselves .
Some see them as weaknesses and are tormented by them , while others act as if there was nothing wrong about them .
Whether we overcome our weaknesses or realize that we were wrong , we must move on and better ourselves .
But sometimes , we just ca n’t do it on our own ...
To me , that ’s what the Snow Queen scenario is about .
Game content - wise , it ’s very challenging .
I think it ’ll be difficult to finish if you ’ve never played the main ( SEBEC ) portion of Persona before .
I suggest that you become familiar with the game — fusion , demon conversation , battle system , etc. — before entering the Snow Queen ’s castle .

MEXICO CITY , June 17 ( Reuters ) - Scientists are genetically modifying a bizarre looking Mexican salamander , which according to ancient mythology is a transformed Aztec god , in the hope its ability to regenerate body parts will one day help human amputees .
Also known as " water monsters , " the half - foot - long ( 15 - cm-long ) axolotl is nearly extinct in its only remaining habitat : the polluted vestiges of Aztec canals that snake though southern Mexico City , packed with colorful boats carrying tourists and mariachi musicians .
But the slimy animal crowned with frilly gills like a headdress , beady eyes and a goofy smile , is thriving in labs where it reproduces easily .
It is a darling of researchers since it can regrow injured limbs , jaws , skin , organs and parts of its brain and spinal chord .
Some other animals have the capacity to regenerate , but only salamanders can regrow so many different parts over and over again throughout their lives .
The U.S. Department of Defense has given a $ 6.25 million research grant to scientists studying the little creature with the aim of eventually helping the more than 1,000 soldiers who have come back from Iraq and Afghanistan with missing extremities .
In a lab in Mexico City , where biology students map the shrinking habitat of the animal , an axolotl whose leg was recently bitten off by a tank mate was already budding a tiny replica , complete with little toes .
" Humans do repair tissue but they do n't repair it perfectly whereas the axolotl under certain injury conditions can go into kind of a mode where they repeat the process of the embryo , " said Elly Tanaka from the Center for Regenerative Therapies in Dresden , Germany .
Tanaka has succeeded in genetically engineering axolotls using a mutant type found in the wild with no skin pigment and inserting a green - glowing gene from a jellyfish into the salamander cells to help see the process of regeneration in action .
" The skin is clear so you can see the fluorescent protein inside the live animal , " Tanaka said in a phone interview .
The goal is to compare and contrast with the human healing process .
After amputation in salamanders , unlike in humans , blood vessels contract quickly and limit bleeding , skin cells work fast to cover the wound site and form what is called a " blastema , " a collection of stemlike cells that will eventually become the new body part .
Working alongside scientists mapping the complex genome of the axolotl , which is 10 times larger than a human genome , Tanaka and her colleagues hope to discover what allows the salamander to regrow a limb instead of a scarred stump .
Humans already have the ability to regrow missing fingertips if they are cut off above the joint .
If the wound is cleaned and dressed properly , a finger can regain its shape , fingerprint and feeling on its own .
" Now , as we watch a salamander grow back an arm , we are no longer quite as mystified by how it happens .
Soon humans might be able to harness this truly awesome ability ourselves , " experts Ken Muneoka , Manjong Han and David Gardiner wrote in a recent article .
They speculated it may be only be a decade or two until human parts can be regenerated , salamander - like .
ALMOST EXTINCT
More axolotls live in captivity than in the wild as their populations in the most isolated corners of the canals in the Xochimilco neighborhood of Mexico City has likely shrunk to as few as 400 , putting them at risk of extinction .
Mexico 's capital , one of the world 's largest cities , was built by the Aztecs on an island in the middle of a lake now drained by centuries of Spanish colonization and urban sprawl .
The Aztecs , who ate the axolotls and used them in medicine , believed they were actually incarnations of the lightning death god Xolotl who went through metamorphosis to escape being sacrificed .
The rare axolotls are threatened by chemical run off from greenhouses on the banks of the city canals , waste water from surrounding neighborhoods and non-native fish species that compete with the salamander for food .
Luis Zambrano at Mexico's Autonomous University said if the axolotls disappear in the wild it could have implications for the future genetic diversity of the research population .
" There is a version of the ( Aztec ) myth , that says when the axolotls disappear , so will humanity , " Zambrano said .
I 'm Writing a Cocoa Book for O'Reilly

I 'm Writing a Cocoa Book for O'Reilly
Posted Sep 28 , 2009 — 34 comments below Posted Sep 28 , 2009 — 34 comments below
Writing a book is a fairly crazy thing to do .
It 's like coming up with 200 essays on a single subject .
You can only do it if you really like the thing you 're writing about .
Fortunately , I really like making Mac software and teaching other people about it , so O'Reilly asked me to turn that into a book .
The book is called Cocoa and Objective - C : Up and Running .
It 's a ground - level introduction to everything you need to write Cocoa apps .
I do n't assume you know C or compilers , or anything other other how to use a Mac .
It 's available now from O'Reilly Rough Cuts .
More content will be added before it goes into production later this year .
In short , I took everything I 've learned about writing Cocoa tutorials since 2004 , cleaned it up , filled in the missing pieces , revamped and updated it for Snow Leopard , and put it all together into one , cohesive walkthrough .
If you like the Cocoa articles on Theocacao and the tutorial I wrote for Cocoa Dev Central , I really think you 'll like this book .
I had to figure out who to write for .
A book for expert programmers is easier to write because you can assume a lot more ; but I wanted to make it possible for anyone to learn Cocoa , even if they had no programming experience .
Once I decided on that , though , I had to figure out how to actually do it .
Cocoa is based on Objective - C , which is based on C .
So I could write a book on C , then a separate book on Objective - C and Cocoa .
The downside is that you could end up wasting time reading about the obscure parts of C that do n't apply to modern Mac apps .
Another option is to skip C entirely , and just jump right into Cocoa and Objective - C. I almost went this route , particularly because it's how I learned .
But then I remembered how many examples and explanations were going over my head when I was learning because I did n't understand the underlying rules of C. I got a lot of code to work purely by accident .
There 's also a good chance that you 'll want to use existing C code , and to do that , you need to know how to read and write C .
In fact , some of the frameworks in Mac OS X can only be used as C types and functions .
And sometimes , you may just need the extra speed of C.So I asked myself was : " Am I training people to write one - off Cocoa apps , or to be productive Cocoa engineers ? "
I decided I wanted to make engineers , not just people who can run through basic examples .
But it takes time to learn C first , and I want to help you get started right away .
So what 's the answer ?
I decided to teach a core set of C concepts that apply directly to Mac and iPhone programming , leaving out the archaic C conventions that Cocoa has better answers for .
So this book has only two chapters on C .
They focus on just the parts that you need to be a productive Cocoa programmer .
The other big decision I made was that the book should n't be only for new programmers .
I wanted it to be useful for people who already knew C or C ++.
I know this sounds like hyperbole , but I really mean it .
I want to be able able to hand this book to an experienced programmer who 's new to the Mac and tell them it will be useful .
So the chapters are setup to be modular .
If you already know C , you can skip ahead to the Objective - C chapter .
If you 've spent some time with the iPhone SDK , you can start with the chapters that cover the frameworks .
This was not something I took lightly and was not easy to do , but I think the result will be something that will work for a lot of people .
The main job I have in this book is to tell you how Cocoa works in simple terms and a personal voice .
The world does not need another big , dense book with distant language .
If you read Theocacao or Cocoa Dev Central , the style will probably be familiar , but hopefully even more stripped down .
My editor at O'Reilly , Brian Jepson , encouraged me to talk directly to you , and even write as if we 're having a conversation .
He also asks questions that he thinks you 'll have , and suggests I just answer them directly in the text .
The home base for the book is CocoaBook.com .
Please check out the site and share it anyone you know .
This is where I 'll post the code for the examples , along with any news on new versions or other things that come up along the way .
I 'm sure a lot of the major developments will end up on Theocacao , too , or you can get updates through my Twitter account Now , what about Cocoa Dev Central ?
There are a lot of useful tutorials there , and some of them need to be updated .
The good news is that I talked to O'Reilly about this and they gave their blessing to posting the revamped versions of the existing tutorials back to Cocoa Dev Central ( specified as a percentage of the total book content ) .
This is no small thing to me , and they really get why this is important .
The net result is that O'Reilly is getting a book while still enabling Cocoa Dev Central to be useful resource for Cocoa developers , which I think is pretty fantastic .
Outdated content will be refreshed and missing pieces will be filled in .
Some of the new content will be unique to the book , because we really want you to buy the book .
But all of the tutorials that were previously available will stay that way .
Nothing is being pulled from the site .
By the way , the reason I want you to buy the book is so that we can do more of this .
This is n't my full - time job , and writing a book is pretty hard .
But if you guys and girls like this one , I 'll write more .
Maybe it 's too predictable , but I have to pull out the Disney quote that Brent Simmons first turned me on to , and John Gruber recently brought back into the collective consciousness : I write software for a living , and I enjoy that very much .
But I write tutorials because I like helping people learn how to do something that might change their life .
I 'll keep doing it for as long as you guys want to read it .
I hope you like it .
The tireless , developer - centric engineers at Google have come up with Noop , a new language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine .
" Noop ( pronounced ' noh - awp , ' like the machine instruction ) is a new language that attempts to blend the best lessons of languages old and new , while syntactically encouraging industry best - practices and discouraging the worst offenses , " according to a description of the language on the Noop language Website .
Noop supports dependency injection in the language , testability and immutability .
Other key characteristics of Noop , according to the Noop site , include the following : " Readable code is more important than any syntax feature ; Executable documentation that 's never out - of - date ; and Properties , strong typing , and sensible modern stdlib . "
Moreover , according to the Noop language home page , some of the thinking behind the creation of the language includes :
" " Dependency Injection changed the way we write software .
Spring overtook EJB's [ Enterprise JavaBeans ] in thoughtful enterprises , and Guice and PicoContainer are an important part of well - written applications today .
" Automated testing , especially Unit Testing , is also a crucial part of building reliable software that you can feel confident about supporting and changing over its lifetime .
Any decent software shop should be writing some tests , the best ones are test - driven and have good code coverage . " "
Discussed at the 2009 JVM Language Summit on Sun Microsystems ' campus in Santa Clara , Calif. , on Sept. 16 , Noop has quickly become the topic du jour in the Java development community .
Indeed , the Noop site also said , " Noop is a new language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine , and in source form looks similar to Java .
The goal is to build dependency injection and testability into the language from the beginning , rather than rely on third - party libraries as all other languages do . "
In an August 2009 blog post , James Gosling , the creator of Java and a Sun vice president and fellow , said of the JVM Language Summit :

THE iconic drink of the Irish is celebrating its 250th birthday today , so don your party hats and grab a pint .
Guinness is the highest selling drink in Ireland and it seems it ’s pretty popular in Gladstone too .
Assistant manager of Dicey ’s Irish Pub , Chris Lynch says they sell “ plenty of it . ”
“ It ’s average compared to other beer sales but we definitely sell plenty of it , ” Mr Lynch said .
While it might be blasphemy to work at an Irish pub and not drink Guinness , Mr Lynch says he does n’t like the taste .
“ It tastes like vegemite , ” he said .
“ It ’s one of those beers you either love or hate . ”
For lovers of the brown ale , Mr Lynch said the beer best compliments “ a nice steak or a spicy meal . ”
Glasses are to be raised at 17.59 to toast the signing of the St James Gate lease in 1759 .
Gladstone Guinness lovers can join in the world wide festivities at their local Irish watering hole with Dicey ’s offering specials and promotions on the brown ale throughout the day .
They will also launch the limited edition Guinness 250 Anniversary Brew , which is the company ’s only new stout introduced since they first started importing Guinness Draught in 1769 .
The first exportation was in 1769 when Guinness exported six and one half barrels to England .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The new head of NATO will seek to ease American doubts about the alliance ’s commitment to the Afghan conflict on Monday , even as European allies downplay chances of major reinforcements after eight years of war .
Anders Fogh Rasmussen , in his first major U.S. speech as secretary - general , acknowledges the need for more resources to fight the Taliban in the face of mounting Western casualties and fading public support , according to prepared remarks obtained by Reuters .
But the former prime minister of Denmark , who took over NATO ’s top job last month , also criticizes those in the United States who belittle the contributions of allies .
Such behavior is counterproductive , he says , and may leave them “ less inclined to make those efforts and those sacrifices ” in the future .
“ I ’m a little concerned about the doubts I hear these days in the United States about NATO , ” Rasmussen says in the speech to be delivered at the Atlantic Council in Washington at 5 p.m .
EDT ( 2100 GMT ) .
“ Talking down the European and Canadian contributions -- as some in the United States do on occasion -- can become a self - fulfilling prophesy . ”
His comments come on the same day as European defense ministers , meeting informally in Sweden , expressed reluctance to send a significant number of reinforcements .
“ If you look at Europe , I do n’t hear any voices saying we have an additional five or ten thousand soldiers to send to Afghanistan , ” said Danish Defense Minister Soren Gade .
Opinion polls on both sides of the Atlantic show souring public sentiment over the eight - year - old conflict , which the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan , Stanley McChrystal , has warned likely will result in failure without more troops .
McChrystal is expected to seek 30,000 to 40,000 combat troops and trainers , according to defense and congressional officials .
European allies are not expected to offer any significant increase in trainers or troops unless the United States takes the lead .
But U.S. President Barack Obama , who is also working to reduce the U.S. military presence in Iraq , has said he will not decide on further reinforcements for Afghanistan until after a broad review of strategy .
Senator John Kerry , the influential chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , urged against committing more troops without clear goals or a timeframe .
“ Otherwise , we risk bringing our troops home from a mission unachieved or poorly conceived , ” Kerry said in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal published on Monday .
NOT RUNNING FROM FIGHT
Rasmussen was scheduled to meet Obama , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Monday and Tuesday , his office said .

In the speech , Rasmussen points to 9,000 additional non-U.S. troops who have joined the Afghan effort in the past 18 months , saying “ the allies are not running from the fight , despite the conventional wisdom . ”
The Netherlands and Canada already have set 2010 and 2011 withdrawal timelines .
But Rasmussen says NATO “ will stay for as long as it takes to succeed . ”
He says more resources will be required and stresses the need to rapidly train Afghan forces so they can take the lead in providing security .
He adds that “ we have to do more now if we want to be able to do less later . ”
“ None of this will be quick and none of it will be easy , ” Rasmussen says .
“ We will need to have patience .
We will need more resources .
And we will lose more young soldiers to the terrorist attacks of the Taliban . ”
McChrystal ’s leaked assessment included withering criticism of NATO ’s International Security Assistance Force , saying that troops often lacked basic understanding of Afghan society .
Rasmussen says he is aware of frustrations in Washington , including restrictions some NATO nations put on their forces and delays in NATO decision - making .
“ I am already working hard to address those very real problems , ” he says in his remarks .
The Pentagon said on Monday any additional deployments would not happen until next year , even if Obama approved them immediately .
“ There is a certain amount of train - up that is required to prepare for a particular battlespace and there is a certain amount of logistics in terms of moving equipment , ” Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said .

Israel ’s nuclear posture is unique .
Some countries with “ advanced nuclear capabilities , ” such as India and China , have publicly adopted “ No First Use ” postures .
Israel has adopted a declaratory policy that it will not be the first to “ introduce ” nuclear weapons into the Middle East .
This posture has been met with widespread and willing suspension of disbelief , as it serves many useful purposes .
How did the “ NFI ” posture come about ?
And has its meaning evolved over time ?
Avner Cohen has produced the most complete account we now have of Israel ’s NFI posture in his fine book , Israel and the Bomb .
The key junctures of NFI , as chronicled by Cohen are as follows :
1. A meeting between President Kennedy and Deputy Minister of Defense Shimon Peres on April 2 , 1963 .
Kennedy pressed Peres hard to offer assurances that would support the President ’s nonproliferation agenda .
According to U.S. notes of the meeting , Peres said the following :
“ I can tell you most clearly that we will not introduce nuclear weapons to the region , and certainly we will not be the first . ”
The meeting with Kennedy was called on short notice , and Peres apparently improvised this answer , much to the discomfort of other Israeli leaders .
When asked to recollect about this exchange in 1991 , Peres said , “ I did not want to lie to the President , but I could not answer his question straight , either .
So I came up with what has become Israel ’s policy for years to come . ”
2. A Memorandum of Understanding reached on March 10 , 1965 between Prime Minister Levi Eshkol and NSC official Robert Komer and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Walworth Barbour .
In this MOU , the U.S. “ reaffirmed its concern for the maintenance of Israel ’s security ” and to the “ independence and integrity ” of Israel .
In return , “ the Government of Israel has reaffirmed that Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Arab - Israel area . ”
3 . An address to the Knesset by Eshkol on May 18 , 1966 , in which the Prime Minister stated , “ I have said before and I repeat that Israel has no atomic weapons and will not be the first to introduce them into our region . ”
Cohen ’s careful account of this nuclear history includes very few attempts by U.S. officials to clarify the meaning of Israel ’s NFI pledge .
The principle exception occurred in the Johnson administration , which negotiated and championed the NPT .
Paul Warnke , then a high - ranking Pentagon official , was under instructions from Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford and Secretary of State Dean Rusk to try to add definition and constraints to Israel ’s NFI pledge .
Warnke met several times with Israeli Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin in November 1968 , where these two men engaged in an oblique , yet crucial discussion about the meaning of Israel ’s NFI pledge .
Whatever leverage Warnke had was in the form of F - 4s , which Israel desperately wanted .
Rabin , who was without instructions , spoke extemporaneously .
He suggested that the NFI pledge be characterized in terms of not testing nuclear weapons and not publicly declaring their possession .
Warnke sought to expand Rabin ’s offerings to include “ physical possession . ”
( The State Department held out the vain hope in the Johnson administration that Israel could sign the NPT under its NFI pledge . )
Rabin rejected physical possession as a constituent element of Israel ’s NFI pledge .
U.S. notes of the November 12 , 1968 meeting has Warnke summarizing this discussion as follows : “ In your view , an unadvertised , untested nuclear device is not a nuclear weapon . ”
Rabin ’s response was , “ Yes , that is correct . ”
LBJ granted the sale of F - 4s to Israel , and Israel did not sign the NPT .
End of story ?
Not quite .
Two signal events have raised further questions about Israel ’s NFI pledge .
Just prior to the Six Day War in 1967 , Israel is reliably reported to have readied a small number of nuclear weapons for operational use , if necessary .
Missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons were also readied for use .
This helps to explain Rabin ’s refusal to endorse Warnke ’s formulations , but it highly qualifies Israel ’s NFI pledge .
Then there is Rabin ’s unqualified “ no test ” pledge .
On September 22 , 1979 , U.S. monitoring capabilities registered data suggestive of a low - yield nuclear event in the South Atlantic .
One possibility was an Israeli test in collaboration with the Government of South Africa , or some variation thereof .
A distinguished panel of U.S. technical experts , led by Jack Ruina , which included Dick Garwin Wolfgang Panofsky , and Luis Alvarez , poured over these data and gave Israel the benefit of the doubt .
A new book by Thomas C. Reed and Danny B. Stillman , The Nuclear Express , paints a very different picture .
Reed and Stillman ’s book contains factual errors and unsupported assertions , but their account of the South Atlantic event cannot be summarily dismissed .
Avner Cohen , who knows more about Israel ’s nuclear program than anyone else writing on the subject , treats this matter only inferentially , and with tortured logic :
Politically , the first full - yield nuclear test signifies the transition from secrecy to the public phase .
A test provided a clear cut and visible criterion for recognizing when and how the nuclear threshold had been crossed .
Nuclear proliferation was thus perceived as an either / or process : as long as a country did not conduct a full - yield test it was still given the benefit of the doubt concerning its nuclear status .
Israel made its nuclear pursuit piecemeal and by taking advantage of this conceptualization of the proliferation process .
A great many nuclear weapon tests have been carried out at less than full yield – including the Indian , Pakistani , and North Korean tests .
If Israel has participated in such a test well beyond the Middle East , does this accord with its NFI pledge ?
When planning first started for the completion of the human genome , some argued that we would need an entirely new approach to DNA sequencing in order to get things done within a reasonable time span .
Instead , success came via a brute force approach : robots prepared DNA samples 24 hours a day and fed the results to machines that could perform a hundred traditional sequencing reactions in parallel .
Now , one machine can do the job in a single month .
Sequencing in record time
In the latest sign of sequencing progress , researchers are using a publication in Nature Biotechnology to announce the completion of 90 + percent of the genome of an anonymous individual .
The work was done in a machine that actually reads the bases of single DNA molecules , allowing it to sequence nearly half a billion DNA fragments at once .
As a result of this massive parallelism , it only took four weeks of machine time to finish the genome .
The machine in question comes from a company called Helicos , which has a brief description of its technology available .
In short , a DNA sample , which may start out millions of bases long , is broken up into small fragments which are then stuck to a solid surface .
That surface is then exposed to a series of reaction solutions under the watchful gaze of a high resolution digital camera .
A solution containing one type of DNA base ( A , T , C , or G ) linked to a fluorescent molecule is added to the chamber containing the DNA fragments .
These added bases are used to copy the immobilized DNA fragments one base at a time .
If the right base is present — for example , the next base on the fragment is a T , meaning that an A should be added — an enzyme in the solution links it .
Only one base can be added at a time , even if there are many Ts in a row , because the fluorescent molecule blocks any continuation of the reactions .

The camera can read the presence of the fluorescent molecule , and it keeps track of precisely where and in which cycle it detects the glow .
Once the area is imaged , the fluorescent molecule is cleaved off , and the next base can be added .
By switching through the four bases sequentially , the machine gradually builds up a sequence of bases for each of the millions of individual DNA molecules stuck to the surface .
In theory , this process could proceed indefinitely , leading to long sequence reads , but a variety of factors cut things short .
For example , even if the chemical process that cleaves off the fluorescent molecule is 97 percent efficient , by the time the reaction is 25 bases long , over half the molecules would have been stopped .
In addition , it takes time to add each reaction solution to the samples , wash it off thoroughly , and perform the fluorescent imaging sufficiently to identify single molecules before starting the cycle all over .
As a result , it takes a week to run the machine , and the average sequence read to come out is only about 32 bases long .
But since each of those reads is taking place on a single molecule , you can squeeze a lot of them into a tiny space .
The Helicos machine gets about 9 million sequence reads for each reaction chamber , and a refrigerator - sized machine contains 50 reaction chambers .
Do the math , and you 'll see that you can get somewhere over 14 billion bases out of that week 's worth of machine time — by comparison , the human genome is composed of under 3 billion bases .
It 's no wonder the hardware comes equipped with 28 TB of storage .
The tech is also very hands - off ; the paper only has three authors .
That compares rather favorably with the hundreds of authors on the papers describing the completion of the human genome .
In terms of the actual work , each run produced approximately six times the number of bases in the human genome , distributed randomly .
At the end of four runs , they were up to over 28 - fold coverage of the human genome , meaning that , if each base in the genome were equally likely to be sequenced , it would show up in the data 28 times .
( They 're not equally likely to be sequenced , so this is just an average . )
Fragments this small probably can't be assembled into a complete genome , but the authors were able to compare them to the reference human genome maintained by the National Institutes of Health .
They were able to align sequences totaling 2.5 billion bases to the published version of the human genome .
The matching used an open source software package called IndexDP , which apparently deals well with the types of errors ( single base deletions ) that are the most commonly produced by this sequencing machine .
Of course , knowing what 's the same as the previously sequenced genomes is n't as interesting as knowing what 's different .
So the authors searched the genome for both single base differences ( SNPs ) and copy number variations ( CNVs ) that indicate the areas of genome that are distinct in this individual .
About 75 percent of the SNPs they found had been identified previously , and they were able to identify over 16 million bases contained in CNVs .
The SNP data is somewhat arbitrary , however ; it 's possible to change the settings on the analysis such that the software identifies more SNPs at the expense of including more sequencing errors .
Problems remain
That last point nicely summarizes the real challenge of the new sequencing technology , both this and the equivalents from other manufacturers .
They 've all got error rates of a percent or more , and when you 're talking billions of bases , this can be a problem .
It 's possible to weed out likely errors by comparison with the published genome , but that goes against the whole point of sequencing more genomes : the possibility of finding something new and rare within the flood of data .
Balancing the two is challenging , and there 's no right place to draw the line between something interesting and a likely mistake .
Regardless of how we interpret the data , the new paper is a technological tour de force , essentially taking the brute force , massive parallelism that got us the genome in the first place and shrinking it down to something that would fit in a typical kitchen .
The authors do n't really comment on price beyond noting that the cost of using other approaches remains a few hundred thousand dollars .
We 've not yet reached the point where everyone can have their genomes sequenced on the cheap , but we 're definitely inching closer .

The gentlemen in the audience may want to cover their groin when reading this .
You ’ve been warned .
A Greek woman set fire to a British man ’s genitals at a club after he allegedly made sexual advances on her .
The unidentified woman is being praised by her hometown in Crete for what she did and for also turning herself in to police immediately after the alleged incident .
She has been charged with causing bodily injury and endangering private property , according to the Telegraph .
I wonder if the “ private property ” was the British man ’s junk ?
Police said that the incident took place at a club in the Greek resort town of Malia .
The British man , who police have also not yet identified , allegedly took off his pants there and waved his genitals at a number girls .
He is then said to have “ forcefully fondled ” the Greek woman and asked her to hold his genitals .
The woman asked the man to stop harassing her , police said , and when he did n’t , she poured Sabucco , a liquor that resembles Greek ouzo , on his private area .
When the man continued his advances , police said that ’s when the woman set fire to his genitals using a lighter .
The man is currently at in a Heraklion , Crete , clinic being treated for second - degree burns to his testicles and penis .

With sprawling new housing tracts transforming the Inland Empire earlier this decade , word traveled to immigrants across the state .
There were jobs -- lots of jobs .
Mexican native Ramon Granados got the news in the Northern California town of Watsonville .
He moved to Riverside in 2004 and quickly was hired as an electrician .
“ There was tons of work -- new apartments , new construction , ” said Granados , 25 , a U.S. citizen .
“ Everybody wanted to come to this part of California . ”
He had a steady job for four years , working his way up to $ 17 an hour plus benefits for himself , his wife and their two children .
But when the economy crashed last year , Granados was laid off .
These days , he waits under a tree outside a Home Depot off the 91 Freeway , hoping for a day ’s work at $ 8 an hour .

“ I ’ll do anything to bring food to my table , ” he said .
“ Here , I get at least a chance of getting a job . ”
Granados and fellow immigrants transformed the face of the Inland Empire .
As hundreds of thousands of immigrants chased construction and service jobs and the chance to own a home in Riverside and San Bernardino counties , the region ’s Latino population soared .
Latinos were one - quarter of Riverside County ’s population in the 1990 Census , for example , and 43 % by 2007 .
Now , with the region ’s economy reeling from a brutal recession in which home construction has collapsed and unemployment rates have soared as high as 20 % in some areas , its immigrant residents are among the hardest hit .
Economic data do not single out the recession ’s effects on immigrants , but researchers and employment specialists note that Latinos , including many immigrants , are heavily represented in construction jobs that have some of the Inland Empire ’s highest unemployment rates .

Joblessness among Latinos across California has surpassed all other ethnic groups , including blacks , for the first time since the economic downturn began , according to new data released by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington , D.C .
And UC Riverside professor Vanessa Estrada Correa said her research shows that Latinos tend to have more subprime mortgages than those in other ethnic groups and are overrepresented in neighborhoods with high foreclosure rates .
The shift of immigrants to inland counties in the years before the recession marked a fundamental change in settlement patterns , according to a recently released detailed analysis of immigrant movement by the Public Policy Institute of California .
From 2000 to 2007 , the number of immigrants in San Bernardino and Riverside counties grew 55 % , from 490,946 to 761,629 , researchers found .
Despite being far larger at 3.5 million , the immigrant population in the Los Angeles - Long Beach area grew by just 161,000 , or 4.6 % , in the same period .

Many of the immigrants -- legal and illegal , blue - collar workers and college graduates -- left homelands or supportive big -city ethnic enclaves behind .
Pursuing jobs , higher wages and homeownership in new areas may be a positive development , said Sarah Bohn , a lead author of the study .
“ That may mean they are grabbing hold of economic opportunities and assimilating faster than in the past , ” she said .
It also can increase social conflicts and challenges .
“ Because they are choosing areas with less established immigrant networks , ” Bohn said , “ they do n’t have the institutions or organizations to fall back upon . ”

Now many immigrants , including some who have been in the U.S. for decades , are struggling to adapt to unemployment in new areas around the state .
Workforce development offices have seen a five - fold increase in jobless clients seeking retraining , many of them minorities , according to the Riverside County Economic Development Agency .
Edwin Fuentes , 41 , a naturalized U.S. citizen from El Salvador , flipped through postings at the Workforce Development Center of Riverside County last month .
He left Santa Ana in 2006 to buy his first home in Perris .
Later that year , the plumbing company where he worked for eight years , earning $ 20 an hour , shut down .
His home went into foreclosure , and he and his wife have moved in with relatives .
Jobs are scarce , he said .
“ You find work and then when things get slow , they lay you off and you start all over again . ”

Immigrants often find it harder to land new jobs , because many lack education or English skills and are n’t as comfortable applying for positions online , said Sylvia Spigner , a job center worker .
And job competition has become fierce .
In some cases , Spigner said , skilled applicants are chasing jobs as truck drivers , dishwashers and phone operators .
“ The immigrants are competing with professionals who are willing to take these jobs , ” she said .
Riverside County Supervisor Bob Buster said the increase in immigrants coupled with the economic downturn has prompted debate over immigration policy and funding for local services .
“ With the recession , everybody ’s watching the dollar [ and debating which ] people we should be spending money on , ” he said , noting that he was reviewing a constituent letter expressing concern about healthcare services for illegal immigrants .
Diversity has prompted adjustments in an array of government activities , including the hiring of bilingual county employees , greater use of bilingual ballots and poll workers and adding programs for children in changing neighborhoods that have seen an influx of Latino families , Buster said .

One challenge for schools , now facing recession - driven budget cuts , has been providing support for students with limited English skills , said Kenneth Young , Riverside County schools superintendent .
Latino enrollment grew dramatically during the boom years , and now Latinos constitute a majority of students , he said .
With much uncertainty about the future of the economy , researchers can’t predict how immigrants in the Inland Empire will respond .
New state data show overall domestic migration to the Inland Empire , including immigrants and non-immigrants , dropped sharply last year .
And studies by the Pew Hispanic Center and others show that the flow of all immigrants into the U.S. has slowed in recent years .
Some immigrants say they plan to ride out the recession while others said they will return to their native countries .
Pedro Paz , 40 , moved from Cudahy to Riverside in 2004 , earning $ 12 an hour building houses in Riverside , Corona and Norco .
An illegal immigrant , he sent money home each week to his family in Honduras .
He had work until 2007 but now is behind on his rent and buys food at a corner store on credit .
He rarely picks up work outside the Home Depot .
Advertisement
“ There is n’t any , ” he said .
“ It all ended . ”
Nevertheless , Paz said , he will keep trying .
Granados , the former electrician , has applied at several restaurants and temporary employment agencies .
At a Jack in the Box recently , Granados said the manager had a stack of applications the size of a thick phone book .
He is considering following his father , who , after more than 30 years in the U.S. , sold everything and returned to Mexico .
“ It used to be the American dream here , ” he said .
“ Not anymore .
The economy came down .
Everything came down . ”

Over the years I ’ve been fairly good at keeping myself from spending money that I do n’t have through impulsive purchases , but it is n’t an accident .
There are a lot of places that I love spending money , and places that I ’m constantly finding myself being tested :
Electronics stores
Bookstores
Anything on Amazon.com
Fatwallet.com and other deals sites .
Clearance sections of pretty much any store
Luckily I ’ve trained myself to become more conscious about the decisions that I make , and I have setup some roadblocks to spending that make it a lot easier to say no .
I thought it might be helpful to look at some of those ideas today .
5 Ways To Help Yourself Say No To The Urge To Splurge
Get yourself a money mentor :
If you have someone who you trust who can keep you accountable for your spending decisions , talk to them regularly about the decisions that you ’re making , and walk through potential purchases with them , and ask for their advice on whether you ’re making a good decision or not .
Make sure it ’s someone who wo n’t be afraid to tell you when you ’re making a boneheaded decision .
This could be your spouse , or another trusted person .
Avoid visiting stores or deals websites unless you really NEED something : Sometimes the key to not spending a lot of money is just not putting yourself in a situation where you might be tempted to spend .
For example , whenever I go to our local Micro Center computer store , I ’m always tempted to spend a ton of money on things I do n’t need .
Cheap flash memory cards , video cards , 7.1 surround pc speakers , etc .
I ’ve decided that I just wo n’t go to Micro Center unless there ’s something that I really need there .
That does n’t happen very often .
By the same token I try to avoid visiting some of my favorite deals websites very often because it often leads to impulse purchases .
Employ a 1 month spending rule :
If you ’re going to buy something , give yourself some time to think about it .
Dave Ramsey suggests waiting 24 hours , but I like to wait at least a month ( especially on high ticket items ) before I purchase it .
Often you ’ll find that just waiting for a short amount of time will mean that you either no longer want the item , or realize that it is n’t really what you wanted in the first place .
Also – waiting can often have the happy side effect of seeing prices drop on certain items .
Pay cash only :
One thing that I ’ve only started doing in the past couple of years is only buying an item once I have the cash to pay for it .
In the past I might have financed a TV or game console before I had the cash .
If I had waited a few more months I may not have had such a strong urge to buy .
Paying cash also hurts a bit more – financing something makes things seem cheaper because you ’re often only looking at the payments .
Financing a TV for only $ 50 / month vs. paying $ 1500 cash for it makes the purchase seem quite different .
We recently did this when we took several months to save for and pay for our new tv .
Before you check out , ask yourself , “ Do I really need this ? ” : I ca n’t count how many times I ’ve been at a store ready to purchase something – and stopped at the register and asked myself that question .
It seems simple – but more often than not I ’ll realize that “ No , I do n’t need this ” , put the item down and walk out .
Beyond these 5 things I also think it ’s important to make sure that you set up a family budget , and set specific amounts for your expense categories every month .
At our house we use the envelope system , and have a specific amount of money set aside every month in our budget for “ blow money ” or money we can use towards whatever we want .
If an item is above that amount – we have to save for it until we have enough money allocated .
That one step alone quickly short circuits a lot of impulse buys .
Do you have your own tips for preventing impulse purchases ?
Have you saved money by setting up your own roadblocks ?

Bulgarian journalists had a strange event today in the Ministry of Finance .
In a very small hall , called " Collegium " in the building , a large number of journalists , cameramen , photographers and many other people were trying to find an empty space so as to hear what explanations the former minister of finance Plamen Oresharski will give about the budget deficit the previous government left and which is 372 mn lv by the end of July ( 190.76 mn euro ) .
Although it was expected that the prime minister Boyko Borisov will also attend the meeting , as well as the ex-prime minister Sergey Stanishev , Mr. Borisov 's appearance in the hall very much resembled that of a Hollywood star .
But what has euinside understood while trying to survive in the melee and ask some questions ?
- the deficit is 372 mn lv ( 190.76 mn euro ) by the end of July ;
- the fiscal reserve has been decreased by half a billion lv an has reached 7.7 bn lv ( 3.94 bn euro ) ;
- Plamen Oresharski behaved like a man because he attended the this peculiar interrogation , organised by the prime minister and his deputy ;
- the most guilty person is the former prime minister Sergey Stanishev because , according to Mr. Borisov , whatever the prime minister says , this is supposed to happen and there was no way that Mr. Oresharski could have acted on his own and conceal the truth about the budget .
And here are the details .
Obviously , we would not exaggerate if we say that the deputy prime minister and minister of finance Simeon Dyankov ran over the first of 3 letters which Plamen Oresharski gave him when he left office almost a month ago and in which it is written : " When too many questions start arising , blame everything on your predecessor ! "
Apparently , wondering what to do after realizing that the new government will start its term with minus 372 mn levs and forecasts of 2.5 bn levs deficit by the end of the year , Mr. Dyankov has chosen to open the first letter but not only blame his predecessor for everything but also to hold him accountable for the troubles .
Thus , the ex-financier No. 1 appeared on stage by explaining that when he reported the realisation of the budget for the first 6 months of the year in the very end of his term as minister , a very small mistake has been made .
On the 20th of July Mr. Oresharski said that by June the budget surplus was 173 mn levs ( 88.7 mn euro ) and it proved to be 178 mn levs ( 91.28 mn euro ) .
Mr. Oresharski continued to claim that the report was , by then , true .
" For July the previous government could have not , in any form , make a report , except if it could base its data on some expectations " , the former finance minister explained .
From these explanations it also became clear that the crisis is a fundamental factor in the lack of money in the budget and he pointed as a starting point the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers .
" This year the import has dropped by 40 % .
I very much wish to take measures but I cannot return this import because there is no way that I could get Lehman brothers back " .
According to Oresharski , all measures that have been undertaken so far are adequate by the time of their undertaking .
He also quoted the estimations the European Commission and the IMF made because they were the basis for the forecasts the Bulgarian government did in December last year .
Mr. Oresharski added that if they were wrong , " then we went wrong after them " .
Asked by euinside whether he still thinks that the budget was not supposed to be reviewed because of the dynamic international situation and the quickly changing and often contradicting forecasts about the growth of the Bulgarian economy , Mr. Oresharski responded : " I still think that the budget has been planned in such a way that it might not be reviewed because in the transitional articles of the Law about the budget there are enough texts that give the government the right , no matter which government , to start restrictions and limitations of the expenses .
Possible review of the budget is an issue which can be discussed if policies are to be changed and is also a matter of decision of the new government whether it would prefer to make restrictions on its own or after discussions in Parliament " .
A little after this response the prime minister joined the conversations , apparently insulted by the fact that he was not given the chance to speak right after his appearance .
He thanked Plamen Oresharski for his manhood and courage to come to the meeting to give explanations about the situation of the state finances and explained that he called this gathering so that the society could see what the new government has inherited and to avoid speculations about who 's to blame for the lack of money .
With a tone that is hard to contradict Mr. Borisov also said that no one should play with the wallet of the state and agreed with Mr. Oresharski that no one should make politics out of this issue .
In the end of his participation , the prime minister also thanked for the possibility to clarify in front of the media what the real situation in the country is and spoke in first person to Oresharski because of his manhood and courage .
He also asked not to be escorted on his way out .
However , an interesting fact is that some time before he took office as a minister of finance and a deputy prime minister , Simeon Dyankov had worked for more than 2 weeks with Mr. Oresharski so as to see what the situations was .
This was the question euinside tried to ask at the press conference but had no chance - whether it was possible that Mr. Dyankov could have seen what deficit is to expect in July .
Instead we asked the former minister Oresharski : " I think I have told you that by the end of June there was no deficit .
In July the revenues are weak and , probably , more expenses are coming as I am informed without knowing the exact structure , come not only from the central government but from the local authorities and it is well known that the municipalities are not being controlled by the central government " .
So , in the end of the day we could n't understand who is to be blamed for the bad but quite helpful forecasts , about whether there were or were n't excessive expenditures , made by the previous government and , if there were , what will happen to those who authorized them .
Instead , there was a meeting today between the prime minister and the Commissioner for consumer protection Ms. Meglena Kuneva at which she has offered in the current situation Bulgaria to ask for help the European solidarity fund .
A denial of service attack that took down Internet access in parts of China earlier this year has been attributed to an over - enthusiastic game provider trying to take down rivals .
Police in Foshan , a city in Guangdong , have announced that they arrested four individuals for the attack , noting that they would go to trial sometime in the mysterious future .
The group was headed up by a 23 - year - old factory worker with the surname Bing , according to the police announcement .
Bing and his cohorts had set up a number of private servers for gamers to use , but were n't making much money because rivals had been engaging in distributed denial of service ( DDos ) attacks against them , constantly taking down the service .
Bing was apparently angered by this and decided to drop 280,000 yuan ( roughly US $ 41,000 ) to rent even more servers for the sole purpose of retaliating against his own attackers .
Unfortunately , these efforts were not very concentrated — Bing and the gang apparently launched their attack against every DNS server they could find belonging to DNSPod , a company that provides services to other gaming servers .
The problem arose when numbers of users attempted to use the servers connected to DNSPod ; their requests were denied and passed onto China Telecom , which could n't handle all the requests .
It ended up taking down the gaming service as well as numerous other websites that were connected to those DNS servers .
According to DNSPod , even Baidu ( the top search engine in China ) became completely inaccessible in certain parts of China .
Foshan officials confirmed that they had detained the four individuals in June and later made their official arrests .
As pointed out by IDG News Service , incidents like this are both common ( DDoS attacks between game operators are old hat ) and uncommon ( police rarely have the jurisdiction or training needed to pursue such a case ) , though the latter may be the reason why a more widespread crackdown on this behavior may take some time .

Beef up the grief !
-- Eddie Izzard
6th century B.C. : Greek legislator Solon institutes curbs against the use of professional mourners .
4th century B.C. : Plato forbids hired mourners in his Laws .
4th century : Saint John Chrysostom derides the use of " hired women … as mourners to make the mourning more intense , to fan the fires of grief . "
12th century : Epic about Spanish hero El Cid shows him requesting only unpaid grief :
When I die , heed my advice :
Hire no mourners to weep for me .
There is no need of buying tears ;
Those of Jimena will suffice .
When I die , heed my advice :
Hire no mourners to weep for me .
There is no need of buying tears ;
Those of Jimena will suffice .
17th century : Irish church forbids the hiring of professional mourners .
1800 : Archbishop of Cashel prohibits " all unnatural screams and shrieks , and fictitious , runeful cries and elegies , at wakes , together with the savage custom of howling and bawling at funerals . "
Professional mourners were widely used in ancient Greece , Rome , and the Middle East , and the practice held strong in many countries through the Middle Ages and , in some countries , even into the present day .
Many saw professional mourners as a crucial part of the ceremony of loss .
Like hired event planners , mourners applied their expertise to a practice that might otherwise fall into chaos .
Of course , the bereaved were capable of grieving by themselves , but the professional mourner helped them to marshal and coordinate their expressions of grief .
Among Spanish Jews in the 14th century , the hired mourner made her position as coordinator of grief more than metaphorical , by accompanying her wailing with a rhythm - setting tambourine .
Of course , the idea of paying for grief makes some people very uncomfortable .
The institution of professional mourning was subject to accusations of opportunism , insincerity , and mercenary motives .
In the 18th century , French explorers in Africa ( completely unaware , it seems , of the prevalence of professional mourning in the supposed fount of Western culture ) sneered : " In default of real grief , wealthy people have the tears and cries by means of hiring certain women for the role . "
But mourners in ancient Greece and Rome , in medieval Europe , and elsewhere heard the same objections from within their own cultures .
The need , however , was strong enough to sustain the practice through much of the Middle Ages .
Professional mourning was so widespread in the 12th century that , in the poem cited above , El Cid assumes that mourners will be hired for him unless he specifically demands otherwise .
By the late Middle Ages , however , the church began to look down on the practice of demonstrative mourning in general ( the thought of heaven should be sufficient to comfort the grieving parties , and dramatic lamentation implied a lack of belief in a happy afterlife ) , and professional mourning in particular .
This was the case not only in Europe in the Christian church , but in the Islamic world as well : for instance , the regulations on custody in Islamic law link professional mourning with other " low trades " such as stealing and prostitution .
Religious figures not only did away with professional mourners -– they replaced them .
In the Christian world , priests would officiate at funerals , and in return , rich people often bequeathed money to orphanages and monasteries .
In his comprehensive book Crying : The Natural and Cultural History of Tears , Tom Lutz writes : " Professional mourners have not so much disappeared over the last millennium ; they have simply donned robes and stopped crying " ( 201 ) .
Objections to demonstrative mourning , and to professional mourning particularly , were also related to the perception of grieving as a feminine activity .
In ancient Greece , lamentations were traditionally performed by professional women and female family members .
Later , the separate spheres of industry and domesticity ensured that death was largely the province of the women .
Psychiatrist Barbara Dorian has suggested that women ’s brains may be hardwired to feel loss and grief more strongly than men's .
Whatever your feelings on this sort of determinism , the assumption remains that florid displays of emotion are seen as quintessentially feminine .
Distaste for mourning and for hired mourners may be partly an effort to suppress this feminine emotion .
Mourning in ancient Greece was one of the only ways in which women could wield public power , and theorists have argued that legislators , like Solon , who spoke out against professional mourning were trying to contain the subversive potential of the female voice .
Although professional mourning has largely disappeared from the consciousness of Western culture , it has left its mark on the language .
The word " placebo , " Latin for " I will please , " was used to refer to paid lamentations before it meant " non-active medication . "
And " threnody " ( sad song ) comes from the Greek threnos -- the carefully constructed song of the professional mourner , as opposed to the disorganized weeping of family and friends .

One of China 's best - known dissidents is recovering from brain surgery in Germany after having been assaulted by a Chinese policeman .
Ai Weiwei , an internationally famous artist who helped design the " Bird 's Nest " Olympic stadium in Beijing , said in a telephone interview that an operation Monday night at a Munich hospital was successful .
" I am fine , I am definitely in no danger , " Mr. Ai said from his hospital bed Thursday .
Ai , an outspoken critic of the Chinese government , was punched in the face by a policeman on Aug. 12 , when police broke into his hotel room in Chengdu , the capital of Sichuan Province , in the middle of the night .
He and several other colleagues were then detained for 11 hours , preventing Ai from attending the trial of human rights activist Tan Zuoren , at which he had intended to give evidence .
Mr. Tan had posted comments on the Internet questioning why so many children had died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake .
He was tried for inciting sedition because of his suggestions that shoddy building work was to blame for the large number of schools that collapsed in the quake .
" After the punch , I suffered tremendous headaches all the time , " Ai said , but he was too busy preparing for a forthcoming show in Munich to do anything about it .
" When I arrived in Germany , I realized I was not functioning well , so I went to a hospital , " he said .
Ai had taken special interest in the earthquake 's aftermath , compiling a list of names of thousands of victims and posting it on his blog , in the absence of an official count .
Access to his blog is blocked in China .
( Read the Monitor 's report about his efforts here ) .
Volunteers who helped gather the names for the list were often arrested and expelled from Sichuan .
But Ai said at the time he believed that his international renown , and the fact that his father was a highly respected poet , gave him some protection .
He also said that his active use of the Internet made official retribution less likely , because it could be quickly and easily publicized .
" Because of the Internet , we can easily get our voice out , " he said in an interview last April .
" The faster we can spread our ideas , the safer we are .
The more open I am , the safer I am .
But maybe that 's an illusion . "
Recently , The Cranky Flier wrote about the airline El Al ( which seriously sounds like it should serve flights to the planet Kypton ) creating a super - low economy section by charging for services normally offered for free .
This “ unbundling ” , as it ’s known in industry parlance , would charge for things like snacks and drinks .
I ’m assuming there ’s no upcharge for seat belts and barf bags .
And I just complained about the ludicrous prices of hotels in much of the First World – the United States is my most egregious example , but western Europe is hardly a bargain .
Why not put the ideas together ?
That is , unbundling hotel services .
I ca n’t take credit for this idea – it was the ever - practical wife ’s suggestion when I told her about El Al .
I ’d completely be willing to forgo telephone services , irons in the room , cable TV and a bad continental breakfast .
Hmm , I guess “ bad continental breakfast ” is redundant .
I ’ve always thought that first a pastry is a pastry – then it gets stale and becomes a “ scone . ”
Once the scone solidifies into a rocklike mass surpassing diamonds on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness , it winds up on a tray in a hotel ’s continental breakfast spread ; only the brutally acidic coffee on display is caustic enough to break it down for consumption by some humans .
But I digress .
That seems a nifty solution to what I consider the really poor values that are most hotels .
Here ’s a question for you :
What standard hotel services would you forego to knock some bucks off the bill ?

The next time you hear about the " death of the novel " , beat the speaker over the head with 2666 .
And then make them read it .
Five books in one , masterfully interwoven not only by recurrent ideas and characters but by a torrential humour , deep humanity and sheer storytelling bravura , the posthumous masterpiece from the Chilean - turned - Catalan magician ( splendidly translated by Natasha Wimmer ) should stand on every self - respecting bookshelf .
That makes his encyclopaedic epic – which has critics reaching for Sterne , Cervantes , Pynchon and Musil allusions – feel a duty or chore .
It 's not .
Beyond the fabulous picaresque fun of the opening , it becomes a searing elegy for all the wretched of the earth among the forgotten dead of " Santa Teresa " on the Mexico - US border , and closes amid the polished barbarism of the Third Reich .
2666 offers everything that fiction can – and then gives even more .
Gringo Lingo , Learning Spanish in Buenos Aires
Spanish in Argentina is quite distinct from other countries , with different pronunciation , unique slang and even grammar rules that vary .
Whether you ’re looking for formal training or to take a more casual approach , here are some of the best strategies for mastering Argentine Spanish .
Maybe you ’ve studied abroad in Mexico or Spain .
Maybe you ’ve spent endless hours in a classroom languishing over the prose of Neruda and Borges .
Or maybe you ’ve learned from the streets .
One step off the plane in Buenos Aires , however , and you could find yourself unexpectedly lost .
Whether it ’s the cadence , pronunciation or dialect , Spanish — or rather , castellano — is a different beast in Buenos Aires .
Argentine Spanish is different
Grammar
If you took Spanish classes in the US , Europe or Australia you probably learned that in Spanish there are two ways to say “ you , ” the formal usted and the informal tú .
If straight off the plane the taxi driver hit you with a “ ¿de donde sos vos ? ”
It may have come as a bit of a shock .
In Argentina , they use vos , a third form of you , that like tú , is informal .
Conjugating verbs for vos
The easiest and most universal trick to conjugating for vos is to ignore any changes in the verb that may take place ( for irregulars ) for tu and add an s in place of the r. Examples :
Querer – Vos queres
Tener – Vos tenes
Jugar – Vos jugas
Fortunately , there are only three irregular vos verbs .
Ser – Vos sos
Ir - Vos vas
Haber - Vos has
While you wo n’t have any issues being understood if you stick with the tú form , understanding vos will help with your comprehension , and using it will help you sound more local .
Pronunciation
Thanks to the massive wave of European immigration from the middle of the 19 the century to the end of the 20 the century , Argentine Spanish was greatly influenced by Italian .
Argentine Spanish has an intonation of stressed syllables and sing - songy rhythm that research has shown more closely resembles the Italian accent than that of other dialects of Spanish .
Argentine Spanish also differs in the “ sh ” pronunciation of the ll and y sounds , which are usually pronounced as “ y ” in other Spanish accents .
Lluvia ( rain ) for example , which would typically be pronounced yuvia , becomes shuvia in Argentina , and yo ( I ) becomes sho .
Slang
Perhaps the most distinctive quality of Argentine Spanish is Lunfardo , Argentina ’s extensive catalogue of unique phrases and slang that almost make up a complete language on their own .
These terms were originally used by Buenos Aires ’ criminal class , but over time have disseminated across social strata and is now part of the standard vernacular in Buenos Aires .
While it ’s doubtful you learned these expressions in a Spanish class back home , or in any other country , these phrases are crucial to understanding everyday conversations in Argentina .
Che
1 . Often times , che is used in the same way that English speakers use the words buddy , dude , man or mate .
“ ¡ Che ! ¿ Qué pasó anoche ? ” ( Dude , what happened last night ? )
2. Equally often , che is used to get the attention of another during a conversation , in the same manner that English speakers use “ hey ” or that other Spanish speakers use “ oye . ”
“ Che , dame las llaves . ” ( Hey , give me the keys . )
Boludo
1 . Used between friends as dude / mate , often used with che .
“ ¡ Che boludo !
¿todo bien ?
( hey dude , what ’s up ?
2 . As an insult to mean idiot , often accompanied with the “ que haces ” hand gesture in which the thumb and fingers are all pressed together facing up as you shake your hand slightly .
Dale
1 . In Buenos Aires , most of the times you hear “ dale , ” it will be used much in the same manner as English speakers use , “ ok . ”
2. Sometimes , dale can also be used to hurry another person along .
“ Bueno .
Dale , dale ! ” ( Alright .
Hurry up , come on ! )
Mina
Woman / chick “ mira esta mina , que belleza ! ” ( “ check out that chick , what a beauty ! ” )
Pibe
Guy / dude “ ¡Hay demasiados pibes en este boliche para tan pocas minas ! ”
( There are so many dudes at this club and so few chicks ! )
Quilombo
Used to describe a big mess or something very chaotic .
“ ¡ Que quilombo la casa después de la fiesta anoche ¡ ” ( The house is a mess after the part last night ! )
These lunfardo expressions are some of the most common slang you ’ll hear in Argentina , but they ’re only the tip of the iceberg .

Spanish Classes
Formal Classes
While learning the slang of Argentine slang is fun and useful , if you ’re a beginner you will probably want to take some formal classes to build a foundation .
Fortunately , there are no shortage of Spanish school , institutes , and tutors in Buenos Aires .
If you ’re looking for a more relaxed environment and to socialize in the process , a group class will probably be a better fit .
We recommend either the Español para Extranjeros course at the University of Buenos Aires ( UBA ) , or a small group class at Vamos Spanish Academy which are week - long intensive courses perfect for shorter term trips .
The downside of a group class is that you wo n’t have the undivided attention of the instructor , so if you ’re short on time or have a specific topic you would like to focus on ( pronunciation , subjunctive , etc ) , a private Spanish tutor can provide more individualized classes .
Whether to take group or private classes comes down to your goals and your budget .
Group classes , which will be less expensive , will likely be more fun , and afford the opportunity to meet new people .
Private classes , on the other hand , offer more flexibility and will likely provide quicker progress .
Lingua Franca
Hobbies , professional interests and passions : we all have them .
After spending years practicing art , reading books , watching movies and / or listening to music we ’ve developed our own informal and specialized vocabularies .
Not being able to talk about your passions and interests in an intelligent way can be frustrating , and translating these specialized vocabularies into another language can be quite a challenge .
However , by registering for extension courses at the UBA ’s Centro Cultural Rector Ricardo Rojas , you can continue within the lingua franca of your personal interests while learning new Spanish vocabulary and meeting others with similar interests .
These informal courses , which cover subjects ranging from 20th - century art in Argentina and philosophy to acrobatics , are perfect for the intermediate - advanced speaker looking to take their Spanish to the next level .
Immersion : live the language
While I highly recommend taking formal lessons , these alone will not allow you to fully develop a true fluency .
Why is that ?
Well , these settings are controlled environments .
Furthermore , in the case of classroom lessons , you will be conversing with other foreigners .
Regardless of differences in native languages , all students learning Spanish begin with the same base vocabulary .
You will quickly find that while this vocabulary is entirely necessary for your survival here , it is only the beginning .
To step beyond the doldrums of this repetitive and basic vocabulary and discover some of the most common yet understudied parts of the Spanish spoken in Buenos Aires , you ’ll need to have regular and unplanned conversations with native Spanish speakers .
Live with Spanish speakers
Whether you ’re coming to Buenos Aires to study or work it may be tempting to live alone or with other expats .
Although probably easier and less fraught with miscommunications and cultural differences , resist this temptation and live with Argentines .
For students , living in a homestay will probably give you the most culturally Argentine experience possible and the best chance at improving your Spanish .
For anyone not studying , there are several Facebook groups devoted to room rentals , and while being able to chat in English at the end of a long day may sound nice , forcing yourself to do it in Spanish will do a lot more for your conversation skills .
Make Spanish speaking friends
Perhaps your new Argentine roommates will become good friends and they ’ll invite you to asados where they introduce you to their other friends and you can practice Spanish .
In the case that this does n’t happen , language exchanges are great opportunities to practice your Spanish and meet new people .
Mundo Lingo is one of the most popular ones and takes place at bars in various neighborhoods almost every night of the week .
Upon entering the bar you ’ll be offered flag stickers that represent your native language , and any other languages you ’re fluent in or are learning .
While these events are meant to be language exchanges , the ratio often skews more towards men and if you ’re an English - speaking female you may end up getting bombarded with attention .

With the space shuttle nearing retirement ( seven flights remaining ) , the International Space Station almost finished and plans for blasting more astronauts out of this world under fire , the Human Space Flight Review panel has a lot to figure out — and not a lot of time .

President Obama set a 90 - day deadline when he asked a blue - ribbon panel in May to conduct a detailed review of the U.S. human spaceflight program , now a mature 50 - something but no less part of America ’s cultural and scientific DNA than it was in the brash days of the Mercury 7 .
Should we go back to the moon ?
Leave the moon to private industry and move on to Near Earth Objects ( the asteroid belt ) and Mars ?
International cooperation or go it alone ?
Partner with private rocket jocks or build rockets with government money ?
Keep the shuttle running a little longer ?
Redirect the Constellation program or stop it altogether to go in a new direction ?
Ditch the International Space Station or sell it ?
What will change mean to the American space workforce , government and private ?
These are just some of the questions that the HSF panel will consider before making a recommendation to the president and Congress on the way forward .
I was lucky enough to attend one of the public meetings .
The mood in the crowd was ripe with expectation .
Lay people , students and those working in the industry packed the auditorium , hoping to catch a glimpse of where the panel ’s thinking may lie .
Personally , I was very impressed with what I saw .
The panel was very inquisitive and asked many probing questions .
No assumption was left to stand without some evidence to back it up .
( Also , it was very cool to see Sally Ride in person ! )
Before the end of August , Norman Augustine and the other members of the panel will deliver the group ’s consensus .
I am very much looking forward to the presentation .
At that point , the ball will be in Obama ’s court .
Traditionally , the president has been the one to set priorities for NASA and where the country takes its space program .
I would love to see a video like this with President Obama announcing a bold plan to explore our solar neighborhood :
These are exciting times !
I for one am rooting for the creation of America ’s first Space Academy .
Although , I ’d prefer it be established in Cocoa Beach instead of in San Francisco .
Where do you think America ’s future lies when it comes to human spaceflight ?

Female orgasms rely on penis size and mental focus , but not the duration of foreplay , according to a new study .
But some Australian researchers and practitioners question the methodology and the political motivations behind the study .
The research , led by Stuart Brody from University of the West of Scotland , asked 1,000 Czech women about their experiences of vaginal orgasms as well as their sexual education .
Their results appear in an upcoming issue of The Journal of Sexual Medicine .
The researchers define a vaginal orgasm as an " orgasm produced simply from movements of the penis in [ the ] vagina without any additional stimulation " .
It found that regularity of vaginal orgasms depends on a number of factors including the length of the penis and the duration of intercourse , but it concluded that the duration of foreplay was not a factor .
Does size matter ?
One - third of the women ( 34 per cent ) said that they were more likely to have an orgasm with a longer than average penis ( 14.5 centimetres ) , but nearly two - thirds said that they had no preference .
" Given that the vagina [ has a high nerve density ] throughout … more thorough stimulation of the full length of the vagina … might result in a more fulfilling experience , " the paper 's authors write .
But Dr Gemma O'Brien , a reproductive physiologist from the University of New England in Armidale , says the methodology of the findings regarding penis length needs careful consideration .
" Self - reporting needs to be done very carefully , " Dr O'Brien said .
" These things come down to perceptions and that introduces a weakness in the study . "
Sex education
Professor Brody and colleagues also found that women who were " taught that the vagina ( or the vagina as well as the clitoris ) was important for eliciting female orgasm " had significantly greater success in regularly achieving vaginal orgasms .
Even more important was the ability to mentally focus on vaginal sensations .
The researchers suggest that this ability may itself be " due in part to having been guided to do so by sexual education " .
As a result , they argue that " it is incumbent upon sex education , sexual medicine , and wider social policy to be supportive of women's sexual health , which includes being supportive of vaginal orgasm " .
Dr O'Brien believes this aspect of the research has the potential to help a lot of women .
" It can be applied to help women who have orgasmic difficulties , " she says .
" The importance of being able to focus really shows that the brain is the most important sex organ .
If women can be trained to focus on their vaginal sensations , they may improve their orgasmic consistency . "
Hidden agendas ?
Dr Vivienne Cass , an adjunct professor at Curtin University of Technology in Perth and author of The Elusive Orgasm , worries about the motivations of research that emphasises vaginal over clitoral orgasms .
She sees this emphasis as part of the increasing " medicalisation of sexuality " .
" There has been concern among my colleagues who , like me , think that there is enormous pressure to fit in with drug companies to help women get vaginal orgasms , " said Dr Cass .
" Women who ca n't achieve vaginal orgasms are treated as sick . "
She says if they are treated as sick then drug companies might be able to sell them a pill .
" We have to understand that we are not studying orgasms in a nice , value - free , scientific context . "
The study also claims that women who have experienced vaginal orgasms " have a greater satisfaction with their sex life , mental health , relationships with both partners and friends , and life in general . "
But Associate Professor Rosemary Coates , also of Curtin University of Technology and president of the World Association for Sexual Health , believes that such assumptions are " reverting back to Freudian assumptions about female sexual responses , " saying that " some form of clitoral stimulation is almost always required to trigger orgasm " .
The study authors dismiss this view as " clitorocentric " and blame it for the " destruction of human pleasure " .
Associate Professor Coates says that such a claim is " nonsense " .
" The main pleasurable nerve endings are located in the clitoris and to achieve the full pleasure of orgasm , these nerve endings must be stimulated , " she says .
" I think these authors have clitoral envy . "

Pterosaur features defy comparison
A well - preserved pterosaur with soft tissues reveals this flying reptile had hair , claws and wings that were unlike anything seen on today 's living animals , suggests a new paper .
Analysis of the remains , which date to around 140 to 130 million years ago , indicate pterosaurs were warm - blooded insect eaters that may have lived in trees and possessed sophisticated flying skills .
" Pterosaurs are unique in their bone construction and our study also shows that some of the soft tissues of these creatures differ from anything known today , " says study author Dr Alexander Kellner .
Kellner , a paleontologist at the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro , and colleagues made the determinations after studying the remains of the adult pterosaur Jeholopterus ningchengensis , found in Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous layers of the Daohugou Bed in China .
Wing tissues show the pterosaur had a nearly one metre wingspan with a complex flying membrane located between the animal 's body and each of its large fingers .
The membrane consisted of up to three layers containing structural fibres , with fibres in each layer oriented in a different direction , forming a reticular pattern .
" We conclude that this pterosaur might have been able to adjust the wing membrane during flight in order to enhance flight capability , " explains Kellner , who says the construction might have also permitted pterosaurs to position the wings as desired when not flying .
The fibres also gave strength to the wings , preventing tears .
The study , published in the latest issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , further describes hair - like structures that covered the pterosaur 's body , including part of the wing membrane .
Unique features
The hairs , previously theorised to have been feathers or protofeathers , consisted of " comparatively thick filaments , differing in structure from mammalian hair . "
" Now , what were they ? " asks Kellner .
" This is the point : ( They were ) a completely different structure that is not known in any living organism today . "
The researchers additionally found a " horny covering " on the pterosaur 's claws , " showing that the claws were much longer in life . "
" This corroborates with the hypothesis that these animals were good climbers and could have been living in trees , " says Kellner .
Italian paleontologist Dr Fabio Dalla Vecchia , one of the world 's leading experts on pterosaurs says , " The presence of up to three layers with differently oriented actinofibrils ( in the wing membrane ) is the most surprising thing in this study . "
" They were not observed in other well - preserved specimens and could mean that not all the pterosaur actinopatagia ( wing structures ) were built the same way , " says Dalla Vecchia .
He also says it 's important that the new paper has better defined the pterosaur hair - like structures , and their distribution on the body , since this too was n't known before .
" This is a remarkably well - preserved specimen , showing the importance of the Chinese deposits to understand different aspects of extinct organisms , " says Kellner .
" Hopefully more such specimens will come to light to enable us to understand a little more about how such strange animals , the pterosaurs , were functioning . "
The solar system is protected from galactic cosmic rays by the heliosphere , a giant magnetic bubble around the sun ( Illustration : Richard Mewaldt / Caltech )
Like a wounded Starship Enterprise , our solar system ’s natural shields are faltering , letting in a flood of cosmic rays .
The sun ’s recent listlessness is resulting in record - high radiation levels that pose a hazard to both human and robotic space missions .
Galactic cosmic rays are speeding charged particles that include protons and heavier atomic nuclei .
They come from outside the solar system , though their exact sources are still being debated .
Earth dwellers are protected from cosmic rays by the planet ’s magnetic field and atmosphere .
But outside Earth ’s protective influence , cosmic rays can play havoc with spacecraft electronics – they may be responsible for some recent computer glitches on NASA ’s Kepler spacecraft , which temporarily halted its planet - hunting observations .
They can also damage astronaut DNA , which can lead to cancer .
Now , the influx of galactic cosmic rays into our solar system has reached a record high .
Measurements by NASA ’s Advanced Composition Explorer ( ACE ) spacecraft indicate that cosmic rays are 19 per cent more abundant than any previous level seen since space flight began a half century ago .

Solar minimum
“ The space era has so far experienced a time of relatively low cosmic ray activity , ” says Richard Mewaldt of Caltech , who is a member of the ACE team .
“ We may now be returning to levels typical of past centuries . ”
The sun ’s magnetic field normally blocks some of the cosmic rays , preventing them from entering the solar system .
But that protection has weakened of late .
The solar wind , which helps project the sun ’s magnetic field out into space , has dropped in pressure to a 50 - year low .
And the strength of the magnetic field in interplanetary space is down to just 4 nanoTesla , compared to the more typical 6 to 8 nanoTesla .
The recent weakening of the shield is due to cycles in solar activity .
The sun is at a minimum in its 11 - year cycle of magnetic activity , and this particular dip is deeper than any other seen in nearly a century .
Extra shielding
That may be a sign that the unusually active sun of the past 100 years or so is returning to the historical norm of lower activity , or even entering a so - called grand minimum of exceptionally low activity that could last centuries .
Scientists can infer variations in the sun ’s magnetic activity over the past 10,000 years from the abundance of rare isotopes in Greenland ice cores .
If the increase in cosmic rays is here to stay , it could make long - duration human missions in space more challenging .
Astronauts aboard the International Space Station are still close enough to enjoy protection from Earth ’s magnetic field , but any sent in future to the moon or beyond will be outside that field .
“ The increase is significant , and it could mean we need to re-think how much radiation shielding astronauts take with them on deep - space missions , ” Mewaldt says .
Down time
If there ’s a long - term increase , it might also make sense to design future robotic missions for extra robustness against radiation , says Roger Hunter of NASA ’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , California , who manages NASA ’s planet - hunting Kepler mission .
It is not clear whether Kepler ’s temporary computer glitches were due to cosmic - ray hits , he says .
But the spacecraft is designed to be able to recover from such events , going into a safe mode while mission controllers work to restore it to normal operation , he adds .
“ Our only concern is will we see more events as a result of the cosmic - ray increase , ” he says .
Since its launch in March , Kepler has lost 3.5 days of observing time due to glitches that put it into safe mode .
However , the mission team always planned for occasional days lost to glitches , and considers up to 12 lost days per year to be acceptable .
That certainly was an interesting episode .
This is by far the greatest deviation from the normal format and I was really surprised only 2 regulars were seen ( Hugh Laurie and Robert Sean Leonard ) .
In terms of production , acting , and writing , the episode was amazing .
Hugh Laurie was unbelievable through the twists and turns of a mental institution .
There was no medical case other than some random music box stuff which I found pretty stupid and unnecessary .
There has to be better ways to show House being helpful .
Other than that , the episode was very multifaceted , touching on House , the patients , and the guy who runs the hospital .
The opening was highly impressive and there were no credits which according to Wikipedia has n't happened since season 3 .
I though the episode dragged on a little too long and could have done better condensed into and hour and a half .
An hour would n't do justice , but 2 hours was a little too much .
After a while , I just wanted House to run off .
Screw character development !
The funny thing is that the 2 hour episode was designed specifically to give House growth as a person which included interpersonal relationships .
We know this is heading down the path of Huddy as much as some people would like to disbelieve .
He meets Lydia , sister - in - law to a deaf patient .
They connect over music initially and growth pretty close .
Eventually House sleeps with her .
Almost immediately after , she moves away after her sister - in - law is cured by House .
Talk about a double - edged sword .
House is pretty upset about it , he probably never got upset when the hookers left , so he shows he actually cared for someone which is almost unprecedented .
House 's rapping roommate Alvie was awesome .
I do n't know if it was his manic condition , but could you not love him ?
His optimism and exuberance shone through the dregs on the blue tinted hospital .
His rebellion against authority compounded with helping House and then hating House for giving in was hilarious .
It would be cool to see Alvie in Princeton - Plainsburo someday and we 'll see whether his personality is when he 's regular .
There 's this crazy guy Steve who thinks he 's a superhero .
House tries to help him realize his dreams , but Steve ends up jumping off a parking structure .
House feels bad about this when he normally would not which is another sign he 's changing .
Dr. Nolan is House nemesis who turns into a friend .
Initially , House tries to go to easy way out with blackmail and causing general mayhem , but Nolan knows
House like the back off his hand .
House can't do anything other than to play ball which he eventually does .
They have some nice conversations which reveals a little about both of them .
Notice how in the beginning I never indicated whether or not I thought the episode in its entirety was good .
As an episode of ' House , ' I did n't particularly like it .
It just was not my cup of tea .
I like House for the fast - paced medical mystery and House 's interactions with everyone .
For a one time deal , the episode was certainly good , but I would not want to see .
I like how the show always maintains a sense of normalcy from episode to episode , and while House did show significant growth in this episode , there was a surreal nature to it which made it feel weird .

With the UK's teenage pregnancy rate the highest in Europe , and one in 10 UK babies born to a teenage mother , a BBC documentary crew followed two girls who badly wanted to get pregnant as they were forced to rethink their decision .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Sixteen - year - old Chantelle lost her virginity at 13 .
Having been with her boyfriend for a year and a half , she was desperate for a child .
" I could see myself as a mum next year pushing a baby around , I get jealous when I see people with babies , I feel like it should be me . "
But her mother , Mandy Pitt , was horrified by the idea , as she knew only too well the stark reality of being a teenage mother .
" She basically thinks that she 's got all the answers and all the solutions , like , 'oh you 'll help me ' , well I won't , I 'm not turning my back on her , but I wo n't help her make that wrong decision . "
" Chantelle wanting a child brings back memories , I made that decision at 17 and thought I was ready to have a baby .
At one point I got the Argos catalogue out and wrote everything down that I 'd need if I had a child
Lydia , 14 " I ended up on my own and it was really rough and it was tough and there was no support or nothing it was horrible not having anyone to turn to . "
Mrs Pitt found teenage motherhood so hard she eventually gave her child up for adoption and was adamant that Chantelle did not follow in her footsteps .
But there was an underlying reason why Chantelle was so desperate for a baby .
" I want a baby because I had an abortion when I was 14 , I did n't want to do it but I had to because I needed to live myself and ever since , there 's just been that little bit missing . "
Headstrong only child Lydia , was convinced she was independent enough to raise a child , even though she 's only 14 and does not have a boyfriend .
" I do n't know anyone else who wants a baby as much as me I really , really , really , really , really want a baby .
Chantelle 's mother Mandy had her daughter when she was 17 " At one point I got the Argos catalogue out and wrote everything down that I 'd need if I had a child . "
Lydia 's mother Josephine Boggis was 37 when she had her daughter , and cannot understand why she would want to throw her teenage years away .
" I think she 's looking for something or someone she can shower in love , something that she can be in charge of , because she likes to be in charge . "
The relationship between Lydia and her mother has been strained , and has played a large part in the reason why Lydia wants a baby .
" Well I 'd love to have a baby so you could bring it up like you wanted to have been brought up , if you know what I mean . "
In order to help the girls make an informed decision about getting pregnant , both were taken to see what their future could be like .
They met with teenage mothers who were living in one - bed mother and baby hostels .
Kim , who is now 16 , gave birth to her son when she was 13 .
With nowhere to go after he was born , she was one day away from being housed in a hostel for drug users and abused women .
" You have no choice , it 's not that easy to get a house .
" I do n't know why you 'd want to have a baby so young .
" I do n't want people to make the same mistake as me and to have to face everything that I have , just because they want a child . "
Lydia and her mother clashed over her desire to get pregnant Both families visited a maternity ward and talked openly and honestly about themselves and their relationships with a psychotherapist .
The teenagers also had a sleepless night looking after computerised babies , in order to have all the information they needed to make a decision .
After going through a week of these tough challenges , Chantelle and Lydia decided that motherhood could most definitely wait .
Chantelle has enrolled at a hairdressing college and has decided to wait at least a decade before having a baby .
Chantelle said : " When I see babies and ( their ) mums now I feel sorry for them and ask , ' are they good sleepers ? '.
" That 's the first thing I ask . "
Her mother Mandy Pitt has said she is thrilled with her daughter 's decision .
" To hear her say that now , I think phew , it 's amazing , it 's just a relief you know , and I just think , thank you . "
And while Lydia still likes the idea of having a baby , she has decided to pursue a career in the catering trade first .
" When I see babies I think , 'oh how sweet ' , I 'll definitely have one one day in the future . "

With the release of music game The Beatles : Rock Band , the world 's biggest group are going to find a whole new audience .
Here , Paul McCartney and Yoko
Ono tell why they agreed to allow the Beatles to become interactive
There are many ways you can get to see the youthful Paul McCartney these days – YouTube , BBC documentaries , the short films that come with the Beatles ' newly remastered CDs – but the best way is the Paul McCartney Soundcheck Package .
McCartney demonstrated this a few weeks ago at Fenway Park , home of the Boston Red Sox .
It was 4 pm , and there were about 80 people in the stadium .
A few of these were lighting and sound engineers , but most were competition winners from local radio stations and fans who had paid extra for a VIP experience .
McCartney smiled a lot as he played songs from Hamburg ( Matchbox , Honey Don't ) , songs from the Cavern ( All My Loving ) , songs from Top of the Pops ( C Moon , Let ' Em In ) and songs from his schooldays ( Leaning on a Lamppost ) .
The years fell away , and his performance was staggeringly good .
A woman in our tiny gathering unfurled a multicoloured sign which read , " Please can you sign my Hofner ? " , but McCartney was far too busy having fun .
Before he sang Leaning on a Lamppost , he explained that George Harrison had given him his ukulele , and before he left the stage he said : " This is a new one " as he began singing Yesterday .
When it was over he had a little chat with his band and security men , and wandered around .
Catering staff said : " How ya doin ' , Sir Paul ? " as he passed , and he said : " Good . "
He posed for a photograph with a young fan in a Beatles T - shirt .
He came up to me and said : " I saw you were taking notes … , " and I said I had been .
One of my notes read : " Two TV monitors , one by microphone at front stage , other further back by piano stool .
Autocues scrolling lyrics .
The words I saw :
He blew his mind out in a car / He did n't notice that the lights had changed . "
McCartney invited me to his trailer behind the stage .
His girlfriend , Nancy Shevell , was preparing iced tea in a large wine glass , and McCartney was sitting with his feet curled under him on a sofa .
His dyed brown hair was not as unnerving in reality as it can appear in photographs .
The trailer looked like a Middle Eastern souk – rugs on the walls , rich embroidery , sweet candles burning on low tables .
I told him how much I had enjoyed the previous evening 's show ( the first of two nights at the same venue ) , and he said that he was aware he had found his groove again .
McCartney is 67 , and his creativity and thumbs - up enthusiasm continue to surpass all reasonable expectations , but he learned long ago to face universal truths .
Last night 's concert had been a mixture of very popular music from half a century , but it was clear that the one thing his fans loved above everything else was songs by the Beatles .
They whooped during a few Wings numbers ( especially for the synchronised fireworks at the loud bits on Live and Let Die ) , but nothing approached the delight they showed for Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , Hey Jude , Get Back , Let It Be and The Long and Winding Road .
Above all , his fans went nuts for Yesterday , and they will go nuts for Yesterday for ever .
McCartney is happy playing the old stuff .
As he explained to the Boston Globe that week , " It 's like a comedian .
You can tell any joke you want , but the ones that they laugh at are probably the ones you should keep in the act . "
There may be several predictable reasons for McCartney 's newly energised enthusiasms – the fresh girlfriend , the great reception for his tour – but there is also an unconventional one .
His old band , the most important in the history of music , is about to be reborn through what was once the most reviled of art forms and the sad province of adolescent dead - enders – the videogame .
The Beatles : Rock Band is released this week amid expectation comparable to the release of The White Album .
There is n't any new music , but there is a new way of experiencing it , and a new audience ready to receive it .
Now a player may not only hear the youthful McCartney , but become him .
And when he or she becomes bored with Paul , there 's always John , George or Ringo .
In this way , the adventure of pop music is being reinvented .
" We 've made the Beatles music , " says McCartney as he sips his tea .
" It 's a body of work .
That 's it for us – it 's done .
But then what happens is that somebody will come up with a suggestion … "
The suggestion for a videogame came from George Harrison 's son Dhani in the winter of 2006 , when he met the head of MTV on holiday in the Caribbean .
MTV had just bought Harmonix , the leading music videogames company , based in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
" So we go , ' What is it ?
Why ? ' "
McCartney continues .
" Because one thing we do n't want to do is just do naff ideas . "
McCartney , Ringo Starr , Olivia Harrison and Yoko Ono ( known collectively and disconcertingly as " the Shareholders " ) began to meet people from Harmonix the following year , and McCartney remembers a meeting at Abbey Road in the spring of 2007 in which Harmonix staff demonstrated what they had done for veteran rockers Metallica .
There were " a couple of grown - ups standing looking very foolish with these little plastic guitars playing to a screen " , he says .
" And we 're going , ' Yeah , all right …
It just looks like a really bad band . '
They said : ' We really can do a great one with the Beatles , and we 'll show you . '
So Ringo and I got a bit intrigued .
They said : ' Look , the thing is , if we get it right , these things are very , very popular . '
And we go , ' Yeah , well , we know , because our kids and the young people we know do it . ' "
McCartney 's scepticism gently lifted .
" The scepticism is in order not to make a terrible mistake , " he explained .
" We go , ' no , no , ' and we 're really down on it , and they 've really got to prove themselves .
We wo n't go , ' Oh , that 's nice … go on boys , you just do it . '
We guard the flame a bit .
But then they did come back one day and they had something .
They were playing our songs , they had some visuals that were half - working , and the penny dropped .
We went , ' You know what ?
This could be pretty cool . ' "
The Beatles : Rock Band works on the same principles as other interactive music games .
You insert a disc into a PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 or Wii console , you strap on a replica guitar or sit at plastic drums , and you play along to a popular song on the television screen .
The song is programmed to respond to your performance : the more tunefully you sing , or the more accurately you press the buttons on the fretboard and hit the drums , the more points you get .
The screen displays not only the lyrics , but a long sequence of cues to tell you when to hit or strum , with the coloured notes on the screen corresponding to buttons on your guitar .
It is the digital version of the pub or campfire singalong , the 21st - century upgrade of the Victorian family parlour concert .
If you play well , you get mellifluous music that sounds like your heroes .
If you sing out of tune , your friends may walk out on you .
The Beatles : Rock Band takes things further .
There are 45 songs to choose from , soon to be augmented by downloadable albums ( in the following months you can get complete versions of Abbey Road , Sgt Pepper 's and Rubber Soul ) .
There are vocal harmonies , a complex innovation .
There is very lovely animation that plays before the music begins and in the background after you start playing .
There are six venues at which the songs are played ( Cavern Club , Ed Sullivan Theatre , Shea Stadium , Budokan , Abbey Road and the Apple Corps Savile Row Rooftop ) .
There is an elaborate system of gathering points to unlock rare audio and visual material from the Apple archives .
And then there is the significant fact that the Beatles have never involved themselves in anything like this before .
" They 've done it very respectfully , and so they should , " McCartney tells me .
" Not just because you should respect the Beatles , but mainly because there are a lot of people out there who are going to notice if you do n't . "
I ask McCartney whether he 's played it yet .
" I have n't , actually .
I 'm kind of , you know , looking forward to playing it .
My excuse is , I play guitar .
I was on the real record .
So the idea of pushing buttons and things in time is kind of slightly intriguing for me , but it 's actually more interesting to do a show like this … "
He motions to the stage beyond his trailer , where his support band MGMT are playing to a swelling audience .
I wonder what John and George would have made of The Beatles : Rock Band .
" I think they would have been amused , " McCartney says .
" I think they would have seen the point of it .
For us , let 's remember that the central thing is our music is getting played .
That 's the bottom line .
I 'm sure John and George would have thought , ' Hey , what a clever idea . ' "
Two miles from McCartney 's show , the people who made the game are talking it up with pride and amazement .
Harmonix is on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge , just down the road from Harvard .
The office sits between a pharmacy and a Get in Shape For Women studio , a series of rooms that resembles something closer to a student dorm than a company valued at hundreds of millions of dollars .
( MTV bought Harmonix in 2006 for $ 175 m , but has since paid almost $ 500 m in additional bonuses . )
In one of the rooms , decorated with a large framed poster of the Beatles , Alex Rigopulos , the co-founder , and Paul DeGooyer , senior vice president of MTV 's games division , are discussing their hopes for what may be their most lucrative game to date .
" Everyone knows of the Beatles , " Rigopulos says , " but there 's this whole generation for whom the music is n't personal , it is n't close to them .
And for that younger audience we 're delivering this incredible music in the most impactful way imaginable .
In a way , it 's a relaunch . "
Rigopulos and DeGooyer are aware of their coup : now that the biggest band of all have entered the arena , it has not only created a whole new series of marketing possibilities , but has legitimised their industry .
It marks the precise point at which music videogames come of age .
Harmonix began in 1995 as a concept at MIT 's Media Lab .
Its first clients were theme parks , and it entered the domestic market with a computer mouse that could also serve as a musical instrument on primitive games .
Rock Band was only launched at the end of 2007 , but already its retail sales in north America have exceeded $ 1bn , and gamers have downloaded more than 40 million songs for $ 1.99 each .
As the company 's co-founder Eran Egozy said recently , the delivery of rock music has just entered a new phase .
There was vinyl , the cassette , the CD , digital downloads and now there is the downloadable digital interactive computer track .
" It 's a launching point for how we see the future of music evolving . "
Harmonix has competition .
Guitar Hero , made by Activision but originally developed by Harmonix , was launched in 2005 and has since sold more than 25 million copies , making it the market leader .
But with the Beatles in its stable , Harmonix believes it has pulled off the ultimate coup .
Songs by the Rolling Stones and the Who were already on Rock Band , but neither of those bands were controlled by the byzantine structure that is Apple Corps Ltd , the company that has handled all of the Beatles ' creative activity since 1968 .
But Apple has always had a canny eye for the innovative and the lucrative , and a neat way of relaunching the Beatles for each new generation ( the last time it was the exhaustive Anthology project in 1995 ) .
The main problem was not the concept but the technicalities .
" Apple said to us , ' We do n't even want to talk about this any more unless you come up with a solution to separating out some of the earlier songs , ' " DeGooyer remembers .
Rock Band requires each of the main instruments to be played in isolation , but on the Beatles early hits the drums and guitars would often be recorded on the same piece of tape .
Dhani Harrison believed that the CIA would have some sort of technology to separate them , but in the end a solution was proffered by a company in Cambridge , England , called Cedar .
There was also the problem of security .
Apple would not permit the Beatles ' master recordings to leave the studio vaults , much less travel to Boston , so once the tracks had been separated out they then had to be encrypted .
In the summer of 2007 , Harmonix received five songs to play with : I Want to Hold Your Hand , Helter Skelter , Taxman , Revolution and Here Comes the Sun .
The plan was for Harmonix to show how the game might work , and to conceive a rough idea of how an animated Beatles might look on screen .
The songs came with instructions .
" Apple gave us some guidelines to stick to , " says Josh Randall , Harmonix 's creative director .
" They said it needs to feel analogue , it needs to feel British , and even though it 's a videogame , it should n't feel computery .
But we should also try to make something new – not just go back and rehash the old stuff . "
In the end , the visual team produced a presentation based around Day Tripper , which was the first the Beatles saw of the game when they gathered at Abbey Road in summer 2008 .
" From each of them there were just tons and tons of ideas , " says Rigopulos .
" They said : ' Oh , you could do this , you could do that , you could do this … ' "
" We did get very hands - on , " McCartney says .
" We said : ' Show us everything – how does it work ? '
They said : ' If you attain a degree of efficiency you 'll then get points , and your prize will be trivia facts about the Beatles . '
I said : ' Oh great – show us them . '
So they showed me one and I went , ' Oh , that 's wrong . '
It was the first one up .
" Some things you just do 'em : somebody 's doing a book or something – we 'll help them , but it 's not our responsibility .
But this is going to go out in our name , so we really have to be careful . "
According to Rigopulos , McCartney asked a lot of pointed questions .
" He was n't aloof at all .
He really did care about accuracy .
There were some ideas we had about mixing and matching times and places that intentionally disregarded historical accuracy , and he put his stake in the ground .
We said : ' Maybe the rooftop concert can have songs performed that actually you guys did n't perform on the rooftop . '
And he said : ' No .
There are some things we can play with , but some aspects of the design we should be true to . ' "
In the game , the Beatles are animated in imaginative ways .
Given the band 's history with Yellow Submarine , this will not be unfamiliar territory for the older player , but it caused a lot of heartache at Harmonix .
McCartney is a keen fan of modern animation , not least because he watches films with his grandchildren and the five - year - old daughter he shares with Heather Mills .
He felt that the early work was not hugely impressive .
" We said : ' Look , the eyes do n't work . '
They said : ' No , eyes are very hard to do …. '
Then : ' Wait a minute , John 's too wooden … '
I started to say , ' Look , Shrek 's good .
There 's this great thing , Arthur and the Invisibles , the Luc Besson film . '
So I started to give them things to aim at . "
Josh Randall says that all the Beatles and their wives were heavily involved .
Talking on the phone from Henley - on - Thames , Olivia Harrison will tell me later that she thought there was a problem with the proportions in early drawings of George 's face .
" I started to look at photos to see where they went wrong .
I thought they could capture those eyes , and get that little bit of a crooked smile . "
She had played the game with Dhani in LA and was eager to have another go in private .
" It makes you appreciate music a little deeper .
We do n't have a band , but the music exists , and I do n't see any harm in letting people have another way of experiencing it . "
It was Yoko Ono who apparently caused the most problems with the game 's designers .
Alex Rigopulos remembers one visit to their office during which Ono reminded them how windy the rooftop concert was , necessitating changes to the band 's hair .
There were other corrections : " She would tell our animation guys how John would approach the mic , how heavy his eyes would be , giving them quite a hard time .
But at the end she said to them , ' It 's OK – I 'm an artist too . ' "
From Tokyo , by email , Yoko later responds to my questions .
" We , especially Olivia and I , were very caring about how the images of the Beatles were represented , as well as the music , " she says .
" The Harmonix people were keen to involve us .
I think they were really happy that we wanted to integrate ourselves so much into the project . "
She has n't had time to play the game , but promises to " explore it properly " when she finishes promoting her new album .
" As a parent myself , I am very aware of the highly educational aspect of this game , " she says .
" It will inspire and encourage the young generation to be intimately involved in music making .
You can't ask for more .
It will be another musical revolution created by the Beatles to make our planet a planet of music . "
The last key figure in the making of the game was Giles Martin , the son of George Martin .
His remixing of the Beatles hits for the Love project ( the Beatles collaboration with Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas ) had earned him the trust of the band , and he acted as the middleman between Apple and Harmonix , helping to select tracks for the game and create new precise endings for songs that had previously faded out .
He too was initially suspicious of the idea .
" I was thinking , ' Am I making a Beatles Zippo lighter or a Beatles plastic tray ? '
I was snooty about it at first – ' Oh God , we 're just making a game . '
There 's part of me , being a musician , that wants to say , ' Why do n't you go and play a proper guitar and not play a plastic one ? '
But what I do like about it is that it makes us listen to the music again and again , in the way that we used to when we bought albums .
As opposed to having 3,000 songs on your iPod which you flick through with obsessive button pressing .
These days we do hear a lot of music , but we do n't actually listen to it very often . "
Giles Martin told me he was surprised , when he tried to play I Want to Hold Your Hand , at just how complex the bass line was .
I knew what he meant .
At the end of my first day at Harmonix , I entered the company 's Star Chamber , where the games are tested .
It is also the room where staff come to relax after a hard day 's struggle with Ringo 's cymbal crashes and George 's eyelids .
Shortly before I was joined by publicity and other staff for a " concert " , I picked up a replica of McCartney 's Hofner bass propped up on a leather sofa .
This had been designed on a slightly reduced scale by Matthew Reineck , who also makes real guitars .
The Hofner and the scaled - down models of Lennon 's Rickenbacker , Harrison 's Gretsch and Ringo 's Ludwig drums were plastic , but they felt OK in the hand .
Reineck explained that McCartney 's bass had been made with great attention to detail ( Hofner had supplied a special sample of the wood grain ) , but there were also variations .
Unlike the original , the guitar was designed for a right - handed player , and it came with a " whammy bar " to enable nice sustain effects and ensure " backwards compatibility " with other Rock Band games .
" McCartney reviewed it halfway through the design process , " Reineck said , " and he did n't have an issue with it . "
The Hofner will come bundled in a big box with Ringo 's drums and a microphone with stand , and will retail for £ 180 .
The Rickenbacker and the Gretsch will each cost £ 90 , while the game just on its own ( requiring the use of older Rock Band instruments ) will cost either £ 40 or £ 50 depending on the console .
As Reineck was talking , various people arrived in the room and strapped on their wireless guitars .
One of them inserted a disk in the machine , and apologised for a slight technical glitch : the Rickenbacker had run out of batteries , a dilemma the Fab Four had rarely encountered .
I was surprised how much visual information is displayed on the screen all at once – it was like a musical satnav .
It helps if you have a big TV ; in fact , it is hard to see how the game could have existed before we all went mad for massive flat screens .
I was asked what song I fancied and I plumped for Sgt Pepper 's , but as a singer .
One man took pity on me and set the difficulty level to Easy .
( The game has five levels : Easy , Medium , Hard , Expert and No Fail , the latter a sort of training - wheels option to ensure the cloth - eared are not discouraged . )
The music began , that familiar chugging .
I began singing – that familiar awful sound .
But I was keen , and it was less fraught than regular karaoke ( you do n't have to be drunk for a start ) , and I became a part of the act I 'd known for all these years .
I appeared to get the right words at the right time , and when the song ended ( this took a while , as of course it segued into With a Little Help From My Friends ) the screen showed I had scored 99 out of 100 .
Vaguely preposterous , but I had made my small contribution to unlocking a rare photograph of the Beatles in the studio with information about the first time they all sported moustaches , and once I had enough of these I would unlock some rare audio of the Beatles goading each other about messing up an intro .
Glowing with success , I had a shot at Get Back .
Not so good ; only 97 % ; the rare photograph of George Harrison playing sitar on Magical Mystery Tour would have to wait .
Overall , I was n't so sure this was a good hobby for a grown man .
The future of music ?
Others seemed to think so .
I asked Olivia Harrison what George would have made of it .
" I hate to say , but I know I 'm his biggest fan and biggest critic , and I 'm happy with it .
I think they did a great job , and if I did n't like it I would feel very uncomfortable . "
Yoko told me : " People are always asking me what John would have thought of our new technology – email being our standard way of communication now etc .
He would have loved it all .
He was always for new ideas to give inspiration and encouragement to the world .
He would have been excited about the Rock Band concept , and very happy with how the music and the visuals of the Beatles were represented . "
Given the likely success of Rock Band and the remastered catalogue , Marty Bandier , the chief executive of Sony / ATV publishing , said : " The fourth quarter will belong to the Beatles . "
Backstage at Fenway Park , Paul McCartney is 90 minutes away from another night on stage .
He is explaining how the Beatles got their look .
" When I was a kid , I went with my parents and my brother to Butlins Holiday Camp at Pwllheli .
I had a vision … what do you call it ?
An epiphany .
I was by the swimming pool , and we were such a funny family , a little bit Alan Bennett .
From a door in one of the buildings , I see four guys walk out in a line .
They were all dressed the same .
They all had grey crew - neck sweaters , tartan twat hats ( as we used to call them , like the Kangols everyone wears now ) , tartan shorts , and a rolled white towel under their arm .
They just walked , and I thought , ' Holy shit ! '
They were in the talent show .
Then I went to see them in the talent show , and they wore grey zoot suits , and they were from Gateshead , and they won .
And I totally remember that .
So when we came to be the Beatles , I said : ' You know what ? ' and I told everyone about this epiphany .
And so we ended up in suits and we all wore the same . "
This was an unfamiliar yarn , and I was aware that McCartney had a reputation for reinterpreting history .
Or perhaps his memory had become sharper as he aged .
I said that I had always thought the look was Brian Epstein 's idea .
He said : " I do n't think it was . "
He explained that the suits may have been Epstein 's thing , as it was the only way they could get the better - paid gigs , but McCartney thought the idea of all looking the same was probably his own .
" When we showed up at a gig , we would come in like this [ regular street clothes ] , and then we'd get the boots and the suits , and suddenly we were the four - headed monster , and it was a very exciting feeling .
We 'd look at each other – wow !
And we'd become more than the sum of the parts .
We 'd become the Beatles . "
The show that night was terrific .
Thirty - five thousand people had an epiphany of their own .
The concert also marked another Beatles milestone , for as McCartney sang Got to Get You Into My Life , from 1966 , the vast screen behind him showed an animated film of the Beatles from 2009 .
" The pictures you saw there are from this new Beatles Rock Band thing , " he said .
His fans clapped and whooped , because they had been presented with a new opportunity , the ability to recreate tonight 's event at home .
Batteries required , unsurpassed creative genius optional .
Yesterday 's sound today
" The idea is to make the Beatles sound as good as they can , " says Allan Rouse , talking at Abbey Road .
He is the co-ordinator in charge of the digital remastering of the Beatles ' back catalogue .
This means that the Fabs ' 12 albums , plus Magical Mystery Tour , which became part of the core catalogue when the first Beatles CDs were released in 1987 , now boast a brighter , fuller sound .
Some bad edits , dropouts and vocal pops are gone ; but the odd cough , John muttering " fucking hell " during Hey Jude - this sort of thing remains .
" De- noising " - removing analogue tape hiss - has only been applied to five of a total of 525 minutes worth of music .
The release of the remastered CDs coincides with the arrival of Rock Band - " because , " says Rouse , " the Beatles are for everyone , not just for people in the past . "

We Sing
EMI , Warners and Universal are opening up their back catalogues to this Wii- based competitor to Sony 's SingStar .
Allows four people to sing along to the likes of Lily Allen .
The Beatles and iTunes
It 's one of the great unanswered questions of pop : why no Beatles on iTunes ?
" We 've been keen to do this for a while , " Paul McCartney told OMM .
" I met Guy Hands on a plane once .
His crew bought EMI .
I refer to them as Terracotta but I believe it 's Terra Firma .
I said : ' What is the problem ?
I want to do it , we all want to do it . '
And he explained that in the deal that we want , they feel exposed .
If [ digitised Beatles music ] gets out , if one employee decides to take it home and wap it on to the internet , we would have the right to say , ' Now you recompense us for that . '
And they 're scared of that . "
There may be other reasons .
George Harrison 's son Dhani said recently that there is a disagreement over the pricing of Beatles songs ; there are hints too that the band have considered setting up their own download store .
The official response from EMI is : " We would love to see the Beatles ' music on sale in digital stores . "

Tokyo may have one of the cleanest and most convenient commuter train systems in the world , but it has its pests .
In the first six months of this year police recorded more than 700 assaults by gropers on Tokyo's notoriously crowded trains .
This week police have launched Groping Prevention Week and investigators are also targeting websites which provide advice on the best train lines to go to to fondle women .
Every morning across
Tokyo , millions of commuters take a deep breath and join the jam on the city 's trains .
It is not uncommon at the larger stations like Shinjuku to see station attendants actually pushing people into already overflowing carriages .
This is the sort of environment where the gropers thrive .
Last year police recorded more than 6,000 cases involving women being fondled or surreptitiously photographed .
An anti-groping television advertisement shows more than 100 high school girls at Tokyo's Ikebukuro station holding up a banner that reads : " Groping is contemptible .
We do n't forgive it ! "
" Please help exterminate the gropers , " they shout .
Eight years ago , in an effort to exclude the gropers , Tokyo began running women - only carriages during rush hour .
Now those caught molesting women face up to six months in jail and a fine of $ 6,000 .
But that has not stopped hundreds of men preying on female commuters .
This week at a train station in Tokyo , a policewoman held classes to demonstrate how to deal with a groper .
" I often carry a bag and umbrella so I think I can swing it like a weapon if I need to , " a young woman said .
A policewoman says the techniques used by train gropers are becoming more clever and wicked .
It is believed thousands of women put up with the abuse and say nothing .
Surveys suggest two - thirds of young women in Tokyo have been molested on trains and prosecutors have found it difficult to get convictions because the men they 're after are often cunning and hunt in packs .
Police say there are now more than 100 websites devoted to train groping .

The most influential Muslim leader in the West Midlands urged his followers to ' vent their feelings ' against Right - wing protesters during a Birmingham rally that ended in violent clashes and 90 arrests .
Birmingham Central Mosque chairman Dr Mohammad Naseem encouraged Muslims to counter - demonstrate during Saturday 's anti-Islamic protest by the English Defence League ( EDL ) .
The police had advised community leaders to stop people from attending , reported The Times .

Faces of anger : Some of the Asian youths who opposed protesters from the Right - wing English Defence League in Birmingham .
The city 's top Muslim leader had urged his followers to ' vent their feelings '
Clashes : The English Defence League demonstration in Birmingham on Saturday
But Dr Naseem said it is not his place to discourage his followers from attending protests : '
The thing is , that is their right , I cannot say , " You do n’t have this right . " '
Troubled flared as the two groups of protesters clashed in the New Street area of the city centre , close to the main train station .
Terrified shoppers looked on in horror as gangs of men and youths hurled bottles at one another and pelted riot police with bricks .
Dr Naseem said that Muslims were instructed to not attend the rally alone but to team up with other counter - demonstrators including socialist and other religious groups .
He added that he had been assured by police that the EDL protesters and counter - protesters would gather in separate locations .
He said : ' If it was kept as originally intended , then everybody would have had a chance to give vent to their feelings without coming into contact with each other .
And that I will take up with the police . '
Police officers hold back members of the public protesting during the event
Last month there were also clashes when the English Defence League - formed after British soldiers were abused by Islamic radicals at a homecoming parade in Luton - held a rally on the same day as the Unite Against Fascism group .
The latest disorder involved around 200 people and spilled on to Bennetts Hill , a street popular with shoppers and lined with a number of pubs .
English Defence League marchers were involved in running disturbances which lasted all afternoon before the Right - wing protesters were taken to another part of the city by bus .
Witnesses claimed the English Defence League marchers , many of whom had been drinking since the morning , ripped up seats on the journey away from the city centre .
English Defence League supporters hold aloft the flag of Israel and gesture to police as they are corralled into a subway following the demonstration
But some members slipped away from the police , clashing with more than 30 socialist protesters amid cries of ' Racist scum , out of Brum ' .
After an hour of angry skirmishes in the city centre , the situation deteriorated further after a group of Asian men also joined in .
Sarah Edwards had to duck into a cafe to avoid being caught in the violence .
She said : ' We suddenly saw what seemed to be about 200 Asian men running down the street , throwing bricks .
' They had bandanas over their faces and were shouting and screaming .
We were so scared , we feared for our lives and had to run into the cafe so we would n't get hurt .
It is so shocking to see this on our streets '
The English Defence League has claimed it is not racist , even saying it did not want any violence to happen at the pre-planned protest .

One protester from the league , Leisha Brookes , 42 , said : ' We are simply protesting about the fact that if people come to our country , they should respect our laws .
' If an English person went to an Arab country they would be expected to dress appropriately , and all we are asking is for them to do the same . '
The league has planned protest marches in other cities , including one next month in Manchester .
Yesterday a West Midlands Police spokesman said all those arrested were male , aged between 16 and 39 , and offences included criminal damage and violent disorder , including possession of an offensive weapon .
He added : ' A number of fixed penalty notices have been issued while the remainder have been bailed while further enquiries take place . '
Contained : English Defence League supporters are herded into a pub entrance
Birmingham City Council last night praised the police for ' successfully ' managing the event .
But Labour MP Khalid Mahmood accused police of failing to prevent the riots .
He said : ' Police have had four weeks to plan for this but they have failed innocent members of the public in Birmingham city centre .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A cluster of UFO sightings over Britain in 1996 may have had more to do with public fascination with TV shows like the “ X Files ” than extraterrestrial activity , according to files released by the National Archives on Monday .
An illustration of an object sighted over Britain in 1993 , included in documents released by the UK National Archives on Monday .
REUTERS / National Archives / Handout
Documents from Britain ’s Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) indicated there were 609 UFO sightings in 1996 , compared with 117 in 1995 .
This coincided with the rise in popularity of the X Files and the release of the alien blockbuster film “ Independence Day . ”
The files , which span 15 years and contain more than 4,000 pages , show that for most cases the UFO sightings had ordinary explanations such as bright stars and planets , meteors , artificial satellites and balloons .
In one incident in 1995 , two men in the midland county of Staffordshire told police they saw an alien with a lemon - shaped head emerge from a hovering UFO and tell them “ We want you ; come with us . ”
Another case detailed dozens of sightings of a brightly illuminated oval object in London during 1993 and 1994 which was later explained as an airship advertising the launch of the Ford Mondeo car .
Despite most cases having a mundane reason behind them , some 10 percent were classed as “ unexplained . ”
For these , the MoD said there was “ insufficient information ” which is why it continued to collect reports .
The files also add a new detail on Britain ’s best known UFO incident , the Rendlesham Forest sightings of December 1980 in which American airforce men saw a series of mysterious lights .
The then government of Margaret Thatcher summarily dismissed the affair but a letter from a former chief of defense staff in 1985 warned it not to be so cavalier .
“ The case has puzzling and disquieting features which have never been satisfactorily explained ... which continue to preoccupy informed sections of the public , ” said the letter .

Multi-Line Lambdas in Python Using the With Statement
Python does not have multi-line lambdas because Guido dislikes them aesthetically .
However , with just a bit of introspection , code like this is possible :
>>> with each ( [ 12 , 14 , 16 ] ) : ... def _ ( x ) : ... print x ... print x + 1 ... 12 13 14 15 16 17
I 'll say a bit about my motivation for creating code like this , show how easy it is to write , and then I 'll argue that code like this is both pythonic and aesthetically appealing in some circumstances .
A Mystery Solved ( By Holmes Himself ! )
When I first saw code using the with statement , my hope was that it would be able to be used somewhat like Haskell 's
Where clause or Ruby 's blocks .
When I dug into the spec , I was disappointed to discover that if it was possible , it was n't easy , and I pushed the thought aside .
That was a couple years ago , and I did n't give it a moment 's thought until I saw a blog post by Richard Jones that uses a with statement in exactly the way I had considered impossible up to now .
I spent a few hours trying to figure it out , but I was stumped , so I put up a question on Stack Overflow to see if somebody could show me how he did it .
Within a few hours , Alex Martelli himself chimed in with a wonderful solution .
The gist of the answer is that you can use the inspect module to access the context manager 's calling scope , and figure out what variables have been defined between its __enter__ and __exit__ functions .
I 'm glad I asked aloud , because even if I had stumbled close to the solution , I surely would n't have come up with one as complete as his .
The How
Once I had Alex 's proof of concept code in hand , I went to work making it do what I 'd had in my head so long ago .
In about an hour , I was able to write code that looks like this :
@accepts_block def each ( iterable , block ) : for i in iterable : block ( i ) with each ( [ " twelve " , " fourteen " , " sixteen " ] ) : def _ ( x ) : print x @accepts_block def bmap ( arr , block ) : return map ( block , arr ) with bmap ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) as foo : def _ ( x ) : return ( float ( x ) + 1 ) / 2 print foo # [ 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 ]
What you see above are two functions which use a decorator giving them access to the function defined within the with block .
The decorator passes the block to the function as its last argument just like in Ruby .
To understand how this happens , you need to know how context managers work .
Context managers consist of a class with __enter__ and __exit__ methods which are called upon entering the with block and upon exiting , just as you 'd expect .
Alex 's solution involves scanning the scope of the calling function from the __enter__ and __exit__ methods , and pulling out the differences between them .
These differences will be all the variables that were defined in the with block .
A sketch :
class FindInteresting ( object ) : def __enter__ ( self ) : f = inspect . currentframe ( 1 ) self .
already_defined = dict ( f . f_locals ) def __exit__ ( self ) : f = inspect . currentframe ( 1 ) # pick out the differences between f.f_locals and self.already_defined
When we pick out the differences between the two , we need to be careful to check for names that have been redefined so that we do n't miss out on new functions that reuse old names .
def __exit__ ( self ) : f = inspect . currentframe ( 1 ) interesting = {} for n in f .
f_locals : newf = f . f_locals [n ] if n not in self .
already_defined : interesting [n ] = newf continue anf = self . already_defined [n ] if id ( newf ) != id ( anf ) : interesting [ n ] = newf
After this function has run , interesting is a dictionary which ( probably ) contains all the names and values of the variables that have been redefined in the with block .
Because we have to use the id check to determine if a name has been redefined , and Python sometimes caches objects in memory , our function can be fooled .
In this case , interesting will not detect x because it 's being redefined and cpython caches the low integers , so id ( x ) will be the same for both x s .
x = 1 with FindInteresting : x = 1
In general , the cpython runtime is not aggressive about caching , but you should know that this possibility exists .
If you use this technique , I recommend being strict about checking only newly defined functions , since there 's no way to be sure if you missed any redefined names .
To make the teaser code at the top of the article work , I just wrapped Alex 's code into a decorator that returned a context manager , then called the function being decorated with the definitions that we found in the interesting dictionary .
The context manager 's __call__ function gets overridden to allow you to pass in arguments for the function being decorated .
def accepts_block ( f ) : class BlockContextManager ( object ) : def __call__ ( self , * args , ** kwargs ) : self .
thefunction = functools .
partial(f , * args , ** kwargs ) return self def __enter__ ( self ) : # do Alex 's magic , just as above def __exit__ ( self ) : # make the interesting dictionary , just as above if len ( interesting ) == 1 : block = list ( interesting . itervalues ( ) ) [ 0 ] assert isinstance ( block , type ( lambda : None ) ) self . thefunction ( block ) return BlockContextManager ( )
It looks complicated and nested , but all it 's doing is saving the function and all its arguments , grabbing the definitions from the with block , making sure there 's only one definition and it's a function , then tacking it onto the end of the arguments list for the function and calling it .
Phew .
The code above handles the case where you do n't need to store the result of the function being decorated :
@accepts_block def each ( iterable , block ) : for i in iterable : block ( i )
But what if we want to store the result ?
Turns out , we can further abuse the with block by hijacking its as clause .
Because a variable defined in the as clause gets detected by Alex 's code , we can use the inspect module to change that variable so that after the with block it reflects the result of our computation .
First we check to see if we probably have a block and a variable in the as statement , then we reach in and store our result there if we are in that case :
def __exit__ ( self ) : #exactly as before ; frame = inspect.currentframe( 1 ) if len ( interesting ) == 1 : #exactly the same as before elif len ( interesting ) == 2 : block =
None savename =
None for n , v in interesting . iteritems ( ) : if isinstance ( v , type ( lambda : None ) ) : block = v else : savename = n assert savename and isinstance ( block , type ( lambda : None ) ) frame . f_locals [ savename ] = self . thefunction ( block )
Which lets us do this :
@accepts_block def bmap ( iterable , block ) : return map ( block , iterable ) with bmap ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) as result : def _ ( x ) : return x ** 2 print result # [ 1,4,9 ]
This time , we 're really taking a leap by assuming that if we find a callable and any other variable , that the variable is where we want to store our results .
This can lead to somewhat unexpected results :
with bmap ( [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) : not_a_result = 12 def _ ( x ) : return x ** 2 print not_a_result # [ 1,4,9 ] instead of 12
That 's my extremely long - winded description of how to abuse the with operator .
If you want to see the full function and the super - lame test code I wrote , you can head on over to github and check it out .
Aesthetics
It should be clear from all of the disclaimers I 've had to put into this article that this technique is of limited use in Python as it stands today .
I 'd like to make an argument that it suggests some nice syntactic sugar for python to support someday , while remaining totally ignorant of the actual difficulties of putting it into the language .
To do so , I 'll start by posting the motivating example for decorators from the relevant PEP .
It argues that this code :
def foo ( cls ) : pass foo = synchronized ( lock ) ( foo ) foo = classmethod ( foo )
is not nearly as readable as this code :
@classmethod @synchronized ( lock ) def foo ( cls ) : pass
The main problem with the readability of the first snippet is not that it requires 2 redefinitions and 4 repetitions of foo .
Rather , the main problem is that it places the cart before the horse by putting the function body ahead of the declarations that are required to understand it .
Similarly , when we define callback functions before we use them , we 're required to define the function body before the place where it will be actually used .
Often , we see :
def handle_click ( self ) : foo = self . flim ( ) if foo : self . flam ( foo ) on Click ( handle_click )
When it would be clearer to write :
with onClick ( ) : def _ ( self ) : foo = self . flim ( ) if foo : self . flam ( )
Which I find much more appealing .
Conclusion
I expect that there 's no way that syntax like this could be officially supported by Python , both because of syntactic constraints and the BDFL 's aesthetic concerns .
I do think it is a neat exercise in pushing the Python interpreter and syntax past where they want to go , and I hope that it gives some food for thought on an interesting Python syntax .
I 'm excited to see where Richard Jones goes with his project , and the design choices that he makes in it , since he 's pushing the boundaries of Python design .
Many thanks to him and Alex Martelli for sending me down quite an enjoyable path .
Finally , in case you missed it above , go ahead and take a look at the code on github .

Update :
Someone has taken this technique a bit farther , using some bytecode hackery .
( Bijoy Mohan )
Few countries have improved their economic prospects so dramatically as India has in the last twenty years .
Indeed , one would be hard - pressed to read a long - term forecast that did not view India as a large and growing force in the world economy .
With a population of over 1 billion ( as of 2008 ) , it might seem like it could hardly be any other way .
Nevertheless , the story was once very different in India .
A Brookings Institution report on January 13 states that India was , “ … essentially insulated ” from world markets as recently as 1990 .
Not only did , “ …ups and downs in the world economy matter little ” to India , but perhaps worse , “ … movements in the Indian economy were even less consequential for the world economy ” , as the proportion of world trade and investment India personally accounted for was negligible at best .
Difficult as it may be to believe today , foreign direct investment in India stood at a paltry $ 100 million in 1991 .
By 2006 - 2007 , FDI had increased to $ 19 billion .
Moreover , Business Standard reports that India boasted a 9 % per annum growth rate between 2004 - 2009 .
Despite being all but irrelevant to the world economy just two decades ago , India has clearly become a force to be reckoned with on the global stage .
Continuing our series on growing economies , we ’ll look more closely at India ’s economic landscape – the opportunities , government incentives to producers , fastest - growing industries , and what the future holds .
The Opportunities
The phrase “ economic opportunity ” is frequently used in economic discussions , but within India , it has always had a somewhat nebulous meaning .
For generations , the opportunities open to citizens were determined by a socially stratified “ caste ” system and one ’s place within it , which was itself determined by birth .
A University of California at Santa Barbara essay referred to the 3,000 year old caste system as a , “ … pernicious practice that discriminates against nearly a fourth of the country ’s billion - plus population . ”
Naturally , such a system was not conducive to widespread prosperity or entrepreneurship , and as a result , neither flourished until the caste system began to wither away .
Fortunately , as the BBC reports , “ … today , caste barriers have largely broken down in the large cities . ”
The result has been nothing short of transformative from an economic standpoint .
A USA Today article from 2004 interviews Sumant Anand , a native Indian returning home after a three year absence .
When asked about his friends , Anand remarked , “ … they were all talking about opportunities in India rather than how to find jobs in the USA . ”
In a stunning turnaround from just ten or fifteen years earlier , Anand reports that , “ … if you talk to people my age , nobody wants to leave India . ”
( Marco Bellucci )
Largely thanks to market reforms and caste system erosion , India has begun transitioning from low - paid outsourcing fodder into a sophisticated service economy .
The nation ’s , “ … world - class software developers are moving into high - margin consulting ” , striving ambitiously to , “ … take business from the likes of Accenture and IBM . ”
In fact , India ’s IT industry alone Outsourcing professionals have graduated from , “ … filling orders for infomercial ab crunchers to handling financial analysis for Wall Street firms . ”
And India ’s drug makers , previously held in contempt by the developed world for patent piracy , “ … are being wooed by the same global giants whose medicines they were copycatting . ”
In short , India has become a place where talented , intelligent and hard - working people can get ahead .
The Incentives and Top Performers
No small amount of India ’s longtime economic struggles owed to the government ’s perennially “ self - reliant ” policies .
As early as 1947 , when it became an independent country , India “ … set out to achieve what its leaders called swadeshi , or self - reliance ” , according to USA Today .
In practice , swadeshi amounted to , “ … walling out foreign investment and imports , and playing the role of obstructionist in global free - trade talks . ”
Unfortunately , in its quest to be self - reliant , India succeeded only in reducing itself to economic helplessness and virtual destitution .
Liberalization occurred at an , “ … agonizingly slow pace ” until 1991 , when soaring oil prices triggered a balance - of - payments crisis .
Since then , India has taken great strides to promote entrepreneurship , trade , production and risk - taking throughout the economy .
One major boost came in the form of lowered tariffs on imports , which were as high as 87% - 113 % as recently as the early 1990’s .
Today , import tariffs are generally lower than 20 % .
Another longtime obstacle to entrepreneurship were stifling foreign exchange controls , which limited when and how much profit foreign multinationals could take home from India .
After being shunned by multinationals for decades , the foreign exchange controls were relaxed , and in 2007 the BBC reported that multinationals were “ … leading India ’s IT revolution . ”
( DraconianRain )
Another incentive that has done much to spur business activity in India is the removal of arbitrary restrictions and barriers .
In 1988 , for instance , the BBC explains that the Indian government did not make it easy for Texas Instruments to do business there .
So involved with every minute detail was the government that , “ … the Indian Ministry of Communications refused to allow them to set up their own private satellite dish unless a government official was present in the control room of the company ’s satellite data transmission centre at all times . ”
Fortunately , “ … within a decade , all such barriers were swept aside ” , and the cost of data transmission subsequently , “ … plunged due to the creation of trans - oceanic fibre optical cable networks . ”
The 2009 Legatum Prosperity Index gives India favorable marks as well , observing the existence of , “ … only 11 formal business start up procedures . ”
USA Today notes , in agreement , “ … private business can now do virtually anything except operate a railroad , nuclear power plant or university . ”
As word of India ’s new found permissiveness to entrepreneurs spread , multinationals began doing business there in unprecedented numbers .
Today “ … more than 500 major international companies have IT operations in Bangalore alone . ”
As mentioned , India ’s $ 28 billion IT industry is an economic juggernaut and easily its most robust sector .
Additionally , however , the country boasts the world ’s fastest - growing telecom market , with some estimates clocking new subscriber signups at 1.6 million per month .
NextBillion reported that 2008 was , “ … a watershed when India ’s subscriber base topped 350 million users to make its network the second largest in the world after China , displacing the US . ”
( NextBillion also explains how the telecom industry has benefited tremendously from the lower tariffs discussed earlier . )
India is also the global leader in business process outsourcing , exporting $ 25 billion worth of such services per year as of 2007 and expected to rise to $ 60 billion by 2010 , according to BBC .
What The Future Holds
While businesses like Hewlett - Packard , Dell , IBM , and Accenture coming in India is certainly encouraging , perhaps more encouraging than any isolated event is the overall , ongoing trend of liberalization in India ’s economy .
In 1991 , trade in goods and services as a proportion of India ’s GDP stood at a meager 16 % .
By 2007 , that number had shot up to 49 % , according to the Brookings Institution .
The country also , “ … grew 13 % per annum in real dollars during the four year period spanning 2003 - 04 to 2006 - 07 . ”
Brookings notes that , “ … if this rate is maintained and the US economy grows at 3 % per annum ” , India will grow to “ two fifths of the US economy in just two decades . ”
Nor , it should be noted , are US companies only making “ token ” investments in India .
In 2007 , networking giant Cisco Systems “ announced a $ 1.1 billion investment in Bangalore , creating 6,000 jobs ” in one fell swoop .
Chief Globalization Officer Wim Elfrink weighed in on the deal by declaring “ we believe that India is the hub for the world where the ICT sector is concerned . ”
Taking the improvements and deregulation of the last twenty years into account , it seems that India is on the road to joining the world ’s major economies in less time than anyone thought possible .

Lammergeiers are not endangered , but rare in India
About 200 Bearded Vultures have been spotted in a remote part of India 's Himachal Pradesh state , reports say .
State chief conservator of forests Vinay Tandon said the reported sighting was being checked by wildlife officials and would be " hugely significant " .
Lammergeiers have been seen on India 's border with China , but not in such a large group or at so high an altitude .
There has been growing concern in India over the fast dwindling population of vultures in recent years .
Experts estimate there are only a few hundred vultures left in India .
' Pleased '
Mr Tandon said four out of the five major vulture species in India are critically endangered .
We are especially pleased ... in recent years the vulture population of India has been disappearing so rapidly
Vinay Tandon ,
Himachal Pradesh state " We had reports on Monday that what appears to be a very large colony of Bearded Vultures - or Lammergeiers - were spotted close to the border with China in what is known as the trans - Himalayan region , " he told the BBC .
" As yet we are not able to confirm that the birds belong to this species .
A team from the state 's wildlife department will be making its way to the area as soon as possible .
" We are especially pleased to hear of such a large colony when in recent years the vulture population of India has been disappearing so rapidly . "
Mr Tandon said that the vultures had been spotted in Lahaul - Spiti , one of the remotest districts of Himachal Pradesh .
Lammergeiers are long - winged vultures known for their unusual habit of dropping bones on to rocks to smash them open and get at the marrow .
Their world population is estimated at between 2,000 - 10,000 individuals .
Cattle link South Asia 's vulture population has been virtually wiped out in recent years .
India 's vulture population is in serious decline Experts believe vultures have been badly affected by the use of the painkiller diclofenac in cattle .
Vultures feeding on the cattle lose their ability to reproduce .
While Bearded Vultures are not thought to have been so badly affected by the drug , their numbers have nevertheless significantly dwindled in India .
In August conservationists announced that the endangered Slender Billed vulture had twice been successfully bred in the states of Haryana and West Bengal .
Conservationists say that despite the recent sightings , urgent action is still needed to save vultures from extinction in the wild .
" With extinction in the wild likely in the next 10 years , we do not have a moment to waste .
The more vultures that we can bring into captivity means a better chance of survival for these rapidly declining species , " Birdlife International spokesman Chris Bowden said .

If the jobless rate continues to climb , as is widely expected , that could generate pressure for another stimulus spending package .
But given intensifying concern about the size of federal budget deficits  now projected to exceed $ 9 trillion within a decade  any new spending could be politically perilous .
The latest snapshot of the nation ’s labor situation testified to the drastic improvement since early this year , when nearly 700,000 jobs a month were disappearing .
Yet it also underscored the continued bleakness of the economic landscape .
“ It ’s a good picture compared to where we were , which was just a free fall , ” said Dean Baker , a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington .
“ But compared to anything else , this is just a horrible report .
The rate of decline is slowing , but it ’s not going to stop .
We ’re likely on a path toward more than 10 percent unemployment . ”

Most economists see recent improvements as the result of pulling away from the disaster of last fall  when the investment giant Lehman Brothers collapsed , spreading fear throughout the financial system  and not a sign of vigorous growth ahead .
After years of borrowing against soaring home values , tapping credit cards and harvesting stock market winnings to spend in excess of their incomes , millions of households are being forced to conserve .
That limits consumer spending , which makes up 70 percent of the nation ’s economy .
And that makes businesses that might otherwise hire and expand more inclined to hunker down .
“ Household balance sheets are shot , ” Mr. Ruskin said .
From here , spending “ has to come from income , and income has to come from employment , and at this juncture it looks like employment will only improve very slowly . ”
Day Two of the World Atlas Of Bad Driving turns to Asia , where the attitude towards traffic is , well , different .

And by different , we mean rather fatalistic .
When we conceived Crash Week , we wanted to be relatively tasteful in our crash coverage , even when showing accidents .
Unfortunately , between the number of pedestrians , bicyclists , scooters , motorcycles , donkeys ( honestly ) , and heaven knows what on Asian roads - plus the cavalier attitude of Asian TV channels towards showing blood - choosing footage was a harrowing task .
Here 's what we managed to pluck from the carnage .
Click Next for the first exhibit .
NATION OF ORIGIN : China
NATURE OF INCIDENT : Apparently having your lights on in the fog is not an international phenomenon , so it 's a good thing these vehicles were n't traveling at normal highway speeds ..
This is an remarkably close - up view of a multi-car pile - up .
NATION OF ORIGIN : China
NATURE OF INCIDENT :
Oh , those crazy Asian intersections where signals are ignored in favor of some sort of traffic etiquette , if signals are present in the first place .
Frankly , we 're glad this went out of the frame .
NATION OF ORIGIN : Singapore
NATURE OF INCIDENT : Cue a flinchworthy montage .
What 's traffic like in a tiny , dense country so legally rigid that chewing gum is against the law ?
Chaos , apparently .
Strict laws do n't mean people are paying strict attention .
NATION OF ORIGIN : Japan
NATURE OF INCIDENT : Japan seems to be more willing than most Asian nations to share its traffic camera footage , This is from a local newscast , the topic of which seems to be safety , and the traffic cam in question seems to be on a rather wide hallway rather than a road .
NATION OF ORIGIN : Australia
NATURE OF INCIDENT : Right , Australia is not in Asia , but calling this the Australasian section seemed silly , and this does n't fit anywhere else ; Australia deserves its own section but we just do n't have room .
So here 's a segment from Aussie TV , filmed as part of a special report on accidents , in which the crew was lucky enough to have a semitruck PIT - turn a Mercedes right when they were filming .
NATION OF ORIGIN : Japan
NATURE OF INCIDENT :
As noted , there were plenty of clips we could n't show you because of the graphic bicycle / scooter / motorcycle involvement .
This one we can !
It 's a reenactment done by the Tokyo police to demonstrate the necessity of caution to bicyclists .
Their bike safety officers seem somewhat more hardcore than our own .
NATION OF ORIGIN : India
NATURE OF INCIDENT :
This is two minutes of small miracles - maybe not so small , if you 've been looking at Asian crash footage for days .
It 's merely normal truck , car , bike , and jitney - cab traffic at an Indian intersection , which is sort of like saying " merely two minutes of the Blue Angels , Thunderbirds , and Red Arrows all flying together . "
Watch for the shocking surprise ending .
Bruschetta is a lovely way to use up leftovers .
Consisting of sliced bread rubbed with garlic and brushed with olive oil then topped with any number of toppings and grilled or toasted , bruschetta is usually served as an appetizer or snack , but I think it can make a nice light lunch , especially if served beside a crisp green salad .
A perfect way to use up day old bread , bruschetta is an already frugal dish ; but when you use leftovers as toppings , it is doubly frugal .
What sort of leftovers do I have in mind ?
Well , I had made a batch of Melanzane con Noci–a Sicilian pasta sauce made with roasted eggplant , garlic and toasted walnuts which is traditionally served over spaghetti–but had more sauce than two people could eat .
While I could have simply frozen the leftover sauce , I wanted to figure out another way to use this delectable puree .
In putting together the bruschetta , which I made for Brittney and I for lunch , I decided to forgo rubbing the bread with garlic as the sauce is already quite sufficiently imbued with garlic ; instead , I simply brushed 1/ 2 inch thick slices of multi-grain baguette ( cut on the diagonal ) on both sides with extra -virgin olive oil .
Then , I spread about a tablespoon and a half of the cold pasta sauce on top of the bread .
This was topped with a sprinkling of fresh basil leaves cut in a chiffonade , then on top of that , thinly sliced tomatoes and a generous , heaping teaspoon of freshly shredded Parmesan cheese .
Then all that is left to do was to place the slices on a tray and pop them under the broiler for a few minutes–until Parmesan is bubbly and melted and the bread is toasted and crisped .
That is all there is to it–and frankly , as much as I love Melanzane con Noci as a pasta sauce –I liked it even better as a bruschetta topping .
The rich sauce –a thick puree , garlicky and filled with the flavor of roasted eggplant and nuggets of toasted walnuts–tasted amazing on the crisped bread , and combined with the fragrant basil , tangy fresh tomatoes and salty cheese–it was a delicious contrast of flavors and textures .
And I can not imagine anyone not liking it–even folks who swear they dislike eggplant .
It is also the sort of vegetarian dish that could convert the most ardent of meat - eaters !
Which made me think that there must be plenty of other pasta sauces that could be used to top bruschetta .
Have any of you used your leftover pasta sauces in such a way ?
Or have you done something else with them ?

BILLING CODE 4710 -10 - P
— A Raleigh plastic surgeon was suspended from his job at WakeMed Sunday after being charged with driving while impaired in a wreck that killed a ballerina last week .
Raleigh police said that Raymond Dwight Cook , 42 , of 10516 Beckridge Lane , was driving a Mercedes 90 mph in a 45 mph zone Friday when he crashed into the back of a Hyundai driven by Elena Bright Shapiro , 20 , at Lead Mine and Strickland roads .
Paramedics took Shapiro to WakeMed , where she died .
Cook was also treated at WakeMed for minor injuries .
He was charged with death by motor vehicle , driving while impaired , failure to reduce speed and careless and reckless driving , authorities said .
He was released from jail after posting a $ 50,000 secured bond .
Cook is employed by UNC Hospitals and is contracted to practice with WakeMed , the hospital said .
“ The entire WakeMed family would like to pass along their condolences to the family of Elena Shapiro , " WakeMed spokeswoman Heather Monackey said .
" We are saddened that this tragic event has taken such a young and beautiful life .
Dr. Cook has been suspended for the time being to allow for further investigation in the case . "
' A true tragedy '
Shapiro , of Winston - Salem , was training with the Carolina Ballet , based in Raleigh , and had been dancing since she was 10 , according to the group 's Web site .
" She was a very young dancer .
She had her whole life ahead of her .
She had all the equipment to be a great dancer , " said Robert Weiss , Carolina Ballet 's artistic director .
" We do n't know what she would have done .
That 's the tragedy , that she never had a chance to find out what she could achieve . "
The dancers still plan to perform Swan Lake this Thursday to open the season .
" In her memory , we 're going to give these performances that she was going to be a part of , " Weiss said .
" It 's a true tragedy , and there 's no way to make it better , but what we do in our profession is we bring joy to a lot of people ... and we 're going to go ahead and try to still do that . "
Shapiro 's funeral services will be held at noon Tuesday in Wait Chapel at Wake Forest University .

Ants Have the Longest Lifespan of Any Insect
The first of our interesting ant facts tells us a little about how long they can live .
While it is true that some species can live for up to 15 years , there is one particular ant that was recorded as living for 30 years !
This was a queen ant , and she lived in her natural habitat in Idaho for the entire span of her life .
The queen ant , much like the queen bee , is the founder of the colony .
Once she has been fertilised she can lay millions of eggs over time .
One Ant Species
Is the Most Venomous Insect in the World We know that ants can nip and bite , and we know how nasty that can be .
However , there is one species of ant that is not only the most venomous amongst its own kind , but also the most venomous insect in the world .
The Maricopa harvester ant has the capability to sting as harshly as 12 honey bees !
The most painful insect sting from an ant comes from the bullet ant .

The Ant Is One of the World ’s Strongest Creatures in Relation to Its Size
The next in our series of fascinating ant facts tells us just how strong they can be .
It is estimated that ants can carry up to 50 times their own body weight .
They are often seen working together to try and move heavy objects from place to place .
They can also move as much as 50 tons of soil from one location to another over the course of one year .
Some ecologists believe that this makes them more important than earthworms in this regard .
Ants Have 2 Stomachs !
When ants have been observed in the wild , it may sometimes appear that they are kissing each other .
Whilst this is a sweet notion , it is n’t actually true !
They are actually feeding each other from one of their 2 stomachs .
They have 1 stomach which they use to feed themselves , and another which they use to nurture others .
The process of ants feeding each other from their second stomach is called trophallaxis and it means that groups of ants can split into 2 , with one half staying in the nest and the other going out to forage for food .
Ants Make Other Ants Slaves
Ants from one species are likely to make ants from other species their slaves , taking them into their colonies and making them carry out work for them .
One species , the honeypot ant will enslave its own kind to work for it – and sometimes make ants from other foreign colonies do their bidding .
Ants Lived with Dinosaurs
This next in our ant facts series shows us exactly how long they have been roaming the Earth !
They evolved some 130 million years ago , and fossilised remains of insects dating back to 92 million years ago have been found in resin and amber .
The oldest known ant species is called sphercomyrma freyi and was found in Clifford Beach , New Jersey .
Ants Are Famous Cartoon Stars !
In 1998 , ants got their own animated movie called Antz , which was set in an ant colony in Central Park , New York .
It ’s famous for being the first CGI film to be made by DreamWorks , and also for being only the second feature length computer animated film .
It features a cast of ants that were created to look , in some ways , like the famous people that voiced them , such as Sylvester Stallone and Woody Allen .
Ants Defend Plant life in Exchange for Shelter Special types of plants called Myrmecophytes have secret hollows or places in which ants can burrow for safety and shelter .
These places might look like thorns or hollow stems .
The ants , in return for this shelter , will protect the plant from intruders , from infestation and from being eaten by other insects or animals .

Ants Are a Delicacy in Some Parts of the World
This next of our ant facts might be a bit gross for some – but ants and ant pupae ( their eggs ) are considered a delicacy in some parts of the world .
In places such as India , the pupae of ants can sell for as much as $ 40 per pound .
In the Far East , green weaver ants are used to season curries .
It is generally accepted that ants have a peppery flavour to them .
Native Australians mash up ants and mix them with water to make a drink that is not dissimilar in taste to lemon squash .
Ants Were Farmers Before Humans
This is a really interesting one of our ant facts .
Ants began farming , growing and harvesting their own crops tens of millions of years before humans thought to do it .
They even learned how to fertilise their own crops and how to stop pests and mould attacking them .
The earliest evidence suggests they started doing this some 70 million years ago !
Worker Ants Can Travel 700 feet from Their Nests
When worker ants need to forage for food , they can actually travel up to 700 feet away on their own without any difficulty .
They will always be able to find their way back to their nest by following the scent trails left behind by other ants from their colony .
Astonishing !
There Are 1 Million Ants for Every Human
This next in our ant facts series gives us a little insight into just how many ants there are in the world .
In total , it is thought that they make up 25 % of the biomass of all land animals .
To put that into context , that equates to the same biomass as the entire human race – and there are 1 million ants on Earth for every human being .
At any given time on Earth , there are between 1 and 10 quadrillion ( 10,000,000,000,000,000 ) ants .
Soldier Ants Use Their Heads to Stop Intruders in Their Nests Soldier ants have slightly differently shaped heads to other ants .
Often , they will be shaped to fit the entrance to the nest .
If the nest is under threat , the soldier ant will block the entrance by poking its head into it , like a cork in a bottle .
When a worker ant from the colony needs to get back in , it will touch the head of the soldier ant to let it know it is “ one of them ” .
Ants Can Survive Underwater for 24 Hours
Ants do n’t have lungs , or a normal respiratory system as such .
Instead , they have a system of holes in their bodies which they breathe through , and which are called spiracles .
Sometimes , in cases where ants appear to have drowned in water , they ’ve miraculously come back to life – though they were never really dead in the first place .
If they fall into water , and enough of it evaporates over time , they can start to absorb oxygen through their spiracles and revive .
They can survive like this for up to 24 hours .

Wow !
The Largest Ant Colony Ever Found Was 3,750 Miles Wide
The last of our ant facts tells us about the large numbers of one particular species found across the world .
The largest colony ever discovered was spread across Europe , Japan and the USA .
Originally thought to be 3 separate super - colonies , it was found that the ants in each area were actually related .
The ants all belonged to one species , the Argentine ant , and the colony grew so large as the ants within it refused to “ fight ” each other for survival .
This particular ant is known for destroying large amounts of crops and native animals in the countries they colonise .
The part of the colony located in Europe stretches some 3,750 miles !
Despite President Obama ’s prediction that it would create new jobs , the climate change bill passed by the House will mean fewer jobs by 2030 than if Congress did nothing at all , according to the first comprehensive study of the measure by the federal government .
The report by the Energy Department ’s Energy Information Administration said the bill would lead to small increases in electricity costs for consumers — what Democrats said was an affordable sacrifice for the environmental benefits of lowering greenhouse gas emissions .
“ We can move to a clean energy future at a cost of less than a postage stamp per family per day , ” Energy Secretary Steven Chu said .
The report said the average cost to a household by 2020 would be $ 114 , though those costs would more than double to $ 288 by 2030 as the rules on polluters tighten .
The Democrat - controlled House narrowly passed its climate change bill on a 219 - 212 vote June 26 .
A week later , Mr. Obama told chief executives that the legislation “ holds the promise of millions of new jobs — jobs , by the way , that ca n’t be outsourced . ”
Mr. Chu repeated the assertion Tuesday .
But a chart in the EIA report showed the employment rate — just like the economy as a whole — worsening for the first several years , improving slightly in the midterm , peaking in 2024 and then declining steadily .
It showed 0.25 percent fewer jobs in 2030 under the Democrats ’ bill , with the manufacturing sector suffering a 2.5 percent lag .
For the economy as a whole , immediate energy price spikes would be followed by relative calm as the economy adjusted .
But when stricter rules go into effect in 2025 “ the rapid increase in energy prices causes the economy to contract , ” EIA said .
The House bill imposes a limit on overall U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and tightens that cap over time , requiring polluters to either reduce their emissions or offset their pollutants by paying others to reduce their emissions .
The system is known as “ cap - and - trade . ”
The Senate is still drafting its version of the climate bill .
Mr. Obama has called for Congress to pass a bill that would reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions , and last month he and leaders of other major world economies committed to achieving specific goals .
But developing economies such as Brazil , India and China have balked at an agreement , arguing that they should n’t be shackled .
The nations will try to forge an agreement at a December meeting in Copenhagen .
The EIA report , requested by the two Democrats who wrote the House bill , is the first comprehensive look at the measure ’s effects on the economy .
EIA is an independent statistical agency of the Energy Department that provides policy - neutral data and analyses and does not advocate or formulate any policy conclusions .
The analysis said that the Democrats ’ decision to give away credits for emissions , rather than auction them as Mr. Obama proposed , would protect vulnerable industries .
“ The Energy Information Agency estimates that the American Clean Energy and Security Act approved by the House will dramatically reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil , increase clean renewable electricity generation in America by 28 percent , while also keeping electricity costs affordable for all Americans , ” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat .
The report said renewable electricity and nuclear power would have to increase and oil consumption would be reduced to meet the bill ’s goals , but it did not say less foreign oil would be used .
Republican energy lobbyist Michael McKenna said it ’s as likely the bill would increase dependence on unreliable sources .
The report is “ completely silent on the bill ’s effect on how much we import , and it ’s silent for good reason , ” Mr. McKenna said .
“ The legislation will either A , have no effect , or B , increase our dependence on places like Saudi Arabia whose crude has relatively lower carbon content than places like Canada , whose crude has a relatively higher carbon content . ”
The study also did not say how effective the bill would be in reducing global temperatures — another primary goal of Democrats .
EIA analysts said there is a lot of uncertainty about how the program would play out , and looked at six scenarios for how quickly technological advances might bring reductions in greenhouse gas levels , and how easily U.S. companies would be able to pay those overseas to offset U.S. emissions .
According to the worst - case scenario , if technology does n’t materialize and other countries refuse to cooperate on offsets , consumer prices could be 14 percent higher in 2030 than they would otherwise be without the climate change bill .

A Central Intelligence Agency officer who allegedly threatened a detainee with a gun during an interrogation in 2002 has been officially " reprimanded and reassigned " for using tactics outside the agency 's legal guidelines .
The punishment is part of the early fallout as the CIA prepares to release a long - secret internal report Monday detailing the use of a mock execution and threatening detainees with power drills and guns during interrogation .
Originally written in 2004 , but only shown to select US government officials and upper - level CIA officials , the report will be released on Monday following a federal judge 's decision to uphold an appeal by the American Civil Liberties Union , reports The New York Times .
Some of the most graphic methods described in the report were used on Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , who allegedly planned the 2000 USS Cole bombing .
According to the report , CIA officials fired a gun in an adjacent interrogation room to make Mr. al - Nashiri think another prisoner had been executed .
In addition to waterboarding him , interrogators also turned a power drill on and off next to his head , reports Newsweek , which first broke the story .
A federal law prohibits authorities from threatening prisoners with " imminent death . "
These recent developments of potential CIA misconduct during interrogations come as the agency is already facing increasing scrutiny .
US attorney general , Eric Holder , is currently reviewing the legality of CIA interrogation methods , reports the Guardian .
The report is understood to be the most detailed review of the agency 's interrogation program and is believed to be highly critical of the techniques used , suggesting that a number of them broke international laws and norms .
The document has become deeply controversial within the CIA itself , not least because the agency was advised two months before Nashiri 's capture in a memo from Jay Bybee , the head of the justice department 's office of legal counsel , that threats of " imminent death " were legal if they did not cause permanent mental harm .
Taking legal action against those involved in questionable interrogation procedures may be difficult , reports The Washington Post .
Although Justice Department lawyers reviewed the case , they declined to press charges .
A. John Radsan , a former assistant general counsel at the CIA , told The Post that cases like this present unique challenges .
" The victims are not sympathetic .
Witnesses may not talk .
Evidence may be gone , " Radsan said .
" If anyone is indicted , there will be the usual graymail .
The defendant is going to push [ Justice ] to reveal things about the program that will even make this administration uncomfortable .
The defendant will say whatever he did was reasonable reliance on advice from government lawyers . "
The incidents described in the report are among the most extreme examples of " enhanced interrogation " techniques used by CIA interrogators .
While waterboarding and sleep deprivation were approved in legal memos from the Justice Department , other methods , such as using a power drill appear to have been improvised methods not specifically mentioned by the Justice Department .
One former US official described some of these practices to The Los Angeles Times as being done " almost in juvenile detective mode . "

Overvalued , irksome , conceited , pudge - faced , balding , boring , awful celebrity art nob Damien Hirst has apparently become embroiled in a ludicrous feud with a 19 - year - old graffiti artist called Cartrain .
Hostilities erupted in 2008 , when Cartrain created a sarcastic collage that included an image of Hirst 's stupid bling - encrusted skull " artwork " ( the one that reportedly sold for £ 50 m at auction , although that figure is disputed by virtually anyone who still retains some degree of faith in humankind ) .
When Cartrain 's humorous collages were put up for sale online , Hirst reportedly complained to the Design and Artists Copyright Society .
The website selling Cartrain 's works buckled under legal pressure and surrendered the collages , along with an apology .
Witless appropriation
Obviously , this involved some chutzpah on Hirst 's part , when you consider how much of his own output involves the witless appropriation of pre-existing material .
When he is n't wowing his hateful audience of inconsequential moneyed idiots with meaningless collections of dots or bisected animal corpses , he 's producing a whopping great reproduction of Humbrol 's £ 14.99 Young Scientist Anatomy Set and selling it to Charles Saatchi for £ 1 m – which would be an absolutely hilarious scam on a richly deserving target ( a pretentious former ad exec who made his fortune heartlessly flogging cigarettes and Thatcherism to the masses ) if the money went to a deserving cause rather than a nauseating irritant .
Anyway , so far , so 2008 .
But the Hirst - Cartrain battle resumed in July this year , when the latter strolled into Tate Britain and allegedly removed a box of pencils from Hirst 's art installation " Pharmacy " .
Cartrain then created a mock ransom note , demanding the return of his collages in exchange for the pencils .
If the artworks were n't given back , then the pencils would be " sharpened " .
All rather daft and annoying .
But a few weeks ago , Cartrain was arrested by Scotland Yard 's art and antiques squad and told that the pencils had been valued at £ 500,000 .
The officers also initially arrested Cartrain 's father , on the grounds that he was " suspected of harbouring the pencils " .
The arrest may not be Hirst 's fault , but sod it : let 's appropriate any resultant outrage and apply it to him anyway .
Cartrain 's almost certainly a self - promoting gump and a poor man 's Banksy – but he 's 19 , for heaven 's sake .
He 's allowed to be an almost impossible arse .
Besides , unless it turns out to have been one huge , hilarious in - jokey art world wheeze involving the pair of them , it was Hirst who started it , mum .
It was his behaviour in the first instance – throwing a legal fit over Cartrain 's collages – that caused the current mess .
It was an absurd tantrum over intellectual property rights , the big guy versus the little guy – just like Lord Mandelson 's stupid proposal to have people who illegally download music kicked off the internet ; a scheme that 's outraged Billy Bragg , the drummer from Blur , thingy from Radiohead and one of Pink Floyd so much that they posed for a photograph and issued a press release and everything .
And they were right to do so .
Apart from the occasional hardcore miser , the kind who'd shoplift at Oxfam , the vast majority of people who illegally download music from the internet do so because they bloody love music .
They 're resorting to theft because they 're either too skint to afford 79 p per track ( often because they 're students ) , or because what they 're looking for is too obscure to find by commercial means , or because it 's been leaked and is n't officially available and they 're just too damn excited to wait .
In the main , these are dedicated fans : precisely the same audience who in days of yore would 've filled C90 cassettes with songs taped off the radio .
In its heyday , the Radio 1 Sunday evening Top 40 countdown constituted the biggest file - sharing portal in British history , with millions of users hooked up simultaneously , mercilessly downloading content to their tape decks .
The government and the music industry should cheerfully view these people as eager young addicts .
Let them have their illicit free samples because once they 're hooked , they 'll cough up later : when they 've got more money , when the tracks are easier to find via legitimate means , or when they go to see an act they only discovered via free illegal downloads play live ( and pay £ 30 for a ticket , £ 30 for drinks , and £ 30 for a poster and T - shirt ) .
But no .
They 're going to identify and isolate these fans and try to ban them from the internet .
Christ knows how that 's going to work .
Perhaps they 'll employ a uniformed enforcer to run in and physically knock the mouse out of your hand every 10 minutes .
Maybe an email arrives , curtly informing you you 've been fired from Google .
Now clear your cache and get out .
I guess the powers that be could pressurise local service providers , but if they start cutting off broadband connections willy - nilly , neighbourhood Wi - Fi " theft " will skyrocket .
And how do you stop people using iPhones and other mobile internet devices ?
Smash their fingers with rocks ?
Position snipers on rooftops ?
As in the tale of Hirst and Cartrain , it 's the big guy who comes off looking small .
Instead of figuring out new and imaginative ways to fleece consumers , the industry is throwing a tantrum .
Trying to fight human nature and progress is an undertaking as doomed as repeatedly kicking a river in the hope it'll change course , and as mean as arresting a 19 - year - old chancer for swiping a tosspot 's pencils .
This project represents a conceptual direction that merges an idea from the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the technologies of today to create a new , open - ended platform for musical composition , improvisation and performance .
" Orchestrionics " is the term that I am using to describe a method of developing ensemble - oriented music using acoustic and acoustoelectric musical instruments that are mechanically controlled in a variety of ways , using solenoids and pneumatics .
With a guitar , pen or keyboard I am able to create a detailed compositional environment or a spontaneously developed improvisation , with the pieces on this particular recording leaning toward the compositional side of the spectrum .
On top of these layers of acoustic sound , I add my conventional electric guitar playing as an improvised component .
At least for me , this takes the term " solo record " into some new and interesting areas , somewhat recontextualizing the idea of what constitutes a solo performance by a single musician .
This project is the result of a lifelong dream in this area that dates back to my early youth .
PLAYER PIANO
As a little kid , every few summers we would go visit my grandparents in Manitowoc , Wisconsin - my mom 's hometown .
My grandfather ( Delmar Bjorn Hansen ) was a great musician , a brilliant trumpet player and singer whose love of harmony was a strong early influence .
Upon arrival at their family house , I would make a beeline to the basement , where one of the family 's most prized possessions was kept : a then - 50 - plus - year - old player piano , complete with boxes of piano rolls of all kinds of music .
I would spend hours there with my cousins trying each roll , pumping until we were worn out by the pedals .
The idea of an instrument like this , capable of playing just about anything mechanically , was totally mind - blowing to me .
It was something utterly charming ; on one hand it was old - fashioned but , at the same time , almost like science fiction .
Throughout the years , that early fascination has grown and I have studied the tradition of these kinds of instruments , including the orchestrions of the early 20th century that took this idea further .
Using various other orchestral instruments mechanically tethered to the piano / piano roll mechanism to develop ensemble sounds , a miniature orchestra was possible .
But considering the repertoire that was usually called upon when these instruments were played ( Conlon Nancarrow and George Antheil 's work were sadly and largely absent from the world in which I grew up , or at least from my grandfather 's basement ) , I would often find myself asking over the years , " What might happen if the potentials of these instruments were looked at now - particularly informed by the harmonic and melodic advances in jazz of the past 70 or 80 years ?
Could I make some kind of personal statement using instruments like these ? "
SOME BACKGROUND
In the late 1800s and early 1900s , with the emergence of player pianos ( pianos played mechanically by moving rolls of paper through a mechanism that physically moved the keys ) , the next logical step was to apply that same principle to a range of orchestral instruments , often including percussion and mallet instruments .
These large instrument arrays were called orchestrions .
Orchestrions flourished in the era that directly proceeded the advent of sound recordings .
In many ways , that period of time stands as an interesting middle zone ; the first technology that brought a performer to an audience once removed , while retaining the essential characteristics of that performer 's message .
THE ORCHESTRION PROJECT
In 1978 , I made a record called New Chautauqua , which was a session built upon the idea of using the studio itself as an instrument by layering several guitars on top of each other to create an ensemble sound .
The only problem was that it was impractical to do this live .
It has since become possible using live looping technology ( sampling ) to create a viable platform for a limited version of what one can do in a studio in real time , but for the kinds of shifting harmonic environments that i love , there are restrictions in that method .
Over the years I have dreamed of coming up with an environment to write that uses the " front end " of modern music technology while harnessing the power of actual acoustic instruments .
MUSIC
One of the by - products of being a musician who grew up in the late 20th century who also happens to be a guitar player is that I have quite naturally lived a parallel life of deep immersion in the world of music technology .
( I often joke that my first musical act with an electric guitar was to " plug it in " - knobs and wires being the same to me as mouthpieces , bows , reeds and drumsticks are to other musicians . )
Alongside the information revolution that has affected all of our lives over the past 40 years , we have also lived through a revolution in the way music can be made that is almost overwhelming .
Yet , at the same time , as enthusiastic as I have been about the orchestral potential of synths and electric instruments in general , and even as those instruments have improved enormously and continue to develop , the whole idea of jamming a mix of polyphonic sounds into a single set of stereo speakers has never been as satisfying to me as a single instrument going into a single discrete amplification system ( electric guitar ) or especially , the power of acoustic instruments and sound .
I have never seen any of these sound components - electric or acoustic in nature - as being mutually exclusive .
In fact , the exciting thing for me has been the combinations possible using available sounds and dynamic levels of all kinds - from the quietest of the quiet , to the loudest of the loud .
The New Orchestrion
For a number of years leading to this project , I have been gathering the forces of a group of talented inventors and technicians from around the country , and commissioning them to construct a large palette of acoustic sound - producing devices that I can organize as a new kind of orchestrion .
A small number of musicians have been doing things like this in recent years as the mechanics of it all has evolved , particularly with the advent of modern solenoid technology .
And naturally , in many ways , much of the experimentation and research in this area has been as much about the technology as the musical result .
My only goal here , however , is a musical one .
This general area of interest has felt like fertile , relatively unexplored territory .
And especially now , nearly ten years into the new century , it has felt like the ideal moment to create something particularly connected to the reality of this unique period in time , using the best of the past with the potential of the future .
The issue of context is crucial to this project .
As much as I have and will continue to enjoy playing in traditional formats ( solo , duets , trios , quartets and quintets , various large ensembles , the Pat Metheny Group - however one might place that in this spectrum - as an occasional sideman , etc. ) , the urge to investigate what might be possible in this secluded corner of musical instrument lore has been building in me .
And it has proven to be a particularly inspiring zone of research that has led me to some new places .
I do n't see this as being something better or worse than any of the other formats that I enjoy playing in - but it is definitely something different .
One of the inspiring hallmarks of the jazz tradition through the decades has been the way that the form has willfully ushered in fresh musical contexts , resulting in new performance environments for players and composers .
This pursuit of change , and the way that various restless souls along the way have bridged the roots of the form with the new possibilities of their own time , has been a major defining element for me in the music 's evolution at every key point along the way .
From new combinations of sounds and new performance techniques to technological shifts in the instruments first deployed in jazz settings ( the drum set , the use of the saxophone , the modification and adaptation of European classical instruments , the electric guitar , etc. ) to large - ensemble presentation and composition ( big bands , etc. ) , jazz musicians have often been the ones trying new things , looking for new sounds .
This quest , in tandem with the generation of deep and soulful content , has made the story of jazz a fascinating journey .
As has been the case several times along the way for me , I found myself craving context that connected to this larger tradition , while longing for a way to reconcile those impulses with the opportunities intrinsic to this particular moment in time - to find something that could only be happening now , in 2010 .
Ray Kurzweil , one of the most visionary thinkers in the world , was asked recently about his work in the area of artificial intelligence , and I thought his response to a question that was essentially something to the effect of " Why do you do this ? " was right on .
His response was to indicate the important ways throughout history that new tools have allowed us to " extend our reach . "
In my life as a player there has never been a substitute for musical depth , informed by the experiences of a lifetime and with the quest to invoke the spirit and soul that is core to being the kind of musician that I have aspired to become .
I often say that whether it is developed and performed acoustically or otherwise , with a ten - dollar instrument or sophisticated computer system , good notes are good notes - and are almost always elusive in whatever path one might take to find them .
Yet good notes , once revealed , seem to carry their own intrinsic value with them forward , however they came to be .
While in pursuit , many times along the way the experience of a new challenge or the search for a new way of looking at things - or a new tool - has allowed me ( encouraged me ?
forced me ? ) to uncover and ask hard questions of myself as a musician .
As the instruments started to trickle in from the various inventors , the experience of writing for them and figuring out what might be possible with them provided a self - imposed challenge that proved to be difficult and time - consuming , but absolutely exhilarating .
I am excited to share this project .
If nothing else , this has turned out to be something unique .
And in the process of developing all this music and these instruments and discovering what they can do and what they are good at , I learned so much .
It feels like progress and has gotten some notes out of me that I did n't know were there .
But the surprise was just how far I was able to go with it all .
Within this new environment , I found something in there that took me to some new places .
I hope you too will enjoy it .

A PREVIOUSLY unknown virus that killed four of the five people it struck in an outbreak in South Africa last year has been identified as part of a family of viruses humans can catch from rats .
The virus , named Lujo , is an arenavirus that over nine days caused rash , fever , muscle pain , diarrhoea , severe bleeding , vomiting , organ failure and death , said Nivesh Sewlall , who treated the first patient at Johannesburg 's Morningside MediClinic Hospital .
He reported the findings at an infectious disease conference in San Francisco yesterday .
Lujo appears more dangerous than other arenaviruses and related hemorrhagic fever syndromes , with the exception of Ebola and Marburg , which have similar fatality rates of about 80 per cent .
Outbreaks of illness from these viruses have been sporadic and not widespread , but the World Health Organisation has said population growth into remote areas and urbanisation have led to new diseases emerging more quickly in recent years .
'' It was n't the outer jungle , this was suburban Lusaka , '' said Dr Sewlall , a pulmonary and critical care physician at Morningside .
'' There are parts of Central Park that are more rural , '' he said , referring to the park in New York .
Scientists do not know where the pathogen came from , although humans usually catch other arenaviruses such as Lassa fever by inhaling dust contaminated with rodent droppings , according to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta .
The Santa Maria Novella Pharmacy is probably the oldest still - operating pharmacy in the world , and certainly the oldest in Italy .
It was established in 1221 , when the Dominican monks from the adjacent Basilica of Santa Maria Novella began growing herbs to make balms , salves and medicines for their infirmary .
The superior quality of their products became widely known , and in the 17th century , the pharmacy opened its doors to the public .
Today the pharmacy still uses the traditional preparation methods , and still carries products using the original recipes of the monks .
Especially of note is the Aceto dei Sette Ladri , or “ Seven Thieves Vinegar . ”
These smelling salts got their unusual name from a band of seven men who robbed corpses during the plague .
They were said to have doused themselves in the strong vinegar to protect themselves from the plague ( bad smells , or “ miasma , ” were believed to be the cause of illness . )
Another specialty of the pharmacy is their production of Carta D’Armenia ( “ Armenian Paper ” ) since at least the 16th century .
It ’s a paper incense which is soaked in a mixture of infusions of resins and oriental spices , and burns without a flame , scenting the air .
The pharmacy itself is housed in the extraordinary original building , the rooms of which are complete with vaulted ceilings , ornate gilding , frescoes , walnut cabinetry , glass - stoppered decanters full of colorful potions , marble floors , glass - stained windows , bronze statues , and antique apothecary scales and mortars .
There is also a small museum , with somewhat irregular hours , which features antique terra - cotta apothecary jars , however the best antiques are already on display in the shop itself .
The staff are able to answer questions and provide suggestions based on your preferences .
There are product lists in a wide variety of languages , and a large computerized display allows customers to explore the offerings and read the history of each product .
They will want to educate you one by one on each scent of cologne , with all the different subtle notes , like wine .
The soaps are easier to view and smell ; the violet soap is a particular treat .
The prices are very high but so is the quality .
It ’s worth a visit to see the interior alone–it was a former papal residence and is ornate and lovely .
Seven years ago , the browser wars seemed all but ended .
AOL bought out Netscape , Microsoft Internet Explorer dominated the market , and the era of browser - based exploits began .
In 2003 , Microsoft 's stranglehold on the browser market did n't change much , but the Mozilla group began their efforts at an open - source alternative .
It still took almost two years before we finally saw the birth of Firefox , the first serious contender to the browser throne since the passing of Netscape … okay , so Netscape was more on life - support , but let 's not argue semantics .
During the past four years , things have changed to the point where browser market share is a lot more varied .
Various browsers have their proponents and opponents , and we 've seen plenty of benchmarks demonstrating which browser is the fastest , which have the best JavaScript support , and which best complies with web programming standards .
With the launch of Internet Explorer 8 , Opera 10 , Firefox 3.5 , Safari 4 , and Chrome during the past year , the market is far more varied than what we 've seen in the past .
So which browser reigns supreme ?
Truth be told , the answer to that question is very subjective .
If you have a reasonably fast system , it 's unlikely that you will notice the difference between any of the major browsers when it comes to loading typical webpages .
Stress tests that focus on JavaScript performance might be meaningful if you visit sites that use lots of JavaScript , and concerns about security , standards support , and availability of plug - ins / add - ons are also potentially meaningful .
On average it 's probably a wash as to which you 'll like " best " .
If you 're trying to figure out which browser is right for you , we suggest looking at the Browser Wars series of articles over at DailyTech .
What we are going to look at today is the impact of your choice of browser on battery life , plain and simple .
Except , coming up with a benchmark is neither plain nor simple .
We have used several different methods for testing battery life on laptops , and depending on the type of content you 're viewing battery life ranges from nearly equal to what you can expect at idle down to roughly the same amount of battery life you would get when viewing high - definition videos .
Like it or not , we feel that Adobe 's Flash is used on many websites , and so we picked three websites that we frequently visit and used those for our testing .
As a point of reference , here 's the sort of battery life difference you 're looking at when viewing " simple " webpages versus the three websites we selected , from our article comparing AMD and Intel battery life .
Obviously , that 's a huge difference in battery life .
You get roughly 50 % more battery life in simple Internet surfing compared to surfing sites that use of lots of Flash content ( along with frames , numerous tables , etc . )
Last we checked , your average website is nowhere near what would qualify as " simple " , and Flash content is ubiquitous .
For better or for worse , we 're going to focus on battery life when viewing three websites .
One of the websites is AnandTech.com , and the other two shall remain nameless .
Suffice it to say , all three sites have approaches to web design that we see replicated all over the Internet .
For testing , we load the three sites into tabs on our test web browser , wait 60 seconds , and then reload all three tabs .
We are using three recently tested laptops that offered decent battery life .
Two of these are the Gateway NV52 and NV58 that represent the current state of entry - level AMD and Intel laptops .
The third is a netbook , the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA .
None of these laptops would qualify as high - end solutions , mostly because we do n't think users interested in battery life are going to be looking at high - end laptops .
These three laptops provide a reasonable view of the current mobile market .
If there is interest , we may look at extending this testing to other laptops in the future , but first let 's see what sort of results we get from the test candidates .
China and US in new trade dispute
The US has accused China of keeping the yuan artificially high China has launched an " anti-dumping and anti-subsidy " probe into imports of some US car products and chicken meat .
The Commerce Ministry said there were concerns the US imports had " dealt a blow to domestic industries " .
It comes a day after the US imposed tariffs on Chinese tyre imports in order " to remedy a market disruption caused by a surge in tyre imports " .
The case is the latest in a series of recent trade disputes between China and the US .
" In line with national laws and World Trade Organisation rules , the commerce ministry has started an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy examination of some imported US car products and chicken meat , " the Chinese authorities said in a statement .
WHAT IS DUMPING ?
In international trade , dumping refers to exporting goods below cost or at a price below that charged at home China has called the tyre move by US President Barack Obama " protectionist " .
The White House announced duties of an additional 35 % on Chinese - made tyres for one year , followed by tariffs of 30 % and 25 % in the following two years .
While Washington has long accused China of trade protectionism , the US is also unhappy at the high volume of Chinese exports to America , accusing Beijing of deliberately keeping the yuan undervalued to make its exports artificially cheap .
The US trade deficit with China totalled $ 103bn ( £ 63 bn ) in the first half of 2009 , down 13 % from the same period last year .

Yesterday I needed dinner on the table stat !
We were going to Wednesday night church service and I had not planned ahead .
I did n’t defrost anything or think of using my crockpot .
To top it off I started on dinner a little late because I was yacking on the phone .
I quickly decided that the easiest thing to toss together was a pasta .
Of course like I already said I had n’t defrosted any meat , so a meat sauce was out of the question .
I knew that some form of a protein was required so not get get any protests from the husband figure .
I looked in my cupboard and found a can of whole baby clams and I also had some clam juice .
Bingo !
Clam marinara it is !
This came together SUPER quick and it was perfect .
The sauce was nice and chunky and I was a little heavy handed with the crushed red pepper , so there was a bit of heat .
It was fine with us , we enjoyed the heat .
It was quick , it was easy and our bellies were full .
What more could I ask for ?
Print Recipe
Marinara & Clam Sauce Over Linguine ( serves 2 with extra sauce )
2 Tbs Olive Oil
3 cloves Garlic , minced
1 small Yellow Onion , diced

1 1/2 tsp dry Oregano
1 1/2 tsp dry Basil
5 leaves Fresh Basil
1/2 tsp Crushed Red Pepper
2 Tbs Clam Juice
1/2 10 oz can Whole Baby Clams
salt and pepper to taste
1/3 box of Dry Linguine
Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium - high heat , saute garlic and onions until translucent .
Add remaining ingrediants and stir .
Bring the sauce to a simmer , turn down to low heat and simmer for about 10 minutes stirring occasionally , making sure it does n’t burn or stick .

Portrait Photography
Portrait photography is about capturing you as you are today , but in the best light and setting possible .
I want you to be able to look back on that day , that age , or that place and remember all of the little things about it .
I want you to look natural , but I also want you to look your best , so I help direct and edit photos in a way that you will love to share .
I 'm going to hold my hands up right now .
I do n't ride a bike to work because it 's good for the environment , nor do I ponder how to wear a skirt while upon two wheels .
My bike of choice is not a Pashley or a Charge Plug , it 's an Evil Revolt – at least in my dreams .
I love bikes and I love riding them hard and fast down mountains .
Ethical living ?
Head to Aston Hill on a Saturday and you 'll see more rock 'n 'roll than eco-friendly .
Yes , I 'm afraid it 's true .
I 'm a mountain biker , cycling that thin line between loving the environment yet engaging in a sport that , when practised badly , actively destroys the landscape .
It 's a dilemma also pondered by skiers – is it possible to preserve the mountains you love but ride them the way you want at the same time ?
Mountain bikers in Dorking – the south - east 's premier spot for trails – have a battle on their hands .
Europa Oil & Gas have submitted proposals for oil exploration on top of Leith Hill .
It 's a move that would severely restrict access to the area for cyclists and drastically increase the number of HGVs .
It is hard to think this would be a good thing .
Yet on any given weekend , the carparks in the area are full of 4X4s , driven in from London and the surrounds so people can ride .
Not particularly good for the environment .
And often , tyre marks can be seen carving up tracks on which bicycles are banned , both for the safety of walkers and the preservation of the landscape .
In other words , riding a bike does n't necessarily make you a saint .
True , there are purpose - built trail centres like 7 Stanes in Scotland and Afan Forest in Wales , and there is great evidence of what can be achieved when mountain bikers and forestry commissions work together .
But there is an argument that says if you only ever ride trail centres , you end up a rather cosseted and not particularly hardcore rider .
Plus , nothing can beat the feeling of riding stunning scenery in the great , unbounded , outdoors .
So should mountain biking be limited more to trail centres , thus removing the freedom and imagination which draws a lot of people to the sport ?
Or should we just accept that some environmental damage is a rather horrible side effect of what is , in its essence , a really good way to spend a day ?

Now this is one big bomb .
Published reports today say the Pentagon is rattling swords in the direction of North Korea and Iran by speeding the development a 20 - foot , 30,000lb bomb known as Massive Ordnance Penetrator ( MOP ) meant to annihilate underground bunkers and other hardened ( re : long range missile ) sites .
The Defense Threat Reduction Agency which has overseen the development of this monster since 2007 , says it is designed to be carried aboard B - 2 and B - 52 bombers and deployed at high altitudes where it would strike the ground at speeds well beyond 2X the speed of sound to penetrate the below ground target .
The Boeing - built MOP wo n't be the heaviest conventional bomb ever made .
The US military built the T - 12 , which weighed about 44,000 lbs , in the 1940s .
Meanwhile the 21,700 - lb Massive Ordnance Air Blast ( MOAB ) bomb , better known as the " Mother Of All Bombs " is still in the US arsenal .
The MOAB was developed to replace the 15,000lb " Daisy Cutters " from the Vietnam Ware era .
The Soviets claimed a " Father of all Bombs " in 2007 but some experts think the bomb was a hoax or stunt and questioned its true power .
The DTRA defines its mission as " safeguarding America and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction ( chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear , and high yield explosives ) by providing capabilities to reduce , eliminate , and counter the threat , and mitigate its effects . "
Indeed the MOP would pretty much mitigate any threat I would imagine .
According to Reuters , the threat reduction agency is working with the Air Force to transition the program from " technology demonstration " to acquisition .
The Air Force and Department of Defense are looking at the possibility of accelerating the program and there have been discussions with the four congressional committees with oversight responsibilities .
No final decision has been made , a spokesperson stated .

It ’s no secret that college costs are rising to ridiculous levels .
Kids are graduating with huge debt loads .
Even if their parents have saved for their schooling since birth , costs are rising so fast they ’re still likely to have to take on debt or work during school .
In the last twenty years or so we ’ve come to believe that college is a non-negotiable necessity .
We ’ve started thinking that college is the end - all - be - all of education and a guarantee of success .
But is it really ?
Obviously some fields require college .
If you want to be a doctor , lawyer , scientist , engineer , teacher , or architect , for example , college is the only way to go .
Other fields value skills that can be taught in college , but not exclusively .
Many tech jobs are more about programming skills , for example , that can be mastered in your garage just as well as in a college classroom .
The same holds true for many trades , design fields , communication fields , or even sales and marketing .
College can teach these things , but they can also be learned in many other ways .
Our world is changing and in a lot of ways it ’s going in reverse .
In days gone by , it was your skills that mattered .
If you could turn out a product , grow a crop , or repair something , you would never have trouble finding work .
Then things changed and we began to value the cerebral .
When you went job hunting , the hunt was less about concrete skills and more about whether you could be taught and molded to fit what a company needed .
The company could teach you the skills ; what they wanted to know was could you be taught and could you apply yourself to a goal .
Getting a college degree became a barometer of your ability to be educated , rather than a path toward acquiring a specific skill set .
The field of your degree did n’t even have to be in the field you were working in .
A degree in philosophy could land you a sales job at a tech company .
All the company needed to know was :
Can we educate this person in our ways ?
Now things are changing .
Many employers value the skill set more than the demonstrated ability to be taught .
They want to know : Can you make this product ?
Can you create this design ?
Can you program this application ?
Can you write this copy ?
Employers no longer have the time or the money to invest in taking an intelligent kid and teaching them the specific skills they need .
Employers want people who can come in , hit the ground running , and start churning out products from the first day on the job .
College degrees may carry a certain cachet , but beyond a few specific fields , they do n’t teach the concrete skills needed by employers .

To that end , higher education is changing .
No longer is a two year degree considered “ settling . ”
A two year degree in web programming may be more valuable than a four year degree in liberal arts – and cost a lot less .
An online degree that results in a useful skill may be more valuable than classroom learning .
Higher education may not even be necessary , beyond rounding out some skill sets or just gaining a different perspective on the world .
The kid who can create a video game in his garage at sixteen may be more valuable than the kid with a four year degree in “ Communication . ”
There are places in today ’s work force for the self taught and highly motivated kids .
Some employers are even taking on skilled kids in directly out of high school and putting them into paid positions and giving them a mentor to flesh out the necessary skills .
College will always have a place , but before you plunk down hundreds of thousands of dollars , ask yourself whether it ’s really necessary .
Maybe your kid already has a marketable skill that he enjoys and is only in need of a two year degree to learn the finer points of that skill .
Maybe your kid can develop a business idea into a full fledged venture without college .
Maybe your kid can get hired on at a company as a highly paid intern .
Maybe a combination of work experience and an online degree will get them further than four years in a classroom .
And do n’t pop for a private school unless you know the degree will earn more than you will pay .
Chances are a private school wo n’t grant a better skill set than a state university and the state school will cost a lot less .
There are a lot more options today in education than ever before .
College is no longer the ultimate prize .
The ultimate prize is to develop a skill set that employers drool over and want to have in their organizations .
That does n’t automatically mean a college degree .
It may mean a two - year degree , an online degree , practical work experience , self - teaching , or a combination of all of the above .
These may end up costing a lot less than college and yet grant a better entrance to the work force .
There ’s no need to take on crushing debt loads for college if it is n’t necessary for the field you want to work in .
Think before assuming that college is necessary .

1/10,000th of a human hair in diameter , stronger than steel and tougher than diamond ; the carbon nanotubes open a bright future for small sized , powerful computer chips .
Scienstists from MIT have worked on a solution , that uses entirely different technology to connect different transistors in computer chips , known as carbon nanotubes .
These tubes are famous among scientist for their sheer strength and thoughness .
They are stronger than steel ( comparatively ) and tougher than diamond .
The tubes have very less diameter compared to traditional copper wires used in chips and as the connection count reaches millions , it generates huge difference in size .
Building block of computer chips is transistor , the processor in your PC has millions of transistor in it .
Traditionally these transistors are connected via carbon wire ; just like those in electronic circuits but thinner .
To achieve high performance on a smaller size these wires have been shrunked over years to pack more in less space .
However there is a certain limit after which the conductivity suffers and may fail entirely after that threashold .
Image from Los Alamos National Laboratory
Professor Carl V. Thompson from MIT has been able to manufacture such carbon nanotubes that are perfect for vertical connections between transistors and can replace the old fashioned copper wires to make computer chip smaller and more robust .
The heavily sponsored research proved to be successful as previous attempts were a bit failure to grow these nanotubes on metallic surface at temperature close to computer chip manufacutring temperature .
Those geeks who want insights should read this paper
The research has n’t ended here , they are looking into different combination of materials to further improve the quality and characteristics of these tubes .
This news was released officially on September 10 , 2009 i.e yesterday , however the research result is at least a month old .
Let ’s see if the engineers claim to release the final version of these tubes that can accept the challenge to go into computer chips .
How to make carbon nanotubes :
An article on MIT research news explains the exact procedure how the engineers were able to make the require carbon nanotubes :
In a vacuum chamber , the researchers vaporized the metals tantalum and iron , which settled in layers on a silicon wafer .
Then they placed the coated wafer at one end of a quartz tube , which was inserted into a furnace .
At the wafer ’s end of the tube , the furnace temperature was 475 degrees C ; but at the opposite end , the temperature varied .
The researchers pumped ethylene gas into the tube from the end opposite the wafer .
When the temperature at that end approached 800 degrees , the ethylene decomposed , and the iron on the wafer catalyzed the formation of carbon nanotubes .
More research work on Carbon Nanotubes :
Carbon nanotube is a hot research topic these days as it offers its application in so many things .
As the research continues it reveals its possible application in the fields of biology , military , commercial use and engineering .
Carbon Nanotube Sensor
Carbon Nanotubes conductors
Carbon Nanotube Heatsink
Nanotube batteries
It seems MIT ’s has diverged its major research on nanotubes .
The above mentioned innovations are really cool for example the heat sink will make it possible to dissipate heat from micro devices without using conventional steel heat sink thus reduces the size .
There ’s been also some research to cure cancer by sucking the faulty cells using these nanotubes .
There future is bright !

In recent years we have seen angry minds at work mainly among extreme right - wingers , who have now demonstrated in the Goldwater movement how much political leverage can be got out of the animosities and passions of a small minority .
But behind this I believe there is a style of mind that is far from new and that is not necessarily right - wind .
Richard Hofstadter , professor of American history at Columbia University , a leading public intellectual in American politics , and conservative political analyst , wrote the quote above .
He is often quoted by strands of neoconservative most popularized by Allan Bloom .
He lost two appoints to major universities because “ he was too Jewish . ”
I think he know receives lukewarm welcome in the academic community , even though he is now recognized as one of the most insightful political commentators of the twentieth century .
He may be best known for his books , Anti-Intellectualism in America and The Age of Reform .
He wrote an essay that I highly recommend to everyone , The Paranoid Style in American Politics .
He tracks what he sees is central to American political history –“ the sense of heated exaggeration , suspiciousness , and conspiratorial fantasy ” –to foundation of America .
He takes liberal literary flourishes , and could be tamed more , but the historical resources of the essay should reveal that health care protesters are not the extreme fringes of our society but apart of a greater tradition , a tradition that we forget about .
One infamous personae is John McCarthy a man who , according to Richard Rovere ,
held two presidents captive–or as nearly captive as any Presidents of the United States have ever been held ; in their conduct of the nation ’s affairs , Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower , from early 150 trhough late 1954 , could never act without weighing the effect of their plans upon McCarthy and the forces he led , and in consequence there were times when the could not act at all .
McCarthy , having ushered in a new fear of radicals , is known for forging an alliance between traditional conservativism and radical agrarians .
Michael Rogin shows in his book The Intellectuals and McCarthy that there is no empirical evidence to suggest radical agrarians supported McCarthy –the same radical agrarians that are supporting the current mob violence and agonistic hate wishes .
I ’d ask could it be that their own radicalism in not necessarily in line with corporate interests and these radicals are using this an opportunity to build political capital for their own interests ?
Regardless whether anyone has an answer for this question , I recommend Hofstadter ’s essay as well as Thomas Frank ’s books , What ’s The Matter with Kansas ? and One Market Under God .

New York Launches Public School Curriculum Based on Playing Games
Video games and learning exercises form the core of a new public school curriculum
Features :
What is now known as the Alpine Butterfly Loop was described twice by Ashley : Lineman ’s Loop ( ABOK # 1053 , p 191 ) ; and Harness Loop ( ABOK # 532 , p 87 ) .
It provides a secure loop in the middle of a piece of rope .
Load can be safely applied : from the loop to either end of the rope ; between the two ends with the loop hanging free ; or to the loop with the load spread between the two ends .
Uses : The Alpine Butterfly Loop is useful anytime a secure loop is required in the middle of a rope .
A good example is when a line of hikers wish to hook on along the length of a shared rope or as a possible option for the first part of a Trucker ’s Hitch .
Also , if a length of rope is damaged , it is a wonderful way to isolate the damaged section so that the rope may still be used – far safer than The Sheep Shank .
Tying it :
There are several methods for tying the Alpine Butterfly Loop .
We devised the method that is used in the animation .
It is an improvement on other “ hand - winding ” methods .
It helps locate the loop : the second crossing of your hand is near your fingertips and away from the other two turns .
This helps you to locate it , pick it up , and wrap it around the other two strands .
Setting the knot usually requires holding the loop in your teeth and pulling both ends with your hands .
Advantages : The Alpine Butterfly Loop is more stable than either the The Bowline on a Bight or the The Figure 8 Loop – both of which may roll over .
Even after a heavy load , the Alpine Butterfly Loop remains reasonably easy to undo .
It is also a little easier to tie and more compact than the The Farmer ’s Loop .
The Alpine Butterfly Loop also teaches the technique for tying The Alpine Butterfly Bend which is one of the reasons that we prefer the Alpine Butterfly Bend over the other similar bends such as the :

As BBC Radio 4 reported the death of Senator Kennedy on the news , I heard a line about how his career had been blighted by the incident at the bridge at Chappaquiddick where " he failed immediately to report an accident " .
You can see what has happened : in an inadvisable attempt to avoid a split infinitive , the adverb has been placed before to , but this puts it next to failed , so we get interference from a distracting and unintended meaning that involves immediate failure ( whatever that might mean ) .
It was the reporting that should have been immediate .
The right word order to pick would have been " he failed to immediately report an accident " .
But you just can't stop writers of news copy from being worried ( falsely ) that splitting an infinitive is some kind of mistake .
I should add one thing .
Many of the comments that began appearing below the first version of this post ( I have deleted them , for reasons I will now explain ) wanted to argue for " he failed to report an accident immediately " .
But in fact that option was rendered disastrously less plausible in the BBC sentence , which I shortened ( thinking the rest of the object irrelevant ) .
It was roughly this : " he failed immediately to report an accident in which he drove off a bridge and his female companion drowned " .
It would of course be much worse to try " he failed to report an accident in which he drove off a bridge and his female companion drowned immediately " , where almost no one would take the adverb to modify the verb report .
Other commenters want to defend " he failed to report immediately an accident " .
That would in fact also have been acceptable in the full context ( which I did not originally give ) , but only because the noun phrase was long .
Still other commenters simply quibbled with earlier commenters or made sarcastic remarks about them or made the ridiculous suggestion that " an Americanism " was involved ( Americans who find a sentence questionable always say it sounds British and British speakers say it's an Americanism — they blame whichever side of the Atlantic they know least about ) .
These bored me , and I spiked them all .
Let me make this clear : I 'm not saying that you never have a choice , and I 'm not saying the split infinitive is always the right choice to make .
All I 'm saying that , squirm though you may , it is fairly common for placing an adverb between infinitival to and the following plain - form verb to be not just grammatical ( it is always grammatical ) , but also the best stylistic choice .
And this was one .
But BBC editors resist that and worry about it .
Stupidly .

If you 've watched Wolf Blitzer struggle to ask relevant questions of interviewees or just fill up time with cliches and nonsense you might 've gotten the impression that he is not very bright .
He did Celebrity Jeopardy to prove you wrong !

He did n't know where Jesus was born .
He thinks Julia Childs wrote Mastering the Art of French Cooking .
He was just not good at Jeopardy .
It does n't help that he was playing against Jeopardy wizard Andy Richter , who handily won $ 68,000 for the St. Jude Children 's Hospital , but Dana Delany was there too and she did n't end the Double Jeopardy round thousand of dollars in the hole .
Even better : The Tonight Show aired scenes from the show rehearsal , where you can see Wolf being even dumber and also weirdly rude and pretentious .

Europe is to throw its weight behind a campaign to save the bluefin tuna from decades of over - fishing after a breakthrough in talks in Brussels .
The European Commission announced a compromise deal backing an attempt to list the Mediterranean fish as an endangered species while waiting for further scientific evidence on the latest population numbers after the EU Fisheries Commissioner Joe Borg backed down .
Europe is now expected to vote as a bloc of 27 nations in favour of a proposal to protect bluefin tuna under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( Cites ) which – if approved by a majority of 175 nations around the world – would ban all international trade in the fish .

Environmentalists expressed their delight at the issue , saying it represented the best chance of allowing the tuna to recover from intense demand in Japan , which imports 90 per cent of Europe 's bluefin for sushi .
At the last count the population of the Northern Atlantic Bluefin in the Mediterranean had sunk to 18 per cent of its 1970 level , although the small size of specimens on the Tokyo fish markets suggests its collapse is more serious .
Europe has been divided on what action to take .
Britain , France , Germany , the Netherlands and Austria favoured a complete trade ban but the move had been resisted by the capital of the bluefin industry Malta and , it is thought , by Spain and Italy , which also have a big commercial interest in bluefin .
The Environment Commissioner , Stavros Dimas , who backed the Cites proposal , was at loggerheads with his fisheries counterpart , Mr Borg .
Mr Borg , from Malta , had been insisting that time be allowed for a bluefin recovery plan which was agreed by the International Convention on the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas ( Iccat ) , whose poor record on conserving the fish has led to it being dubbed the International Conspiracy to Catch All Tuna .
The impasse meant support for a ban was in danger of collapsing , raising the prospect of a compromise of limited trade being allowed instead , which environmentalists said would provide cover for widespread illegal fishing .
However a compromise was reached after Mr Borg backed down , and the Commission provisionally agreed to back a proposal for a ban at Cites in March , subject to the latest assessment of stocks from Iccat in November .

In a statement yesterday , the EC said : " Given that the European Commission services share many of the concerns expressed by Monaco about the state of the stocks of Atlantic bluefin tuna , they consider that the Community could provisionally co-sponsor the proposal by Monaco requesting the listing of BFT in Cites Appendix I . "
In a sign that the EC might drop its support if Icatt announces a recovery in bluefin numbers , the EC cautioned : " Whereas it appears for the time being that the criteria for such a listing may be met , the Commission services note that the assessment on which the Monaco proposal is based draws from scientific advice issued in October 2008 . "
The EC proposal will be put to a meeting of President Barroso 's Cabinet tomorrow .
The Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said : " It is great news that the commission is showing its support for the proposal to give bluefin tuna the highest form of protection , which the UK is backing strongly . "
He said the UK would seek support for the proposal from other EU states .
Tony Long , director of WWF in Brussels , said : " Commissioners Dimas and Borg have made the right choice , leading the EU to heed urgent scientific advice that Atlantic bluefin tuna is dangerously close to collapse and needs a break . "
Willie Mackenzie of Greenpeace , said : " Today 's move does n't mean that this fish is saved yet .
Member states still need to agree to support this ban , and follow the lead of countries like the UK . "
Opposition to over - fishing has been growing since the release of the film The End of the Line , which pictures what may have been the last big summer hunt for bluefin in the Mediterranean .
Charles Clover , the author of the book on which the film was based , also called The End of the Line , said : " It may have been collapsing while we were filming . "
Celebrities signed a letter by the actress Greta Scacchi to President Barroso urging him to avoid bluefin tuna going extinct " on his watch . "
Being bad is good for you :
Playing blaring rock music and skipping the housework can actually boost your health
We 've been told not to get angry - because it raises blood pressure .
While fizzy drinks do nothing but rot your teeth and make you fat .
But new research has shown that many of our bad habits may also be good for us .
Here , VICTORIA LAMBERT presents the Good Health guide to when and why our bad habits can be positively virtuous ...
ANGER
GOOD FOR YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE
We used be warned off getting angry because it raised blood pressure , but now it seems letting off a head of steam may bring physical benefits .
Researchers from the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have found that people who respond to irritating , high - stress situations with some righteous anger maintain lower blood pressure and secrete less cortisol , known as the stress hormone , than people who respond with fear or bottle up their feelings .
It seems to be about how you react to situations .
Demonstrating a level of anger that seems proportionate - such as letting off steam at an unjust situation - helps you develop increased feelings of control and optimism .
But being fearful or frustrated does n't , leading to a rise in the stress hormone , which when experienced for prolonged high levels , can lead to heart disease .
Anger : Letting it all out can actually be good for your blood pressure
In the study , psychologist Jennifer Lerner harassed 92 students by making them perform difficult timed tasks under stress .
She then changed the rules several times during the test .
Wrong answers meant subjects had to start all over again , leading to frustration .
Video cameras recorded the subjects ' facial expressions and researchers identified fear , anger and disgust .
They also recorded blood pressure , pulse rate and secretions of cortisol .
The people whose faces showed fear during the tests had higher blood pressure and higher levels of the hormone than those who got angry .
VIDEO GAMES
BOOST METABOLISM
Despite being blamed for their part in the obesity epidemic , video games might actually help us get fit and lose weight .
Scientists at the University of Miami hooked up 21 boys to various monitors while they played Tekken 3 , a mock martial arts contest , on a Sony PlayStation .
These showed that during the game the boys ' heart rates speeded up , they used more energy and began breathing more quickly .
Study leader Dr Arlette Perry concludes that playing video games could have a positive effect on health , provided they 're not substituted for real sport .
' It 's better than just sitting there watching TV , ' she says . '
SWEARING
EASES PAIN
Swearing is good for you : Gordon Ramsay , well known for his liberal use of the F - word , will be pleased
Our ancestors may have bitten on sticks of wood when surgery was practised without anaesthetic , but a study has shown they might have been better off without .
Scientists at Keele University found volunteers could withstand pain for longer when they swore rather than using non-offensive words .
Dr Richard Stephens , a lecturer in psychology who conducted the research , believes it may explain why swearing is still commonplace .
Having observed his wife swearing in labour , he was motivated to find out why .
He believes swearing is connected to our adrenaline response and that it could even have evolved to allow our ancestors to fight back when attacked by predators .
' In the volunteers who swore , we also found they had an elevated heart rate , so it could be that swearing increased their aggression levels .
Increased aggression has been shown to reduce people 's sensitivity to pain . '
In the study 64 students submerged their hands in a tub of iced water while repeating their own chosen swear words .
The task was repeated later using non-offensive words .
The swearing volunteers were able to keep their hands submerged for an average 40 seconds longer .
When questioned about perceived pain they also rated it as being lower .
LAZING ABOUT
ADDS YEARS TO YOUR LIFE
People who get up early and busy themselves all day long are heading for an early grave , says public health expert Professor Peter Axt .
He believes lazing about is the key to a long life and an antidote to professional stress , provided people are otherwise healthy .
He suggests : ' Waste half your free time .
People who would rather take a midday nap instead of playing squash have a better chance of living into old age . '
Research shows that people who run long distances into their 50s are using up energy they need for other purposes such as cell renewal and fighting disease , he adds .
As examples of his thesis , he has pointed to the increased longevity of zoo animals - for instance lions in the Serengeti live only eight years , but can live to the age of 20 in a zoo ; Arctic polar bears last 20 years in the wild , but 40 in captivity .
Human examples are priests , nuns and monks , who tend to live quieter lives .
Lazing about :
Why hit the gym 5 am when you can spend the day on the sofa AND live longer ?
Another added benefit is that our brains are much more active when we daydream than previously thought .
' Mind wandering is typically associated with negative things like inattentiveness , ' says psychology Professor Kalina Christoff at the University of British Columbia .
' But research shows our brains are very active when we daydream , much more than when we focus on routine tasks . '
The findings suggest that daydreaming , which can occupy as much as one third of our waking lives , is an important cognitive state where we sort through important information .
GETTING STRESSED
BOOSTS THE MEMORY
While long periods of stress such as redundancy or divorce can leave your immune system depleted and your body prone to infection , researchers at the University of Buffalo in the U.S have found that a short stressful incident can boost your learning and memory .
This is due to the way cortisol , the hormone produced when we 're stressed , affects the part of the brain which controls learning and emotion .
Acute stress increases transmission of glutamate , the substance that passes messages in the brain - and improves working memory .
Zhen Yan , professor of physiology and biophysics , explains : ' Stress hormones have both protective and damaging effects on the body .
This is why we need stress to perform better , but do n't want to be stressed out . '
In the study , rats were trained to complete a maze , then half were put through a 20 - minute forced swim - placing them under acute stress .
They were then put through the maze again .
Scientists found the stressed rats made significantly fewer mistakes as they went through the maze compared to the non-stressed rats .
AVOIDING HOUSEWORK
PREVENTS ALLERGIES
Rising numbers of allergies and auto - immune conditions ( such as psoriasis , where the body attacks itself ) are often blamed on the ' hygiene hypothesis ' ; the idea that our modern sterile society is too clean .
But dirt may not be the key .
A survey last year carried out at Bristol and Brunel Universities found that women who used a lot of household cleaning products during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth are increasing their child 's risk of developing asthma .
The study , which examined 13,000 children from before birth , found that early life exposure to such chemicals was linked to a 41 per cent increase in a child 's chances of developing asthma by the age of seven .
The chemicals in these products may have irritated the child 's airways .
LOUD MUSIC
STIMULATES THE BRAIN
Loud music :
Heading off to rock festivals , or simply turning up the volume on your home amplifier might be good for your brain power
Heading off to rock festivals , or simply turning up the volume on your home amplifier might be good for your brain power .
According to researchers at Manchester University , music fans are stimulating part of the inner ear known as the sacculus , which responds to the beat in music .
This gives the brain pleasure and makes us feel good - during the music and afterwards .
The sacculus , which is not thought to have any hearing function in humans , appears to be sensitive only to very loud volumes , above 90 decibels .
Neil Todd , an expert in the scientific study of music , explains that the sacculus seems to be part of a primitive hearing mechanism that has slowly been lost as humans have evolved .
He said it has a connection to the part of the brain responsible for drives such as hunger , sex and hedonistic responses .
When these desires are satisfied , the brain is stimulated into releasing feelgood hormones that make us calm , happy and responsive .
So to trigger a dose of happy hormones on a Monday morning , you should , in theory , choose Black Sabbath over chamber music .
FIZZY DRINKS
COMBAT DEMENTIA
Despite concerns about rotting teeth and obesity , drinking two cans fizzy drink a day might help you avoid Alzheimer 's and improve your memory by 20 per cent .
Neuroscientists from Glasgow Caledonian University said as well as the elderly who were struggling with short - term memory loss , people studying for exams could benefit - perhaps because of the sugar rush .
Psychology lecturer Dr Leigh Riby focused on an area of the brain known as the hippocampus , which creates new memories but declines with the onset of dementia .
Using memory tests and brain - imaging techniques Dr Riby assessed volunteers after they had guzzled fizzy drinks containing either 25g of sugar ( the same as in a can of Coke ) or twice that amount .
The hippocampus lit up with activity after participants had a sweetened drink and they were able to recall 17 per cent more than without a drink .
' It is accepted that when humans face a stressful situation they experience a natural rise in glucose in the body , particularly in the hippocampus , ' he said .
' We also tend to remember these dangerous or scary occurrences more clearly than other memories .
' This glucose - memory system has evolved to help humans survive .
Unfortunately , it is compromised in old age .'
FIDGETING
FIGHTS OBESITY
It may be irritating at the theatre , but natural fidgets are doing themselves a favour .
U.S. researchers from the Mayo Clinic have found that people who always seem to be on the go are more likely to be slim - and may spend two more hours a day being active than their tubby friends .
The extra motion , whether it is tapping , twitching , stretching or yawning , accounts for an extra 350 calories a day , or between 10 to 30lb a year .
Endocrinologist James Levine of the Mayo Clinic , who led the research , says : ' There are absolutely staggering differences in the amount of fidgeting between people who are lean and people who are obese .
The amount of this low - grade activity is so substantial it could account for obesity quite easily . '
The team also found that while we are born wigglers or sitters , there 's no reason to stop a person deliberately adopting a fidgety habit .
' Some say obese people have no choice about their weight , ' said Levine .
' But I would argue the opposite . '
BEING UNTIDY
Being untidy :
An unmade bed can deter dust mites which is good news for asthma sufferers
Unmade beds are the bane of many a mother 's life , but researchers at Kingston University think they might be the answer to asthma .
Their research suggests that house dust mites - thought to cause asthma - cannot survive in the dry exposed conditions found in an unmade bed .
Normally , the average bed houses 1.5 million house dust mites , which feed on scales of human skin ; the mites ' waste contains allergens which are easily inhaled during sleep and can particularly affect those with allergy problems such as asthma .
An occupied bed , or a made one that retains the warmth and moisture after the person has left it , is the ideal home , but house mites are less likely to thrive when moisture is in short supply .
According to Dr Stephen Pretlove , who led the study , mites survive by taking in water from the atmosphere - your body sweat while you 're asleep .
' Something as simple as leaving a bed unmade during the day can remove moisture from the sheets and mattress so the mites dehydrate and die . '
PLAYING BINGO
EASES DEPRESSION
Gamblers may be healthier and happier than those who do n't like a flutter , says research conducted by Yale University in America .
This found that moderate gambling , a weekly game of bingo or trip to the races , is a common denominator in adults who live past 65 and that those who gambled were mentally healthier adults of the same age .
This could be due to increased activity , socialisation , and brain stimulation , says Rani Desai , associate professor of psychiatry who led the study .
The results are also consistent with other work on healthy ageing : that having an active brain and a social life staves off dementia and depression .
For instance , playing poker online will keep brain cells active ; bingo or a trip to the Grand National will get you out of the house .
As most studies on the effects of gambling have found negative health benefits ( and all the risks of addiction ) the researchers say they were surprised by the findings and will continue their investigation .
WASHINGTON  The Central Intelligence Agency in 2004 hired outside contractors from the private security contractor Blackwater USA as part of a secret program to locate and assassinate top operatives of Al Qaeda , according to current and former government officials .
Executives from Blackwater , which has generated controversy because of its aggressive tactics in Iraq , helped the spy agency with planning , training and surveillance .
The C.I.A. spent several million dollars on the program , which did not successfully capture or kill any terrorist suspects .
The fact that the C.I.A. used an outside company for the program was a major reason that Leon E. Panetta , the C.I.A. ’s director , became alarmed and called an emergency meeting in June to tell Congress that the agency had withheld details of the program for seven years , the officials said .
It is unclear whether the C.I.A. had planned to use the contractors to actually capture or kill Qaeda operatives , or just to help with training and surveillance in the program .
American spy agencies have in recent years outsourced some highly controversial work , including the interrogation of prisoners .
But government officials said that bringing outsiders into a program with lethal authority raised deep concerns about accountability in covert operations .

We have published a more detailed account of how these ads appeared on NYTimes.com , with a look at the larger issues with security and ads .
The New York Times Company said on Monday that NYTimes.com was the victim of an attacker who first posed as a legitimate advertiser , then started hitting site visitors with aggressive advertisements that appeared to be warnings about viruses .
“ Over the weekend , NYTimes.com was the victim of a malware attack that targeted several news organizations , ” Diane McNulty , a spokeswoman for the company , said in a statement in response to questions about the rogue ads .
“ The culprit masqueraded as a national advertiser and provided seemingly legitimate product advertising for a week .
Over the weekend , the ad being served up was switched so that an intrusive message , claiming to be a virus warning from the reader ’s computer , appeared . ”
Ms. McNulty said that in response to the problem , The Times suspended advertising that is inserted automatically into its pages by outside ad - placement companies , and posted a notice about the attack .
“ We now know how it occurred and have taken steps to prevent a similar situation from happening , ” she said .
We are posting information on what to do if you saw one of these ads on the Gadgetwise blog .

While taking a look at some of the talks by Tamara Munzner I found this video / documentary about turning a sphere inside out .
I 've found this to be very impressive ( and pedagogic ) .
The style of the video reminds me the Moebius Transformation video I posted last year .
For those who do n't know Tamara Munzner she 's like a big reference in all InfoVis - related stuff .
One of the most inspiring InfoVis talks I 've found was done by her and can be seen here .
This is the talk that started my interest in InfoVis and the making of the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit

There is nothing in any of the legislative proposals that would call for the creation of death panels or any other governmental body that would cut off care for the critically ill as a cost - cutting measure .
But over the course of the past few months , early , stated fears from anti-abortion conservatives that Mr. Obama would pursue a pro-abortion , pro-euthanasia agenda , combined with twisted accounts of actual legislative proposals that would provide financing for optional consultations with doctors about hospice care and other “ end of life ” services , fed the rumor to the point where it overcame the debate .
On Thursday , Mr. Grassley said in a statement that he and others in the small group of senators that was trying to negotiate a health care plan had dropped any “ end of life ” proposals from consideration .
A pending House bill has language authorizing Medicare to finance beneficiaries ’ consultations with professionals on whether to authorize aggressive and potentially life - saving interventions later in life .
Though the consultations would be voluntary , and a similar provision passed in Congress last year without such a furor , Mr. Grassley said it was being dropped in the Senate “ because of the way they could be misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly . ”
The extent to which it and other provisions have been misinterpreted in recent days , notably by angry speakers at recent town hall meetings but also by Ms. Palin  who popularized the “ death panel ” phrase  has surprised longtime advocates of changes to the health care system .
“ I guess what surprised me is the ferocity , it ’s much stronger than I expected , ” said John Rother , the executive vice president of AARP , which is supportive of the health care proposals and has repeatedly declared the “ death panel ” rumors false .
“ It ’s people who are ideologically opposed to Mr. Obama , and this is the opportunity to weaken the president . ”
CONCORD , N.H - When Tropical Storm Chata'an struck the Federated States of Micronesia in 2002 , the U.S. government sent 1,300 blankets , 4,000 disposable diapers , 30 cases of sardines - and my Social Security number .
The nine digits that govern so much of Americans ' identities are supposed to be ours for life - and only ours .
But mine ended up linked to a Micronesian man who defaulted on a disaster loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration .
I did n't find out until March , in a letter from a debt collector threatening to garnish my wages if I did n't pay $ 7,306 in two days .
The same could happen to an unknown number of others , because of a processing glitch that the U.S. Social Security Administration did n't even know existed and the federal government has n't fixed .
Who is giving away American Social Security numbers to strangers in other lands ?
The answer is not so simple .
The problem involves three Pacific island nations , each of which has its own , independent Social Security Administration .
The three - the Federated States of Micronesia , the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau - grant defense rights in the region to the U.S. , and in exchange receive aid , including grants and loans after disasters .
For instance , the Federal Emergency Management Agency sent $ 20 million to 9,700 people in the Federated States of Micronesia after the 2002 storm .
The three countries together have received USDA housing grants and loans worth $ 33 million since 2000 .
Some federal agencies collect locally - issued Social Security numbers from grant and loan applicants and report them to credit bureaus as if they were U.S. numbers , regardless of whether the numbers already are in use .
That 's the beginning of the problem , which is n't identity theft but can create some of the same headaches when identities become linked in the eyes of lenders or creditors .
" This can really slow you down if there is a default or a history of bad payment , " said Chris Jay Hoofnagle , director of information privacy programs at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has known for years that it creates " overlapping " Social Security numbers when granting loans in the three island nations , said Donald Etes of the agency 's rural development office in Hawaii .
The office that processes loans is working on a fix , but there have been no software or policy changes yet , he said .
My own case - involving a Micronesian man who failed to repay an SBA loan - illustrates how the resulting hassles play out and also shows that I 'm probably not alone .
Of 299 people in Micronesia who took out SBA loans , more than 200 have n't paid up , increasing the odds that others have shared my experience .
No one has a good estimate of numbers .
The collection agency told me the debt , though listed under another name , was associated with my Social Security number .
Despite knowing I was n't at fault , I felt my face grow hot as the debt collector rattled off a list of everywhere I had ever lived .
" You 've never had any debt like this ? " he pressed .
" NEVER ? "
He backed off within days , but I spent weeks calling and e-mailing federal agencies , banks , credit bureaus and collection agencies in four countries and five time zones trying to untangle the rest .
In many cases , no one could explain why it happened , because they were n't convinced it could happen .
It turns out that Social Security numbers in two of the three Pacific Island nations do n't even have nine digits like U.S. numbers .
They have eight , but some U.S. computers automatically add a zero to the front to fill in the blank .
Sometimes , that creates new numbers beginning with a double - zero - just like New Hampshire 's Social Security numbers , and Maine's .
Bottom line :
If your U.S. number starts with 002 - 6 , 003 - 9 , 005 - 7 or 007 - 8 , it could match a number in Micronesia .
Numbers that start 006 - 4 could match numbers in Palau .
Those that start with 004 could match numbers in the Marshall Islands .
That works out to roughly 135,000 possible matches , according to an Associated Press comparison of the numbering systems .
But no one knows how many actually exist .
Jeff Whitcomb of Keene , N.H. , had no idea that public record databases show his Social Security number linked to someone in Micronesia , but he was n't overly alarmed .
As far as he knows , he has n't been harmed by the connection .
" It seems to me it 's likely an innocent mistake , but one that bears watching , " he said .
" It makes me want to most definitely do business with small , local financial institutions that know me , and not just my Social Security number . "
Do other factors contribute to the identity sharing ?
The region 's major financial player - the Bank of Guam - says it differentiates between local Social Security numbers and U.S. numbers , but wo n't say how .
None of the three major credit reporting agencies has any way to distinguish between U.S. Social Security numbers and those issued in the three island nations , said industry spokesman Norm Magnuson , who answered questions on behalf of all three agencies .
Surely the four nations ' Social Security administrations were aware of this , right ?
Not a one .
" I thought U.S. government agencies only accepted U.S. - assigned numbers , " said Gregory Ngirmang , head of the Republic of Palau Social Security Administration .
The credit bureaus say call the Social Security Administration .
But Social Security mainly cares about crediting wages earned by American workers to the right person .
If that 's not an issue , it 's not their problem .
Social Security says try the credit bureaus , or the Federal Trade Commission .
But the FTC investigates identity theft , and this is n't theft .
" This is the trouble consumers have .
There are obvious questions that need answers , and they do n't have to answer you , " said Evan Hendricks , author of " Credit Scores and Credit Reports . "
" You 're sort of highlighting how wrong things can go , and how powerless you are to do anything . "
Arrowheads and other Stone Age tools may not look like much to the untrained eye , but try making them yourself and you 'll find out just how difficult it can be .
After struggling for years to replicate stone blades excavated in the southern tip of Africa , modern toolmaker Kyle Brown — like early humans before him — stumbled upon the missing ingredient : fire .
Most archaeologists have thought that humans developed pyrotechnology — the controlled use of fire — in Europe about 25,000 years ago .
But Brown 's discovery , published in Science today , pushes that date back to at least 72,000 years ago — and possibly as far as 164,000 .
The new findings complement other discoveries , like shell beads and ochre pigments , revealing advanced technical capabilities in the earliest modern humans , who emerged between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago .
Beginning in 2006 Brown , a doctoral student at the University of Cape Town in South Africa , began hunting for stone outcrops that had the same silcrete ( a hard material formed from dissolved silica ) found in tools excavated from archaeological sites at Pinnacle Point .
He and his colleagues made some 10 trips to the field , lugging the heavy rocks back to the lab and smashing them to try to recreate the stone blades .
" I had a pretty high failure rate , " he says .
The stone never flaked off properly , and the tools he made were larger and thicker than the ancient tools .
" We reached a point that we covered the landscape fairly well and we were n't finding any suitable rocks , " he says .
The team , however , had recently excavated silcrete tools that had a glossy luster to them and looked a lot like heat - treated Native American tools they had seen before .
In 2007 the researchers had also found a large hunk of silcrete embedded in ash .
" Out of desperation , " Brown says , " I put the materials in a fire . "
He buried them in a sand , built a fire on top , raised the temperature to 300 degrees Celsius over a period of about eight hours , and then cooked them for another eight .
When he pulled the materials out of the sand , the rock flaked off easily , and had a glossy sheen that matched the silcrete artifacts .
Brown , 36 , grew up in San Francisco and got his start making stone tools as a teenager .
His father , a field biologist , took him on ecological studies in California 's Napa Valley where he collected volcanic glass and tried to copy the arrowheads he found in the region .
" I was n't much good at that , " he admits .
Years later , as a student at the University of California , Berkeley , a toolmaker gave him instruction and he was hooked .
Now , Brown has something to teach the rest of us , something that earlier Homo sapiens figured out tens of thousands of years ago .

Former Governor Jesse Ventura : Let Me Judge Torture Photos On Behalf Of The American People
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , May 21 , 2009
The real reason behind Obama ’s reversal of a decision to release the torture photos has been almost completely ignored by the corporate media – the fact that the photos show both US and Iraqi soldiers raping teenage boys in front of their mothers .
The Obama administration originally intended to release photos depicting torture and abuse of detainees in Afghanistan and Iraq by the end of May , following a court order arising out of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit first filed by the ACLU in 2004 .
However , a reversal of Obama ’s decision was announced this week , after he “ changed his mind after viewing some of the images and hearing warnings from his generals in Iraq and in Afghanistan that such a move would endanger US troops deployed there , ” according to a Washington Post report .
In response , the ACLU charged that Obama “ has essentially become complicit with the torture that was rampant during the Bush years by being complicit in its coverup . ”
The Obama administration has also sought to protect intelligence officials involved in torture from prosecution at every turn .
The primary reason why Obama is now blocking the release of the photos is that some of the pictures , as well as video recordings , show prison guards sodomizing young boys in front of their mothers , both with objects as well as physical rape .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
This horrific detail has been almost completely ignored by the establishment media in their coverage of the story this week , despite the fact that it ’s been in the public domain for nearly five years , after it was first revealed by investigative Seymour Hersh during an ACLU conference in July 2004 .
“ Some of the worst things that happened you do n’t know about , okay ? ” said Hersh .
“ Videos , there are women there .
Some of you may have read that they were passing letters out , communications out to their men .
This is at Abu Ghraib …
The women were passing messages out saying ‘ Please come and kill me , because of what ’s happened ’ and basically what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys , children in cases that have been recorded .
The boys were sodomized with the cameras rolling .
And the worst above all of that is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking that your government has .
They are in total terror .
It ’s going to come out . ”
Hersh ’s contention that minors were raped by prison guards while others filmed the vulgar spectacle is backed up by a leaked Abu Ghraib memorandum highlighted in a 2004 London Guardian report , in which detainees Kasim Hilas describes “ the rape of an Iraqi boy by a man in uniform ” .
The testimony was also part of the military ’s official Taguba Report into the torture at Abu Ghraib .
“ I saw [ name blacked out ] fucking a kid , his age would be about 15 - 18 years .
The kid was hurting very bad and they covered all the doors with sheets .
Then when I heard the screaming I climbed the door because on top it was n’t covered and I saw [ blacked out ] , who was wearing the military uniform putting his dick in the little kid ’s ass , ” Mr Hilas told military investigators .
“ I could n’t see the face of the kid because his face was n’t in front of the door .
And the female soldier was taking pictures . ”
Another inmate , Thaar Dawod , described more abuse of teenage boys .
“ They came with two boys naked and they were cuffed together face to face and Grainer [ Corporal Charles Graner , one of the military policemen facing court martial ] was beating them and a group of guards were watching and taking pictures from top and bottom and there was three female soldiers laughing at the prisoners , ” he said .
A 2004 London Telegraph report also described photos which showed “ US soldiers beating an Iraqi prisoner nearly to death and having sex with a female PoW , ” as well as a videotape , apparently made by US personnel , which shows “ Iraqi guards raping young boys ” .
Former Governor Jesse Ventura today offered a solution to the controversy surrounding President Obama ’s decision to reverse an earlier promise to release the torture photos – let Ventura see the photos on behalf of the American people and then decide if they should be released .
Ventura told the Alex Jones Show today , “ How about if I step forward on behalf of the taxpayers and the citizens of the great United States of America – and I wanna go public with this – I will represent us , let me go where these photos are , let me go inside and see them and let me come out and report back as to what these photos are . ”
“ I think I have the right to do that , I think they have no right to keep me from doing that , you know why ?
I pay their salaries and I ’m a governor , I ’m a mayor , I ’m a former Navy SEAL , I had a top secret security clearance – I think I ’m fully qualified to walk in and view these photos , ” said Ventura , adding , “ I ’ll report to the public , what it is why we should n’t be able to see them because I understand it could infuriate the enemy , but I ’m not the enemy and therefore I think I have every right to see these photos in private . ”

A petrol bomb was thrown at a Department of Finance office in Dublin last night .
The flammable substance was thrown through a window of the building on Merrion St and a small fire broke out .
A garda on duty outside called the Fire Brigade just before 11 pm and five units attended the scene .
However , security staff had already put out the small fire .
A small amount of damage was done to the building but no - one was injured in the incident .
Gardaí say a lone man approached the building from the Baggotrath Lane direction and threw a bottle containing an accelerant at one of the front windows .
The man was wearing a dark - coloured woolly hat and his face was covered by a scarf .
He wore a black , zip - up fleece top with a white logo and dark blue jeans .
The t- shirt he wore underneath was light in colour .
Gardaí are appealing to anyone who may have seen the man to contact them .
Gardaí are also appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and who may have witnessed the incident or who may have any information to contact them at Pearse Street on 01-6669000 , the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 - 666111 or any Garda Station .

UNIONTOWN , Pa. ( AP )  A Pennsylvania history buff who recreates firearms from old wars accidentally fired a 2 - pound cannonball through the wall of his neighbor 's home .
Fifty - four - year - old William Maser fired a cannonball Wednesday evening outside his home in Georges Township that ricocheted and hit a house 400 yards away .
The cannonball , about two inches in diameter , smashed through a window and a wall before landing in a closet .
Authorities say nobody was hurt .
State police charged Maser with reckless endangerment , criminal mischief and disorderly conduct .
No one answered the phone Friday at Maser 's home .
He tells WPXI - TV recreating 19th century cannons is a longtime hobby .
He says he is sorry and he will stop shooting them on his property , about 35 miles southeast of Pittsburgh .

We often think that we have a problem of scarcity of resources .
It is not so : scarcity is not absolute .
Whether we have enough of something or not depends on our perception of what we need .
And , because we seem to think that we never have enough , we tend to use what we have faster than it can be replaced .
It is the phenomenon called " overexploitation " or " overshoot " .
It is the main problem that we are facing and it is all because of the way the human mind works .
Just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder , overexploitation is all in the brain of the exploiter .
Nate Hagens has argued several times in " The Oil Drum " that the human mind is geared for growth ( see , for instance here ) .
Apparently , we act on the basis of a series of neurotransmitters ( e.g. dopamine ) that make us search for continuously renewed stimulation .
This way of functioning of the human mind is what generates our tendency of " discounting the future " , that is of giving a lower value to the future than to the present .
This rapidly declining discount function is the key of the mechanism of overexploitation .
This view of human behavior is based on experimental evidence which , however , is mostly limited to humans living in the modern , fast growing countries of the Western world .
But present day humans may be just a short lived phenomenon .
Growth cannot continue forever and sooner or later we 'll have to settle in a condition of zero growth ; very likely after a phase of decline .
Zero growth has been the normal condition of human life for the past few millennia of agricultural civilizations .
Surely the world changed even in ancient times , but the perception of this change was denied to people constrained to their fields , their family , their village , and little more .
It was the world of peasants .
Peasants , by now , have disappeared in the Western world , replaced by farm workers specialized in operating agricultural machinery .
Yet , this is a recent development and the peasant world is still alive in poor countries and a living memory in rich ones .
So , we still have a chance to have a glimpse of a zero growth world and of the mind of the people living in it .
How did they see the world around them ?
How did they see their future ?
How did they plan ahead for good and bad times ?
There seem to be few psychological studies of the mind of the peasants : office workers are much easier to find and study , nowadays .
But anthropologists have studied peasant civilizations in depth .
One of these studies is in the book of Peter Farb " Humankind " published in 1978 .
Farb was an American anthropologist who had studied mainly native Americans , but who had a broad interest in human behavior in general .
" Humankind " was a condensate of his thought ( he died in 1980 ) .
After more than 30 years , the book is dated in many respects , but it is still well worth a look even today .
I remember having read it for the first time in the early 1980s and , rereading it now , I see how much it has shaped my vision of the world .
Here are some excerpts of Peter Farb 's description of the way of thinking of peasants as it appears in the chapter titled " The Perennial Peasants " .
The pattern that emerges does n't agree with the idyllic view of a zero growth world made of small , self - sufficient units as it is often presented today .
It shows that the limitation of material resources affects also the perception of all ( as termed by Farb ) " the good things in life " , such as friendship , manhood , honor and sex .
We do n't know the shape of the discount function in the mind of peasants but , from this description , they seem to be even less worried about the future than we are .
That is , perhaps , a logic consequence of the fact that in a zero growth world the future is just the same as the present .
People living in a future zero growth world will not necessarily live and think as ancient peasants , but surely there is a lot of food for thought here .
I 've been bitching and moaning about battery life for as long as there have been luggables , and I feel like I 've lugged most of them , starting with a 28 - pound Compaq 286 Portable ( aka the sewing machine ) back when I was still a pup , relatively speaking .
In July I wrote about a class - action suit filed against Intel for its -- shall we say " optimistic " ? -- claims of notebook battery life ( " Assault with batteries " ) .
I also detailed my own sorry struggle trying to squeeze more juice out of my portable gear over the years .
Since then I 've heard from a few readers who 've echoed my sentiments .
[ Also on InfoWorld : " Assault with batteries " | Stay up to date on Robert X. Cringely 's musings and observations with InfoWorld 's Notes from the Underground newsletter . ]
M. C. , a professor at a well - known university in the Midwest , says battery life has actually gotten worse over the past 20 years :
The one laptop that I had that actually lived up to its battery life promises was my Zenith 80286 that gave me 6 hours of working time .
I used it to research my thesis and spent an 8 hour day in an archives every day , and would take my notes on the laptop .
It always gave me a full day 's work .
I would plug it in at night and do it all over again the next day .
How I wish that 1987 technology was still with us !
Professional support tech D. S. B. sees a conspiracy afoot , citing the ridiculously high price of replacement batteries ( often 25 percent of the cost of a new notebook ) coupled with their propensity to simply up and die overnight without warning .
To wit :
... about 5 months ago I powered up my Dell Inspiron 6400 laptop and was startled by a warning message that the battery was now dead and needed to be replaced , along with requisite contact information for how I could purchase one from Dell .
Prior to that day , the battery continued to charge and hold a charge as normal .
Granted , again , not as long as new , but certainly acceptable and at least an hour .
Now , all of a sudden , Whap !
The battery would no longer take or accept a charge .
...
There is simply no reason why a previously working battery would all of a sudden drop off the useful list and Dell would be so " helpful " in pushing me toward dropping an exorbitant amount on a replacement .
Call it captive revenue .
On the other hand , Cringe fan S. E. says he 's always gotten close to the advertised amount of juice from his PowerBooks and MacBook Pro ( unless he 's watching a movie , in which case it drops to about 60 percent ) .
So maybe it 's a Windows thing ?
Back in July , I also promised to give the Acer Timeline 3810T a whirl .
The 3810T is a sweet little ultrathin with a sharp 13 - inch screen and a roomy keyboard , yet it weighs just 3.5 pounds .
It also claims to provide at least 8 hours of battery life , thanks to its Intel ultra - low - voltage chips .
At the time , I said if I got 8 -- or even 6 -- hours of battery life , I 'd eat my fedora , washed down by a frosty malted beverage .
Well , my hat is still intact .
Here 's the story .
I 'd originally intended to test the Timeline on my trip to Korea in August .
I opened the notebook at the start of my 14 - hour flight and immediately found myself staring at a 3.5 - pound paperweight .
After working fine for several weeks prior , that battery up and died when I needed it most , just like it did for D. S. B. above .
But the Timeline worked just fine while plugged in , and there happened to be an AC outlet at my seat , so I did n't have to spend my whole trip watching straight - to - video movies while the flight attendants brought me yet another round of soju , which is kind of a cross between sake and rubbing alcohol .
( For the record : Those Korean Airline stews [ video ] are the best in the biz .
Seriously . )
I got a new battery and tried again , this time on a recent 8 - hour flight from Copenhagen .
I used it in power - saving mode , which dimmed the screen but otherwise did n't seem to have much effect on the notebook 's performance , and used it as I normally would : with the Wi-Fi on , running a browser , e-mail , and a word processor .
( There 's no DVD drive , and I did n't watch any downloaded or streaming video . )
I put it to sleep and woke it up as needed .
The good news is that I squeezed more life out of the Timeline 's battery than that of any portable machine I 've ever used .
The bad news is that it did n't come close to giving me 8 hours -- more like a shade under 5 .
Some reviewers , like Laptop Magazine 's Dana Wolman , found the machine to deliver 8 hours on standard tests .
Also , the in - flight movie sucked , and US Airway 's flight crews are n't in the same league as KAL's .
But I digress .
The power management software on that model , on the other hand , is totally insane .
At one point , it assured me I had 177 hours and 42 minutes of battery life remaining .
I 'm not kidding .
When I told Acer about it , I got this response : " We 've seen high estimates before ... but none that high !
Would n't it be great if it were true ?
Gosh , we can only dream . ;)
The lower the battery life , the more accurate [ the meter ] is .
Also , as the system runs more on battery , the more accurate it becomes . "
Switching between " power saver , " " balanced , " and " high performance " had virtually no impact on how much time it guessed I had left at any moment .
In fact , it kept telling me that by choosing power saver , I was n't using the most efficient setting for the battery .
Hello ?
This probably has more to do with Vista being brain dead than a problem with Acer 's technology .
And I probably could have eked out a few more minutes here or there by diving deep into Vista 's power management settings and tweaking them .
But why should you have to do that ?
This got me to thinking , though .
At this point in the evolution of technology , I should be able to get 177 hours and 42 minutes out of a computing device .
If batteries had followed or surpassed Moore 's Law , the way chips and memory and storage and displays have , we'd be there already .
I think some of the problem has to do with how computers are engineered , as well as the deeply inefficient way Windows uses memory and storage .
But there seems to be no fixing that .
Also , I want a jet pack .
I was promised one as a child , and I 'm still waiting .
But I 'll settle for a laptop I can carry with me across the pond and beyond , without having to hunt for a three - pronged outlet every few hours .
What do you long for from tech but cannot seem to get ?
E-mail me : cringe@infoworld.com .
This story , " The 8 - hour Laptop : Do n't Hold Your Breath " was originally published by InfoWorld .
This month saw the publication of the Wired US editor - in - chief Chris Anderson 's latest business book , Free : The Future of a Radical Price , a followup ( of sorts ) to the 2006 bestseller The Long Tail .
I quite enjoyed The Long Tail , a book about the market opportunities created by the plummeting cost of inventory epitomized by the Amazons of the world .
While a traditional bookstore may stock a few thousand titles , Amazon can afford to " stock " ( that is , list ) millions of titles , and when they do so , they discover a remarkable thing : the titles that some bookstores ignored for absence of demand are , in fact , in demand .
Not much demand – a book may sell a copy a year , or twice a decade – but where the cost of supplying that demand is nearly zero ( Amazon 's warehouse space is cheaper than a bookseller 's retail shelf , and many of the books that Amazon sells are directly supplied by their publisher , or , increasingly , printed to order ) , it becomes possible to fulfil that demand .
The Long Tail resonated with me as a reader , a writer and a former bookseller .
As a reader , I knew that the books I loved were often nowhere to be found on the shelves of my local bookshop – not even in the so - called megastores that replaced the miserable mall stores that , in turn , had replaced the charming mom-and - pop stores .
As a writer , I knew that once sales of my books had fallen off from their initial launch , the number of stores that carried them dropped off precipitously .
And as a bookseller I knew that every day saw one or more customers looking for a book that we did n't carry – but always a different book .
But The Long Tail was n't perfect .
One area where I took great exception with its argument was when it came to digitally delivered goods , such as digital music , games and books .
Anderson 's equation looks like this : [ Goods ] / [ Cost of Inventory ] = [ Breadth of Market ] .
As [ Cost of Inventory ] fell , the market got bigger and more vibrant .
It therefore followed that when [ Cost of Inventory ] fell to zero – as with the iTunes store , where the cost of running a store with 1,000,000 songs or 1,000,001 songs is practically speaking the same – the breadth of the market would be explosive .
But as every good programmer knows , dividing a number by zero yields an indeterminate outcome , and therein lay the problem with the hypothesis .
As good as The Long Tail was at describing many kinds of markets , it did n't capture the extraordinary stuff that happened when the marginal cost of goods fell to zero .
For one thing , the cost of excluding people from those goods goes to infinity .
Exclusion costs are a necessary part of any merchant 's pricing model : a small newsagent 's stall can set out piles of newspapers with saucers for coins on top , and use a hawk - eye and the social contract to stop people from walking away without paying .
This lowers the newsagent 's costs and increases his margins .
The cost of excluding people from commercially available digital goods is now infinite ; this is another way of saying : " Any popular song , book , movie , TV show or game will eventually be pirated . "
The only way to prevent this is to go to the impossible step of forcing everyone to trade in their PCs for specialised anti-copying devices , dismantling the internet as you do so .
Failing that , exclusion is a lost cost .
Now , there 's still a big market for non-excludable goods – whether it's the banana that sells at the cafe for eight times what it sells for at the grocer 's next door , or the bottled water that you buy for several thousand times what it would cost you at your kitchen sink .
But these are n't really goods in the way that , say , CDs or books or shirts are goods – they 're services , the service being the convenience of getting them at this particular time with a minimum of hassle and fuss , at a price low enough not to bother about .
Likewise , iTunes sells a lot of music that you can get for free on the internet , so they 're not really selling the music , they 're selling the service of getting the music without having to muck about with P2P software and unsure quality .
Goods markets and service markets have very different characteristics , and The Long Tail 's lessons for digital service providers are necessarily different from the lessons it offers to those who use digital technology to improve the market for physical goods .
When I read The Long Tail , I thought Anderson had either run out of courage or vision when it came to digital information – the courage to consider that the market did n't explain , produce or allocate the signature " product " of the 21st century ; the vision to imagine what businesses centred on the service of " getting information more easily than you can get it elsewhere " might look like .
Enter Free , a book about the latter , but not the former .
Free does a genuinely excellent job of describing the proven and speculative market opportunities that can be built around digital information services , from the musicians who use free downloads to fund paid gigs to the giant search companies that use free search to improve the market for paid advertising .
Some , such as Malcolm Gladwell , have faulted Anderson for failing to be sceptical enough of the businesses enabled by free , pointing out that services such as YouTube lack any sustainable revenue model ( something that Anderson states in Free , contrasting it with its rival Hulu and making some shrewd observations about the potential future for both ) .
Gladwell 's criticisms ring hollow to me , blending a hand - wringing grievance about " theft " of information with special pleading for Gladwell and his fellow journalists .
Which is not to say that Free is perfect .
Indeed , I think it has exactly the same problem as The Long Tail , namely , an unwillingness to consider the wider implications of a world centred on a commodity that can be infinitely reproduced at no marginal cost .
Nowhere is this more evident than in Anderson 's dismissal of the Free Software Foundation founder , Richard Stallman , the original free software hacker who launched the GNU / Linux project that is the forebear of today 's free / open source movement .
Anderson mentions Stallman , dismissing him as " anti-capitalist " .
But this is to miss one of the most important points .
There 's a pretty strong case to be made that " free " has some inherent antipathy to capitalism .
That is , information that can be freely reproduced at no marginal cost may not want , need or benefit from markets as a way of organising them .
And why not ?
There 's plenty in our world that lives outside of the marketplace : it 's a rare family that uses spot-auctions to determine the dinner menu or where to go for holidays .
Who gets which chair and desk at your office is more likely to be determined on the lines of " from each according to his ability , to each according to his need " than on the basis of the infallible wisdom of the marketplace .
The internally socialistic , externally capitalistic character of most of our institutions tells us that there 's something to the idea that markets may not be the solution to all our problems .
And here 's where Free starts to trip up .
Though Anderson celebrates the best of non-commercial and anti-commercial net - culture , from amateur creativity to Freecycle , he also goes through a series of tortured ( and ultimately less than convincing ) exercises to put a dollar value on this activity , to explain the monetary worth of Wikipedia , for example .
And there is certainly some portion of this " free " activity that was created in a bid to join the non-free economy : would - be Hollywood auteurs who hope to be discovered on YouTube , for example .
There 's also plenty of blended free and non-free activity
But for the sizeable fraction of this material – and it is sizeable – that was created with no expectation of joining the monetary economy , with no expectation of winning some future benefit for its author , that was created for joy , or love , or compulsion , or conversation , it is just wrong to say that the " price " of the material is " free " .
The material , is , instead , literally priceless .
It represents a large and increasing segment of our public life that is conducted entirely for reasons outside the marketplace .
Some of the supporting planks may be market - driven ( YouTube 's free hosting ) , other parts are philanthropic ( archive.org 's free hosting ) , or simply so cheap that creators do n't even notice the cost ( any one of the many super - cheap hosting sites ) .
Through most of the history of the industrial era , markets were seen as a fit tool for organising a small piece of human endeavour , while the rest of life – the military , volunteerism , families , public service – were outside the marketplace .
Markets may be good at organising scarce goods , and they may even be good at organising abundant ones , but do abundant goods really need organising ?
Also missing in Free is the frank admission that for many of the practitioners threatened by digital technology , the future is bleak .
For while it is true that Madonna and many other established artists have found a future that embraces copying , there will also be many writers , musicians , actors , directors , game designers and others for whom the internet will probably spell doom .
And for every creator who loses her livelihood because she is unsuited to the digital future , there will be many more intermediaries – editors , executives , salespeople , clerks , engineers , teamsters and printers – who will also be rendered jobless by technology .
It is possible to be compassionate about those peoples ' fortunes – just as it is possible to mourn the passing of mom-and - pop bookstores , the collapse of poetry as a viable commercial concern , the worldwide decline of radio serials , the waning of the knife - sharpening trade , and a million other bygone human activities – while still not apologising for the future .
Anderson paints a rosy picture of free , even noting the gains we all experienced as a result of the creative destruction of travel agents and stockbrokers thanks to Expedia and Etrade , but he fails to clearly and explicitly state something to the effect of : " The information revolution is not painless or bloodless .
Its wrenching changes have and will put those of the industrial revolution to shame .
Much of value will be lost . "
On those lines , Free suffers from the same fate as many other recent business books : it describes a business - climate that no longer exists .
The anecdotes and evidence come largely from the era of the cheap money bubble
Though there is a coda in which Anderson tries to sum up the lessons of Free for the econopocalypse , he fails to note with brutal honesty the fact that both of the free bubbles – dotcom and cheap money – had the side - effect of funding much of free 's underpinnings , first by training millions of slacker undergrads in the basics of HTML and Perl at the expense of insurance - company - funded venture capitalists , and then by subsidising millions of experimental small " free " ventures as an indirect effect of over - capitalised advertisers pursuing a beggar - your - neighbour marketing strategy .
Indeed , there 's something eerily Marxist in this phenomenon , in that it mirrors Marx 's prediction of capitalism 's ability to create a surplus of capacity that can subsequently be freely shared without market forces ' brutality .
I 'm not saying that " free " is communist , or even inherently anti-capitalist .
But to discuss " free " without taking note of the ways in which it both challenges and reinforces non-market ways of living just as much as it does for market - driven ones is to only tell half the story .

A leaked report describes a secret visit by senior Burmese military officers to North Korea last year .
The report includes 182 photos .
The photos show meetings with Gen. Thura Shwe Mann , Burma ’s third - ranked official leader and chief of staff of the armed forces , Chinese Defense Ministry Central Commission member and armed forces Chief of Staff Gen. Chen Bingde , and North Korean Defense Ministry Chief of General Staff Gen. Kim Kyok Sik .
Monroe College was founded in 1933
A New York woman who says she cannot find a job is suing the college where she obtained a bachelor 's degree , the New York Post reports .
Trina Thompson , 27 , filed a lawsuit last week against Monroe College in Bronx Supreme Court .
She is seeking to recover $ 70,000 ( £ 42,000 ) she spent on tuition to get her information technology degree .
Monroe College spokesman Gary Axelbank said Ms Thompson 's lawsuit was " completely without merit " .
This case does not deserve further consideration
Gary Axelbank
Monroe College spokesman
The ex-student , who received her degree in April , says the college 's Office of Career Advancement did not provide her with the leads and career advice it had promised .
" They have not tried hard enough to help me , " she wrote about the college in her lawsuit .
Her mother , Carol , said her daughter was " very angry at her situation " having " put all her faith " in her college .
With her student loans coming due , the family would be saddled with more debt , the graduate 's mother added .
Monroe insists it helps its graduates find jobs .
" The college prides itself on the excellent career - development support that we provide to each of our students , and this case does not deserve further consideration , " its spokesman said .
Over 6,700 Time Lord fans responded to a Doctor Who Magazine call to rate all 200 episodes of the classic sci-fi TV series , and selected 1984's The Caves of Androzani - in which fifth Doctor Peter Davison hung up his sonic screwdriver - as the best of the bunch .
Davison 's finale beat 2007's excellent Blink , with David Tennant , into second spot .
Tom Baker deservedly took third place with 1975 's Genesis of the Daleks .
The Telegraph explains that in The Caves of Androzani , the Doctor and companion Peri " arrive on the planet Androzani Minor , and are soon entangled in a dark plot involving gun-running , drug - smuggling and android duplicates .
" At the climax of the story , dying from poison , the Doctor has to regenerate to save his own life , but saves the life of Peri in the process . "
Davison said of the programme : “ I think you immediately knew when you read the script , that it was a very good Doctor Who story .
It was a Bob Holmes script , and he was one of the writers that you dreamed of having on Doctor Who . ”
The full 200 - episode league table appears in Doctor Who Magazine # 413 , out today .
The top ten are :
The Caves of Androzani ( 1984 - Peter Davison ) Blink ( 2007 - David Tennant ) Genesis of the Daleks ( 1975 - Tom Baker ) The Talons of Weng - Chiang ( 1977 - Tom Baker ) The Empty Child ( 2005 - Christopher Eccleston ) Human Nature ( 2007 - David Tennant ) Pyramids of Mars ( 1975 - Tom Baker ) City of Death ( 1979 - Tom Baker ) The Robots of Death ( 1977 - Tom Baker ) Bad Wolf ( 2005 - Christopher Eccleston )

ANCR : This is a Public Forum .
Our topic today is the health care crisis .
( phone rings )
What luck !
Our first caller is a lobbyist for health insurers !
You ’re on the air .
CALLER : ( bombastic voice )
What health care crisis ?
We have the most profitable health care industry in the world .
At a time GM is bankrupt and millions of people are losing their jobs , our profits are up 400 percent !
( wheeze , snort ) .
We ca n’t hire enough clerks to weed out sick people or deny claims !
( laugh , snort ) .
Just the other night we had a big party honoring a true healthcare visionary -- the guy who came up with ... pre-existing conditions !
Sure , Obama won the election .
He has the people , but we have the Congress .
So long as we have Republicans and corporate Democrats , nothing is gonna change .
( laugh , snort )
Is this some wonderful country or not ?
ANNCR : In his next town hall meeting ,
we need to ask Senator Kent Conrad to explain why he has quality health care and YOU do n’t !
What your constituents want to know , Senator Conrad , is ... which side are you on ?
Stay tuned .
A message from the Sheet Metal Workers ’ International Association and over 2 million working families throughout the United States .
The ads focus on Senators Chuck Grassley ( IA ) , Max Baucus ( MT ) , Kent Conrad ( ND ) , and Blanche Lincoln ( AR ) .
The Sheet Metal Workers International Association ( SMWIA ) and a coalition of Unions representing almost 2 million workers are planning to run these ads through the end of Congress 's August recess .
The SMWIA is diverting the political funds it would regularly use for donations to purchase time for these ads , rather than to padding the campaign coffers of the Democrats targeted in them .
The Union suspended all financial and intangible campaign donations to political candidates to focus on efforts to pass real health care and labor law reform .
Other Unions are considering similar action .
These ads are part of an effort to cut through the noise and highlight the truth about the broken healthcare system the insurance industry , Republicans in Congress and some Democrats are fighting to protect .
According to SMWIA President Michael Sullivan , " it is imperative that these Senators serve the American people and not an industry which has thrown millions of Americans into debt and ruin while reaping a 450 percent surge in profits over the last ten years . "
The ads are the beginning of a grassroots effort on the part of several Unions to pressure wayward Democrats in the House and Senate to pass real comprehensive health care reform .
The Racetrack is a unique attraction of Death Valley National Park that not many park visitors get to see .
It 's a dry lakebed in a very remote and beautiful area .
On the north end of the lakebed is a rock formation known as the grandstand .
Rocks from the grandstand and other nearby formations break off and fall onto the lake .
There , they perform feats that make this remote playa world - famous .
They move !
But after all these years , a hundred or more since this phenomenon was brought to the attention of naturalists studying Death Valley , no one has ever seen them move .
These rocks are n't boulders ; most are perhaps a foot or so tall , but can still weigh a lot and are not easy to lift .
( Please do n't try - leave the rocks in place for others to enjoy . )
The evidence that they move is the trails they leave behind them as they scoot around the lake .
You 'll find a rock sitting innocently anywhere on the playa -- from next to the grandstand but mostly at the far southern edge -- and behind it will be a trail , from the rock sliding across the fine clay surface of the lakebed .
When this phenomenon was discovered around 1900 , observers speculated that magnetic forces were the cause .
Now , however , scientists believe they have solved the mystery of this movement .
It occurs , they believe , when there 's been enough rain to wet down the lakebed , then a strong wind -- as much as 70 miles per hour in this area -- blows the rocks around .
The surface of the lake is a fine clay that becomes extremely slick when wet .
But since no one has yet seen them move , this is still just a theory .
The Racetrack is located beyond Ubehebe Crater , which is southwest of Scotty 's Castle of Scotty 's Castle .
Getting there involves a long drive down a severely washboaded dirt road - OK in a passenger car in good conditions , but with a notorious reputation for shredding tires .
A more interesting approach is via the Lippincott Mine Road from Saline Valley .
Strictly 4wd , and exciting , but not too serious unless there have been recent washouts .

Introduction
Have you ever wondered how regular expressions work in detail ?
If the answer is yes , this article is right for you .
I will try to guide you step by step on how to create your own mini regular expression library .
The purpose of the article is NOT to give you a highly optimized , tested , and great regular expression library , but to explain the principles behind the pattern matching in text files .
If you only want a good library and do n't care how it works , you probably want boost the regex library , which you can find here .
I used a couple of different regular expression libraries but I must say that I am happiest with boost regex .
Obviously , you decide for yourself .
There is another regular expressions article that could be found here .
I must admit I did not read the article completely , but it seems to me that the article focuses mostly on how to use a regular expression library provided by the author .
In this article , the author uses a similar technique ( I could be wrong , though ) to create a more sophisticated library .
The aticle you are reading right now could be seen as a prerequisite for the article I just mentioned above .
Regular expressions are part of the MS.NET library or Java SDK ( if you write code in Java ) .
As you can see , regular expressions are available in many different programming languages and technologies .
Actually , the article does not focus on writing the library in a specific language .
I wrote the code in C++ , using STL primarily because it is my favorite language / library , but the principles from the article could be applied to any language ( obviously ) .
I will try to be as language independent as possible using pseudo code wherever possible .
If you want the code in Java , please send me an e-mail .
The code provided in this article is free ( obviously ) , but if you like it and use it in your application , it would be great if you would give me the credit for what I deserve .
Also please e-mail me , so I can show off to my peers and / or potential employers .
Overview
So , how are we going to do it ?
Well , before we start with coding , it is necessary to explain the mathematical background needed to fully understand the method used in this article .
I would strongly recommend reading and understanding the math behind , because once we overcome the math part , the rest will be very simple .
Note , however , that I will not have any mathematical proofs .
If you are interested in proofs , please check out the references , which could be found in References section of this article .
Additionally , note that the regular expression parser , which we will create here , will support these three operations :
Kleen Closure or Star operator ( " * " )
Concatenation ( for example : " ab " ) Union operator ( denoted with character " | " )
However , many additional operators can be simulated by combining these three operators .
For instance :
A+ = AA * ( At least one A ) [ 0 - 9 ] = ( 0 |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9 ) [ A - Z ] = ( A| B |...|Z ) , etc .
The reason for implementing only three operators is simplicity .
When I started planning to write this article , I quickly recognized that I had to limit myself in many ways .
The topic is so large that it would require a book to explain every little detail ( maybe I write it someday ) .
As I stated above , the purpose of the article is not to equip you with a library but to introduce you to principles behind regular expressions .
If you want to know more on how to use the regular expressions , you can check out the book Mastering Regular Expressions , published by O'Reilly .
Following is the overview of the article :
NFA stands for nondeterministic finite - state automata .
NFA can be seen as a special kind of final state machines , which are in a sense an abstract model of a machine with a primitive internal memory .
If you want to know more about finite - state machines , please refer to the references below .
Let us look at the mathematical definition of NFA .
An NFA A consists of :
A finite set I of input symbols A finite set S of states A next - state function f from SxI into P( S ) A subset Q of S of accepting states
An initial state s0 from S
denoted as A ( I , S , f , Q , s0 )
If we explained the above definition to a 12 year old , we could say that an NFA is set S of states that are connected by function f ( maybe to a smarter 12 year old ) .
NFAs are represented in two formats : Table and Graph .
For example , let us look at the table representation :
Input States a b c d epsilon s0 s1,s3 s1 { s2} { s2} s3 s4,s5 s4 { s6} s5 { s7} { s6} {s7}
And an equivalent graph would be :
Looking at the table / graph above , we can see that there are special transitions called epsilon transitions , which is one of the special features of NFA .
A transition is the event of going from one state to another .
Epsilon transition is the transition from one state to another on an empty string .
In other words , we are going from one state to another on no character input .
For example , as we can see from table / graph above , we can go on no input from s3 to s4 and s5 , which means that we have a choice .
Similarly , there is a choice to go from state s0 to states s1 or s3 on character input " a " .
Hence the name nondeterministic , because at some point the path , which we are able to go is not unique but we have a choice .
The final and accepting states are drawn double circled ( or enclosed in " {} " in the table ) , as in , for example , s6 .
Once one of these states is reached , we have an accepting state , and hence an accepting character string .
In an NFA , like the mathematical definition defines , there is always a starting state .
I used Graphvis , a great tool for drawing different kinds of graphs ( see References ) , for drawing NFAs and DFAs ( see later ) .
Because Graphvis is laying out the nodes of a graph on its own , it seems to me that a starting state is always the state drawn at the top of the graph .
So , we will follow that convention .
DFA stands for deterministic finite state automata .
A DFA is very closely related to an NFA .
As a matter of fact , the mathematical definition of NFA works for DFA , too .
But , obviously there are diferences , from which we will take advantage .
One big difference is that in a DFA there are no epsilon transitions .
Additionally , for each state all transitions leading away from this state are done on a different input character .
In other words , if we are in state s , then on input character a , there is unique transition on that character from s. Additionally , in a DFA , all states must have a valid transition on an input character .
The input character here is finite set I of input symbols ( as in the mathematical definition ) .
For example , in the above graph ( under DFA ) , the set of symbols I would be {a , b , c , d} .
Now that we understand NFAs and DFAs , we can proceed by saying that , given any NFA , there is an equivalent DFA .
( You are going to have to trust me on this because I do n't think it is appropriate to give you the mathematical proof of this statement . )
As humans , generally it is easier for us to construct an NFA , as well as interpret what language an NFA accepts .
But , why do we need the DFAs , then ?
Well , if we think about computers , it is very hard to " teach " them to do very well educated guesses ( sometimes even we can't make smart educated guesses ) .
And this is exactly what the computer needs to do when traversing an NFA .
If we would write an algorithm that would use an NFA to check for accepting a combination of characters , it would involve backtracking to check for choices that it did not make previously .
Obviously , there are regular expression parsers that work using NFAs , but they are generally slower than those that use DFAs .
This is due to the fact that a DFA has a unique path for each accepting string , so no backtracking is involved .
Hence , we are going to use a DFA to check whether a combination of input characters is accepted by automata .
Note :
If you really want to understand both NFAs and DFAs , I would recommend that you do further reading on these topics .
It is useful as an excerise to convert from one to another , to fully understand the difference and the algorithm used here to convert an NFA to a DFA ( see later ) .
Now that we have all the mathematical background that we need to understand regular expressions , we need to start thinking about what our goal is .
As a first step , we realize that we need a way of going from a regular expression ( such as " ab * ( a|b ) * " ) to a data structure that will be easy to manipulate and use for pattern matching .
But , let us first look at the method for converting a regular expression to an NFA .
Probably the most famous algorithm for doing this conversion is Thompson 's algorithm .
This algorithm is not most efficient , but it ensures that any regular expression ( assuming that its syntax is correct ) will be successfully converted to an NFA .
With the help of the basic NFA as seen from figure below , we can construct any other :
Using the basic element above , we will construct three operations , which we would like to implement in our regular expression parser , as in the following :
But , how do we go from something like " ( a|b ) * ab " to the graph above ?
If we consider what we really need to do , we can see that evaluating regular expressions is similar to evaluating the arithmetic expressions .
For example , if we want to evaluate R=A + B * C - D , we could do it like this :
PUSH A
PUSH B
PUSH C
MUL
ADD
PUSH D
SUB
POP R
Here , PUSH and POP are stacks and MUL , ADD , and SUB take two operands from the stack and do the corresponding operation .
We could use this knowledge for constructing an NFA from a regular expression .
Let 's look at the sequence of operations that need to be performed to construct an NFA from the regular expression ( a|b ) * cd :
PUSH a
PUSH b
UNION
STAR
PUSH c
CONCAT
PUSH d
CONCAT
POP R
As we can see , it is very similar to the evaluation of the arithmetic expressions .
The difference is that , in regular expressions , the star operation pops only one element from the stack and evaluates the star operator .
Additionally , the concatenation operation is not denoted by any symbol , so we would have to detect it .
The code provided with the article simplifies the problem by pre-processing the regular expression and inserting a character ASCII Code 0x8 when ever a concatenation is detected .
Obviously , it is possible to do this " on the fly , " during the evaluation of regular expression , but I wanted to simplify the evaluation as much as possible .
The pre-processing does nothing else but detect a combination of symbols that would result in concatenation , as in , for example : " ab " , " a ( " , " ) a " , " * a " , " * ( " , " ) ( " .
PUSH and POP operations actually work with the stack of simple NFA objects .
If we would PUSH symbol " a " on the stack , the operation would create two state objects on the heap and create a transition object on symbol " a " from state 1 to state 2 .
Here is the portion of the code that pushes a character on the stack :
void CAG_RegEx:: Push ( char chInput ) { CAG_State * s0 = new CAG_State(++m_nNextStateID ) ; CAG_State * s1 = new CAG_State(++m_nNextStateID ) ; s0->AddTransition( chInput , s1 ) ; FSA_TABLE NFATable ; NFATable.push_back(s0 ) ; NFATable.push_back(s1 ) ; m_OperandStack.push ( NFATable ) ; m_InputSet.insert(chInput ) ; }
As we can see , the character is converted to a simple NFA ; then , the resulting NFA is added to the stack .
CAG_State class is a simple class that helps us structure the an NFA as we need it .
It contains an array of transitions to other states on specific characters .
Epsilon transition is a transition on character 0x0 .
At this point , it is easy to see the structure behind NFA .
An NFA ( and DFA ) is stored as a sequence of states ( deque of CAG_State pointers ) .
Each state has as a member all the transitions stored in a multimap .
A transition is nothing else than mapping from a character to a state ( CAG_State * ) .
For detailed definition of the CAG_State class , please refer to the code .
Now , back to the conversion from a regular expression to the NFA .
Now that we know how to push the NFA onto the stack , the pop operation is trivial .
Just retrive the NFA from the stack and that 's it .
As I said earlier , an NFA table is defined to be a double - ended queue ( STL container deque < CAG_State * > ) .
In this way , we know that the first state in the array is always the starting state , while the last state is the final / accepting state .
By preserving this order , we can quickly get the first and last states as well as append and prepend additional states when performing operations ( such as the Star operator ) .
Here is the code to evaulate each individual operation :
BOOL CAG_RegEx::Concat ( ) { FSA_TABLE A , B ; if (!
Pop ( B ) || ! Pop ( A ) ) return FALSE ; A[ A.size ( ) - 1]-> AddTransition ( 0 , B [ 0 ] ) ; A.insert ( A.end ( ) , B.begin ( ) , B.end ( ) ) ; m_OperandStack.push ( A ) ; return TRUE ; }
As we can see , the concatenation is popping two NFAs from the stack .
The first NFA is changed , so that it is now a new NFA , which is then pushed on the stack .
Note that we first pop the second operand .
This is the case because in regular expressions the order of operands is of importance because AB != BA ( not commutative ) .
BOOL CAG_RegEx ::Star ( ) { FSA_TABLE A , B ; if (! Pop ( A ) ) return FALSE ; CAG_State * pStartState = new CAG_State(++m_nNextStateID ) ; CAG_State * pEndState = new CAG_State(++m_nNextStateID ) ; pStartState -> AddTransition ( 0 , pEndState ) ; pStartState -> AddTransition ( 0 , A [ 0 ] ) ; A[ A.size ( ) - 1]-> AddTransition ( 0 , pEndState ) ; A[ A.size ( ) - 1]-> AddTransition ( 0 , A [ 0 ] ) ; A.push_back ( pEndState ) ; A.push_front ( pStartState ) ; m_OperandStack.push ( A ) ; return TRUE ; }
A star operator pops a single element from the stack , changes it according to Thompson 's rule ( see above ) , and then pushes it on the stack .
BOOL CAG_RegEx::Union ( ) { FSA_TABLE A , B ; if (!
Pop ( B ) || ! Pop ( A ) ) return FALSE ; CAG_State * pStartState = new CAG_State(++m_nNextStateID ) ; CAG_State * pEndState = new CAG_State(++m_nNextStateID ) ; pStartState -> AddTransition ( 0 , A[ 0 ] ) ; pStartState -> AddTransition ( 0 , B [ 0 ] ) ; A[ A.size ( ) - 1]-> AddTransition ( 0 , pEndState ) ; B[ B.size ( ) - 1]-> AddTransition( 0 , pEndState ) ; B.push_back ( pEndState ) ; A.push_front ( pStartState ) ; A.insert ( A.end ( ) , B.begin ( ) , B.end ( ) ) ; m_OperandStack.push ( A ) ; return TRUE ; }
The union pops two elements , makes the transformation , and pushes the result on the stack .
Note that here to we have to watch for the order of the operation .
Finally , we are now able to evaulate the regular expression .
If everything goes well , we will have a single NFA on the stack , which will be our resulting NFA .
Here is the code , which utilizes the functions above .
BOOL CAG_RegEx::CreateNFA ( string strRegEx ) { strRegEx = ConcatExpand( strRegEx ) ; for ( int i=0 ; i< strRegEx.size ( ) ; ++i ) { char c = strRegEx[i ] ; if ( IsInput ( c ) ) Push (c ) ; else if ( m_OperatorStack.empty ( ) ) m_OperatorStack.push(c ) ; else if ( IsLeftParanthesis ( c ) ) m_OperatorStack.push(c ) ; else if ( IsRightParanthesis ( c ) ) { while (!
IsLeftParanthesis( m_OperatorStack.top ( ) ) ) if (!
Eval ( ) ) return FALSE ; m_OperatorStack.pop ( ) ; } else { while (!m_OperatorStack.empty ( ) && Presedence ( c , m_OperatorStack.top ( ) ) ) if (!
Eval ( ) ) return FALSE ; m_OperatorStack.push(c ) ; } } while (!m_OperatorStack.empty ( ) ) if (!
Eval ( ) ) return FALSE ; if (! Pop( m_NFATable ) ) return FALSE ; m_NFATable[m_NFATable.size( ) -1]->m_bAcceptingState = TRUE ; return TRUE ; }
Function Eval is actually evaluating the next operator on the stack .
Function Eval ( ) pops the next operator from the operator stack ; and , using the switch statement , it determines which operation to use .
Parantheses are treated as operators , too , because they determine the order of evaluation .
The function Presedence ( char Left , char Right ) determines the precedence of two operators and returns TRUE if precedence of the Left operator <= precedence of the Right operator .
Please check out the code for the implementation .
Now that we know how to convert any regular expression to an NFA , the next step is to convert an NFA to a DFA .
At first , this process seems to be very challenging .
We have a graph with zero or more epsilon transitions , and multiple transitions on a single character , and we need an equivalent graph with no epsilon transitions and unique path for each accepted sequence of input characters .
Like I said , it seems to be very challanging , but it really is not .
Mathematicians have actually solved that problem for us already , and then using the results , computer scientists created the Subset Construction Algorithm .
I am not sure who to give credit here , but the Subset Construction Algorithm goes like this :
First , let us define two functions :
Epsilon Closure :
This function takes as a parameter a set of states T and returns again a set of states containing all those states that can be reached from each individual state of the given set T on epsilon transition .
Move :
Move takes a set of states T and input character a and returns all the states that can be reached on a given input character from all states in T .
Now , using these two functions , we can perform the transformation :
The start state of the DFA is created by taking the epsilon closure of the start state of the NFA .
For each new DFA state , perform following for each input character : Perform a move to the newly created state .
Create a new state by taking the epsilon closure of the result ( i ) .
Note that here we could get a state that is already present in our set .
This will result in a set of states that will form new DFA state .
Note that here , from one or many NFA states , we are constructing a single DFA state .
For each newly created state , perform Step 2 .
Accepting states of DFA are all those states that contain at least one of the accepting states from the NFA .
Keep in mind that here we are constructing a single DFA state from one or many NFA states .
Simple enough ?
If not , read further .
Following is the pseudo code found on the pages 118 - 121 of the book Compilers — Principles , Techniques and Tools by Aho , Sethi , and Ullman .
The algorithm below is equivalent to the algorithm above but expressed in a different way .
First , let 's define the epsilon closure function :
S EpsilonClosure ( T ) { push all states in T onto the stack initialize result to T while stack is not empty { pop t from the stack for each state u with an edge from t to u labeled epsilon { if u is not in EpsilonClosure ( T ) { add u to result push u onto the stack } } } return result }
Basically , what this function does is go through all the states in T and checks what other states can be reached from these on no input .
Note that each state can reach at least one state on no input , namely itself .
Then , the function goes through all these resulting states and checks for further transitions on no input .
For example , let us look at the following :
If we would call an epsilon transition on a set of states { s0 , s2} , the resulting states would be {s0, s2,s1,s3} .
This is because from s0 we can reach s1 on no input , but from s1 we can reach s3 on no input , so from s1 we can reach s3 on no input .
Now that we know how the epsilon transition works , let us look at the pseude code to transform an NFA to a DFA :
D- States = EpsilonClosure ( NFA
Start State ) and it is unmarked while there are any unmarked states in D - States { mark T for each input symbol a { U = EpsilonClosure ( Move( T , a ) ) ; if U is not in D - States { add U as an unmarked state to D - States } DTran [ T,a ] = U } }
Finally , the DTran is the DFA table , equivalent to an NFA .
Before we go to the next step , let us convert an NFA to a DFA by hand using this process .
If you want to master this process , I would strongly suggest that you perform more similar transformations using this method .
Let 's convert following NFA to the corresponding DFA by using a subset construction algorithm :
Using the subset construction algorithm , we would do following .
( Each newly created state will be bolded : )
Create a start state of a DFA by taking the epsilon closure of the start state of the NFA .
This step produces the set of states : { s1,s2,s4} Perform Move ( 'a ' , { s1,s2,s4} ) , which results in set : { s3,s4} Perform EpsilonTransition ( {s3,s4} ) , which creates a new DFA state : { s3,s4} Perform Move ( 'b ' , { s1,s2,s4} ) , which results in set : { s5} Perform EpsilonTransition ( {s5} ) , which creates new DFA state : { s5} NOTE :
Here we must record two new DFA states { s3,s4} and {s5} , together with a DFA strting state { s1,s2,s4} .
Also , we must record a transition on character ' a ' from { s1 , s2,s4} to { s3,s4} and on character b from { s1 , s2,s4} to { s5} .
Perform Move ( 'a ' , { s3,s4} ) , which returns : { s4} Perform EpsilonTransition ( {s4} ) , with result : { s4} Perform Move ( 'b ' , { s3,s4} ) , which results in set : { s3,s5} Perform EpsilonTransition ( { s3,s5} ) with result : { s3,s5} { s3,s4} ->{s4} on ' a ' { s3,s4} ->{ s3,s5} on ' b ' Perform Move ( 'a ' , { s5} ) , which returns an empty set so we do n't need to check epsilon transitions Perform Move ( 'b ' , { s5} ) , which returns an empty set , so forget it .
Perform Move ( 'a ' , { s4} ) , which returns : { s4} .
But , this is NOT a new state , so forget it .
However , we must record the transition : { s4} ->{s4} on ' a' Perform Move ( 'b ' , { s4} ) which returns : { s5} Perform EpsilonTransition ( {s5} ) which returns : { s5} ( not new , but we must record the transition ) { s4} ->{s5} on ' b ' Perform Move ( 'a ' , { s3,s5} ) which returns an empty set , so forget it .
Perform Move ( 'b ' , { s3,s5} ) which produces : { s3} EpsilonTransition ( {s3} ) produces : { s3} a NEW DFA state { s3,s5} ->{ s3 } on ' b ' Move ( 'a ' , { s3} ) is an empty set Move ( 'b ' , { s3} ) is { s3 } which is not new , but the transition must be recorded !
{ s3} ->{s3} on 'b '
There are no new states , so we are done .
Following is the drawing of the DFA :
The starting state is { s1 , s2,s4} , because that is EpsilonClosure ( Starting state of NFA ) .
The Accepting states are {s5} , { s3,s4} , and {s3,s5} because they contain s3 and / or s5 , which are accepting states of NFA .
Now that we have all the knowledge to convert a regular expression into an NFA and then convert NFA to an equivalent DFA , we actually could stop at this point and use it for patterns matching .
Originally , when I planned to write this article , in order to keep it as simple as possible showing only principles , DFA optimization was not taken into account .
But then , it occurred to me that , first of all , for large regular expressions we are creating very large NFAs ( by the nature of Thompson 's algorithm ) , which in turn occasionaly creates complex DFAs .
If we were to search for patterns , this might slow us down considerably , so I decided to include the optimization as a part of the regular expression parser .
The optimization here is not a complicated one .
So , let 's look at the following example :
Click here for a larger image .
If we look at this DFA , we notice that state 3 is first of all not a final state .
Additionally , we notice that there are no outgoing edges from this state except for the loop .
In other words , once we get into state 3 , there is no chance to get to an accepting state .
This is due to the fact that a DFA , besides the fact that it has a unique path for each accepting string and does not contain the epsilon transitions , it also must have a transition on all input characters from a particular state .
( Here , the " all input characters " means the set of possibly accepting input characters .
For example , in a|b|c , the set of input characters here is {a , b, c} ) .
Here is where we abuse the math a little bit to make a DFA simpler .
By deleting state 3 , our DFA becomes simpler , and it still accepts same set of patterns .
In this case , our DFA is not anymore exactly a DFA .
If you are asking yourself why this is important , the answer is :
It is not !
At least for us !
We will use this very basic optimization mechanism to delete all the states with such characterisitcs and so we will obtain a smaller and compacter DFA for pattern maching .
To summarize , we will delete states ( and all transitions leading to these states from other states ) with the following characteristics :
State is not accepting state State does not have any transitions to any other different state
So , the result is the following :
The DFA above definitly seems to be smaller than the the previous one .
I will still call this a DFA , despite the fact that it is not really a DFA .
Finally , we are ready to use all of the parts from above to mach some text patterns .
Once we have the DFA , all we need to do is to take an input character and run it against the starting state .
Here is the pseudo code to do that :
Find ( string s ) { for each character c in s { for each active state s { if there is transition from s on c { go to the next state t if t is accepting state { record the pattern } mark t as active } mark s as inactive } if there is transition from starting state on c { go to the next state s if s is accepting state { record the pattern } mark s as active } } }
The code above can be found in the Find ( ... ) function of the regular expression class .
To keep track of active states , I use a linked list , so I can quickly add and delete states that are active / inactive respectivly .
After all the charcters are processed , all results are stored in a vector that contains pattern matches .
By using the functions FindFirst ( ... ) and FindNext ( ... ) , you can traverse trough the results .
Please refer to the documentation of the CAG_RegEx class for information on how to use the class .
Also , at this point I have to stress that the demo program loads a complete file into a rich edit control and then , when the searching is done , it stores it into a string , passing it as an argument to the Find First function .
Depending on your RAM size , I would avoid loading huge files because it could take a lot of time to copy the data from one string to another , because of use of virtual memory .
Like I said earlier , the program is designed to show the principle behind pattern matching in text files .
Depending on time , future releases might incorporate more complete regular expression parser that searches through the files of any size and delivers the results in different ways .
At this point , for the completness of the article , I must note that there is a way of converting a regular expression directly into a DFA .
This method is not explained here yet , but if the time permits , it will be in future articles ( or article updates ) .
Well , that 's it !
I hope you enjoyed reading the article as much as I enjoyed writing it .
Please use the demo code in any kind of applications , but give me the credit where deserved .
If you want to build a more complete library using the demo code presented here , please send me a copy of your additions .
Note : The class CAG_RegEx contains two functions — SaveDFATable ( ) and SaveNFATable — that in debug mode save the NFA and DFA to " c:\NFATable.txt " and " c:\DFATable.txt " respectivly .
As the names already reveal , these are NFA and DFA tables .
Additionally , the class has functions SaveNFAGraph ( ) and SaveDFAGraph ( ) , which in debug mode create two files " c:\NFAGraph.dot " and " c:\DFAGraph.dot " .
These files are simple text files , contining the instructions for drawing these graphs using Graphviz ( Check out Reference 4 below ) .

( NYC marijuana law chart from NORML )
An article in Cannabis News by Harry G. Levine , a professor of sociology at Queens College , City University of New York , explains why New York City is the " marijuana arrest capital of the world . "
The law states that possessing a small amount of pot results in $ 100 civil citation for the first offense .
Yet 40,300 people were arrested and jailed in NYC last year for possessing small amounts of pot .
How so ?
By trickery on the part of the NYPD .
Police officers convince people to pull their stash out of their pocket , promising to go easy on them if they do , then bust them on charges of having marijuana " open to public view , " which means they can be handcuffed , fingerprinted , and jailed on a misdemeanor charge .
( As you might expect , racial profiling figures heavily into the arrests . )

For the last couple of weeks I ’ve been doing some Java development using NetBeans and every couple of days my checked out copy of the project dies on me .
I was getting very frustrated because each time it happened I had to check out an older revision to a new directory , then export the corrupted one into and from there I could check it in .
This was not only time consuming but a very messy solution which had the potential mess up my repository .
Yet after going through all this work I would again be presented with the following error :
“ This client is too old to work with the working copy “ C:\path\to \repository . ”
You need to get a newer Subversion client , or downgrade this working copy .
See http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#working-copy-format-change for details . ”
This error was somewhat misleading , as the site it provided did n’t offer me any insight as to why it was happening .
I had the newest version of TortoiseSVN and the error was n’t happening with any of my Visual Basic or PHP projects , just the Java project .
Eventually it dawned on me what was causing this .
NetBeans IDE has built in support for Subversion which uses the CollabNet Subversion client .
When I was working within the NetBeans IDE the CollabNet client was working behind the scenes and changing files within the .svn folder on my system .
When the time came for me to check in my changes through TortoiseSVN I would get the not so helpful error message .
After a quick Google search I found the solution on the NetBeans Forums .
In the NetBeans IDE go to Tools - > Plugins then under the Installed tab check Subversion and hit Uninstall .
The plugin will be removed and you will be prompted to restart the IDE .
Australian and UK researchers have used high - speed photography to reveal the complex nature of insect flight .
The research , published in today 's edition of Science , puts scientists one step closer to creating mini robotic aircraft .
Dr John Young , an aeronautical engineer and lead researcher at the University of New South Wales , says small flying insects are the best place to learn how to make small robotic aircrafts .
" Their wings have been optimised over hundreds of years [ of ] evolutionary pressures , " he said .
Dr Young says fixed wings , like those on aeroplanes , become very inefficient in tiny robotic planes .
" People are now looking at flapping wings as an alternative structure , " he said .
Efficient flyers
Dr Young says he and his colleagues from the University of Oxford decided to study locusts because they are very efficient flyers .
" They can fly for a very long time , over very long distances with very little energy , " he said .
He says their aim was to understand what they were doing and use some of their tricks to build small robotic aircrafts .
Dr Young says the team started their experiments by videoing the locusts flying in a wind tunnel .
He says the locusts ' wing motion could be calculated from multiple angles .
Dr Young then used this data in a computer simulation to understand the locust 's aerodynamics .
" I looked at the forces the wings generated , what lift and power it took to make the wings flap , " he said .
" The locust is using the bending and the folding of its wings to control its aerodynamics in a very efficient way . "
Computer manipulation
Dr Young then used the computer simulation to modify the wings and study the effects .
" I wanted to find out what would be the results if the wings were slightly different , if they did n't have all the veins and corrugation , " he said .
One of the modifications was to make the wings flatter , something engineers would find easier to build .
But Dr Young says the simulations showed that flatter wings are not as efficient .
" The results show that if you want to model the insect you have to get as much detail as you can and build wings that do most of what the insect wings do , " he said .
Dr Young says they would now like to use their findings to build their own small robotic aircraft .
He says defence forces around the world have shown a lot of interest in the technology .
According to Dr Young , small robotic aircraft could be used to fly " anywhere you do n't want to send people , but need to navigate a complex environment " , such as a collapsed building or flood region .

Richard Poncher , a onetime Beverly Hills resident who died 23 years ago at age 81 , will be moving out of the crypt above Marilyn Monroe 's resting spot at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park cemetery in Los Angeles .
Poncher 's wife intends to sell the crypt , said to have once been owned by Monroe 's former husband , Yankee great Joe DiMaggio .
So while the plaque on Poncher 's crypt reads : " To the man who gave us everything and more , " his wife Elsie is hoping he has just a little more to give .
She wants to use the money to help pay off the $ 1.6 million mortgage on her 1¾ - acre Beverly Hills home .
" I can't be more honest than that , " she says .
" I want to leave it free and clear for my kids . "
Elsie Poncher plans to start the bidding at $ 500,000 when she places the crypt on eBay , making it -- per square foot -- one of the most expensive pieces of real estate on the market .
Richard Poncher was a serial entrepreneur , to hear his wife tell it , who made a fortune with a variety of electronics firms and once sold surplus U.S. Army airplanes and parts .
She claims he built two bulletproof cars for Al Capone and owned 12 Rolls Royces in his lifetime .
" He was n't afraid to tackle anything , " Elsie Poncher says .
" Besides that , he was a helluva nice guy . "
She says her husband bought the crypt -- two of them , in fact -- from DiMaggio during the former ballplayer 's 1954 divorce from Monroe .
She is n't sure how her husband knew DiMaggio .
" He knew a lot of people , " she says with a wave of the hand .
Wearing gray sweats and with long , pink fingernails , she admits to being in her 70s but is quick to add , " I do 20 laps in the pool every day . "
She says when she sells the crypt , she 'll put her husband 's remains in the one reserved for her , and when her time comes , she 'll be cremated .
Following the launch of two new e-ink based digital book readers earlier this month , Sony today announced a new eBook reader with a wireless connection - something that 's been notably lacking in their eReader lineup .
The Reader Daily Edition has a 7 - inch touchscreen and connects wirelessly via AT&T 's 3G cellular network , but there 's a catch - with no built - in web browser , the only connection the device will be making is to the Sony eBook store .
However , one other notable addition to the eBook store itself is about to make that connection a lot more valuable .
In partnership with thousands of public libraries and Overdrive.com , Sony Readers will be able to use a new free library finder service that allows you to check out digital ebooks and other content from your local public library .
There are some DRM - like restrictions in terms of license expirations after certain time periods ( 14 - 29 days depending on your local library 's regulations ) , but overall the service offers something new and welcome to the digital book market .
Combined with the wirelessly - connecting Reader Daily Edition , the new Sony ecosystem will offer a free digital library on demand - giving it a unique edge over its rival and industry - leading Amazon Kindle .
The existing Sony Reader lineup without wireless connectivity will be able to check out library ebooks as well - first via PC , followed by a transfer to the device .
The new Reader Daily Edition launches this December for $ 399 , with the 3G service included for free ( i.e. no pesky subscription cost ) .
Would you consider picking one up ?
Or do either of the other new Pocket Reader or Touch Reader devices catch your eye in combination with the new library service ?

In this July 20 , 1969 photo provided by NASA and taken by Lt. Michael Collins through the window of the lunar command module , the Apollo 11 lunar module decends to the surface of the moon carrying astronauts Neil Armstong and Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  NASA could put a man on the moon but did n't have the sense to keep the original video of the live TV transmission .
In an embarrassing acknowledgment , the space agency said Thursday that it must have erased the Apollo 11 moon footage years ago so that it could reuse the videotape .
But now Hollywood is coming to the rescue .
The studio wizards who restored " Casablanca " are digitally sharpening and cleaning up the ghostly , grainy footage of the moon landing , making it even better than what TV viewers saw on July 20 , 1969 .
They are doing it by working from four copies that NASA scrounged from around the world .
" There 's nothing being created ; there 's nothing being manufactured , " said NASA senior engineer Dick Nafzger , who is in charge of the project .
" You can now see the detail that 's coming out . "
The first batch of restored footage was released just in time for the 40th anniversary of the " one giant leap for mankind , " and some of the details seem new because of their sharpness .
Originally , astronaut Neil Armstrong 's face visor was too fuzzy to be seen clearly .
The upgraded video of Earth 's first moonwalker shows the visor and a reflection in it .
The $ 230,000 refurbishing effort is only three weeks into a monthslong project , and only 40 % of the work has been done .
But it does show improvements in four snippets : Armstrong walking down the ladder ; Buzz Aldrin following him ; the two astronauts reading a plaque they left on the moon ; and the planting of the flag on the lunar surface .
Nafzger said a huge search that began three years ago for the old moon tapes led to the " inescapable conclusion " that 45 tapes of Apollo 11 video were erased and reused .
His report on that will come out in a few weeks .
The original videos beamed to Earth were stored on giant reels of tape that each contained 15 minutes of video , along with other data from the moon .
In the 1970s and ' 80s , NASA had a shortage of the tapes , so it erased about 200,000 of them and reused them .
How did NASA end up looking like a bumbling husband taping over his wedding video with the Super Bowl ?
Nafzger , who was in charge of the live TV recordings back in the Apollo years , said they were mostly thought of as data tapes .
It was n't his job to preserve history , he said , just to make sure the footage worked .
In retrospect , he said he wished NASA had n't reused the tapes .
Outside historians were aghast .
" It 's surprising to me that NASA did n't have the common sense to save perhaps the most important historical footage of the 20th century , " said Rice University historian and author Douglas Brinkley .
He noted that NASA saved all sorts of data and artifacts from Apollo 11 , and it is " mind - boggling that the tapes just disappeared . "
The remastered copies may look good , but " when dealing with historical film footage , you always want the original to study , " Brinkley said .
Smithsonian Institution space curator Roger Launius , a former NASA chief historian , said the loss of the original video " does n't surprise me that much . "
" It was a mistake , no doubt about that , " Launius said .
" This is a problem inside the entire federal government .
...
They do n't think that preservation is all that important . "
Launius said federal warehouses where historical artifacts are saved are " kind of like the last scene of ' Raiders of the Lost Ark . '
It just goes away in this place with other big boxes . "
The company that restored all the Indiana Jones movies , including " Raiders , " is the one bailing out NASA .
Lowry Digital of Burbank , Calif. , noted that " Casablanca " had a pixel count 10 times higher than the moon video , meaning the Apollo 11 footage was fuzzier than that vintage movie and more of a challenge in one sense .
Of all the video the company has dealt with , " this is by far and away the lowest quality , " said Lowry president Mike Inchalik .
Nafzger praised Lowry for restoring " crispness " to the Apollo video .
Historian Launius was n't as blown away .
" It 's certainly a little better than the original , " Launius said .
" It 's not a lot better . "
The Apollo 11 video remains in black and white .
Inchalik said he would never consider colorizing it , as has been done to black - and - white classic films .
And the moon is mostly gray anyway .
The restoration used four video sources : CBS News originals ; kinescopes from the National Archives ; a video from Australia that received the transmission of the original moon video ; and camera shots of a TV monitor .
Both Nafzger and Inchalik acknowledged that digitally remastering the video could further encourage conspiracy theorists who believe NASA faked the entire moon landing on a Hollywood set .
But they said they enhanced the video as conservatively as possible .
Besides , Inchalik said that if there had been a conspiracy to fake a moon landing , NASA surely would have created higher - quality film .
Back in 1969 , nearly 40 % of the picture quality was lost converting from one video format used on the moon — called slow scan — to something that could be played on TVs on Earth , Nafzger said .
NASA did not lose other Apollo missions ' videos because they were n't stored on the type of tape that needed to be reused , Nafzger said .
As part of the moon landing 's 40th anniversary , the space agency has been trotting out archival material .
NASA has a website with audio from private conversations in the lunar module and command capsule .
The agency is also webcasting radio from Apollo 11 as if the mission were taking place today .
The video restoration project did not involve improving the sound .
Inchalik said he listened to Armstrong 's famous first words from the surface of the moon , trying to hear if he said " one small step for man " or " one small step for A man , " but could n't tell .
Through a letter read at a news conference Thursday , Armstrong had the last word about the video from the moon : " I was just amazed that there was any picture at all . " _ Copyright 2009 The Associated Press .

Brief an die Bundeskanzlerin Joachim Jakobs
Fragen zum Datenschutz , zur Überwachung oder zu biometrischen Ausweisen
Liebe Frau Merkel ,
vor meinem
Haus steht ein Schild , das behauptet , Sie und Ihre Parteifreunde seien kräftig .
Seit Wochen quält mich nun die Frage , wie kräftig Sie sind und wozu Sie diese Kraft nutzen wollen .
Deshalb habe ich ein wenig in Ihrem Regierungsprogramm 2009 - 2013 geschmökert .
Leider habe ich nicht zu allen meinen Fragen Antworten gefunden und so schreibe ich Ihnen diesen Brief in der Hoffnung , dass Sie mir auf die Sprünge helfen können .
So befürwortet Ihre Partei den „ verstärkten Einsatz von Videokameras “ .
Das passt zu den Forderungen , die Sie persönlich bereits in einem vergangenen Wahlkampf erhoben hatten :
Es könne nicht sein , dass „ technisch Manches möglich ist und der Staat es nicht nutzt , aber stattdessen die Verbrecher und Täter “ .
Dazu würde mich interessieren : Ist Ihnen bekannt , dass der massive Einsatz von Videokameras in London nicht zur Verminderung von Straftaten geführt hat ?
Nicht einmal bei der Aufklärung der Verbrechen konnten die Kameras tatsächlich helfen .
Streuen Sie dem Wähler hier Sand in die Augen ?
Kürzlich bestätigte das Bundesjustizministerium , dass der Missbrauch der auf Vorrat gespeicherten Telefondaten nicht ausgeschlossen werden könne .
Was würde wohl der Wahlkampfmanager einer Partei bezahlen , wenn er erfahren könnte , mit wem der politische Wettbewerb so den lieben langen Tag telefoniert ?
Was wäre es dem chinesischen Geheimdienst wert , zu wissen , mit wem Sie Ihre SMS austauschen ?
Was würde die russische Mafia für die Telefondaten von der Siemens Einkaufsabteilung hinblättern ?
Sie und Bundesinnenminister Schäuble wollen das Land auch mit Hilfe von Fingerabdrücken in den Ausweisen „ sichern “ .
Ein Sicherheitsberater ist nun aber der Meinung , dass es möglich ist , falsche Fingerabdrücke in echte Ausweise zu bekommen .
Wie viel Sicherheit bekommen wir dann mit diesen Ausweisen ?
Müssen wir damit rechnen , dass alle Schwerkriminellen künftig mit gefälschten Ausweisen unterwegs sind und allein deshalb nicht kontrolliert werden , weil der Polizisten eingetrichtert wurde , dass diese Ausweise fälschungssicher seien ?
Kürzlich veröffentlichten die Datenschutzexperten der Düsseldorfer Xamit Bewertungsgesellschaft eine Studie über den Datenschutz bei den politischen Parteien .
Dort wird die CDU mit 37 Prozent aller möglichen Verstöße zu den „ Spitzenreiter ( n ) “ der Datenschutz - Ignoranten gezählt – nur Ihre bayerische Schwester CSU übertrifft die Christdemokraten mit 38 Prozent .
Auf den Plätzen folgen FDP ( 36 Prozent ) und SPD ( 33 Prozent ) .
Für Ihre Pressestelle allerdings scheint die Studie ein Grund zum Feiern zu sein : „ Selbstverständlich setzt die Bundes - CDU aus bekannten Gründen auch kein google - analytics ein .
Abschließend möchten wir nicht unerwähnt lassen , dass die Bundes - CDU auch bei der Spenden - Akquise via Internet allen Sicherheitsansprüchen genügt und in dem Test am Besten abgeschlossen hat . “
Und : Selbstverständlich führe die CDU „ ein öffentliches Verfahrensverzeichnis , das für jedermann , jederzeit , vor Ort einsehbar ist “ .
Liebe Frau Merkel : Die CDU führt die Negativ - Hitliste der datenschutzverletzenden Parteien an – dies scheint mir keineswegs ein Anlass zu sein , derart aufzutrumpfen , nur weil sie bei den Online - Spenden weniger Fettnäpfe als ihre Wettbewerber gefunden hat .
Nur am Rande sei mir der Hinweis erlaubt : Das Verfahrensverzeichnis ist zur Verfügung zu stellen !
Diese konkrete Ansage ist nicht auf die Klingelhöferstr 8 in Berlin ( die Adresse der CDU Parteizentrale ) beschränkt .
Doch zurück zu Ihrem „ Regierungsprogramm “ : Im Licht der genannten Studie gibt ’s hier eine Fülle spannender Aussagen : Beim elektronischen Geschäftsverkehr wollen Sie sich für die Datensicherheit , bei der Einführung von Funketiketten ( RFID ) wollen Sie den Datenschutz gewährleisten .
Soll dieses angestrebte Datenschutz - Niveau mit dem Ihrer Partei auf Augenhöhe liegen ?
Oder darf 's auch ein wenig mehr sein ?
Sie wollen weiter die „ sichere Kommunikation per E - Mail voranbringen “ -
Ich vermute , das spielt auf die De - Mail an ?
Ist sich denn die Bundesregierung sicher , dass die Anwendung der De-Mail auf Millionen ungeschützter PC im Land sicher funktioniert ?
Und es gibt Juristen , die daran zweifeln , dass eine elektronische Willenserklärung dem angeblich Erklärenden einwandfrei nachgewiesen werden kann .
Und schließlich schreiben Sie : „ Gleichzeitig werden wir die Bürger , insbesondere die Jugendlichen , verstärkt für einen verantwortlichen Umgang mit persönlichen Daten sensibilisieren . “
Das ist nun der Gipfel !
Der Datenjunkie der Nation will die Menschen zum verantwortlichen Umgang mit den Daten sensibilisieren !
Das ist ja so , als wollte eine Leberzirrhose Patient Jugendlichen Lebenshilfe anbieten .
Liebe Frau Merkel , die Spielchen auf anderen Politikfeldern sind schlimm genug – das was sich die „ Volksvertreter “ hier aber leisten , gefährdet unser Gemeinwesen als Ganzes und die Sicherheit eines jeden Einzelnen .
Die Politik sollte die Hände von Themen lassen , von denen sie nix versteht !
Mit freundlichen Grüßen
Ihr Joachim Jakobs ( Joachim Jakobs )
An Australian inventor , who was set to reap the lion 's share of a mammoth $ US388 million ( $ 445 million ) damages award from Microsoft , is now set to get nothing after the US judge hearing the case decided to ignore the jury 's decision and hand victory to Microsoft .
Ric Richardson , who divides his time between Northern Rivers in NSW and California , is the founder of Uniloc , which sued Microsoft in 2003 for violating its patent relating to technology designed to deter software piracy .
Ric Richardson .
The company alleged Microsoft earned billions of dollars by using the technology in its Windows XP and Office programs .
In April , a Rhode Island jury found Microsoft had violated the patent and told Microsoft to pay the company $ US388 million , one of the largest patent jury awards in US history .
The most powerful testimony at last week 's anti-Fed hearings in Congress came from economic historian Tom Woods .
The author of Meltdown , which we excerpted way back in March , explained that most reasons given for keeping the Fed 's books secret are hogwash .
The argument that greater transparency will somehow give Congress authority over setting interest rates seems far fetched , Woods explains .
Nothing in the bill seems likely to lead to that consequence .
What 's more , arguments that the bill could compromise the Fed 's independence frequently overstate the existence of that independence .
" We should investigate that issue , " Woods says .
" How independent is the Fed ?
How independent could it be ?
The Fed chairman is occasionally up for reappointment .
The chairman typically wants to ingratiate himself with the President , and often will accommodate him with loose monetary policy . "
Someone has helpfully put up the best of Woods testimony on YoutTube .
We decided to collect them for you all on one slide show .

As someone who spent two hours on the phone talking to six different insurance reps Monday , trying to find out why my insurer was trying to stick me with a $ 12,000 emergency room bill , I can only repeat what has become my personal mantra :
The only people who are really satisfied with their health coverage are those who have never had to use it .
The industry that helped scuttle health reform 15 years ago with its " Harry and Louise " ads is back , voicing support for a central element of the Obama administration 's plans : making sure everyone is covered .
That does not mean the industry is backing the administration .
Indeed , the leader of the insurance lobby has sent lawmakers a message :
Be careful what you change , because " 77 percent of Americans are satisfied with their existing health insurance coverage . "
Karen Ignagni , president of America 's Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) , invoked the statistic to argue against the creation of a government - run insurance option .
But the polls are not that simple , and her assertion reveals how the industry 's effort to defend its turf has led it to cherry - pick the facts .
The poll Ignagni was citing actually undercuts her position :
By 72 to 20 percent , Americans favor the creation of a public plan , the June survey by the New York Times and CBS News found .
People also said that they thought government would do a better job than private insurers of holding down health - care costs and providing coverage .
In addition , data from a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last year , compiled at the request of The Washington Post , suggest that the people who like their health plans the most are the people who use them the least .
Those who described their health as " excellent " -- people who presumably had relatively little experience pursuing medical care or submitting claims -- were almost twice as likely as those in good , fair or poor health to rate their private health insurance as excellent .
The level of satisfaction expressed with private insurance was essentially the same as that with Medicare , the government program for the elderly and disabled .
The industry 's stance against a public health plan revives shades of 1994 , when it was instrumental in blocking President Bill Clinton 's health - care proposals .
" A government - run plan would turn back the clock on efforts to improve the quality and safety of patient care , " AHIP has argued .
Such a plan " will ultimately limit choices and access , " the big insurer WellPoint contends .
But systemic problems have persisted for 15 years , and it is not clear how much private insurers have done , or can do , to solve them .
" Insurers promise choice , they promise innovation , they promise a lot of things , but I think they 've delivered very little , " said Alan Sager , professor of health policy and management at Boston University .
" I think net they give us very bad value for the 10 to 20 percent share of the health dollar they skim off the top . "
Instead of choice , they offer " the illusion of choice , " he said .
Michael Untermeyer better steer clear of the strip clubs for the next thirty days .
The candidate for Philly DA has chosen to wear an electronic monitoring anklet like the thugs get to wear .
Why ?

Leading by example , or you know by gimmick , the candidate believes that the state can save millions by slapping these GPS trackers on nonviolent criminal defendants instead of keeping them in jail .
Here is a candidate really trying to relate to all the people .
You can watch where he is right now on his website .
This reminds me of when my friend tried out his dog 's invisible fence collar .
He understood the punishment so much more after he ran through it and got shocked in the jugular .
Either way , I 'd still keep my eyes on Untermeyer to see if he slips up and forgets he is being tracked at all times .
Oh in case you really do track him , the site does n't work in Firefox .
That already has to ignore about half of his voting constituency .

Sun Microsystems '
JRuby team is leaving the company to work for application hosting company Engine Yard , citing the uncertainty surrounding Sun 's planned acquisition by Oracle .
Sun hired Charles Nutter and Thomas Enebo , often called " the JRuby Guys , " about two - and - a - half years ago so they could work full time on JRuby , an implementation of the Ruby programming language for the Java Virtual Machine .
Some months later Sun hired Nick Sieger , another key JRuby developer .
All three will start work at Engine Yard next week .
Nutter said they decided to leave Sun largely because of the uncertainty resulting from its acquisition by Oracle , a deal that 's expected to close later this summer pending regulatory approvals .
" To be honest , we had no evidence that Oracle would n't support JRuby , but we also did n't have any evidence that they would , " Nutter said by telephone Monday .
" Two out of the three developers making this move have families ; we want to make sure JRuby will get to the next level , and we had to make a decision , " he said .
Oracle is a big user of Sun's Java technology and says it 's one of the main reasons it bought the company , though it has n't given specifics about its plans .
Getting hired by Sun and being given the chance to work full time on JRuby was " pretty much a dream come true , " Nutter said .
The team got to work independently as a " satellite project , " but with Sun 's engineering resources behind them , including access to its Glassfish , NetBeans and JVM software .
JRuby has since gone through several releases and been deployed in some critical business applications , including an infectious disease reporting and management system used by the state of Utah .
" We really have managed to build JRuby into pretty much the best alternative Ruby implementation that 's out there ; we 've got production deployments all over the world and lots of people really love it .
We certainly could n't have done it without Sun , " Nutter said .
Engine Yard , which offers hosting for Ruby on Rails applications , is hiring the team because it 's seeing increased use of JRuby by Java Web developers and lacks expertise in that area , said Michael Mullany , its vice president of marketing .
A recent survey by Evans Data showed the number of Ruby developers increasing 40 percent from a year earlier , he said .
" I think one of the things that can take JRuby to the next level is having a paid commercial support offering and a real professional open - source offering around it , " Mullany said .
Engine Yard approached the developers about working at the company , he said .
Sieger had been leading Sun's Project Kenai , Nutter said , which allows developers to host applications in the cloud , a bit like SourceForge .
He 'll go back to full - time JRuby work at Engine Yard .
The fourth leading JRuby developer , Ola Bini , still works at ThoughtWorks , where he was hired last year , Nutter said .
A Sun spokeswoman confirmed that the developers ' last day at Sun would be this week but did n't have further comment .
Nutter said he would continue to develop JRuby and support the community much as before .
The next release , 1.4 , is due around September , Nutter said .
" We ended up moving it back a month because of this move , " he said .
" One of the big focuses [ in 1.4 ] will be doing for the Java side of JRuby what we 've done for the Ruby side , " Nutter said .
" Over the past two to three years we 've done a really good job of making JRuby into an excellent Ruby implementation , and now we want to turn our focus a little bit to making sure it 's the best JVM language as well , and a first - class citizen on the Java platform .
" That includes making sure de facto standards like Hibernate work very well with JRuby , making sure new libraries and frameworks and standards from the [ Java Community Process ] work with JRuby as well as Java , and also , to a degree , making sure we can continue to improve JRuby 's performance on the JVM . "
The team will also do some work to make sure JRuby runs as well as possible in Engine Yard 's hosting environment , he said .
The developers planned to announce their move in a blog post Tuesday afternoon , he said .
Being gay is not just a physical attraction .
Being homosexual means that you are mentally & emotionally attracted to someone .
Just because you can't get physically aroused does n't automatically mean that your feelings for another person get voided out .
There are millions of people of both genders who are unable to achieve physical arousal that still love their partners / signifigant others .
There is nothing wrong with being gay & you are not going to go to hell for whom you love .
Even if you were straight your heart would still be getting broken until you met that right person .
Do n't buy into the " if you 're gay you 're going to h3ll bullsh * t " & do n't allow yourself to be brainwashed while you 're vulnerable .
Besides , do you know how many times my friends & I have said " I wish I was a lesbian - then maybe I would n't have my heart broken as much " ?
Then our lesbian friends go " No , it 'd still get broken .
It 'd just get broken by someone with boobs . "
Do n't give up .
There is someone out there that you can spend the rest of your life with , but if you give up you 'll never find him .
EDIT :
Chemical castration DOES NOT stop your urges .
I do n't know where you are reading this , but it 's not true .
There have been people who have been physically castrated due to medical reasons or chemically castrated due to other reasons & they still have urges .
A lobotomy will not do anything for you .
It is destruction of the brain .
Many have been lobotomized & become little more than vegetables afterwards or afterwards felt like they " lost part of their soul " .
Lobotomies have basically been made obsolete since they are so dangerous to the actual person .
I am starting to think that you need to seek some professional therapy .
What you are suggesting is a living suicide .
If you really want something to numb the pain , go see a psychologist .
They will prescribe something to you that will help you get over your pain & is more healthy for you in the long term .
Do n't take recreational drugs , since those will just exacerbate any mental anguish you are now going through .
There is no place that will offer you a chemical castration or lobotomy & any place that will give you one without a physician referral is illegal & will more than likely kill you .
CHAPEL HILL , N.C.  Devin Ceartas would no sooner give up drying his laundry on a clothesline than he would dig up his spice garden , overturn his rain barrel or get rid of his compost heap .
Air drying is one of the simple , old - fashioned ways the 42 - year - old computer programmer and his wife try to make their life in a Chapel Hill subdivision kinder to the environment .
So when their homeowners ' association told them two years ago to take down the clothesline , they organized their neighbors .
Today , laundry hangs freely from the backyard balconies of Village West townhouses , and aesthetic complaints can be taken up with Ceartas , who last fall became association president .
Switching to clothesline and drying racks saves energy , but residents can get in hot water with associations , landlords or towns that see clotheslines as eyesores .
Now , a growing number of states , from Maine to Hawaii are stepping in to override local laws and rules .
" What we 're talking about here is a cultural shift , " says Alexander Lee , founder of pro-clothesline group Project Laundry List .
" It would be nice to go from community association to community association to have this discussion and change the rules , but there are 300,000 of them , and we need to hurry along now if we 're going to cope with climate change . "
Laws with varying levels of protections for clotheslines passed in May for Vermont , in June for Maine and in July for Hawaii , joining existing laws in Florida , Utah and Colorado .
That does n't sit well with some local associations , who feel states are stepping into decisions that should be made by local association boards .
Bruce Benton , who serves on the board of the Tamarac subdivision in rural Horse Shoe , N.C. , says property values have dropped in the recession and could sink more if residents have to watch underwear flap in the breeze .
" People do n't want to see somebody , just because they want to do what they want to do , start breaking the rules , " he says .
" It starts to look like a tenement . "
Benton 's neighbor , Bryan Aleksich , assembled a clothes drying rack on his deck in August , despite an association rule against visible clotheslines .
Aleksich , 81 , says he is unconcerned about a potential run-in with his board , with which he has sparred before over disagreements like the proper location for his natural gas tank .
He says drying in the sun makes his laundry fluffier and saves significant energy .
" It 's amazing how appearance is paramount in most people 's minds , " he says .
More than 5 % of electricity used in homes goes to power clothes dryers , according to a U.S. Department of Energy report that looked at energy use in 2001 .
Local governments also have prohibitions .
The Greenwich ( Conn . )
Housing Authority deems clotheslines a hazard , and notified residents of one public - housing unit in July it plans to remove their line , says authority Executive Director Anthony Johnson .
Advocates for state action have seen mixed success .
Efforts in North Carolina , Virginia , Maryland and Oregon have not succeeded so far , Lee says .
Colorado's law applies only to retractable clotheslines .
The law Maine passed this year affects covenants , ordinances and leases created after Sept. 30 .
The more - sweeping Vermont law overturns bans in covenants like the ones that govern the condominium associations Paul T. Carroccio's company manages in ski areas .
Carroccio said nearly all such groups have bans , which exist to protect homeowners .
" When people buy these things … they 're assured the buildings are always going to look the way they 're intended to look , " he says .

ATFP presents a new Task Force book publication :
What ’s Wrong with the One - State Agenda ?
Why Ending the Occupation and Peace with Israel is Still the Palestinian National Goal
by ATFP Senior Fellow Hussein Ibish
In this new book , Dr. Ibish examines the arguments generally put forward by Palestinian and other Arab American proponents of abandoning the goal of ending the occupation and establishing a Palestinian state and instead seeking to promote a single , democratic state in all of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories .
The book also looks at differences between the deployment of the one - state idea by some Palestinian figures in the occupied territories as a diplomatic " threat " intended to spur greater Israeli seriousness about a negotiated agreement and the diasporic discourse that drives most one - state rhetoric .
Finally , Dr. Ibish explains in some detail why ending the occupation and peace with Israel , while difficult to achieve and thus far elusive , are the only plausible and practicable Palestinian national strategy .
The book also includes a preface by ATFP President Ziad J. Asali .
The 138 - page book can be read or downloaded in the following formats :

Jesus said that the poor would always be with us — but that does n't mean we should n't try to bring them broadband .
A coalition of Christian churches and the Islamic Society of North America has launched a new campaign to bring broadband to everyone in the US so that " our poorest communities , our rural areas , our public libraries , our public schools , and community centers " benefit from the communications revolution that the Internet hath wrought .
The " Bring Betty Broadband " campaign casts the broadband debate in moral terms .
It 's about the " right to disseminate and receive information , " it 's a " right that helps to define ourselves as human beings and political actors , " and it 's absolutely essential for everyone in a modern society .
In addition , in the modern economy , just distribution of access to communication and information is essential to promote economic justice , " says the group .
" Increasingly in the United States , the fundamental right to communicate is meaningless without high speed Internet access . "
The joint effort is part of a media reform project called " So We Might See , " and it 's spearheaded by the United Church of Christ .
It has also been endorsed by the National Council of Churches , the US Catholic Conference of Bishops , the United Methodists , the Presbyterian Church ( PCUSA ) , the Lutherans ( ELCA ) , and the Islamic Society of North America .
The groups all believe that the government has a role to play in this process , especially with more than $ 7 billion in broadband stimulus money on the table .
" For too long , " they say , " the process of reaching out and educating traditionally disenfranchised communities has been left to volunteer efforts and the philanthropic community alone .
Increasing access does n't just assist the people who are helped , we all benefit .
Just as the value of a telephone increases when we can reach more people by using it , the value of the Internet for all of us increases when we are all connected . "
But , recognizing that many people without broadband do n't currently see its utility , the coalition asks the government " to promote digital inclusion initiatives to stimulate broadband demand and ensure that all US residents have access to the digital skills and equipment necessary to take advantage of the Internet 's enormous potential benefits .
For example , establishment of local and national digital inclusion councils could work with other agencies and programs to promote digital inclusion principles in the fulfillment of their missions .
Media literacy curriculum for secondary schools should be established , along with technology literacy and digital media production . "
The " Bring Betty Broadband " webpage features a cute animated video ( presumably of " Betty " ) , but the action step is a form letter that people are encouraged to send to Gary Locke of the Commerce Department ( which is overseeing much of the broadband money ) .
Unlike many such letters , though , senders pledge themselves to help out .
" As members of a wide range of faith communities in this country , " the letter concludes , " we are prepared to do our part to help our friends and neighbors to get online and to get broadband access .
We hope the federal government will also step up to the plate . "
So We Might See 's media reform mission goes beyond the new broadband campaign ; one of its recent projects was the " Spare Kids the Ads " campaign , which sought to cut down on embedded advertisements ( product placements ) , especially those targeted at kids .
One key item of concern ?

To promote the issue , the United Church of Christ 's Office of Communication dreamed up some holiday - themed e-cards , one of which is too good not to share .
MTA Roller Buffed on the LA River
Not only did the large Saber roller on the LA river suffer from the rath of the graffiti buff in LA but so was the massive MTA roller .
That ’s how the California tax dollars are being put to use .
Since taking power nine years ago , Syrian strongman Bashar Assad has : turned his country into a safe haven and transit corridor for jihadists en route to Iraq ; funneled sophisticated munitions to Hezbollah and probably Hamas ; sought to build an illicit nuclear reactor with North Korean help ; mostly failed to liberalize Syria ’s economy and resisted liberalizing its politics ; publicly declared that Israel would never “ become a legitimate state even if the peace process is implemented ” ; and ruled while Syrians have been implicated by a U.N. investigator in the 2005 assassination of Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri .
So , naturally , President Obama has made Syria a prime target for diplomacy as part of his new Axis of Engagement .
The President has already restored full diplomatic ties with Damascus that were cut off after the Hariri assassination .
Last week , State Department envoy George Mitchell visited Mr. Assad to discuss improved military - to - military ties and easing some sanctions , though others remain in place .
Now the Administration believes it can entice Mr. Assad into abandoning some of his bad habits , like sponsoring terrorist groups , meddling in his neighbors ’ internal affairs and maintaining close ties with Iran .
“ We received assurances that the relations between the two countries should resume on the basis of mutual interests and most importantly of mutual respect , ” Syrian deputy foreign minister Fayssal Mekdad told the Journal last week .
“ We really welcome such a new approach . ”
Damascus ’s delight is no surprise , but the chances of success here are somewhat lower than Hugo Chavez becoming a capitalist .
Since the current president ’s father , Hafez Assad , came to power in a coup in 1970 , the U.S. has repeatedly imposed sanctions on Syria , withdrawn ambassadors and even shelled Syrian military positions in Lebanon .
But the U.S. has also repeatedly sought to engage Syria as a partner — during the 1991 Gulf War against Saddam Hussein , and later as a mediator in failed peace negotiations with Israel .
After the fall of Baghdad in 2003 , George W. Bush dispatched Colin Powell to Damascus to try to win Mr. Assad ’s cooperation .
Instead , Syria made itself a safe haven for the terrorists who killed U.S. soldiers .
After Barack Obama 's convincing win over John McCain , it was clear the Republican Party was at a crossroads .
The Grand Old Party had to decide what ideology was going to guide it in the post - Bush era : a philosophy rooted in conservative ideas or a credo based upon fear and anger .
Unfortunately for America , Republicans turned to the dark side and chose the road to fascism .
By " fascism " I mean a national political movement that rejects democracy , embraces nativism and racism , and promotes violence .
The Ku Klux Klan is an American fascist movement .
The German Nazis were another example .
The Republican dance with fascism dates to the Nixon era when the GOP recruited Southern Democrats alienated by passage of the Civil Rights Act .
When George W. Bush first ran for President , rabidly racist and sexist groups became major campaign players .
The Bush White House encouraged nativism with its imagery of America the Christian nation leading a worldwide crusade against infidels .
And , Bush fed distrust of reason - another hallmark of fascism - with his fear - based propaganda and anti-science agenda .
Since Obama 's election , we 've seen the Republican Party tighten its embrace of fascism .
First , they made the decision to oppose whatever Obama proposed without offering contrasting ideas ; their hope was that the President would fail and this would work to their advantage .
Republican leaders rooted for a collapse of the American financial system , wanted the current recession to be as severe as the Great Depression , so their Party could take advantage of the chaos .
Second , in the absence of strong internal leadership , the GOP looked to demagogues - Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity - to represent the Party .
Republicans adopted Nazi leader Joseph Goebbels ' " big lie " tactic , where Party spokespeople could say anything so long as it advanced their cause .
Limbaugh denied there is a healthcare crisis , called Obama a racist and compared him to Hitler .
Beck , Hannity , and O'Reilly took the same path as Limbaugh and claimed the Democrats ' healthcare bill supports euthanasia .
Third , the GOP embraced nativism and racism by supporting border vigilantes , opposing the Supreme Court nomination of Sonja Sotomayor , and spreading lies about Obama 's birth .
In effect , the Republican Party rebranded itself as the White People 's Party .
And finally , in their advocacy of disruptions at Congressional town hall meetings , Republicans have explicitly supported violence .
Beginning with the lie that the Obama Administration wants to suspend the second amendment and deny Americans the right to bear arms , Glen Beck has promoted armed resistance .
Falsely claiming Obama has " surrounded himself by Marxists his whole life , " Beck proclaimed the Obama era is reminiscent of " " the early days of Adolf Hitler " and suggested America is rapidly becoming " a totalitarian state . "
The Republican Party and closely allied lobbyists promoted thuggery that disrupted town hall meetings .
Now the Republican Party teeters on the edge of the signature tactic of fascist movements : sponsoring paramilitary groups .
It 's time for Americans to call the Republican tactics for what they really are and launch a counter - attack against fascism .
(1) Encourage Democratic members of Congress to vote for the Obama healthcare plan when they return from their August recess .
Republican leaders understand that healthcare reform is vital for the American people and the economy and its passage will further diminish GOP influence and credibility .
So long as they are united , Democrats do n't need Republican votes to pass healthcare reform .
(2) Show up at town hall meetings , support healthcare reform , and object to the mob violence espoused by the Republican Party .
Ask GOP leaders to denounce thuggery .
Send letters to your local newspaper supporting healthcare reform and condemning Republican fascism .
(3) Donate to progressive groups that pledge to combat fascism ; for example , Organizing for America , Democracy for America , and Move On .
(4) Support Democratic Representatives from swing Congressional districts ; those holding seats that might be jeopardized by a vote supporting the Obama healthcare initiative .
The Cook Report lists 18 Democratic incumbents at risk .
(5) Demonstrate against hatemongers - Beck , Coulter , Hannity , Limbaugh , Malkin , O'Reilly , Savage and others - and the Republican leadership that supports them - Boehner , McConnell , Palin , and Steele .
Send them disapproving emails and show up at their public appearances .
(6) Boycott sponsors that advertise on the shows of hatemongers .
Fox News Boycott has a complete list of Fox sponsors .
(7) Demand that the FCC or Congress reinstate the Fairness Doctrine to limit the power of Fox News and hate radio .
In 1987 , the Republican - dominated Federal Communications Commission suspended the fairness doctrine , which required holders of broadcast licenses to report on controversial issues in an honest , equitable , and balanced manner .
This action opened the door for Fox News , the Rush Limbaugh show , and other conservative outlets to spew Republican propaganda without having to offer the opposing perspective .
This is a critical moment for healthcare reform , the Obama presidency , and American democracy .
In their ill - considered scramble for power , the Republican leadership is feeding the fires of fascism .
It 's time for all of us to do what we can to ensure meaningful healthcare reform legislation is enacted and the GOP tactics are rebuked .

For example , to search for firefox , type gg : firefox and enter .
The search result will be brought up in the default web browser .
To use Google Image Search , type images : < some name > .
For example , to search for pictures of Avril Lavigne , type images : avril lavigne .
As in the Google Web Search , results are shown in the default web browser .
2. Unit Converter
KRunner can also be used as a very capable unit converter .
Want to find out what is 12.1 miles in kilometres ?
Just type in 12.1 miles in kilometers and you will get the result .
The syntax is < value > < unit_1 > as / in < unit_2 > ( as and in can be used inter changebly ) .
3. Navigation
KRunner can also be used to open certain folders .
For example , if i want to go to my home folder , I simply have to enter / home / ricky and the location will be opened by the default file browser .

Single - celled slime moulds could be programmed as robots ( Image : Visuals Unlimited / Corbis )
THOUGH not famed for their intellect , single - celled organisms have already demonstrated a surprising degree of intelligence .
Now a team at the University of the West of England ( UWE ) has secured £ 228,000 in funding to turn these organisms into engineering robots .
In recent years , single - celled organisms have been used to control six - legged robots , but Andrew Adamatzky at UWE wants to go one step further by making a complete “ robot ” out of a plasmodium slime mould , Physarum polycephalum , a commonly occurring mould that moves towards food sources …
One can choose to go back toward safety or forward toward growth .
Growth must be chosen again and again ; fear must be overcome again and again .
Lou Dobbs has gone and done it again :
On his radio show -- broadcast from the anti-immigration organization Federation for American Immigration Reform 's " Hold Their Feet to the Fire " legislative advocacy event -- Lou Dobbs interviewed WorldNetDaily staff reporter Jerome Corsi , who Dobbs described as " a pretty good guy to talk to " about immigration issues .
Corsi is a consistent promoter of the conspiracy theory -- previously advanced by Dobbs -- that President Obama has yet to produce a valid birth certificate ; the author of falsehood - laden books about Obama and Sen.
John Kerry that Dobbs ' CNN colleagues panned as " discredited ; " and has a history of making bigoted comments , some of which he later apologized for .
The piece documents Corsi 's long history of promoting conspiracy theories , including most recently the " birther " nonsense , but more famously the " Swift Boat " garbage that sank John Kerry 's candidacy .
Perhaps even more germane is that , beyond the " birther " conspiracy theories , Corsi has most recently been promoting the theory that President Obama is planning to round up conservatives and put them in concentration camps .
This willingness to abet the most insane wingnuttery is yet another drop in the bucket of evidence that CNN needs to give Dobbs the boot if it ever hopes to salvage what little credibility it has left .
A new site called DropDobbs.com is a joint effort by various progressive organizations -- including Media Matters , America 's Voice , the Southern Poverty Law Center , and the National Council of La Raza -- to demand CNN make the change :
Over the years , Lou Dobbs has consistently used his CNN platform to spread hatred and fear .
He played a critical role in skewing the immigration reform debate in 2006 , leading to the derailment of that effort , and his obsession with the issue of immigration and with defeating immigration reform continues unabated .
Adding to his repertoire of hate and fearmongering , he has recently aligned himself with the “ birther ” conspiracists and their racially tinged attack on the legitimacy of Barack Obama ’s presidency .
From his CNN platform , he has bolstered the claims of those on the fringe by asserting repeatedly that President Obama has failed to produce adequate proof that he was born in the United States .
His recent focus on the birth certificate conspiracy issue has reinforced what immigration reform proponents have long known — that Dobbs has a long history of the worst kind of pandering by promoting hate and ethnic and racial division .
Timothy Karr at HuffPo has a thoughtful piece on what we can start to do to confront the flood of toxic garbage that is spewing out of right - wing media these days .
Lou Dobbs is only one of the most prominent problems .
Rand Paul has crashed the party for Kentucky Secretary of State and establishment pick Trey Grayson ( pictured ) .
Kentucky contender hits obstacle
If Republicans thought their headaches in the Kentucky Senate race were over when Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - Ky . ) announced his retirement , they were wrong .
Rand Paul , the son of former presidential candidate and Texas GOP Rep .
Ron Paul , has crashed the party for Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson , who is widely regarded as the establishment pick to succeed the 77 - year - old Bunning .

While Paul , an ophthalmologist , is a long shot , his presence in the contest all but guarantees that Grayson will be embroiled in an expensive and potentially damaging primary contest .
It ’s not the scenario the GOP was hoping for .
Party officials had been maneuvering behind the scenes for months to ease out Bunning , the irascible former Major League Baseball pitcher who was widely viewed as unlikely to hold his seat against a credible Democrat .
The idea was to clear a path for Grayson , who has twice been elected statewide .
“ From a larger tactical perspective , I think the fact that both Grayson and Paul will raise and spend a lot of money is something the party wanted to avoid , ” said Scott Jennings , a Louisville - based GOP strategist who served as deputy political director in the George W. Bush White House .
“ I think it is frustrating .
There certainly is a dynamic where you ’d rather [ Paul ] not be there , ” said Ted Jackson , a top Republican strategist in the state who is supporting Grayson .
“ If you could wish it away , you would wish it away .
[ Grayson is ] going to have to spend money in a primary campaign . ”
The heart of the GOP establishment ’s problem is Paul ’s ability to generate campaign cash through the same channels as his father .
A widely publicized Aug. 20 “ money bomb ” Internet outreach to his father ’s grass - roots donor list raised about $ 800,000 .
Just as troubling for GOP officials , an August SurveyUSA automated poll showed Grayson leading Paul just 37 percent to 26 percent — putting the insurgent Paul within striking distance .
All the while , Paul has sought to rally the support of his father ’s backers — libertarian - minded voters who are politically active , not firmly tethered to the GOP and willing to donate .
“ The risk is underestimating [ Paul ] — not because he is such a great candidate but because he inherits a grass - roots organization from his father , ” said one Washington - based strategist who is watching the race closely .
But even as Grayson gears up for a primary , there is considerable doubt among state Republicans about how much traction Paul can actually gain , regardless of how much he spends .
While Kentucky ’s Republican primary electorate is conservative , party insiders say , it is traditionally conservative — not necessarily anti-government conservative .
Either way , an expensive primary risks depleting Grayson ’s coffers for what is all but certain to be a hard - fought general election campaign .
And Kentucky , which includes the Cincinnati and Louisville media markets , is not an inexpensive state in which to run a campaign : Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his Democratic challenger , Bruce Lunsford , spent more than $ 32 million combined in their slugfest last year .
There is also concern among GOP strategists that Paul , who is attacking Grayson on his conservative credentials on a near - daily basis , may dampen enthusiasm on the right for the secretary of state .
In an interview with POLITICO , Paul painted Grayson as a soft conservative , slamming him for once voting for President Bill Clinton and questioning why he accepted donations from senators who had voted in support of the Troubled Asset Relief Program bailout .
“ I just do n’t think he has a lot of hard or strong beliefs , ” said Paul .
Republicans now say that ignoring Paul is no longer an option , leading them to circle the wagons around Grayson .
McConnell — the state ’s most powerful Republican — is n’t endorsing Grayson outright , but he is n’t leaving any doubt that Grayson has his backing .
McConnell is hosting a September fundraiser for Grayson with more than half of the Senate GOP conference scheduled to be in attendance .
And two key McConnell political hands , Nate Hodson and Justin Brasell , have signed on to head up Grayson ’s campaign .
Kentucky Republicans say Grayson will run a no-holds - barred primary campaign that targets the same grass - roots conservative activists on whom Paul is focusing .
“ Anytime you ’re dealing with an opponent who has raised the kind of money Paul has , you have to take it seriously , and you have to go out and win — and win convincingly , ” said Jennings .
Some in the party see a silver lining in Paul ’s candidacy .
At 37 , Grayson remains largely untested politically and , as a nominee , would face a general election dogfight against one of two seasoned Democratic pols : Lt. Gov. Daniel Mongiardo or Attorney General Jack Conway .
“ I frankly think that Grayson needs an opponent , ” said Al Cross , a longtime Kentucky political watcher who is director of the University of Kentucky ’s Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues .
“ He needs a worthy opponent to sharpen his skills . ”
In WHERE DO WE COME FROM : The Molecular Evidence for Human Descent ( Springer , 2002 ) Klein and Takahata write , on page 381 , '' The species , as the only biologically definable category , provides a dividing line in biological classification .
Most of the other categories ( genus , family , order , etc ) are positioned above the species level , while only a few are in the sub - species level .
The latter , which include variety , subspecies , and race , are poorly defined and ambiguous .
Any deviation from the holotype , the specimen on which the description of a new species is based , is referred to as a variety , even when the deviation is in a single morphological character .
A subspecies is a population or a group of phenotypically similar populations inhabiting a geographically defined region and differing from other populations of the same species in diagnostic characters .
Race is used by taxonomists either as a synonymn of sub-species or as a designation of a local population within a sub-species .
Different variants , subspecies , or races of the same species are either known or expected to interbreed if given the opportunity .
[ Note that only a single character is enough to distinguish a ' variety ' , and SOME distinguishing designation is certainly called for between Europeans and Asians .
Thus we can conservatively say Euros and Asians are different varieties .
Next , consider that statement , '' race is used by taxonomists either as a synonym of sub- species or as a designation of a local population within a sub- species ' ' .
That means race signifies a greater distinction than variety , and it might be used to distinguish a ' lesser ' difference than subspecies .
Klein and Takahata discuss how the gorillas are divided into subspecies by their fur length and color or various morphological characteristics .
They go on to say , ] '' All this is biological reality which raises few emotions .
Taxonomists may disagree on the number , delineation , name , indeed on the very existence of the subdivisions in a particular species , but other than that they find nothing objectionable about the notion of species consisting of populations between which gene flow has been reduced , because of the geographical distance between them , for example . '' and '' Biologically , H. sapiens is a species like any other and as such it might be expected to be differentiated into subspecies , especially since its global distribution creates opportunities for adaptation to different climatic conditions and so for morphological divergence . ''
[ Commenting on the current , PC effort to deny the very existence of race , K and T write , ] '' The proposal to scrap the concept of race altogether is currently only one extreme in a range of views .
It is certainly not shared by all anthropologists and is by no means the majority opinion of the public at large .
It appears to be a conclusion reached more on the basis of political and philosophical creeds than on scientific arguments .
Correspondingly , anthropologists who do hold this opinion often attempt to shout down their opponents rather than convince them by presentation of facts .
Their favored method of argumentation is to label anybody who disagrees with them as racist .
The public , however , seems unimpressed by their rhetoric .
It refuses to believe that the differences they see are a mere figment of their imagination .
A lay - person can tell with a high degree of accuracy where individuals come from just by glimpsing their features .
[ The authors give a specific example and go on to write , ] '' Except for some anthropologists , everybody else seems to be able to distinguish people from different parts of the world at a glance by their outward appearance .
This apparently is also the view of some government administrators in countries with programs designed to fight racial discrimination .
Obviously , there is a credibility gap between some anthropologists on the one side and the public , as well as the governments of some countries , on the other .
One way to settle the arguments among anthropologists and to reconcile anthropologists with the public might be to move away from physical characteristics and focus on the genes .
If races are real , they should have a genetic basis separable from environmental and cultural influences . '' and '' Provided the races separated a long time ago , random genetic drift should have diversified their genetic composition even in the absence of selection .
It can be expected that the longer ago the races diverged , the greater the differences between them will be .
Even if there has not been enough time to ' fix ' different alleles in distinct races , at least differences in gene frequencies should have been generated . ''
[ The research discussed in Letter to the Editor of Discover ( posted on site ) describes the results from the sort of study Klein and Takahata suggest .
It turns out there ARE fixed alleles that vary by race , and different frequencies that are associated with Africans , Europeans , and Asians .
In other words , there ARE genetic ' races ' in spite of the disingenuous statements that are publicized in an attempt to obfuscate and deny the facts .
Everyone has noted that Europeans have white skins ; many of them have lightly pigmented eyes and hair ; on the other hand Africans have dark skin , hair , and eyes , while Asians have dark eyes and hair , and Eurasian hair has a different texture from that of Africans .
Harding et al. ( in Evidence for Variable Selective Pressure at MC1R , Amerian Journal of Human Genetics , 66:1351 -61 , 2000 ) studied the MC1R gene , which influences the pigmentation of eyes , hair , and skin .
They found that all Africans , and tropical indigenes in general , had an ancestral form of the gene : there were NO non-synonymous alleles .
Thus , they contend that MC1R is tightly constrained in the tropics ; this implies that any indigenous population radiating ' Out of Africa ' would have been black .
By contrast , there were several alleles , at various frequencies among European populations , accounting for the observed ubiquity of white skin , and substantial frequency of light hair and eye colors .
These alleles could ONLY have arisen in populations that left the tropics a very long time ago , or never lived there to begin with .
It would have taken a long time for the mutations in these alleles to occur and then rise to the observed distribution .
Harding et al. calculate that at least a hundred thousand years , and possibly more than twice that long , might be required for one of these alleles to reach its current frequency .
I defy any population geneticist to produce a credible model of genetic mutation and diffusion that turns an all - black African population into an all - white European population in the 50 to 70 thousand years that current Out of Africa models permit !
And remember that those same afrocentrists claim the African radiation replaced the indigenous Eurasians , rather than interbreeding with them , so they cant postulate acquisition of MC1R alleles from archaic Europeans , followed by selection to achieve fixation of euro - genes ; that would be more like absorption than replacement !
Moreover , they must , but cant , explain why the putative African radiation in Asia produced an entirely different variety and set of alleles .
The afrocentrists appeal to selection , but Harding finds evidence that MC1R has NOT been selected at Euro - specific alleles , though it has been tightly CONSTRAINED to the ancestral form in the tropics .
Klein and Takahata , writing of the various attempts to explain what kind of selection would make ALL Europeans white , or account for their eyes and hair , concede that , ]  None of these explanations is fully satisfactory  and  Satisfactory explanations are also not available for hair color and texture , eye color , and other external differences between human races . 
[ Before the recent advances in genetics it was possible to contend that black Africans were somehow converted into Eurasians .
Geneticists speak glibly of '' drift ' ' as if it were a serious theory for how ALL those putative black Africans turned white in Europe and yellow in Asia ; and not just their skin color , but all the other soft tissue , cranial , and intellectual features .
Everybody changed completely and there was no mix of people with different degrees and phenotypic expressions of afro-characters .
What kind of a pseudo - science theory of population dynamics could yield an ALL white - characteristic Europe from blacks ?
There is an old saying that some ideas are so dumb only highly educated people can believe them .
As noted above , no satisfactory explanations were forthcoming for such conversion , but the socio- political , PC ' virtue ' of an African origins theory was irresistible to academia and media opinion makers .
The early research on mtDNA was misinterpreted to support the ' ' African Eve ' ' , or '' Out of Africa ' ' theories , by asserting that all human mtDNA came from an African woman .
This assertion is maintained today , and it continues to be represented as ' proving '
African replacement , even though the data does NOT justify such an assumption .
See Plural Lineages in the Human mtDNA Genome ( posted on site ) for contraindications .
Since the morphological , genetically mediated , differences between Europeans , Asians , and Africans are so obvious , those who wish to deny the biological reality of race are forced ( against all common - sense ) to argue that such differences are statistically trivial .
Lewontin , for instance , argues that since ' ' only ' ' 15 % of the variation in the human genome is completely correlated to race , that such differences are trivial .
As noted in the closing paragraph of Letter to the Editor of DISCOVER , this is a deceitful argument .
Klein and Takahata are quite PC on the subject of race , but they have too much scientific integrity to misrepresent the data as Feldman does ; here is what they say , ] '' Formally , these findings demonstrate , first , that the species is indeed subdivided into genetically definable groups of individuals and , second , that at least some of those groups correspond to those defined by anthropologists as races on the basis of physical characters . ''
[ Klein and Takahata note that , in spite of the genetic findings , many continue to argue that such distinctions are trivial .
Then they write , ] '' By contrast , Sewall Wright , who can hardly be taken for a dilettante in questions of population genetics , has stated emphatically that if differences of this magnitude were observed in any other species , the groups they distinguish would be called subspecies . 
[ So , while genetic research does support traditional and common - sense racial distinctions , it is even more consistent with a nuanced view that the major distinction is between the indigenes of New Guinea / Australia and sub-Saharan Africans versus Eurasians .
The differences between Europeans and northern Asians are minor by comparison , so the old tri-racial distinction of white , yellow , and black , while not invalid , is not strictly accurate from a taxonomic perspective .
Genetically , we should regard Europeans and northern Asians as varieties of H. s. sapiens ; the sub -Saharan Africans and Australian / NG populations as subspecies , and the back - crossed hybrid indigenes of N. Africa and much of southern Asia as one or more races .
Klein and Takahata write , ] '' One can extend Wrights argument even further .
The more than two hundred species of haplochromine fishes in Lake Victoria differ from each other much less than the human races in their neutral genes , although they are presumably distinguished by genes that control differences in their external appearances .
The same can be said about at least some of the currently recognized species of Darwins finches and about other examples of recent adaptive radiations .
In all these cases , reproductively isolated groups are impossible to tell apart by the methods used to measure differences between the human races .
Obviously human races are not reproductively isolated ( interracial marriages are common and the progenies of such marriages are fully fertile ) but the external differences between them are comparable to those between the cichlid fishes and Darwin 's finches .
Under these circumstances , to claim that the genetic differences between the human races are trivial is more a political statement than a scientific argument .
Trivial by what criterion ?
How much difference would Lewontin and those who side with him consider non-trivial ? ''
[ Actually Klein and Takahata understate human racial differences by calling them '' comparable ' ' to the finches and cichlids , because only an expert can tell those birds and fishes apart , while any ordinary person can tell another persons race at a glance !
K and T go on to write , ]
 By mixing science with politics , geneticists and anthropologists are committing the same infraction of which they are accusing other scientists , whom they themselves label as racists .
Even worse , by dismissing genetic differences as insignificant , they play into the hands of genuine racists who can easily demolish this claim . 
[ These genetic differences between human races offer an important test of the Out of Africa theory , and it fails ! ]
 Multiregionalists have no difficulty explaining the 10 - 15 % differences between the human groups .
Since they assume that the differentiation began up to 2 my ago , when H. erectus established founding populations in the different regions , there has been sufficient time to accumulate the differences .
Uniregionalists [ Out of Africa theorists ] who assume that the differentiation into groups began after the exodus of H. sapiens from Africa , are at a disadvantage , because calculations indicate that only under highly unrealistic assumptions ( e.g. , no gene flow between populations ) would the time interval suffice for the origin of the observed differences .
Here is some research that gives a perspective on the claims that differences between human races are genetically insignificant .
In Number of ancestral human species : a molecular perspective D. CURNOE * , and A. THORNE , ( in HOMO Vol. 53/3 , pp. 201-224 ) write :  Nuclear DNA
Our analyses using 24 genetic distances provide an estimated speciation rate of 1 - 13 with a mean of 4 for all DNA distances ( table 1 ) .
Some of the speciation rates in table 1 are < 1 .
This results from the fact that some of the distances between humans and chimpanzees , when halved , are below those between Africans and Asians . 
Just think about that : some of the genetic differences between Africans and Eurasians , are more than half as great as between the consensus human genome and chimpanzees !
Compare the research cited above , in regard to the great difference between African and Eurasian nuclear and mtDNA , to the deceptive statements by Feldman , as quoted in Discover magazine ( IMO , posted on site ) .
Next , consider how racial differences , between Eurasians and sub-Saharan Africans , compare to the difference between modern humans and pre-human species of Homo .
 We estimate the mean distance between H. sapiens and « terminal » H. neanderthalensis from 16 distances to be around 0.08 % .
This is a very small distance and is less than half the estimated genetic difference between living sub-Saharan Africans and Eurasians ( Starr & McMillan 2001 ) .
The mean of 8 genetic distances between H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis is 0.026-0.027 .
This is equivalent to the genetic distance between Papua New Guineans and Thais or Na Dene and Indonesians ( Cavalli - Sforza et al 1994 ) .
So , the difference between the modern human consensus genome , and H. neanderthalensis , is less than half the difference between s-S Africans and Eurasians .
These are the differences : twice as much as the gulf between Hss and Hn , which Lewontin and the race - deniers call trivial !
What about the genetic distance to H. erectus ?
 Homo sapiens and H. erectus living about 0.3 Ma , may have shared an ancestor around 1.5 Ma ( a total divergence time of 2.4 million years ) .
The distance between them as determined from the mean of 16 distances may have been around 0.19 % .
This is about equivalent to the estimated genetic difference between living sub-Saharan Africans and Eurasians of 0.2 % ( Starr & McMillan 2001 ) .
The mean of 8 other genetic distances between H. sapiens and H. erectus is 0.065-0.068 .
This overlaps the range of distances for living humans , with the lower estimate identical to the distance between « Bantu » and « Eskimo » ( Cavalli - Sforza et al 1994 ) .
So , modern Eurasians and s-S Africans are about as genetically distant as modern humans are from H. erectus !
The authors say erectus and modern humans may have shared a last common ancestor about 1.5 million years ago .
Notice how that fits with the data on fossil mtDNA included on chromosome 11 ( see Australian Ancestry ) which also implies that African erectus and Eurasians had diverged for more than a million years , before [ on my view ] hybridization between Eurasian sapiens and tropical erectus produced the indigenous populations of Africa and southern Asia .
Even authors who have , in the past , minimized the importance of racial genetic distinctions are now admitting that the shibboleths , race is a social construct  and we are all the same genetically , are just plain wrong .
As one reviewer wrote ,  New support for the existence and significance of group , or racial , differences in medicine comes from several contributors to the [ then ] current Nature Genetics , a leading journal of genetics .
This already widely noted issue is devoted to the question of whether inherited differences between groups should be considered in medical research and treatment , and though various authors deny the relevance of such differences , Sarah Tishkoff ( University of Maryland ) and Kenneth Kidd , of Yale , in  Implications of biogeography of human populations for race and medicine report that racial differences indeed exist , while Joanna L. Mountain and Neil Risch , both of Stanford , in  Assessing genetic contributions to phenotypic differences among racial and ethnic groups ,  recognize racial disparities and regard them as important for medical treatment .
The reviewer comments that ,  The careful ( and sometimes cautious ) findings of these scholars may seem all too obvious , but they are an important corrective , in an authoritative source , to efforts to use such recent advances in genetic knowledge as the Genome to obscure the fact and the importance of racial differences .
The reviewer continues , writing of a recent Stanford study that  found a very close correlation between individuals ' racial self - identification and the evidence from their DNA .
In Genetic Structure , Self - Identified Race / Ethnicity , and Confounding in Case - Control Association Studies , which appears in the February 2005 issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics , a dozen researchers report the way the 3,636 individuals studied classified themselves racially tallied almost perfectly with their racial type as indicated by 326 signposts in their DNA : only 5 participants volunteered a racial identity at variance with that indicated by their genetic material .
Intriguingly , the study also determined that the DNA of self - identified African - American and Hispanic participants , despite their substantial genetic admixture from other racial groups ( and despite their historical tendencies to identify with other racial groups ) , jibed with their expressed racial membership as often as did those of whites and East Asians .
The largest of its kind to date , the Stanford study focused on four major racial groupings ( white , East Asian , African - American , and Hispanic ) and was conducted in fifteen locations in the United States and Taiwan .
Study leader Neil Risch , currently a professor at the University of California at San Francisco , believes that the demonstrated ability of prospective patients to accurately specify their group DNA can save time and money otherwise spent on painstaking individual genetic testing .
Without knowing how the participants had identified themselves , Risch and his team ran the results through a computer program that grouped individuals according to patterns of the 326 signposts .
This analysis could have resulted in any number of different clusters , but only four clear groups turned up .
And in each case the individuals within those clusters all fell within the same self - identified racial group .
Risch said , peoples self - identified race is a nearly perfect indicator of their genetic background , contradicting the race - as - social - construct view .
I commend those authors for having the courage to tell even a little of the truth about this PC - censored topic .
A paper by Deka , et al. , titled : Population genetics of dinucleotide ( dC - dA ) n. ( dG - dT ) n polymorphisms in world populations ( Am J Hum Genet .
1995 Feb ;56(2):461-74 ) is both pertinent and long - ignored .
 We have characterized eight dinucleotide ( dC - dA ) n. ( dG - dT ) n repeat loci located on human chromosome 13 q in eight human populations and in a sample of chimpanzees .
Even though there is substantial variation in allele frequencie at each locus , at a given locus the most frequent alleles are shared by all human populations .
The microsatellite loci examined here are present and , with the exception of the locus D13S197 , are polymorphic in the chimpanzees , showing an overlapping distribution of allele sizes with those observed in human populations .
This study compares the genetic distances of eight human populations ( Samoans , North Amerindians , South Amerindians , New Guineans , Kachari [ Mongolids ] , Germans , more generalized Caucasians , and Sokoto : sub-Saharan Africans from Nigeria ) to each other and to chimpanzees .
The data were analyzed two ways - with Nei's standard genetic distance , and with modified Cavalli - Sforza distance .
Using Nei's method , the Nigerian - chimp distance was 1.334 +/- 0.375 , by far the closest value .
By the Cavalli - Sforza method , the Sokoto Nigerians were again the closest to chimps ( 0.539 ) by a large margin .
The farthest were again the South Amerindians ( 0.712 ) , with the Germans ( 0.680 ) and general Caucasians ( 0.667 ) being a very close third and fourth behind the South Amerindians as well as Samoans ( 0.711 ) and North Amerindians ( 0.697 ) .
So , while the two methods give slightly different orders , in both cases the Nigerians are by far the closest group to the chimps .
Once again , given the first method , these sub-Saharan Africans were at 1.334 while all the other groups ranged from 1.527-1.901 , and given the second method they were at 0.539 while the other groups ranged from 0.643 ( Kachari again ) to 0.712 .
Finally , there have been numerous publications asserting that modern humans are 99.9 % genetically identical .
EVEN if that were true , there are so many loci in the human genome that a tenth of a percent of them would be MILLIONS !
As one of the authors ( quoted below ) observes ,  that could explain differences  NO doubt !
However , that 99.9 figure is WRONG .
As posted September 8th , 2004 , in World Science :  New research casts doubt on the widely accepted belief that humans are 99.9 percent genetically identical .
That statement has been used to argue that race is n't real .
But two new studies suggest that percentage is too high , researchers say  The 99.9 percent number is pure nonsense ,  wrote Michael Wigler , of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , New York , in a recent e-mail .
 I will not say anything more about it .
Wigler is a co-author of one of the two studies , which is published in the July 23 advance online edition of the prestigious research journal Science .
In it , the researchers wrote that they were surprised to find large - scale differences in human DNA .
 There is considerable structural variation in the human genome [ genetic code ] , most of which was not previously apparent ,  they wrote .
Wiglers group sampled DNA from 20 people from around the world .
They detected 76 major differences among the people , differences known as copy number polymorphisms .
This means that some sections of genetic code are repeated , but the numbers of repetitions vary among people .
This could explain why people are different said Scherer , whose team reached similar findings to those of the Cold Spring Harbor group .
 At first we were astonished and did n't believe our results because for years we had been taught that most variation in DNA was limited to very small changes ,  Scherer said .
But later he learned Harvard University researchers were making similar observations , so the groups combined their data and reached the same conclusion .
The Cold Spring Harbor team found that these changes affected the code for 70 genes [ just in the small set studied ] .
These included genes involved in Cohen syndrome - a form of mental retardation - as well as brain development , leukemia , drug resistant forms of breast cancer , regulation of eating and body weight .
That [ 99.9 % ] figure has become one of the most prominent pieces of their [ race - is n't real proponents ] argument since about four years ago , when the number came from scientists associated with the Human Genome Project , a 13 - year program to map the human genetic code .
Lander - a researcher who has been quoted in published reports giving the 99.9 percent figure , and who works with the Whitehead Institute in Boston - didnt respond to phone calls and e-mails requesting comment for this story .
His secretary said he was abroad .
Also unreachable was Craig Venter , chairman of the Institute for Genomics Research in Rockville , Md. , U.S.A .
He was president of a company whose research produced the 99.9 percent figure in 2001 , Celera Genomics .
He did n't return phone calls or repeated emails .
.
Miami Universitys Jon Entine , author of ,  Taboo : Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why Were Afraid to Talk About It ,  wrote , in an e-mail :  Rats are about 95 percent the genetic equivalent of humans .
These are ridiculous statements , although technically accurate .
The use of the 99.9 percent figure by the popular press and scientists is , frankly scandalous . 
[ I agree . ]

This November , the musically inclined among you will be able to turn any music into playable Rock Band music , for profit , in under a month .
The game 's developers showed me how , unafraid their populist invention would cost them their jobs .

Here comes Rock Band 's public option .
Launching on the Xbox 360 in November and coming later to the PlayStation 3 , the Rock Band Network is one of those grand creations that just maybe could change how everything works in its corner of the video game kingdom .
Advertisement
The Network will empower anyone with about $ 160 to spend and decent music and computer skills with the ability to turn a recorded piece of music into a Rock Band song available to anyone who has an Xbox 360 version of Rock Band .
This is what the game 's developers at Harmonix have been doing for years and they 're now ending their monopoly .
The ambitious program will require a community of amateur and professional song coders to take several steps — some probably too technical to interest the average gamer — to bring a song through the process .
" This is a project that 's geared towards musicians , " Harmonix composer and sound designer Caleb Epps told Kotaku during a demo of the tools and service at MTV 's offices in New York earlier this week .
" The boon for gamers is they 're going to get access to a ton more content .
It 's far more content than we can do [ ourselves . ] "
If this all works , gamers will gain the ability to purchase countless new songs from a broader selection of music styles than any video game has offered before .
And they 'll be able to do something with them they 've not yet been able to do with Rock Band music :
Try it before they buy it .
Advertisement
At the MTV offices in Times Square earlier this week , a quartet of Harmonix employees demonstrated how Rock Band Network works .
The process begins , hopefully , with honesty .
Harmonix and MTV Games are opening their platform to anyone who has rights to pieces of music .
Those with such rights can get underway by purchasing , for a $ 60 non-commercial license , the PC and Mac audio program Reaper , a version of which has been modified for Rock Band .
The program allows the user to edit multiple MIDI tracks , associating hits of a drum , licks of a guitar or words in a song with colored - button Rock Band cues .
That coding makes it possible for a piece of music to become the stuff of Rock Band : Audio that plays if players tap , strum and sing using the game 's drums , guitars and mic , in time with colored icons that scroll down a note highway .
Advertisement
Manipulating a song in Reaper looks , at a glance , like working on a song in ProTools or other popular sound - editing software .
" We 're fully expecting people to come to the program with a little bit of musical knowledge , " Harmonix sound designer Caleb Epps told me .
If you do n't have that expertise , then coding songs for Rock Band Network is probably not for you .
But if it is , the Harmonix reps say that Reaper will feel comfortable for people who use digital audio studio programs .
Features specific to the Rock Band version of Reaper include a preview pane that shows how the part of a song will look as it scrolls through the game 's note highway .
Some shortcuts are built into the system , automatically syncing mouth animations of characters to vocals .
Drum parts can be automatically rendered for those who do n't want to code one .
For those who want depth , they can manually craft each part , even including a track for animations in the venue .
Manipulating the same system that Harmonix coders use , Rock Band Network programmers can specify how a a drummer will animate and hit each drum throughout a song .
Advertisement
The next step involves the computer program Magma , a transferring tool that brings the music file from Reaper to a user 's Xbox 360 .
This program allows a little more tweaking of a song 's levels , but is primarily intended to allow the song coder to test a playthrough of their song , using regular Rock Band instrument controllers and setting as many or as few parts to auto - play as need be .
Testing can only be done locally , not with other people networked online .
Advertisement
During these stages , a song coder can apply any cover art , upload the text of lyrics , incorporate overdive cues , assign a difficulty level and any other basics that would be involved in setting the song up for purchase and playability .
Harmonix estimates that these coding stages will take about two days for a user comfortable with the program to complete .
What follows is a process of mandatory play - testing and peer review on the Rock Band Network 's creators website .
Advertisement
Uploading a song for playtesting and participating in such tests and peer reviews requires membership in Microsoft 's XNA Creators Club , which costs $ 99 to join .
A submitted song will have to be reviewed by at least eight other people and will be checked manually and by software for quality and copyright infringement .
Play - testing last a week and peer review runs at least two days or as long as two weeks .
A two - day quarantine follows .
After that , a song will be published to the Rock Band Network Store , a separate store from the familiar Rock Band marketplace , also accessible through the game .
Publishing will happen within an hour of the song clearing those hurdles , not at an assigned weekly or monthly release time .
Advertisement
The whole process from song creation to publishing on the store would therefore take a couple of weeks , minimum .
Advertisement
Once a song is on the Rock Band Network store , gamers will be able to download and play a demo version of the song , which will last a minute or 35 % of the way into a song , whichever comes first .
Song quality can be rated with one to five " lighters , " though Harmonix attests that there will be measures taken to ensure people can't unfairly vote down a song for spite .
Songs can be sold for 80 , 160 or 240 Microsoft points , the equivalent of $ 1 , $ 2 or $ 3 .
Songs can range from 30 seconds to 10 minutes .
Albums are not supported and , while there will be a Harmoinx Picks section in the store , no special treatment is planned for bigger labels .
Users will be able to search by song author , label , genre or even just find a random track .
The person who put the song through this whole system , the song " submitter , " will earn 30 % of the revenue generated by the sale of the music .

The Rock Band Network is in beta test on the Xbox 360 .
When the service launches to the public in November , Harmonix expects there to be songs already pushed through and available for purchase .
Epps said the song - coding tools that this service makes available are " 98.75 % " the same as what Harmonix used to code songs for Rock Band .
Amatuers and the pros will be on a nearly level playing field .
But he does n't fear for his job , he said .
" I think there 's always going to be a market for premium content . "
He 's coded many , many songs himself .
" I think we 're the best in the world at this , " he said .

Dear public , can you do better ?
( A release of the Rock Band Network Store is also planned for the PlayStation 3 , though Harmonix has no date specified .
As the PS3 lacks the Creators Club amateur development infrastructure , song creation and submission would still occur through the XNA Creators Club .
Harmonix senior producer Matthew Nordhaus told Kotaku that a subset of the songs available to 360 owners would be available to PS3 users .
As for the Wii , Harmonix would like to make the store available but is uncertain how to do it but is trying to find a way .
Support for the Rock Band Network requires a software patch , and Wii games currently do n't support patches . )
Scientists suspect that parts of the San Joaquin Valley have started to sink again after years of stability , a troubling development that geologists say can be traced to increased pumping of groundwater .
State water managers are worried that falling land surfaces could damage the California Aqueduct , which carries water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta to the valley and Southern California .
To measure the extent of the problem , the U.S. Geological Survey is launching a three - year study that will use sophisticated satellite tracking to map sagging land in the valley ’s arid floor in western Fresno and Kings counties .
“ We want to know if it ’s going to be impacting the aqueduct , ” said Laurel Rogers , an agency spokeswoman .
“ Once we get some baseline data , water managers and people interested in infrastructure issues can take appropriate action . ”

Pumping has spiked in recent years as San Joaquin Valley farmers responded to drought and regulatory decisions that reduced surface water deliveries , said Peter Martin , a U.S. Geological Survey hydrologist .
The $ 225,000 project will focus on an area west of Lemoore and south of Mendota that is bisected by the concrete channels of the aqueduct .
In the past , geologists tracked changes in surface elevations with surveying tools or measuring rods installed inside wells , Martin said .
For this study , scientists will use satellite - imaging data that has been collected by European space agencies since 2003 , said Michelle Sneed , who is leading the study .
Supplemented with new images , the data will be able to track changes as they are occurring , Sneed said .
“ We ’ll use it to see if there ’s been any deformation along the aqueduct in that time period , ” she said .
“ We ’ll download new images as quickly as they become available to create a real - time monitoring pool . ”

It ’s not the first time the state has dealt with sinking land in the San Joaquin Valley .
Farmers began noticing dips in the valley floor as early as the 1920s as they drew water from underground aquifers .
Subsidence became a major issue after World War II when growers , spurred by expanding markets for fruits and vegetables , took advantage of then - new turbine pumps and drilled thousands of new wells .
Underground water tables fell faster than nature could replenish them .
Studies at the time found that over - drafting caused a 5,200 - square - mile area to sink by an average of one foot .
One area near Mendota fell an astounding 28 feet , a study found .
Advertisement
The explanation is simple , Martin said .
When aquifers are depleted of water , the clay earth above them starts to compact and everything on top crumbles with it , like a giant souffle gone flat , he said .
In the 1970s , the state ’s aqueduct system began delivering water from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta and that helped stem the problem , along with several wet winters that replenished water levels , Martin said .
But with prolonged drought , farmers are once again resorting to aquifers to irrigate their crops , he said .
Drought conditions have also prompted state water managers to reduce water exports from the delta .
Water deliveries from the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta fell to 3.6 million acre-feet for this year , down from 5.7 million acre - feet before 2008 , according to a state water report .
Advertisement
Much of the reduction , about 75 % , is due to the effects of the drought .
The other 25 % was curtailed to protect the endangered delta smelt and salmon fisheries .

When you install Linux for the first time , you will need to partition your hard drive during the install process .
If you ’re using one of the more friendly distros such as Ubuntu it will by default partition your hard drive in a logical manner ( this is called guided partitioning ) .
However the partitioning it does is very basic , if you want to get more power from your Linux install , you will need to manually partition your hard drive during the installation .
Most people shy away from this thinking that it is too difficult to know what part of the file system should get it ’s own partition and what the partition size should be .
Things , however , are not as difficult as you might believe and I will attempt to give a quick guide to how you can manually partition your hard drive to get more out of your Linux installation ( I use Ubuntu so everything will be biased towards that distro ) .
Ubuntu Guided Partitioning
To make Ubuntu easier to install for those not familiar with Linux , it provides guided partitioning .
Basically , the installation process will partition your hard drive without you having to get involved .
This is fine if you ’re new to Linux or are just not comfortable partitioning your hard drive manually .
However , guided partitioning is very basic , it simply divides your drive into two partitions .
The smaller one will be the swap partition ( this one will usually be no more than a few gigabytes ) .
The larger part of the hard drive will contain everything else ( i.e. will house the root of the file system – / ) .
While this type of partitioning is easy and will serve your basic needs , if you decide to manually allocate partition sizes for your hard drive you can get the following advantages :
isolate parts of the file system , so that they can be preserved if you reinstall the operating system ( e.g. you can reuse your home folder so that all your documents and customizations are preserved )
, so that they can be preserved if you reinstall the operating system ( e.g. you can reuse your home folder so that all your documents and customizations are preserved ) separate data that changes frequently from data that changes infrequently , which can reduce disk fragmentation and prolong the life of the system
from data that changes infrequently , which can reduce disk fragmentation and prolong the life of the system separating data that you want backed up into a separate partition can make your back up procedures much simpler
into a separate partition can make your back up procedures much simpler make your system more resilient to attack , if your system becomes the target of an attack or one of your programs behaves badly , it can create large log files or other files which can fill up the whole disk , however if you have multiple partitions , it can only ever fill up one partition which means your system is less likely to crash
Manually Partitioning Your Drive
Obviously if you decide to go with manually partitioning your drive you will need to consider the kinds of activities that are likely to occur on your system , this will determine what partitions you ’ll need .
This is completely up to you , however , generally the following parts of the Linux file system are good candidates to get their own partition ( pick and choose the ones you think you will require ) .
/ ( known as root ) – this is the root of the file system ( clearly : ) ) and will always get it ’s own partition .
Anything that does n’t get a partition of it ’s own will become part of the root partition .
/ boot – the kernel and various other data needed for the system to boot live here .
This partition can usually be pretty small .
The data on this partition changes very infrequently and therefore you may not even need the ext3 file system on it ( it can use ext2 instead ) and having it as a separate partition can facilitate this .
swap – the swap partition is used to temporarily store data when the system does not have enough RAM for it ’s current tasks .
As a guide the swap partition should be double the size of system RAM and does n’t need to be bigger than about 2 gigabytes .
These days , systems often have more than 2 Gb of RAM , but you do still need a swap partition ( a system could , technically speaking , function without a swap partition , but I would n’t recommend it ) .
Considering that disk space is so cheap these days , it is usually not an issue to have a 2 Gb ( or more ) swap partition .
The swap partition is never mounted and so does not get a mount point of it ’s own ( i.e. you wo n’t be able to browse the files on your swap partition ) .
/ home – this is where the home directories of all users of your system will live .
Having this as a separate partition allows you to reinstall the operating system without losing all your personal data .
The other advantage is , if you have a multi-user system , a single user wo n’t be able to fill up the whole drive with their data and crash the system ( at most only this partition will get filled up ) .
/ usr – most of the packages you install on the system will end up here .
Having this as a separate partition will allow you to backup or export this partition to another system easily ( if you need to ) .
/usr / local – many additional packages ( those other than Ubuntu core packages , if you ’re using Ubuntu ) , will end up here .
Some of the software packages you compile from source will also often end up here .
You can have this one as a separate partition for similar reasons to /usr .
/ opt – other packages you install and compile from source get installed here , so once again , for similar reasons to /usr and /usr / local – you might want a separate partition for it .
/ var – the data here usually changes frequently ( hence the name ) .
Much of the system log data , package and accounting information resides here .
It is a good idea to have it as a separate partition , if someone runs a job that consumes a lot of disk , this area wo n’t be affected and you will still have the information you need ( such as logs ) to diagnose the problem .
The only caveat if you ’re using Ubuntu is the fact that , the Apache web server will store all it ’s web content under /var .
So if you ’re planning to use the system as a web server , it might be prudent to configure a different location for Apache to use .
/ var / log – system logs usually live here , and so it may be a good idea to isolate the system logs from other parts of the system , considering how important logs can be do diagnose problems when something goes wrong .
/tmp – this one is pretty self explanatory .
It can be used as a temporary space to store files or for programs to write temporary data .
Strictly speaking you do n’t really need a separate partition for this , but it certainly wo n’t hurt .
Possible Sizes For Your Partitions
/ boot – usually do n’t need more than 200 M b but disk space is cheap so give it 500 Mb ( 0.5 Gb ) .
– usually do n’t need more than 200 M b but disk space is cheap so give it 500 Mb ( 0.5 Gb ) . ( swap ) – depends on amount of RAM , but for modern system with lots of RAM , make it the same size as the amount of RAM you have ( e.g. 2 Gb RAM – 2 Gb swap )
– depends on amount of RAM , but for modern system with lots of RAM , make it the same size as the amount of RAM you have ( e.g. 2 Gb RAM – 2 Gb swap ) / home – this one depends on how you plan to use the system , how many users you plan to have and the kind of work they plan to do .
It is hard to give a guide for this one , however for a single heavy user ( lots of data in home directory ) , you can plan anywhere between 20 Gb – 100 Gb or more .

/ var – if you do n’t plan to run many severs this does n’t need to be too big , so around 2 Gb should be enough .
If you do plan to run a few servers , this may need to be much bigger ( depending on what servers you plan to run ) .
Use your judgment here and remember that disk space is not expensive .
To give yourself some future flexibility make this one around 20 Gb .

This one is normally less important , give it around 10 Gb . / ( root ) – it is always a good idea to create the root partition last .
Since this partition will contain all the data which you decide not to put in a partition of it ’s own , the size required can change drastically .
If everything else has it ’s own partition then this does n’t need to be much bigger than 2 Gb or so .
However , if you decide not to have a separate partition for something else , you will need to increase the size of this partition accordingly .
Depending on the size of your drive , you may have a lot of space left over after this .
It is up to you how you dispose of that space .
You may want to increase the size of each of your partitions proportionally to use up your whole drive .
You may also want to use the rest of the space for another OS ( dual boot ) .
That ’s all there is to it .
As you can see , manually partitioning you drive during a Linux install does not have to be a major drama .
Having said that , I am not a great Linux guru , this is just the way I understand it .
If you ARE a Linux guru , or simply have some extra tips in addition to the above , please feel free to share so that everyone can learn .

I ’m out of the nonprofit world these days , but I ’ve spent some years in it , so I ’m not at a total loss as to how things work and how cultural norms accrue .
I ’ve got my opinions , to be sure .
So when I saw , via FriendFeed , a post from Beth Kanter — Seth Godin ’s Non Post About Nonprofits : Deers in the Headlights ? — I was curious .
I like both Kanter ’s and Godin ’s work and this seemed to be generating some buzz .
So I clicked over to both Kanter ’s post and to the original Godin post :
The problem with non .
Quite a bit of the conversation was on Kanter ’s site , so I joined the fray with the following post - length comment …
I was , until recently , trying to develop engagement media practices inside a public media company .
It was a disaster , but not for the reasons most nonprofit managers would point to .
It was n’t about the tiny budgets or the excessive time required .
It was about EXACTLY what Godin was talking about : resistance to change and slothful , good - enough - for - a - nonprofit management practices .
It was also because the traditionalists liked their ivory tower positions ; they liked speaking from on high to the little people in the audience .
I was told we did n’t want to get the public involved in public media — that ’s too messy .
Godin has nailed it and the reason for the violent response is precisely because he nailed it .
Lots of nonprofit workers , after a while , develop a sort of victimization mythology that serves the stagnation problem .
“ I do n’t have enough money , so I ca n’t do this , so I ca n’t make more money … woe is me .
But I ’ll keep at it because I ’m such a nice person .
And maybe someone rich will come along and notice me .
It could happen ! ” I saw that all the time .
Is it all nonprofits ?
Nope .
But it ’s a lot of them .
Of the 2 million out there , how many are really creating engaging relationships with donors or their constituents regularly ?
Maybe 10,000 ?
Whatever the number is , it ’s not enough .
Here are the key nonprofit organization questions you have to answer :
Who are you , why are you here , and why should anyone care ?
( And if you spit out a mission statement , you just failed step 1 . )
What are you doing today to build authentic , meaningful relationships with donors and potential donors ?
( Mass mailings via any means do n’t count . )
What are you doing today to build authentic , meaningful relationships with the individuals , firms or communities you serve ?
( Look up the words “ authentic ” and “ meaningful ” before you answer . )
What are you doing today to connect your donors and your beneficiaries , either directly or indirectly , so the donors feel energized and involved and the beneficiaries feel supported and involved , too ?
Or in other words , how are you building a community around your mission ?
( And broadcasting does n’t count as connecting . )
Given # 1 , what tools will best help you handle # 2 - 4 ?
( Notice I made no mention of Twitter or any other social media tool . )
charity : water is just the beginning .
There ’s a new generation of donors growing up right now and they wo n’t take your call or your e-mail or your mass mailing .
But they will respond to an earnest call for help , especially from a friend they know .
The next - gen trick is to be that friend first .
Nonprofits had best start making new friends .
Because the old ones are dying and the broadcast campaigns ( e- mail blasts , newsletters , appeal letters ) will largely die with them .
There ’s still a place for building awareness , but action will come via relationships .
Godin ’s pointing all this out through this post , his recent Tribes book and plenty of other posts .
It ’s a tough message , especially if you ’re a “ victim ” inside a change - averse nonprofit ( or a for - profit , for that matter ! ) .
From here , you can deal with it — seeking new ways to engage your community — or just hope he ’s wrong .
Frankly , I think it ’s more fun to engage with your community regardless of what Godin says .
But if proving Godin wrong sounds more fun to you , enjoy .
What I did n’t mention in my comment was my own immediate experience with fundraising for a cause via social media — via connections built across my own “ community . ”
It was a small , first effort .
But it was the collective action of a group of people with no nonprofit organization whatsoever .
We came together to help a friend we ’d literally never met .
For my generation and especially for Generations Y and Z , the old impersonal “ broadcast ” approaches used in public media and across the nonprofit spectrum will have diminishing returns .
But if I know you and you know me and we know we care about one another in some meaningful way — if we ’re engaged in each other ’s lives — the support will be there .

Joan Baez In
the tumultuous year of 1968 , Baez traveled to Nashville , where a
marathon recording session resulted in not one , but two albums : Any Day
Now , a record consisting exclusively of Dylan covers ( one , " Love Is Just A Four - Letter Word , " was never recorded by Dylan and has become a Baez staple ) and the country - infused David 's Album
recorded for husband David Harris , a prominent anti-Vietnam War
protester and organizer eventually imprisoned for draft resistance . .
Deciding
to experiment after having exhausted the " folksinger with guitar "
format , Baez turned to Peter Schickele , a classical composer , who
provided classical orchestration for her next three albums : 1966's
Noel , 1967 's Joan and 1968 's Baptism .
Noel was a Christmas album of
traditional material , while Baptism was akin to a concept album ,
featuring Baez reading and singing poems written by celebrated poets
such as James Joyce , Federico Garcia Lorca and Walt Whitman .

If the legends are to be believed , a rock star 's day is two hours of playing music and 22 hours of sex , drugs and worshipping Satan .
Are the legends true , though ?
We assembled the most unsettling myths and , wearing elbow - length rubber gloves , took a closer look .

7 Stevie Nicks Rides the White Horse
The legend :
Stevie Nicks , easily the most bangable member of Fleetwood Mac , was at one time so tolerant to the effects of cocaine use that in order to achieve a healthy , atomic - grade high she had to have it blown up her rectum .
Why it grosses us out :
Because people who snort cocaine nasally spend approximately 90 percent of their time wiping their constantly running noses .
If the legend is true , things do n't look good for that awesome dragon chair she ' sitting on .
Why we still hope it 's true :
Aside from giving us reason to discuss Stevie Nicks ' ass in social situations , it would be the most hardcore thing anyone 's done with their body since that dude at Lollapalooza hung a bowling ball off his dong .
Shoving cocaine up your ass is extra - strength crazy , unless of course it 's your source of livelihood ( apologies to any drug mules who may have been offended ) .
As an added bonus , it could be considered an anthropological throwback to the Mayans , who used to imbibe alcohol through their rectal lining via beer douches .
Tastes great and less filling !
Not that you 'll notice .
Yeah , but is it :
Nicks most certainly blew the blow , and it is biologically feasible that one could get high by reverse - farting cocaine , but we still find the claim pretty dubious .
She has publicly denied it , which could be taken as proof either way .
If someone at work started spreading a rumor that at last year ' Christmas party , you snorted cocaine through your sphincter , would you dignify it with an on - the - record denial ?
As far as the official record is concerned , the field remains wide open for a CRACKED reader brave enough to claim the title " first person to take cocaine anally . "
Get to it !
6 KISS ' Comic Book Petri Dish
The legend :
KISS , in one of the more ridiculous marketing gimmicks of the last 50 years , mixed vials of their own blood into the red ink used to color the blood for the first issue of Marvel 's KISS comic series .
Why it grosses us out :
KISS is n't exactly the model of sexual restraint .
Their blood would probably be more valuable at a clinic documenting the evolution of various strands of STDs since the ' 70s , and less valuable staining our finger tips .
We 'll stick with our Whitesnake coloring book , thank you very much .
Why we still hope it 's true :
No one does zany , goofy , ultimately innocuous horror like KISS , and what better manifestation of that than mixing their blood with comic book ink ?
Yes , they 're bleeding , but at some point that blood is going to be mixed with the palm - sweat of a thousand chubby sixteen - year - olds as they read about Ace and Gene battling space - pirates with their righteous riffs .
Really , the only way this can be considered hardcore is if you assume - as we do - that the blood was not extracted by a needle , but rather sopped up from the floor after the guys rolled in bacon fat and waded through a trough of alligators .
Yeah , but is it :
Absolutely .
KISS flew to Marvel 's inking facility in between tour stops and dumped vials of blood into the red-ink vat .
Not only is there a picture of it happening , but it was witnessed by a notary public and subject to a signed contract .
Comic fans are apparently very particular about the validity of their blood - infused inks .
You can now rest assured that if you see someone licking a KISS comic , they are either a vampire or a huge freak .
5 Mick Jagger 's Goes to Mars
The legend :
Mick " the rooster " Jagger was caught during a drug bust eating a Mars Bar from between the legs of Marianne Faithfull , as well as nude in bed with effeminate rocker David Bowie .
And , he was caught by Bowie 's wife , no less .
Why it grosses us out :
Now picture that , but without any clothes on .
Yeah .
That ' why .
Why we still hope it 's true :
We like our rockers like we like our parents : androgynous and sex-crazed .
Jagger eating a candy bar out of someone 's cooch is alright , but ultimately just another entry in the pantheon of " rockers have so much sex they get bored with it and do crazy shit " stories .
Add in some Bowie - humping , though , and you 've got rock - legend magic .
The only thing that could make it better would be if Prince had filmed the whole thing and the tape leaked to the Internet , revealing Bowie in full makeup and demanding to be called " Major Tom . "
We can dream , ca n't we ?
Yeah , but is it :
In a happy twist of fate for lovers of bizarre celebrity behavior , the Mars Bar bit is a definite no , but the Bowie - banging may actually have some truth to it .
Police did bust in on Jagger and Faithfull looking for drugs , but reported no sexual activity other than the fact that Faithfull was naked except for a large blanket .
By rock standards , she might as well have been in a burka .
As for the latter incident , Bowie 's wife detailed it on an episode of Joan Rivers ' radio show , but later claimed that the men were n't having sex , just nude in bed , which , you know , is totally normal .
4 Frank Zappa Eats Poo
The legend :
Misanthropic hermit and erstwhile experimental rocker / composer Frank Zappa got in an onstage gross - out contest with friend Captain Beefheart , in which Beefheart took a dump onstage .
Zappa then promptly won the contest -- and put Ozzy Osborne ' bat stunt to shame -- by scooping up a handful of poop and popping it in his mouth .
Why it grosses us out :
Because it ' the most disgusting thing you could possibly do , other than eating two pieces of shit .
Why we still hope it ' true :
OK , we kind of do n't , since we like Frank Zappa and it would force us to lose a healthy amount of respect for the guy .
But , his notoriously bizarre musical style , and the fact that he named his kids Moon Unit , Dweezil , Ahmet Emuukha Rodan and Diva Thin Muffin Pigeen , does n't help his case much .
Put that guy in front of a crowd , goaded on by a competition and under pressure to perform , and who knows what he 's capable of ?
As anyone who 's watched Fear Factor knows , people will eat a lot of crazy shit for very little compensation .
Of course , this would be the first time the phrase " eating crazy shit " was used so literally .
Yeah , but is it :
Despite strident and persistent claims from fans who " totally saw it happen , " it almost certainly did n't .
Zappa was actually boringly conservative for a rambling guitar rocker and was one of the most vocal anti-drug performers of his time .
When asked directly about the incident , Zappa said , " I never took a shit on stage , and the closest I ever came to eating shit anywhere was at a Holiday Inn buffet in Fayetteville , N.C. "
3 Marilyn Manson Gets Flexible
The legend :
Marilyn Manson , who decided getting breast implants and being an ordained priest in the Church of Satan did n't make him creepy enough , had his lowest set of ribs removed so he could perform autofellatio ( That ' where you blow yourself .
Read a book , dammit . ) .
Why it grosses us out :
There ' basically nothing Marilyn Manson can do that would n't make us uncomfortable .
Also , this myth requires that you acknowledge the existence of Marilyn Manson ' penis , which we 're assuming bares its fangs and writhes around like a snake when exposed to daylight .
Why we still hope it ' true :
We , uh ... have this friend that ' worried he ' going to break his neck , and we think it would just make things easier on " Ã Â ¦ our friend if this " ÃÂ ¦
Oh hell , it does not make you gay if you try it to yourself .
Ok ?
Yeah , but is it :
A thorough investigation into the matter , conducted only for the purposes of this article , proved that there is no evidence of a successful rib-removal surgery in all of the Western world .
Of course , that does n't take into account the Eastern world , as well as any surgery attempts that are n't on record .
Also , medical research conducted for this article , and only for this article , reveal that it would actually be more helpful to remove a vertebrate .
2 Rod Stewart Gets Pumped
The legend :
Rod Stewart passed out at an after party and had to get his stomach pumped after ingesting a gallon of semen .
Why it grosses us out :
A gallon of semen ?
We can't even get through a gallon of milk without throwing up .
Why we still hope it ' true :
The Rod Stewart - semen - stomach - pump story blazed a path for the same rumor to be applied to countless modern pop stars .
There was Jon Bon Jovi , various members of New Kids on the Block and , more recently , Justin Timberlake .
So , either blowing thousands of dudes is a proud tradition passed down from one pop star generation to the next , or there is an intergenerational tendency among American men to imagine popular male musicians with dicks in their mouths .
We 'll take the option where Jon Bon Jovi ' the creep and we 're just doing our jobs reporting the gruesome facts .
Yeah , but is it :
It ' almost definitely false , though Rod is n't helping his case with his denials .
In a Rolling Stone interview Stewart commented , " It was so laughable , it never really hurt me .
What could it have been ?
A fleet of fucking sailors ?
Or , footballers ? "
They cut the quote off there , but we 're assuming Stewart continued naming the professions of all of the different people he did n't blow to get that much semen in his stomach .
1 Led Zeppelin's Mud Shark
The legend :
While staying at the Edgewater Hotel in 1969 - a hotel that allows guests to fish from their room balconies - Led Zeppelin caught a mud shark and then proceeded to use it sexually on a bound groupie .
Exactly how is a matter for grim speculation only .
Why it grosses us out :
Because it sounds like an even more disturbing version of the most disturbing scene in A Clockwork Orange .
It also , for whatever reason , makes us acknowledge the existence of Marilyn Manson ' dick again .
Why we still hope it ' true :
The way we heard it , the chick was totally into it , which helps undercut the " Oh , my God , that 's horrific " factor .
Still , a shark ?
And , you thought that little pussy - riding prop you brought home to spice things up was " edgy . "
Try introducing Jaws to your significant other 's privates and see if one or both of you does n't end up taking a trip to the emergency room .
This legend is also appealing because it takes some of the sting out of realizing your favorite rock band is singing primarily about Lord of the Rings characters .
Zep are n't nerds , man !
Zep boned a chick with a fucking shark !
Yeah , but is it :
Sort of , but in a stripped - down , pathetic kind of way .
The widely accepted " true version " of the legend is that the band 's road manager Richard Cole caught a red snapper , and , as the groupie in question was a natural red-head , made the inevitable lame joke and applied the fish to her crimson honeypot .
Legend also has it that John Bonham was present , but otherwise engaged in a rousing game of Dungeons and Dragons .

Drivers ' should always be blamed for cycle crashes '
Motorists should be made legally responsible for all accidents involving cyclists , even if they are not at fault , say Government advisers .
Cycling England , an agency funded by the Transport Department , wants the civil law to be changed so drivers or their insurers would automatically be liable for compensation claims .
The proposal will infuriate drivers , many of whom are angered by the antics of ' Lycra louts ' - cyclists who sail through red lights , go the wrong way up one - way streets and intimidate pedestrians on pavements and zebra crossings .
Road wars :
The Cycling England agency wants the most powerful vehicle involved in a crash automatically liable for compensation or insurance claims ( file picture )
It comes after ministers suggested allowing cyclists to ride the wrong way down one - way streets in an attempt to encourage more people to switch to two wheels .
The proposal by Cycling England is modelled on regulations in the Netherlands , Denmark , and Germany , which are heavily skewed in favour of cyclists .
Even in cases where a crash results from illegal or dangerous manoeuvres by the cyclist , the motorist is usually blamed .
The motorist is always legally responsible for any crash involving a child or elderly cyclist , even if they are cycling in the wrong direction , ignoring traffic signals , or otherwise flouting traffic regulations .
Now cyclists ' groups want similar measures included in the Government 's forthcoming National Cycling Plan and Active Transport Strategy .
As well as cyclists , pedestrians would also be assumed not to be at fault in civil law if hit by a car .
The ' most powerful vehicle ' involved in a crash would automatically be liable .
Where a cyclist was hit by a car , the presumption of blame would fall on the driver .
Cyclists would automatically be blamed if they hit a pedestrian .
The proposals would not apply to the criminal law .
Cyclists ' groups say the reforms would encourage people to get out of their cars and make more journeys by bicycle or on foot .
A report being prepared by officials for ministers is expected to recommend that councils should introduce 20 mph zones in residential streets where there are high numbers of cyclists or pedestrians .
Phillip Darnton , chief executive of Cycling England , said : ' I would like to see the legal onus placed on motorists when there are accidents ; speed limits reduced to 20 mph on suburban and residential roads ; cycling taught to all schoolchildren ; and cycling provision included in major planning applications . '
Ministers have already suggested allowing cyclists to ride the wrong way down one - way streets .
A pilot project is being launched in Kensington and Chelsea that will permit cyclists to ignore ' No entry ' signs .
A plaque will be attached to the signs saying ' Except cycles ' .
The Cycling England proposals could fuel tensions between motorists and cyclists .
Edmund King , president of the AA , said : ' Many cyclists are motorists and many motorists are cyclists .
Simple changes in the law that assume one party is in the wrong because of what they drive will not help harmony on the roads . '
A Department for Transport spokesman said : ' This is something that gets raised by pressure groups from time to time .
' Cycling England has proposed it , but it is not something that is being considered by ministers . '
( CNN ) -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara , a key architect of the U.S. war in Vietnam under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson , has died at age 93 , according to his family .
Robert McNamara took a lead role in managing the U.S. military commitment in Vietnam .
McNamara was a member of Kennedy 's inner circle during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 , when the United States and the Soviet Union stood on the brink of nuclear war .
But he became a public lightning rod for his management of the war in Vietnam , overseeing the U.S. military commitment there as it grew from fewer than 1,000 advisers to more than half a million troops .
Though the increasingly unpopular conflict was sometimes dubbed " McNamara 's War , " he later said both administrations were " terribly wrong " to have pursued military action beyond 1963 .
" External military force cannot reconstruct a failed state , and Vietnam , during much of that period , was a failed state politically , " he told CNN in a 1996 interview for the " Cold War " documentary series .
" We did n't recognize it as such . "
A native of San Francisco , McNamara studied economics at the University of California and earned a master 's degree in business from Harvard .
He was a staff officer in the Army Air Corps during World War II , when he studied the results of American bombing raids on Germany and Japan in search of ways to improve their accuracy and efficiency .
After the war , he joined the Ford Motor Company and became its president in November 1960 -- the first person to lead the company from outside its founding family .
A month later , the newly elected Kennedy asked him to become secretary of defense , making him one of the " whiz kids " who joined the young president 's administration .
In October 1962 , after the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba , McNamara was one of Kennedy 's top advisers in the standoff that followed .
The United States imposed a naval " quarantine " on Cuba , a Soviet ally , and prepared for possible airstrikes or an invasion .
The Soviets withdrew the missiles in exchange for a U.S. guarantee not to invade Cuba , a step that allowed Soviet premier Nikita Kruschev to present the pullback as a success to his own people .
Do n't Miss TIME.com : No escape from Vietnam for McNamara
In the 2003 documentary " The Fog of War , " McNamara told filmmaker Errol Morris that the experience taught American policymakers to " put ourselves inside their skin and look at us through their eyes . "
But he added , " In the end , we lucked out .
It was luck that prevented nuclear war . "
McNamara is credited with using the management techniques he mastered as a corporate executive to streamline the Pentagon , computerizing and smoothing out much of the U.S. military 's vast purchasing and personnel system .
And in Vietnam , he attempted to use those techniques to measure the progress of the war .
Metrics such as use of " body counts " and scientific solutions such as using the herbicide Agent Orange to defoliate jungles in which communist guerrillas hid became trademarks of the conflict .
McNamara made several trips to South Vietnam to study the situation firsthand .
He , Johnson and other U.S. officials portrayed the war as a necessary battle in the Cold War , a proxy struggle to prevent communism from taking control of all of Southeast Asia .
But while they saw the conflict as another front in the standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union , which backed communist North Vietnam , McNamara acknowledged later that they underestimated Vietnamese nationalism and opposition to the U.S. - backed government in Saigon .
" The conflict within South Vietnam itself had all of the characteristics of a civil war , and we did n't look upon it as largely a civil war , and we were n't measuring our progress as one would have in what was largely a civil war , " he told CNN .
Casualties mounted , as did domestic opposition to the war .
In 1965 , a Quaker anti-war protester , Norman Morrison , set himself on fire outside McNamara 's office window .
In 1967 , tens of thousands of demonstrators marched on the Pentagon , which was ringed with troops .
By November 1967 , McNamara told Johnson that there was " no reasonable way " to end the war quickly , and that the United States needed to reduce its forces in Vietnam and turn the fighting over to the American - backed government in Saigon .
By the end of that month , Johnson announced he was replacing McNamara at the Pentagon and moving him to the World Bank .
But by March 1968 , Johnson had reached virtually the same conclusion as McNamara .
He issued a call for peace talks and announced he would not seek re-election .
After leaving the Pentagon in early 1968 , McNamara spent 12 years leading the World Bank .
He said little publicly about Vietnam until the publication of a 1995 memoir , " In Retrospect . "
" You do n't know what I know about how inflammatory my words can appear , " he told Morris .
" A lot of people misunderstand the war , misunderstand me .
A lot of people think I 'm a son of a bitch . "

( CNN ) -- San Diego Chargers linebacker Shawne Merriman was arrested early Sunday on suspicion of choking and restraining MTV reality show star Tila Tequila , police said .
Shawne Merriman is accused of restraining reality TV star Tila Tequlia as she tried to leave his home , police say .
However , Merriman 's attorney denied the allegations , saying more than a dozen other people were at Merriman 's house in suburban San Diego , California , at the time of the incident and " witness after witness after witness will back up his story 100 percent . "
Authorities responded to a disturbance call about 3:45 a.m.
Sunday from a woman who said she had been choked and restrained by a male , the sheriff 's department of San Diego County , California , said in a statement .
When police arrived , " the reporting party identified herself as Tila Nguyen , aka Tila Tequila , and her alleged assailant as Shawne Merriman , " the statement said .
" Nguyen told deputies she had been choked and physically restrained by Merriman when she attempted to leave his residence , " the statement said .
Watch Merriman 's side of the story »
Nguyen signed a citizen 's arrest at the scene , and Merriman was taken into custody on suspicion of battery and false imprisonment , according to the statement .
Deputies did n't see any physical injuries on Nguyen , but she asked to be transported to a local hospital , sheriff 's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said .
Nguyen 's condition was not immediately known .
Merriman 's attorney , Todd Macaluso , told reporters that Nguyen was " extremely intoxicated and inebriated " and that the player tried to make arrangements for her to leave the house .
" At no time did Mr. Merriman assault her .
At no time did Mr. Merriman keep her against her will , " Macaluso said .
" His intentions were nothing but good .
...
We 're very confident that this matter will be resolved without any charges being filed whatsoever . "
Caldwell said alcohol " was involved " on Nguyen 's part .
Caldwell did n't elaborate .
Merriman was released from jail late Sunday morning .
Caldwell said she did n't know whether Merriman was released on bail or on his own recognizance .
The district attorney 's office will determine whether criminal charges will be pursued , Caldwell said .
As Tila Tequila , Nguyen starred on the MTV reality shows " A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila " in 2007 and " A Shot at Love 2 With Tila Tequila " in 2008 .
On her Twitter account , Nguyen did not mention the incident but tweeted about going to meet Merriman on Saturday .
In a statement posted on the Chargers ' Web site Sunday , team General Manager A.J. Smith said it is " disappointing to hear about the issue involving Shawne Merriman . "
" We 'll continue to monitor the situation and let the legal process run its course , " Smith said .
Merriman , a three - time Pro Bowl selection , is entering his fifth year with the Chargers and the NFL .
He recorded at least 10 sacks in each of his first three seasons , but he was limited to one game last season because of a knee injury that required surgery .
The Chargers begin their 2009 NFL regular - season campaign on September 14 in Oakland , California , for a game against the Raiders .

Lifestyle Inflation Is About More Than You
Once you trade up , you are never going back .
Lifestyle inflation is a real phenomenon that I ’ve surprisingly seldom talked about .
Basically , it refers to the strikingly true fact that most people increase their spending as their income increases no matter how much or how little they earn .
Stepping up the standard of living ladder is fun but it absolutely sucks for people who have to scale back .
Now that we are expecting our first child , we should not only think about the danger of our own inflation bubble but also of our children’s .
My parents always reminded me that they were very happy making their own games with paper .
In fact , they said it was one of the happiest times of their lives .
But in this day and age of Nintendo Wiis and Sony Playstations , kids would look at you like you are crazy if you even hint at playing those paper games .
It ’s not that the games of old are no good .
It ’s just that they are used to much more complication toys .
In fact , Inflation Starts the Second You Are Born
My mom called me the other day and told me she bought some baby underclothes for her grandchild , but when she saw softer , more expensive versions , she bought the nicer ones and returned the ones she already purchased .
My immediate thought was “ what if the baby gets used to the really nice undershirt and cry when we give her standard ones ?
Are we going to expose our children to the higher standard right from the beginning ? ”
Other , Bigger , More Important Aspects of Our Standard of Living
Fortunately , baby clothes is a relatively minor issue .
What ’s more important is the bigger ticket items , like …
The House – Living in Southern California , we live literally a few miles from the ultra rich .
Emma and I agreed that we should n’t live in a place where our house would fall in the same school district as those multi-million dollar homes because we rather have our kids grow up not being exposed to some of the reckless parents who shower their kids with money .
– Living in Southern California , we live literally a few miles from the ultra rich .
Emma and I agreed that we should n’t live in a place where our house would fall in the same school district as those multi-million dollar homes because we rather have our kids grow up not being exposed to some of the reckless parents who shower their kids with money .
The Car – Last night , Emma suggested that we should n’t ever buy our kids a high priced vehicle as a teenager in a luxury car zipped by us .
How is the child ever going to live below their means if you start them off with a Ferrari on their 16th birthday ?
I used to think that lifestyle inflation is perfectly fine if you have confidence that you can forever keep it up .
However , the statement is flawed .
Inflation is only okay if you can ensure that you , your children and every decedent of yours can cope with a possible deflation .
Even if you do n’t want to curb your own lifestyle inflation , at least do it for your children .
One of the problems we use to see frequently on Green Felt happened when we ’d update a Javascript API :
We ’d add some parameters to some library function and then update some other files so that they called the function with the new parameters .
But when we ’d push the changes to the site we ’d end up with few users that somehow had the old version of one of the files stuck in their cache .
Now their browser is causing old code to call new code or new code to call old code and the site does n’t work for them .
We ’d then have to explain how to reset their cache ( and of course every browser has different instructions ) and hope that if they did n’t write back that everything went OK .
This fragility annoyed us and so we came up with a solution :
We replaced all of our < script > tags with calls to a custom “ script ” function in our HTML template system ( we use Template : : Toolkit ; [ % script ( " sht.js " ) %] is what the new calls look like ) .
tags with calls to a custom “ script ” function in our HTML template system ( we use Template : : Toolkit ; is what the new calls look like ) .
The “ script ” function is a native perl function that does a number of things : Reads the Javascript file into memory .
While reading it understands C style “ #include ” directives so we can structure the code nicely ( though we actually do n’t take advantage of that yet )
Uses JavaScript :: Minifier :: XS to minify the resulting code .
Calculates the SHA hash of the minified code .
Saves the minified code to a cache directory where it is named based on its hash value which makes the name globally unique ( it also keeps it ’s original name as a prefix so debugging is sane ) .
Keeps track of the original script name , the minified script ’s globally unique name , and the dependencies used to build the image .
This is stored in a hash table and also saved to the disk for future runs .
It returns a script tag that refers to the globally unique Javascript file back to the template which ends up going out in the html file .
For example , < script src="js/sht-bfe39ec2e457bd091cb6b680873c4a90.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script >
There ’s actually a step 0 in there too .
If the original Javascript file name is found in the hash table then it quickly stats its saved dependencies to see if they are newer than the saved minified file .
If the minified file is up to date then steps 1 through 5 are skipped .
The advantages of this approach
It solves the original problem .
When the user refreshes the page they will either get the page from their browser cache or they will get it from our site .
No matter where it came from the Javascript files it references are now uniquely named so that it is impossible for the files to be out of date from each other .
That is , if you get the old html file you will reference all the old named Javascript files and everything will be mutually consistent ( even though it is out of date ) .
If you get the new html file it guarantees you will have to fetch the latest Javascript files because the new html only references the new hashed names that are n’t going to be in your browser cache .
It ’s fast .
Everything is cached so it only does the minification and hash calculations once per file .
We ’re obviously running FastCGI so the in memory cache goes across http requests .
More importantly the js / dir is statically served by the web server so it ’s exactly as fast as it was before we did this ( since we served the .js files without any preprocessing ) .
All this technique adds is a couple filesystem stats per page load , which is n’t much .
It ’s automatic .
There ’s no script to remember to run when we update the site .
We just push our changes up to the site using our version control and the script lazily takes care of rebuilding any files that may have gone out of date .
So you might be thinking , is n’t all that dependency stuff hard and error prone ?
Well , it ’s really only one line of perl code :
sub max_timestamp(@ ) { max map { ( stat $ _ ) [ 9 ] || 0 } @_ } # Obviously 9 is mtime
It ’s stateless .
It does n’t rely on incrementing numbers ( “ js/v10/script.js ” or even “ js/script-v10.js ” ) .
We considered this approach but decided it was actually harder to implement and had no advantages over the way we chose to do it .
This may have been colored by our chosen version control system ( darcs ) where monotonically increasing version numbers have no meaning .
It allows aggressive caching .
Since the files are named by their contents ’ hash , you can set the cache time up to be practically infinite .
It ’s very simple to understand .
It took less than a page of perl code to implement the whole thing and it worked the first time with no bugs .
I believe it ’s taken me longer to write this blog post than it took to write the code ( granted I ’d been thinking about it for a long time before I started coding ) .
No files are deleted .
The old js files are not automatically deleted ( why bother , they are tiny ) so people with extremely old html files will not have inconsistent pages when they reload .
However :
The js / dir is volatile .
It ’s written so we can rm js / * at any point and it will just recreate what it needs to on the next request .
This means there ’s nothing to do when you unpack the source into a new directory while developing .
You get a bit of history .
Do a quick ls - lrt of the directory and you can see which scripts have been updated recently and in what order they got built .
What it does n’t solve
While it does solve the problem of Javascript to Javascript API interaction , it does not help with Javascript to server API interaction –it does n’t even attempt to solve that issue .
The only way I know to solve that is to carefully craft the new APIs in parallel with the old ones so that there is a period of time where both old and new can work while the browser caches slowly catch up with your new world .
And …
It seems to work
I ’ve seen similar schemes discussed but I ’ve not seen exactly what we ended up with .
It ’s been working well for us –I do n’t think I ’ve seen a single bug from a user in a couple months that is caused by inconsistent caching of Javascript files by the browser .

Erik Prince 's company Blackwater ( now known as XE ) has been embroiled in controversy for years .
Company employees have posted videos online of their own ruthless behavior and abuses against Iraqi citizens , and can be heard laughing off camera .
We 're now finding out that this brutality most likely came from the top , down from Prince himself -- former employees are finding their consciences and telling horrifying stories about their former boss :
A former Blackwater employee and an ex-US Marine who has worked as a security operative for the company have made a series of explosive allegations in sworn statements filed on August 3 in federal court in Virginia .
The two men claim that the company 's owner , Erik Prince , may have murdered or facilitated the murder of individuals who were cooperating with federal authorities investigating the company .
The former employee also alleges that Prince " views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe , " and that Prince 's companies " encouraged and rewarded the destruction of Iraqi life . "
In their testimony , both men also allege that Blackwater was smuggling weapons into Iraq .
One of the men alleges that Prince turned a profit by transporting " illegal " or " unlawful " weapons into the country on Prince 's private planes .
They also charge that Prince and other Blackwater executives destroyed incriminating videos , emails and other documents and have intentionally deceived the US State Department and other federal agencies .
The identities of the two individuals were sealed out of concerns for their safety .

Of course , the big news all last week was the “ emotional outburst ” of Joe Wilson , Republican congressman from South Carolina .
Briefly , in defiance of congressional protocol , in defiance of military protocol ( Joe Wilson is a retired Colonel in the National Guard ) , and in defiance of what his momma must have taught him was good manners ( not that it seems to matter much these days ) , Joe interrupted President Obama ’s speech on health care with the cry of “ You Lie ! ” Besides calling into mind Invader Zim accusing earthling Dib of lying when Dib claims that Zim is …well , an alien invader , it also brings to mind the setting of the argument in that august show–a school playground .
Wilson claimed that he was just so overwrought by emotion that the incident just sorta happened and has tried to get away with a private apology to Obama for a rather public insult .
Wilson ’s account is disingenuous at best .
It ’s easier to see in his actions his own little version of General Beauregard opening fire on Fort Sumter , a direct opening salvo in the war against Obama .
Joe , confused about the appropriateness of the town hall antics of the summer , fully expected the body of Republican Senators and Representatives to join in on calling Obama a liar and disrupt the speech completely in a chant of liar , liar , pants on fire .
They did n’t , and Joe slunk away at the end of the speech , tail between his legs , calling the White House to offer a lame “ I ’m sowwy – I have kids in the service . ”
Whatever THAT has to do with it .
But Joe ’s tail did n’t stay between his legs for long !
Not with Michele Malkin and Glenn Beck and the host of other rabblerousers calling him an American hero !
Joe ’s got his nuts back and he ’s refusing to apologize to Congress for a censurable offence when he ’s already apologized –in private –to the President .
His heart must have leapt when he heard the Taxation Protesters echoing his accusation in chants of “ Liar , Liar , pant on fire ” this weekend .
Is it really about the prospect of illegally aliens getting free medical services under the still yet undefined Health Care plan ?
Especially when , as many observers have already pointed out , the proposed bills have language specifically excluding benefits to unofficial immigrants .
Especially , as Donny Shaw pointed out on Open Congress , that Joe Wilson himself voted to reimburse hospitals for services rendered to uninsured illegal aliens back in 2003 .
Aaaaaahhhh , but that was under a REPUBLICAN Administration … with a white President .
I ca n’t help but think that this whole thing is part and parcel of some crazy - ass pipe dream that when some deluded “ patriot ” shoots Obama–as some of the crazies who ’ve shown up with guns at the town hall meetings seem to be advocating ( and many more secretly hoping for it ) –he ’ll be taken to the local hospital where HE WILL BE DENIED TREATMENT because he does n’t have a valid HAWAIIAN BIRTH CERTIFICATE !
Would n’t that be poetic justice for tryin ’ to push Commie medicine down our throats and , at the same time , validate our paranoid fantasies ?
Then God will intervene and install Sarah Palin to her rightful place on the throne .
It ’s getting dangerous to be sane .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Both the money supply and federal spending have increased at breathtaking rates over the past year , unprecedented in peacetime .
The policy decisions made by the Federal Reserve Board and Congress virtually assure we will enter a period of 1970s - like stagflation .
The recovery , when it comes , will combine slow economic growth , unusually long un - and underemployment , stagnating real incomes , rising interest rates and inflation .
There is little that policymakers , having made colossal mistakes , can do to prevent such an outcome .
However , there are steps that can be taken to shorten the period of stagflation and return to an era of robust economic growth , good jobs and stable asset and consumer prices .
The money supply is measured several different ways .
They all show alarming increases .
The monetary base ( coins , currency and bank reserves ) has doubled over the past year .
It is increasing at a rate 12 times the average since 1981 .
M1 ( the monetary base plus checking deposits ) increased last year by roughly 16 percent , a near record and three times faster than average since 1981 .
M2 ( M1 plus most savings deposits and money market funds ) increased 9 percent in the past 12 months ( a rate more than 50 percent higher than the average since 1981 ) .
The demand for money is relatively stable and generally increases in proportion with economic activity ( although precautionary motives play a role ) .
Given the huge increases in the money supply and credit , future inflation is virtually ensured .
Money supply will outstrip money demand , and the excess money will cause prices to be bid up .
The prices of gold and other commodities provide real - time indicators of future inflation .
They have been rising substantially for the past three to six months , depending on the commodity .
It is not certain , however , whether this price inflation will manifest in consumer prices or the asset markets ( the stock and real estate markets ) or both .
Equally alarming , fiscal 2009 federal outlays were $ 3,938 billion compared to $ 2,983 billion in fiscal 2008 - a 34 percent increase in one year .
Federal spending has grown from 21 percent to 28.1 percent of gross domestic product in only one year .
Only during the last three years of World War II has federal spending been a larger share of the economy .
These figures understate the degree to which federal spending and credit creation have increased because various federal entities have guaranteed something on the order of $ 10 trillion to $ 12 trillion in private debt .
Inflating asset prices in support of Wall Street , the banks and consumers who are upside - down on their mortgages is , presumably , a major , if unstated , goal of Fed policy .
The Japanese proved in their “ lost decade , ” however , that artificially propping up asset prices with cheap credit and government spending while failing to recognize losses and moving on is a recipe for stagnation .
Interest rates are low because of the massive credit and money creation .
But as it dawns on investors that significant future inflation is virtually certain , long - term rates are starting to creep up .
Long - term Treasury bond rates already have risen from 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent over the past eight weeks .
They will continue to rise as investors demand larger premiums to compensate for inflation and the tax on purely inflationary gains .
The real measure of the federal economic footprint is not the tax burden , but the spending level .
Right now , federal taxes barely pay for half of federal spending .
It is frightening when one considers that the taxes paid by the taxpaying public would have to double to pay for the current level of spending .
The rest of the federal government ’s spending is paid for by borrowing ( which is money not available to the private sector to spend or invest ) or by creating money to buy federal bonds ( which devalues everyone ’s assets and salaries with inflation ) .
The dead - weight loss to the economy of a 34 percent increase in federal spending is quite large and will serve as a continuing drag on economic performance , as can be seen in the decades of poor performance in most European economies .
Substantial George W. Bush - era spending increases , while not as dramatic as recent spending increases , are also part of the reason for lackluster economic performance over the past several years .
An economic train wreck is coming .
Its cause is simple and straightforward : the breathtakingly bad monetary and fiscal policy during the past six to nine months - in other words , too much money and too much federal spending .
The first thing policymakers need to do is to stop doing harm .
The Fed needs to immediately raise the federal funds target interest rate and slow money growth to normal levels .
Congress needs to return federal spending to a more normal 19 percent to 23 percent of gross domestic product .
It should reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate , currently the second - highest rate among industrialized nations , and , if possible , reform the tax system to promote work , savings and investment .
Finally , it needs to control rather than exacerbate federal entitlement spending .
Instead , the Obama administration seems bent on doubling down and making a bad situation even worse with massive increases in business and individual taxes , nationalizing or taking control of major industries ( including automakers , banks , insurance and health care ) , hidden but huge energy - cost increases in pursuit of the chimera of global warming and ever greater entitlement spending .
The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated the Democrats ’ health reform plan would increase federal spending a further $ 1.3 trillion over 10 years .
Stagflation is baked in the cake .
The question remains whether policymakers take the necessary steps to shorten the period of stagflation .

Sassate nella notte contro la sede Pd di Cavriglia
di Simona Poli
( 28 settembre 2009 )
UN COMMENTO RICEVUTO
Spaccati i vetri del portone della sede del Pd di Cavriglia , in provincia di Arezzo , proprio mentre stanno per concludersi i congressi dei circoli per l´elezione del segretario nazionale e regionale .
Sabato notte contro l´ingresso del partito qualcuno ha lanciato due grosse pietre e ora i carabinieri stanno indagando sull´episodio .
« Probabilmente si tratta di una ragazzata » , si affretta a dire l´ex sindaco Enzo Brogi , consigliere regionale del Pd e presidente della commissione Attività culturali e turismo .
« Ma preoccupa il fatto che si prenda a bersaglio la sede di un partito .
Questo è segno di imbarbarimento nella vita sociale » .
Il paese di Cavriglia , aggiunge Brogi , che per primo ha dato l´allarme , « rappresenta da sempre un modo sano di fare e vivere la politica , la storia ci caratterizza come una terra dalle grandi tradizioni popolari , dove ha sempre prevalso la tolleranza .
Oggi purtroppo Cavriglia deve subire un episodio grave » .
Le sassate sulla sede del Pd , commenta il segretario toscano Andrea Manciulli , « sono un esempio di intolleranza , di vandalismo e di inciviltà » .
Un altro dei candidati alla segreteria regionale , l´assessore franceschiniano Agostino Fragai sostiene che l´episodio di Cavriglia sia un brutto segnale , visto il clima in cui avviene : « Pare che in questo paese ci siano persone che ancora considerano la politica oggetto di scherno o , peggio ancora , i partiti come avversari da combattere non con la politica ma con l´utilizzo della violenza » , dice Fragai , « Mi auguro che al più presto possano essere individuati i responsabili » .
Di atto vandalico grave parla anche il presidente della Toscana Claudio Martini : « Un gesto che esprime intolleranza e inciviltà in un territorio che ha sempre avuto una tradizione di confronto politico leale » , osserva .
« Il ricorso alla violenza è sempre da condannare e non è certo questa la strada per esprimere una divergenza di opinioni » .
Il lancio di pietre coincide con un momento particolare della vita del Pd , alle prese in questi giorni con la conta dei voti per le mozioni congressuali che si sta svolgendo in tutti i circoli .
A Firenze le votazioni sono quasi finite , oggi saranno chiamati ad esprimere la loro preferenza gli iscritti dell´ultimo seggio cittadino , l ´Andrea del Sarto .
A bilancio quasi completo si può dire che la gara tra i due principali candidati nazionali si sia risolta a Firenze con la vittoria di Pierluigi Bersani , che è a quota 43,90 mentre Dario Franceschini - che sembrava destinato a prevalere - arriva a 40,31 .
Ignazio Marino , invece , segue a 15,8 per cento , un risultato considerato soddisfacente dai sostenitori della sua mozione .
Sul fronte regionali , in attesa dei dati definitivi , l´andamento è costante : Manciulli oltrepassa notevolmente la quota di Bersani ma Fragai va molto peggio di Franceschini , mentre Simone Siliani si attesta più o meno in linea con Marino .
Decisamente a favore di Franceschini è lo scrutinio del seggio unico di Scandicci , dove il segretario uscente del Pd ( sostenuto dal sindaco Simone Gheri , che lo ha recentemente ospitato per un comizio in piazza Matteotti ) ottiene il 63,9 per cento contro il 28,3 di Bersani e il 7,6 di Marino .
Diverso a Scandicci il risultato della competizione per la segreteria regionale dove Manciulli vince col 46,3 staccando Fragai che è al 38,4 e Siliani al 15,3 .
A Sesto Fiorentino , invece , Bersani arriva primo col 60,2 , seguito da Franceschini col 35,8 e Marino che arriva solo al 4 per cento .
Sul fronte toscano Manciulli raggiunge il 69,6 , Fragai è al 20,8 e Siliani al 9,5 .
E a Piombino , nella sua " patria " , il segretario toscano fa cappotto , vincendo addirittura col 91 per cento .
Con questo exploit Manciulli batte anche Bersani , che pure a Piombino svetta sugli altri candidati con l´85 per cento .
Anche l´affluenza è straordinaria : vota a Piombino l´80 per cento degli iscritti , contro una media regionale intorno al 50 per cento ( con qualche eccezione : a Calenzano ha votato oltre il 67 per cento ) .
In the Supreme Court this week , Elena Kagan , the new solicitor general , eloquently defended the longstanding ban on corporate spending in political campaigns .
But the conservative justices who spoke showed a disdain for both Congress ’s laws and for the court ’s own prior rulings .
If the ban is struck down , as we fear , elections could be swamped by special - interest money .
Conservative jurists talk about judicial modesty and deferring to the elected branches .
But in the questioning , Justice Antonin Scalia made clear that he considers Congress to be a self - interested actor when it writes campaign finance laws .
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito seemed to put little weight on the fact that the court has repeatedly upheld a ban on corporate campaign expenditures .
What the conservatives seemed most concerned about was protecting the interests of corporations .
The chief justice and Justice Scalia seemed especially perturbed that what they see as the inviolable right of these legal constructs to speak might be infringed upon .
The conservatives also seemed incredulous that vast amounts of corporate money flooding into campaigns could be seen as corrupting the system .
We agree with Senator John McCain , who told reporters after the argument that he was troubled by the “ extreme naïveté ” some of the justices showed about the role of special - interest money in Congressional lawmaking .
If you ’re searching for a bright spot in a dismal economic climate , look no farther than your roof .
The downturn is helping to make solar panels more affordable .
Manufacturers are cutting prices to move inventory .
Uncle Sam is helping too .
As part of the economic stimulus package , the federal government this year boosted tax credits to homeowners who switch to solar power .
Together with state incentives , those subsidies could slash the cost of some systems in California by 50 % or more .
Some homeowners are banding together into buying groups for even bigger savings .
If you do n’t have a lot of extra cash lying around , innovative financing can help you spread your payments out as long as 20 years .
Or you can take advantage of leasing deals to get panels on your home for little or no money down .
June was a record month for state rebate applications by California homeowners .
Some of them are opting for the steady returns that come from lowering their energy bills rather than betting on volatile stocks or real estate .

So shake off the recession gloom and let the sun shine in .
Here ’s how to go solar without going broke .
The basics
A well - designed solar - power system can reduce your annual electricity expense to zero over the 25 - to 30 - year life of the panels .
Spending $ 20,000 or more on a system today amounts to pre-paying your power bill for the next three decades .
Is that a smart decision ?
Advertisement
If your aim is to help the planet , the answer is a resounding yes .
If you ’re looking to save money , it depends .
Not all homes are good candidates .
Generally , the higher your current electric bill and the sunnier your roof , the more solar makes sense .
Still , payback can easily take a decade or more .
You ’ll need to crunch some numbers .
Reputable solar installers will be glad to help you figure the payback period , lifetime savings and rate of return , free of charge .
If you want a ballpark estimate without the sales pressure , check out the calculators section on the state ’s Go Solar California website .
A particularly good one is the state ’s own Clean Power Estimator .

Once you ’ve made the decision to go solar , your final cost will depend on four main factors .
* System size -- Solar modules typically are priced by the DC or direct current watt .
A typical - size system in Southern California ranges between 4 kilowatts ( 4,000 watts ) and 5 kilowatts ( 5,000 watts ) .
* Panel prices --
They ’re falling .
That ’s a good thing .
* California rebate --
The state subsidy is declining .
That ’s not such a good thing .
Advertisement
* Federal Investment Tax Credit --
A once - modest incentive just turned into a really big deal this year .
Let ’s take a closer look at those last three .
A buyer ’s market
Demand for solar - power systems in much of the world has slowed along with the global economy .
Meanwhile , solar - cell factories planned when the market was booming are coming on line .
The result : too many panels and too few buyers .
To move them , companies are cutting module prices .
Advertisement
In the U.S. , wholesale prices for top-quality modules made of crystalline silicon have fallen by 50 % over the last year to around $ 2.40 a watt , according to Nathaniel Bullard , solar analyst with New Energy Finance in Alexandria , Va .
“ It ’s really a precipitous drop , ” Bullard said .
“ The mood in the industry is grim . ”
Panels typically account for less than half of the final “ retail ” price most consumers pay for solar .
Unless you ’re a do - it - yourselfer , you ’ll need to hire a professional installer whose add - ons will include labor , permits , taxes and an inverter to convert the direct current electricity generated by the solar array into alternating current suitable for appliances .
Retail prices have n’t fallen in lock step with panels , but there ’s no question that they ’re coming down fast .
Some residential systems that were retailing for $ 9 a watt to $ 10 a watt installed before the recession can now be had for about $ 7.50 a watt .
Homeowners who join together to buy in volume are snagging complete systems for a little more than $ 6 a watt .
Big commercial buyers are paying even less .
Advertisement
And that ’s before factoring in government subsidies .
“ Jobs are very competitive , and that ’s translating into lower prices , ” said Ron Kenedi , vice president of Sharp Solar Energy Solutions Group , the U.S. solar arm of Sharp Corp .
“ This is the perfect time to buy solar . ”
If that sounds like sales hype , here ’s something to consider : Analysts are predicting further declines in panel prices , so waiting could save you some money .
Or it could end up costing you a bundle .
Advertisement
That ’s because another major incentive -- the California subsidy -- becomes less valuable the longer you wait .
Great state rebate
The California Solar Initiative provides rebates to owners who install solar panels on existing homes .
The 10 - year , $ 3 - billion program , which launched in 2007 , is funded by the state ’s utility ratepayers .
These rebates are based on a system ’s size , performance -- and timing .
Californians who purchase sooner , rather than later , are eligible for the biggest subsidies .
That ’s because the rebates are programmed to drop every time the state reaches a certain target of megawatts installed .
Advertisement
For customers of the state ’s three large investor - owned utilities , the rebates started at $ 2.50 a watt and will shrink to 20 cents a watt by the time the program expires at the end of 2016 .
That ’s a difference of $ 11,500 on a 5 - kilowatt system over the life of the offer .
At present , rebates for customers living in those service territories are as follows : Pacific Gas and Electric -- $ 1.55 a watt ; Southern California Edison -- $ 1.90 a watt ; and San Diego Gas and Electric -- $ 1.55 .
To keep tabs on how close all those rebates are to dropping to the next level , check out the Statewide Trigger Point Tracker at www.csi-trigger.com.
Your final rebate will be less than those benchmark figures because the state will apply a discount to account for your roof ’s shading , the efficiency of your panels , the conversion from DC to AC and some other factors .
So figure on getting about 86 % of the benchmark .
California ’s municipal utilities have their own solar rebate programs .
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , for example , calculates how much power your system would produce over 20 years , then pays an upfront subsidy -- currently 13 cents per kilowatt - hour -- based on those estimates .
The DWP website has a calculator known as PVWatts to help you estimate your rebate .
( Warning : It ’s not very user - friendly . )
Advertisement
Check out your utility ’s website for more information .
Reputable solar firms will handle all the paperwork and give you the California rebate immediately , saving you the wait and hassle .
Make certain the firm you choose is registered with the state by checking the California Energy Commission database .
Tap your uncle
The second big solar incentive comes from Uncle Sam in the form of an investment tax credit .
Advertisement
Starting this year , homeowners who purchase solar panels can qualify for a federal tax credit equal to 30 % of the cost of their systems after the state rebate has been deducted .
The credit is a dollar - for - dollar reduction in the amount of federal income taxes owed .
Here ’s how the math would work for a resident living in Southern California Edison territory who bought a 5 - kilowatt system retailing for $ 7.50 a watt with an 86 % conversion rate for the state rebate .
System price : $ 37,500
( $ 7.50 x 5,000 watts )
Advertisement
State rebate : -$ 8,170
( $ 1.90 x .86 x 5,000 )
Post - rebate price = $ 29,330
Federal tax credit : -$ 8,799
Advertisement
$ 29,330 x 30 %
Net system price = $ 20,531
Lease it
Although government subsidies can reduce the cost of solar substantially -- by nearly half in the case above -- most homeowners do n’t have a bundle of cash to invest in panels .
And falling home values have made it tougher to get a home equity line of credit .
Advertisement
That ’s why some solar firms have begun offering residential leases and so - called power purchase agreements , or PPAs .
These arrangements are already popular with big commercial power users , including Wal - Mart Stores Inc. , that want to go green without tying up a lot of their own capital .
Instead of purchasing their own solar equipment , consumers let a solar - power provider install its panels on top of their homes .
Homeowners buy the clean energy generated from these arrays , paying a monthly fee to the solar firm much in the way they currently buy power from their utilities .
Upfront costs to the homeowner are minimal , from zero to a few thousand dollars .
There ’s no maintenance either ; that ’s the solar company ’s responsibility .
Contracts are lengthy , typically 15 to 20 years .
But they can be transferred to a new owner if the home is sold .
Many customers cut their monthly power bills immediately by at least 10 % to 15 % .
But the biggest savings come in the later years .
That ’s because , depending on the deal you cut , you can lock in a fixed rate or get a contract with a predictable escalator that ’s well below electricity rate hikes being projected for conventional utilities .

Ned Araujo of Upland turned to SunRun , a San Francisco company that offers residential power purchase agreements .
The environmental engineer paid $ 8,000 upfront to lock in a rate of 13 cents a kilowatt - hour .
That ’s slightly above the cheapest rate available currently from Southern California Edison .
But it ’s less than half the utility ’s priciest peak rates , and it ’s guaranteed not to budge for 18 years .
Araujo said he did n’t want the headache of maintaining solar panels -- especially in a seismic area .
“ Anything that happens , it ’s their responsibility , ” he said of SunRun .
Similar arrangements are available from SolarCity , a company based in Foster City , Calif. , whose popular leasing program has turned it into the state ’s leading installer .
Advertisement
The company is making a big push in Los Angeles , where it recently reached an agreement with the city that allows LADWP customers to participate in such lease arrangements .
Homeowners with an electric bill as low as $ 100 or even less can still save money by going solar , said SolarCity spokesman Jonathan Bass .
The company has a nifty calculator on its website where you can plug in the numbers .
Power to the people
In the last few years , companies , including SolarCity , have courted business by offering volume discounts to groups of homeowners who agree to adopt the technology at the same time .
Advertisement
The so - called community solar movement is gaining traction nationwide , thanks in part to a Bay Area company called One Block Off the Grid , or 1BOG for short .
Its business is organizing homeowners into groups of 100 or more and using that bargaining clout to get the best deals from solar installers .
Here ’s how it works :
If you ’re interested in solar , just go to the website and sign up .
1BOG is running campaigns in metropolitan Los Angeles ( including Orange County and parts of the Inland Empire ) , the Bay Area , San Diego , Sacramento and Sonoma County .
There ’s no cost or obligation .
But the more homeowners 1BOG can get to take the plunge , the more leverage they have with installers , who compete to win the contract .
1BOG makes its money by charging the winning bidder a fee .
1BOG offers educational seminars , provides a leasing option and does all the negotiating with solar companies , saving homeowners a lot of hassle .

Retirees Dorothy and Walter Harris of Ladera Heights were interested in purchasing panels but were dismayed by the steep learning curve .
After tuning in to a 1BOG
Web seminar , the couple knew they had found their company .
“ They presented things clearly . . . and made the whole process easy , ” Dorothy Harris said .
The savings can be enormous .
Los Angeles 1BOG members can now get solar for $ 6.05 a watt installed .
That would reduce the net cost of that 5 - kilowatt system in Southern California Edison territory mentioned above by an additional $ 5,075 .
The drawback is that you do n’t get to pick what brand of panel goes on your roof or the company that does the installing .
You also might have to wait several months to get your system , depending on how many people are ahead of you in line .

Put it on my tax bill
State legislation known as AB 811 approved last year grants most California cities and counties the ability to offer low - interest solar loans to residents , who then repay those loans through assessments that appear on their property tax bills .
The idea is to make solar more affordable by allowing California residents to spread their payments over 20 years .
If the house is sold , the annual assessments become the responsibility of the new owner .
That ’s appealing to homeowners who are n’t sure how long they ’ll stay put .
So far , Berkeley , Palm Desert and Sonoma County have set up programs .
San Diego is planning to launch one this fall .
A number of cities are in the exploratory phase .
Advertisement
The cost to homeowners and businesses depends on the interest rate provided by the municipality .
Palm Desert , for example , offers a 7 % fixed rate .
So financing a $ 30,000 system over 20 years would raise a homeowner ’s property tax bill by a little more than $ 3,000 a year .
Want your city to participate ?
Tell your mayor or council representative you want an AB 811 program in your town .

Though coordinating eight separate arms might seem a tricky task for an octopus brain , what 's really demanding is controlling the arms ' flexible , infinitely variable movements .
Now researchers have figured out part of their secret .
Unlike us , specific regions of an octopus ' motor cortex do n't correspond to specific parts of its body .
Instead , each region controls different parts at different times .
Their motor neural network seems as flexible as their bodies — a phenomenon that expands the range of neurophysiological possibility , and could refine the design of arm - flexing robots .
" We think , because of the complexity of the octopus body and its variability , that it has another way of organizing its control system .
That 's what we find in this study , " said Benny Hochner , a Hebrew University of Jerusalem neurobiologist and author of research published Thursday in Current Biology .
" It 's suited to a structure with many more degrees of freedom than our own body , which is constructed around a segmented skeletal structure with few degrees of freedom . "
How octopuses control their arms has been a focus of Hochner 's work for more than a decade .
In earlier studies , he helped show that seemingly complex movements are actually combinations of individually simple motions .
Hochner also found that many of the movements are guided peripherally , rather than by the brain , as if each arm had its own spinal cord .
An octopus brain sends a general prompt , and the arm computes the specifics :
It 's much simpler than running all those calculations in the brain itself .
And all this is especially interesting to roboticists who want to build machines with flexible appendages , ideal for rescue bots working in disaster areas or surgical machines weaving through a body .
" The idea is to draw inspiration from biology to answer the question of how to generate movement in a flexible structure , and how to control this with the nervous system , " said Hochner .
In the latest study Hochner 's team ran electrical currents through wires inserted into in the animals ' brains , measured the resulting movements , and then dissected the sacrificed animals to see exactly what the electrodes had stimulated .
They found yet another example of modular , highly efficient design :
Each site proved capable of generating different movements , in different arms , with movements becoming more complex as the current increased .
In humans , most body parts are controlled at a single , unchanging location .
" The networks are embedded in one another .
The system is remodeled according to stimulation .
It 's more dynamic , rather than strictly organized , " said Hochner .
Hochner suspects that other neurological programs , stored elsewhere in the octopuses ' bodies — perhaps at the base of each arm — act as gates , blocking signals from the brain or allowing them to pass .
That possibility is especially intriguing to Cecilia Laschi , a biomedical engineer at Italy 's Sant 'Anna School of Advanced Studies and member of the Octopus Project , a group of researchers building octopus - inspired soft - bodied robots .
" This is very important for robotics .
If you build a robot with many degrees of freedom , it becomes very difficult to control . " said Laschi , who was not involved in the study .
" We know that some movements are controlled peripherally , some parameters are set by the brain , and we will do the same thing in our robots . "
But whereas roboticists building humanoid forms can already try to mimic the human brain 's layout in their computing , Laschi said that " with the octopus , we 're not at that level — yet . "

Dr. Nancy was dumbfounded by what this teabagger had to say about Obama 's back to school speech and lesson plans in general .
Nancy :
Have you changed your mind since hearing the president today ?
Teabagger : No I have n't .
I thought the speech was OK , we never really had a problem with the content of the speech .
It was always about the lesson plans .
Nancy :
And what 's the problem with the lesson plans , that the idea is to stay in school and do your work and not let adversity keep you down ?
Teabagger :
Well , actually the lesson plans as they 're presented are actually illegal under the protection of People 's Rights
Nancy :
But what 's your problem with the message ?

Well like I said , there is no problem with the message it 's the lessons plans that encourages students to reveal personal information about themselves by participating in the lessons that the teachers are putting forth for them and that 's illegal ....
Nancy :
But I 'm not sure I understand what you 're talking about .
No one asked for personal information as far as I understand and the lesson plans really went along with the bulk of the speech .
Teabagger :
When the teachers ask in a questionnaires or they encourage the students to reveal information about their goals that delves into the psyche of the children and under code 34 of the federal regulations that 's illegal .
Nancy :
You must be kidding me .

Gordon Bell has just published a book called Total Recall on his digital project Gordon Bell never forgets .
That 's because , since 1998 , he has been working on archiving his entire life .
That includes everything he has accumulated , written , photographed , presented , and owned .
Bell , a principle researcher at Microsoft Research , has now written a book about how in the future we may all be able to offload our own memory into a comprehensive e-memory .
His life is kept in a database for a project called MyLifeBits .
Bits ' n ' bobs
In an interview with the BBC World Service 's Digital Planet programme , Mr Bell explained the motivation behind his unique and intriguing work .
" We started out to see just how much information one had coming through their life , " he said .
" I have a reasonably complicated life - so I wanted to find out just how many bits were coming and going , and how to deal with it . "
All computer users tend to archive some parts of their life , whether it's an e-mail , a written document or a photograph .
With the increasing popularity of the cloud - the name given to information stored in the online space - people are beginning to archive even more their lives .
Mr Bell , however , has taken it one step further - even scanning in till receipts .
" Overall I think there are maybe a million items all together , " he said .
He estimates that he has archived around 150,000 images , along with a similar number of emails and web pages .
Making digital memories is becoming cheaper and cheaper " The other half million are scans of books and things that I have " .
He said that the time is right for people to take e-memories seriously .
" I scan all the paper that comes into my life .
I went paperless in 2002 .
" You never delete anything .
" I would n't have said this 20 years ago because of the difficulty and the cost to do it .
The opportunity now is : it does n't cost anything to do this . "
For Mr
Bell the benefit of his experiment is simple : it makes him feel better .
" I get enormous amount of comfort , " he said .
" You basically have a great sense of freedom , because you are able to offload your bio-memory , and just commit all of the facts to an e-memory . "

spigot : HERE'S A HINT FOR ALL YOU LADIES OUT THERE DOING PORN SHOOTS : spigot : PUT A FUCKING EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE
Well , the ones that we are dealing with have to be a bit taller than that .
The reason comes from the connection that we have to make from the rig floor down to the bit at the bottom of the hole .
Because we are continually pushing the bit deeper into the ground we need to use something that we can keep extending .
( From this it also follows that the top guy on the rig got to be known as the tool pusher ) .
The term derrick comes from Thomas Derrick , a hangman who invented a type of gallows using a movable beam and pulley system during the Elizabethan era .
During his lifetime , Derrick executed over 3,000 people , many of them with his modified gallows device , and the supporting framework for his gallows came to be known as a derrick .
Well , there are several ways to go after talking about the pressures that develop at the bottom of oilwells .
But before going on to talk about completing the well , let me first just cover some basic terms and parts that go into getting the bit to actually turn and drill the well .
In other words , today I want to talk about the oil derrick and what happens on the rig floor .
Trying to update this , I discover that the term “ derrick ” has an interesting past .
At the same time , this connecting device has to be able to allow the mud to get down to the jet nozzles on the bit .
The logical way of doing this is to have a tube or pipe , into which the drilling bit can be threaded on the lower end .
( Which gives rise to the expression oilfield tubulars ) .
Now , by attaching the mud pumps to the upper end of the pipe , we can also get the mud down into the bit .
There is usually a special piece of pipe that fits between the bit itself and the main sections of the pipe , and this is called the drill collar .
These normally have a thicker wall than normal pipe so that they can add more weight to push the bit into the rock .
( see below ) .
Drill pipe comes in various sizes , depending on the hole that is being drilled , but for the sake of an example we might use a pipe that is 5.5 inches diameter on the outside and 3.25 inches wide on the inside .
This would weigh around 14 lb a foot , and is normally used in 30 ft lengths .
This length is a standard , and the pipe will have a threaded connection welded to each end , known as the tool joint .
One is male and one is female , so that additional lengths of pipe may be threaded into the original piece to extend the overall length as the hole gets deeper .
Normal male pipe ends ( taped over to protect the threads )
To handle these lengths of pipe , and to have them already in place and vertical before we need them , we need a handling system that can lift the pipes into place , and this tall initial support structure is called the mast .
Typical modern masts may be around 140 ft tall , with the space between the legs around 12 ft .
So to follow through the parts I ’ll make a simple version of a mast , and then as I explain what the parts are , I can add them to the model .
Basic Mast
I mention the length because there are several things that control the rate of penetration ( ROP ) of the bit , and one is the thrust that is applied to push the bit into the rock .
This comes from the weight of the pipe that is connected to the bit , and thus is known as the weight on bit .
However , if you do the arithmetic , 14 x 30 = 420 lb. per length of drill pipe .
So if we have one length of pipe , we are pushing the bit into the ground with 420 lbs of weight .
Add another length and we are up to 840 lb .
And so it continues , except that there is , for each bit and rock , a bit weight that will cause that bit to drill at its best ROP .
Typically this might be around 15 - 20,000 lb depending on hole size and rock type .
But we get that weight from the pipe with only 36 lengths , or a total of around 1,000 ft of drill pipe .
But increasingly we might be drilling a well that is much more than 7,000 ft deep .
( It is actually a bit shorter , since for the first few hundred feet the additional weight of the drill collars is needed to keep the thrust up ) .
To keep the bit weight at the best level to give the fastest ROP , the driller will carry the rest of the weight of the pipe through the derrick and will adjust the weight on bit by controlling the amount of lift through a block and tackle arrangement to a traveling block on the top of the drill pipe .
So to the model we will add a platform at the top , ( or crown ) of the derrick which will have a pulley on it to feed cable down to the travelling block .
Crown block at top of mast ( OSHA )
The cable that connects the traveling block to this second crown block at the top makes a number of loops between the two blocks and in this way the cable can carry up to a million pounds or more of weight .
Schematic of the two blocks at the top of the mast
From the crown block the cable feeds back down to the reel on the rig floor where it is stored .
The reel and the motors that drive it are known as the drawworks , and the driller controls the reel rotation and thus the weight carried through the cable to the derrick , to control the amount of thrust on the bit .
The hoist and motor of the Drawworks ( Schlumberger )
There are two other things , however , that have to be controlled .
Firstly the bit has to turn , and so there must be a way of allowing the pipe to rotate .
This is done by adding a swivel below the traveling block .
The swivel also allows a connection to the mud system and mud can be pumped into the pipe , without the mud line having to turn .
Travelling block showing the swivel and mud line connection ( OSHA )
This is done through a rotary table that sits on the rig floor and a special piece of pipe ( some 43 ft long ) , known as the Kelly , that is connected between the swivel which sits right under the traveling block , and the first length of drill pipe .
The pipe is square or hexagonal and will slide through the turntable as the hole gets deeper .
At the same time the shape allows the turntable to grip it and turn it , and the attached drill string that connects below it to the drilling bit at the bottom of the hole .
There is a motor , generally under the rig , that drives the turntable .
Drive through the turntable and Kelly drive to the Kelly , and the underlying drill pipe ( OSHA )
Some more modern rigs can have an electric motor at the top of the mast , attached to the bottom of the traveling block , which drives the pipe without the need for the Kelly and rotary table .
Top drive that can be used in small mast applications ( Tesco )
Bear in mind that after the drill bit has penetrated 30 ft ( the length of a single length or joint of drill pipe ) then drilling must stop .
The Kelly is disconnected from the top joint , and raised while a new joint is swung in up the catwalk ( from where spare joints are stored on the rig ) and connected , at the bottom end to the existing string , and at the top end to the Kelly .
The drill is then ready to go forward again .
While I am not up on current performance , I was once taught that a good crew cannot make more than 7 connections , or drill more than 200 ft of hole an hour .
( There is another way of adding pipe that can allow a faster ROP but we ’ll get to that another time ) .
Now also remember that if the bit needs to be changed because it wore out , or because it can't drill in the rock that it has not started to go through , then the entire string above the bit has to be removed , one joint at a time , until the bit reaches the surface .
Then it is replaced , and the joint in turn have to be replaced , again one - at - a - time , until the bit hits bottom again .
Now hauling the string out of the hole goes a little faster than drilling , but you can see that this process , known as tripping , can take more than a day .
Which can be quite expensive , especially since , while you are tripping you are not making hole , and that is what the rig is being rented to do .
When tripping the well , the drill pipe has to be held in place with slips , which are a wedge shaped tool that fits around the top of the pipe and grips it , while the connections are made or unmade .
Slips prepared to slip around the drill pipe ( Schlumberger )
Well , this is a bit of a hard subject to cover in less than 50 minutes , and without 60 pictures , so if there are things that are not clear , or if some of my numbers are n't quite up to date please comment or ask .
This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
I ’ve been getting a little attention here for my early review of PRPG , PPR : Pathfinder RPG ( First Impressions ) .
For instance :
At the official Paizo Blog , Lead Designer Jason Buhlman posted The Reviews are Coming In !.
In addition to mentioning both my review and a Pen and Paper Games review of the new Pathfinder RPG , he also provides an embedded YouTube video review from “ Game Geeks ” .
For those who want the actual YouTube page for the video , it ’s located at the following URL :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdBv_9Eiq-o
He also mentioned that there ’ll be a free PDF conversion guide for people who want to convert characters from D&D 3.5 to Pathfinder RPG .
Before anyone complains that you should n’t have to convert characters for something that ’s supposed to be “ compatible ” with D&D 3.5 , I suggest you check out my previous ramble on the subject :
What does “ compatibility ” mean for Pathfinder ?
I do n’t know what they ’ll say about experience point totals , considering that experience points for advancement have been somewhat altered between D&D 3.5 and Pathfinder RPG .
I know what I did when converting characters during the playtest period , though , and what I ’ll be doing if necessary in the future : I ’ll use the pfconv utility I wrote specifically for this purpose .
You can get a copy of the current form of this Ruby script for yourself , or you can use the Web interface for it :
pfconv – Web Interface
It turns out that the experience point advancement table , called Table 3 - 1 : Character Advancement and Level - Dependent Bonuses , has not changed between the playtest versions and the release version for Pathfinder RPG , so if you have an old copy of the script it ’ll still work .
I have , however , changed the license under which I ’m distributing it from the Public Distribution License ( now deprecated ) to the Open Works License .
For the vast majority of users who download the script , this wo n’t really affect you — and it should n’t affect you at all if you just use the Web interface .
Once I see what ’s in the free conversion guide PDF , I may automate more stuff via pfconv options ( if there ’s more to automate , of course ) .
In the meantime , I do n’t really see a lot of conversion guidance needed other than for experience points .
The rest can be handled by just basically doing a mid-campaign rebuild .
I actually like having the excuse to do a mid-campaign rebuild here , anyway , as it allows me to tighten up the character concept a bit .
It ’s fun , and helps with character development , at least as long as I do n’t violate continuity by throwing away capabilities that my character has been using all along .
At any rate , the pfconv script is still there , and still useful for converting XP totals between 3.5 and PRPG without changes .
You ’re set for the official Pathfinder RPG release date ( or whenever you get your hands on the book ) .
If you 're anywhere near Palmya , Nebraska this weekend , you should plan to hit the estate auction of John Armbrust .
Over the past 50 years he collected more than 275 vehicles , and they 're all for sale .

The Lone Star state famously leads the U.S. , itself the world leader , in wind power .
But how much wind power - - really - - does Texas have ?
Less than one - tenth of its official tally of more than 8,000 megawatts , says Robert Bryce in the Energy Tribune .
That 's because wind power is a lot more fickle than other power sources , such as natural gas , coal , or nuclear power .

It ’s apparently a huge controversy .
My Parisian doctor was telling me about it the other day .
You see , this is the land of “ socialized medicine , ” and it ’s gotten so expensive for the government to support that whole single - payer thing that the French govt .
is now having to raise the prices for consumers .
And boy are people hopping mad .
They ’re talking about raising the price you have to pay for a one night hospital stay by 25 % .
Yup .
A night in a French hospital is going to go up from $ 23.50 a night to $ 29.40 a night .
The French are also saying that there ’s such a HUGE deficit – because all of that communist fascist medicine is just too costly – that the state may have to cut the rate at which it reimburses private citizens for the aspirin they buy over the counter .
Yes , the state currently reimburses Frenchmen 35 % of the cost of … aspirin .
Because of the “ deficit , ” the reimbursement may have to go down to 15 % .
So , when things are going “ badly ” in the land of socialized medicine , when they have to cut back because government - paid health care has just gotten too expensive , a hospital stay is still cheaper than the cheapest , sleaziest , low - rent hotel .
Still think we ’re number one ?
As good as Google Maps is for most everyday Android users , many users still clamor for a high quality turn - by - turn GPS solution .
Enter TomTom .
Having just released an official application for the iPhone platform , TomTom recently announced their interest toward Android and plans to develop an official application for it .
According to a VP at TomTom :
" We can not ignore such a successful platform as Android .
HTC is an important partner of ours and Android is becoming increasingly important too . "
Though we would obviously prefer a Google Maps turn - by - turn solution , we certainly can't deny a GPS heavyweight like TomTom .
We 've tested the iPhone TomTom application and in our brief time with it , it truly feels like a standalone TomTom GPS unit .
If TomTom can offer the same experience with Android , we 'd happily jump on board .
What do you guys think ?

Jim Carroll , the poet and punk rocker in the outlaw tradition of Rimbaud and Burroughs who chronicled his wild youth in “ The Basketball Diaries , ” died on Friday at his home in Manhattan .
He was 60 .
The cause was a heart attack , said Rosemary Carroll , his former wife .
As a teenage basketball star in the 1960s at Trinity , an elite private school on the Upper West Side of Manhattan , Mr. Carroll led a chaotic life that combined sports , drugs and poetry .
This highly unusual combination lent a lurid appeal to “ The Basketball Diaries , ” the journal he kept during high school and published in 1978 , by which time his poetry had already won him a cult reputation as the new Bob Dylan .
“ I met him in 1970 , and already he was pretty much universally recognized as the best poet of his generation , ” the singer Patti Smith said in a telephone interview on Sunday .
“ The work was sophisticated and elegant .
He had beauty . ”
The diaries began , innocently : “ Today was my first Biddy League game and my first day in any organized basketball league .
I ’m enthused about life due to this exciting event . ”

Once in a while , though , for your own sake and for the sake of readers who suspect the post is all wrong but are n't quite sure why , you let loose with a full - blown response .
And that 's what I 'm doing here in reaction to a blog entry called " Peter Schiff : Medicare Recipients Are Lazy People Who Refuse to Pay for Their Own Health Care . "
This is longer than my usual pieces , but I hope I am not trying the reader 's patience too much .
In block quotes are the words of a blog author who identifies himself , interestingly enough , simply as " Che . "
Here we go .
I love it when right wing economists talk about " market forces " and " letting the free market run our economy . "
They make it sound like the free market is some altruistic being that always knows exactly what to do and when to do it .
I do not know of anyone who subscribes to this junior - camper caricature .
For one thing , no free - market economist is dumb enough to use a phrase like " letting the free market run our economy . "
The free market is merely the matrix of free exchanges entered into by individuals .
How can a matrix of free exchanges " run " anything ?
Secondly , no free - market economist thinks the market " always knows exactly what to do and when to do it . "
If that were the case , how could free - market economists account for firms that go out of business ?
The argument that free - market economists actually make is that on the free market , decisions regarding what to produce , in what quantities , using what methods , and in what locations , are made in light of satisfying the most urgent demands of consumers .
Business firms find out very quickly what consumers want and what they do not want , and they adjust their production decisions accordingly .
Profits indicate that a particular industry is combining factors of production in a way that pleases consumers .
As a result , production in that industry tends to expand .
Likewise , losses indicate that value is being reduced or destroyed , and that factors of production are being employed in lines of production that please consumers less , at the expense of other lines of production where they might have produced something consumers wanted more .
There are limitless ways business firms can combine factors of production to produce an equally limitless potential array of goods .
Thankfully , firms do not have to grope around in the dark amid these trillions of choices .
If their production process uses an input more urgently needed elsewhere , that input gets bid away from them and they find a substitute .
If they produce too much of something , their resulting losses prompt them to produce less , thereby releasing resources for the production of another good that consumers value more highly .
At all times , resources are directed , in light of consumer wants , to those production processes in which they are most urgently demanded .
So no , markets do not know " exactly what to do and when to do it " — a juvenile caricature — but feedback from consumers ' decisions does constantly push markets toward a more efficient use of limited resources .
Government , on the other hand , has no rational basis for determining what to produce , in what quantities , and so on .
It gets its money not by providing a good that people voluntarily choose to purchase , but by seizing the funds from its subject population .
Since it therefore lacks a profit - and - loss feedback mechanism , every single production decision it makes is absolutely arbitrary , and necessarily wastes resources .
It operates completely in the dark .
It can not adjust to consumer demand , since it has no way of calculating the best , least wasteful way to produce .
More than that , it can not even know what to produce .
The free market is not some emotionless , all knowing entity .
It is controlled by humans who are susceptible to greed , corruption , and exploitation .
The free market is only as pure as the fallible human beings that control it .
As we 've seen , the free market is just a matrix of exchanges , so no one in his right mind would describe it as any kind of " entity , " whether " emotionless , " " all knowing , " or " yellow with purple polka dots . "
We 'll deal with " corruption " and " exploitation " below .
But in keeping with Che 's charming devotion to government , he does n't consider that its own officials might be susceptible to greed , corruption , and exploitation .
Later , he suggests that corrupt politicians can simply be voted out of office ( how 's that one working out for you so far , Che ? ) .
He does not consider the possibility that corporations that do not produce what consumers want can likewise be voted out of the economy by merely abstaining from buying their products .
If free market principles were allowed to rule , like Schiff wants , what that means is everything is based on maximizing profit .
At this point we are all supposed to gasp at what a terrible prospect this would be .
After all , the track coach and Michael Moore have told us about the wickedness of " profits , " so what more is there to say , really ?
But as we 've seen above , profit is simply society 's way of ratifying a firm 's past production decisions .
It indicates what consumers want , and ( by the process of imputation ) the best process for producing it .
Profits attract further investment in a given line of production , until the increased supply of goods in that industry brings the rate of return there back down to the level that exists elsewhere in the economy .
This is how we ensure that our limited resources are not wasted , and that the most urgently desired goods are produced .
In the absence of profit as a driving force , how exactly would Che like to see resources allocated ?
We can either allow consumer preferences to guide production , or let the personal preferences of a monopolist ( i.e. , government ) dictate what should be produced and how .
When the question is posed this way , the choice is pretty clear , which is why the question is never posed this way .
Incidentally , would Che prefer to base economic decision making on maximizing losses instead ?
Would that be better ?
Two major byproducts occur when the only concern of an economy is profit .
1 . Quality goes down because corners must be cut to save money and compete ( See China ) .
Now Che , think about this for a minute .
Suppose you had an economy in which profit was of no concern whatever .
Would quality go up , then ?
Would we enjoy products of ever - increasing quality if businesses were not required to satisfy the consuming public ( which is what earning profits means ) in order to stay in business ?
You do n't think their freedom from the need to make profits might make them lazy , or unresponsive to consumer demand ?
You think they 'd work overtime on high - quality products for the sake of the brotherhood of man , or the great fatherland , or whatever abstraction the regime proposes ?
If the consumer wants high - quality merchandise , producers will compete to provide him with it .
If everyone is producing low - quality garbage , there is a gigantic profit opportunity awaiting a newcomer who simply improves product quality .
Do n't you believe those evil corporations would jump at the chance to profit ?
Why in your scenario do those wicked , wily , greedy characters suddenly lose their drive to earn a return ?
You will say that consumers wo n't pay higher prices for quality merchandise .
But where does that arbitrary assertion come from ?
If they wo n't pay the higher prices , then that means they are satisfied with the existing level of quality , and that the money they might have spent on nicer things is in their view more urgently spent on something else — basic , no - frills products , say .
" We can either allow consumer preferences to guide production , or let the personal preferences of a monopolist ( i.e. , government ) dictate what should be produced and how . "
You , Che , are not in a position to judge their decision .
If they will pay higher prices , then more upscale firms will cater to them — which , if you 'd turn your head slightly and glance around a bit , you 'll notice is how the economy already works .
There is , after all , no logical limit to the potential quality of merchandise .
Following Chester Lampwick on The Simpsons , someone may purchase a solid - gold house .
Now most people , in their search for higher - quality dwellings , may not want to live in a straw hut , but they are likewise prepared to stop well short of a solid - gold house .
There is no nonarbitrary way to decide , apart from the voluntary spending streams emanating from consumers and the production decisions made on that basis , what ratio of quality to affordability people should choose .
Again , though , all we need to do is look around to find the refutation of Che 's strange claim .
Are automobiles today of lower quality than they were in , say , 1977 ?
Would anyone care to trade in his Blu-ray player for a 1981 VCR ?
The Blu-ray also costs a teensy - weensy bit less , in real terms , than the 1981 VCR , I might add .
I trust you that there is something wicked in all this , Che , but I 'm just not seeing it .
2 . Wages go down , because it [ employers ' drive for profits ] pits workers against one another .
For example , if there are no labor regulations , I can pay a woman significantly less than a man to do the same job .
This forces wages down , because now a man must settle for a depressed wage if he wants a job .
This is why nonchemists do not write about chemistry , and nonbotanists stay out of botany .
At this point our author is simply making things up .
An enormous amount could be said here , including the obvious point that although laborers do compete with each other ( just as all factors of production do ) , employers have to compete for labor , just as much as they have to compete for steel or any other input .
But for a simple reply to the claim that under competitive conditions wages will fall , we ask the simple question : has this in fact happened ?
During the 19th century , without any of the institutions that Che thinks make wages rise , real wages quadrupled .
This is not supposed to happen , according to him — competition among workers should make wages go down .
But whom are you going to believe , Che or your own eyes ?
But now let 's proceed to the second sentence : on a free market , Che could pay a woman less than a man , which means in turn that men would have to accept lower wages .
I 'm not surprised Che believes wage rates are determined at the arbitrary whim of employers — it 's the conventional wisdom among the general public , after all , and it would be unthinkable to deviate from that .
We 're hanging on for dear life to what our social - studies teacher taught us , evidently .
But if on a genuine free market , businesses can arbitrarily lower women 's wages , followed in turn by men's , why do n't they lower both men's and women 's wages right now ?
Equal - pay legislation has nothing to say about lowering wages for both sexes , so why do n't employers go ahead and use their magical wage - lowering powers right now ?
Why should they wait until equal - pay legislation is repealed , and then follow Che 's convoluted path to this same outcome by first lowering women 's wages and then forcing men to accept low wages as well ?
The answer , of course , is that wage rates are not arbitrary .
If businesses tried to do what Che proposes , the result would not be that male wages would be bid down .
The competition for labor would drive women 's wages back up .
There is no point in pretending that the level of compensation workers enjoy today has anything to do with the minimum wage or labor unions ; the vast majority of Americans earn much more than the minimum wage , and labor unions have always been a negligible factor in the United States .
US workers ' wages have consistently outpaced those of the much more heavily unionized countries of Europe .
Che can account for none of this ; we should , according to his logic , all be earning minimum wage .
Also completely neglected in Che 's account is the tendency for real incomes to increase on a free market .
How does this process occur ?
When firms increase and improve the equipment and machinery at the disposal of workers , their labor becomes more productive .
Imagine someone using a forklift , as opposed to stacking pallets with his bare hands , or producing books with modern equipment as opposed to a 16th - century printing press .
The amount of production the economy is capable of is thereby increased , often dramatically , and this increase in production puts corresponding downward pressure on consumer prices ( relative to wage rates ) .
Now there is nothing natural or inevitable about the availability of this productivity - enhancing capital equipment .
It does not fall out of the sky .
It comes from the wicked capitalists ' abstention from consumption , and the allocation of the unconsumed resources in capital investment .
This process is the only way the general standard of living can possibly rise .
Only in this way can the average laborer produce the tiniest fraction of what today he is accustomed to producing .
It follows that only under these conditions can he expect to be able to consume the tiniest fraction of what today he is accustomed to consuming .
The increases in the productivity of labor that additional capital brings about push prices down relative to wage rates .
By increasing the overall amount of output , such increases raise the ratio of consumers ' goods to the supply of labor .
Put more simply , improvements in the production process that lead to an increased supply of output make that output cheaper and easier for people to acquire .
That 's why , in order to earn the money necessary to acquire a wide range of necessities , far fewer labor hours are necessary today than in the past .
Thanks to capital investment , which is what businesses engage in when their profits are n't seized from them ( to the cheers of people like our friend Che ) , our economy is far more physically productive than it used to be , and therefore consumer goods exist in far greater abundance and are correspondingly less dear than before .
In 1950 , for example , Americans had to work six minutes to earn the money that would buy them a loaf of bread ; by 1999 that was down to just three and a half minutes .
To be able to buy a dozen oranges in 1950 took 21 minutes of labor .
It was only nine minutes by 1999 .
Paying for 100 kilowatts of electricity required two hours of labor in 1950 , but only 14 minutes in 1999 .
Someone in 1900 would have had to work nine hours , as compared with four hours in 1950 , and three hours in 1999 , to earn the money to buy a pair of jeans .
For a three - pound chicken , it was 160 minutes in 1900 , 71 in 1950 , and 24 in 1999 .
When Che wants to tax business firms , as you can be sure he does , he is advocating the direct sabotage of the process by which everyone in society sees his purchasing power rise .
American society , in short , would have been far wealthier had top income tax rates been lower throughout the 20th century .
Had government not seized so many resources to squander on consumption , those resources would have been available for investments that would have made the economy permanently capable of producing far more wealth than otherwise .
Everyone 's standard of living would , as a result , have been far higher .
If there is no regulation of the " market forces " by the government , you essentially place the power in the hands of CEO's who have no accountability to anyone but their share holders , and in order to keep the share holders happy , profit must be maximized by any means necessary .
If that means exploitation and corruption , so be it .
Since " exploitation " and " corruption " are not defined here , we have no way of knowing what Che is talking about .
By " exploitation " he is presumably referring to the Marxian theory that intensified competition leads to lower wages , an absurdity we 've already addressed .
By " corruption " he could mean one of two things .
He could mean the use of fraud , theft , or some other violation of the law .
If this is what he means , he is no longer speaking about the unhampered market , which punishes nonmarket , criminal behavior like that , and thus his comment is irrelevant .
If someone violates the law , punish him .
If he is guilty and is n't punished , that 's hardly the market 's fault — after all , who monopolizes the provision of courts and police ?
( I 'll give you a hint : it is n't the free market . )
He could also mean the use of lobbying in order to win special privileges from government , or to hobble one 's competitors .
Once again he is not actually criticizing the free market , even though he thinks he is .
Here his criticism is not of the free market but of government itself .
The free market contains no coercive mechanism to grant special privileges to any one party .
Only government has the power to initiate coercion .
You want a single , monopolistic institution to have plenary power to order society as it sees fit , and you 're going to pretend to be surprised when it turns out to be dominated by antisocial forces ?
If government regulations are allowed to control an economy , those who installed the regulations can be held accountable if the regulations are too intrusive .
Consider the Code of Federal Regulations .
Every year the Federal Register adds about another 70,000 pages to the Code .
If even one of these pages were to be eliminated , we would all die instantly .
They were put there to keep us safe !
According to Che , not one of these regulations could possibly be " too intrusive " — we would surely have repealed it if it were !
That reminds me of the student I once had who , upon learning that the Job Corps was a complete and utter failure by any conceivable standard , innocently asked why it was n't repealed .
I do n't blame that student — with that question she was starting to figure things out for the first time .
Che actually runs a blog without ever asking a single unconventional question .
In Che 's world , the entire " capture " literature on regulation , which describes how industry and large firms in particular influence regulation to benefit themselves , does not exist .
Regulation is solely for the public good .
Here , on the other hand , is a small taste of reality .
In the usual caricature , if you support the free market then you support pollution and various other forms of property invasion .
To the contrary , someone who believes in the free market opposes these things because they damage other people 's property without their consent .
That does not mean the only solution is " regulation . "
Here 's a genuinely free - market way to think about these issues .
Che may also be referring to regulation of banking and the financial markets , which is actually quite heavy despite all the talk of " deregulation . "
Deregulation is almost always phony , as when financial institutions are allowed to make riskier bets while the government still insures their deposits .
Complaints about a lack of regulation are also beside the point .
If you have a toppling house of cards , you do n't need tape or glue — the functional equivalent of " more regulation . "
You need a whole new house , built on a solid foundation .
In other words , you need a hard - money system that cannot be manipulated by governments or their central banks .
That option does not exist in Che 's world , since in his world the system we have now is already a free - market one .
I 've covered this a little bit here and here .
" You want a single , monopolistic institution to have plenary power to order society as it sees fit , and you 're going to pretend to be surprised when it turns out to be dominated by antisocial forces ? "
Moreover , existing regulators saw nothing wrong with the way the securitization model was working , and in fact financial institutions were in line with the various capital requirements proposed by international regulatory standards .
The system of regulations itself gave banks an incentive to hold on to securitized loans , thereby undermining the risk dissipation function it existed to provide .
Is the solution to add more regulators ?
Or could there be something wrong with the system itself — a system at war with the free market , a system that yields the extreme leverage and instability we periodically observe ?
Another obvious question routinely overlooked in this context is why a regulator with no financial stake in an enterprise would know better how to satisfy consumer demand than a business owner whose own wealth depends on getting it right .
How superstitious can you get ?
Yet dime - a - dozen commentators calling for more regulation attribute magical powers to people who in the real world tend to be unworthy of these exaggerations .
As Robert Higgs put it , " Had they been given even greater powers , budgets , and staffs , what enchantment would have transformed the regulators into smart , dogged champions of the public interest , rather than the time - serving drones and co-conspirators with the regulated firms that they have always been ? "
How many business school or other graduate students aspire to become regulators ?
We 'll put it kindly and simply observe that it's the slower ones who wind up in the regulatory agencies , and the brighter ones who wind up as successful businessmen .
We expect a kid who graduated # 505 out of a class of 508 not to get his clock cleaned by a kid who graduated # 12 ?
Finally , the free market does n't pump up the money supply and push interest rates down to levels that promote unsustainable bubbles .
Had there been no Fed - created housing bubble in the first place , there could have been no resulting crash .
The free market punishes reckless risk - takers , while it is government that bails them out ( thereby encouraging them to take greater risks in the future ) .
It was the Federal Reserve System , not the free market , from which the " Greenspan put " — the implicit promise to bail out major Wall Street players — emerged .
The Financial Times warned that these guarantees were encouraging dangerously risky investments .
The free market makes no such guarantees , and thereby cultivates a more cautious and sensible class of entrepreneur .
Might there be a lesson here ?
Holding the government accountable for its actions is called Democracy .
Holding a CEO accountable for his or her actions is called impossible .
Could these be the most laughable lines of the whole piece ?
Che has swallowed the propaganda he got in school without a peep of independent thought .
Our wise public servants are concerned for the common good , and anything they might do against the interests of the people are unfortunate aberrations — mere " corruption " that can be punished in the next election .
For our political system holds government accountable to the people !
I could write a whole book on this , so let 's stick to a couple obvious points .
Our government launched a war in 2003 on ludicrous and transparent pretenses that led to as many as a million people dead and four million displaced .
Prior to that , in the 1990s , we had a bipartisan sanctions regime that killed half a million Iraqi children .
( Note that our leaders do not deny that statistic ; they merely say the price was " worth it . " )
Who , my dear Che , was held " accountable " for that ?
Anyone ?
What alleged sins of any US corporation even approach that ?
The Federal Reserve System , which enjoys a government monopoly on the creation of legal - tender money , created the conditions that led to the present economic crisis .
( I give some of the contours of the argument here and in Meltdown , my latest book . )
Was anyone held " accountable " for that ?
In fact , who in government has been held accountable for anything relating to the financial crisis ?
Are you telling us that the government bailouts were an example of public - spiritedness , rather than a transparent payoff to friends and allies of the regime ?
The bailouts , in fact , were an example of government intervention to prevent the free market from holding CEOs accountable .
The regime regularly kills , maims , destroys , steals , and , for good measure , spies on the people .
How exactly is " democracy " keeping this thing " accountable , " Che ?
Are you referring to the electoral process , in which Americans recently had a choice between a pro-empire , pro-bailout , pro-war Republican and a pro-empire , pro-bailout , pro-war Democrat ?
You want to keep a CEO accountable ?
Stop buying his product .
How do I stop buying the government 's " product " ?
Oh , I forgot , I do n't buy it — the money to fund it is seized from me .
" The bailouts , in fact , were an example of government intervention to prevent the free market from holding CEOs accountable . "
There is a market for corporate control , by the way , but the very people who complain the loudest about unaccountable CEOs tend to be most opposed to , and want to place the greatest barriers in front of , corporate takeovers .
Here again , government erects roadblocks in the way of the market 's attempts to correct misallocations of resources .
Now , you may say I am being too hard on Che .
The poor kid is just repeating what he learned in junior high .
How can I blame him ?
This sort of propaganda is what kids are taught , and we can't fault Che for simply repeating whatever his teacher said .
I blame him for being so incorrigibly incurious .
The brighter kids figure out they 're being fed propaganda of the crudest and most obvious kind , which is designed to make them obedient little servants of their overlords , who claim to protect them from the evil exploiters they read about in their textbooks .
These kids seek out the truth , and discover that the real exploiters are the overlords themselves , parasites on the productive economy , who live on the fruits of other people 's labor while blaming the resulting social ills on the various bogeymen the kids have been taught to hate .
The slower kids , by contrast , memorize what the teacher tells them , reproduce it on the test , and repeat it like drones for the rest of their lives .
Update : More photos of the Netflix shipping center are available on Flickr .
No , we did n't break in -- Netflix invited HackingNetflix to tour the Hartford shipping center , and even let us take a few photos .
50 employees at the 20,000 square foot Hartford shipping center process as many as 90,000 discs per day , or 275,000 per week .
Even though we knew the address , the shipping center was hard to find .
Located in an unmarked warehouse in the local business district , the only outside mention of Netflix was on the trucks they use to pick up and deliver the DVDs .
3a .m .
The mail is picked up from the Postal Distribution Center and the workers start processing the DVDs .
Each envelope is ripped open by hand , and the DVDs are inspected for cracks .
If you look closely at the photo you can see the Blockbuster Online discs that were delivered to Netflix by mistake .
If a disc is dirty , the DVD is cleaned using a sprayer with glass cleaner and the disc is rubbed on what appears to be paper towels .
Most of the discs are place in a tray to be sorted by machine , but cracked , Blu-ray , damaged , and mislabeled discs are placed in separate bins .
The also collect customer notes .
To celebrate Independence Day , some guys thought that shooting fireworks from RC planes — using an electrical firing system — was a great safe idea .
Judging by the music , however , it seems they were celebrating Hitler 's invasion of Poland .
There ’s nothing more dangerous than an average manager with free time on his hands .
When your work is solely coordinating and assigning other people ’s tasks , topping off a slow day usually means making up more ( needless ) stuff for others to do .
This is in part the tyranny of the 8 - hour work day paradigm .
When the work is progressing as planned and the core issues have been addressed , the right move for the manager is often to step back .
But if all you know how do is “ manage ” , there ’s no fallback .
Nothing else to fill your time with .
What you ’re left with is net - negative management .
That the presence of a manager actually detracts more value than not having one at all would do .
The alternative for many smaller teams or shops is the combined idea of managers of one and working managers .
That management can be less than a full - time role , it can be a responsibility that people who also does the work can take upon them when needed .
The guy who used to play the Green and White Ranger on the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is trying to fight with creatures from this planet -- dude is an MMA fighter now .
35 - year - old Jason David Frank -- who used to fight inside a friggin ' Dragonzord -- just told MMAweekly.com he 's hoping to fight inside the UFC octagon .
The 6th degree Black Belt just signed a deal with a new management team and hopes to get in the ring pretty soon .
We 'll let you know when he actually schedules a fight .
No word on what color his trunks will be ...
Believer asked :
" I 've noticed that many of your pages revolve around two topics : that you are an outspoken atheist , and that you have had a very difficult life including homelessness .
Have you ever considered that there may be a connection between the two ?
Have you ever asked yourself " What if I 'm wrong ? " .
I wonder if you gave your life to God whether he would have taken you down the same path .
Were you always an atheist ?
Did you have a bad experience with a church or a clergy member ?
Do you feel that if there was a God he would have preventing certain things from happening , and so therefore chose to believe He does not exist ? "
" I 've noticed that many of your pages revolve around two topics : that you are an outspoken atheist , and that you have had a very difficult life including homelessness .
Have you ever considered that there may be a connection between the two ? "
No , but many religious people have told me that not thinking God is real caused all of my ( well - deserved in their opinion ) suffering .
I believe that my difficulties were not a punishment from a non-existent God .
Many people who are devout believers have even worse lives than mine so that logic does n't hold up .
Additionally , if I analyze what happened in my life , I can pretty well see why things happened the way they did .
As an atheist , I believe that autism is a real thing .
I ascribe to no ideology that causes me to reject the existence of learning disabilities and emotional problems as real .
Having been diagnosed with autism , I tend to believe I am autistic .
There is a known connection between inability to perform in social interactions and autism .
In fact , that 's almost the definition of autism .
My autism was not properly treated when I was a child and , like almost every other autistic who receives no special assistance , when left completely on my own I experienced difficulties .
I was a stranger in a strange land .
I had no familial support and had formed only the most inadequate of friend support structures in school .
When this left me homeless , I was the perfect victim for predators .
I was incredibly naïve and socially inept .
I had no " common sense " to keep me from dangerous situations .
I reacted to harmful stimuli ( beatings , rapes , and other frightening encounters ) by withdrawing into myself instead of reaching for help as most people do .
That entrenched me more deeply into homelessness - a shell - shocked autistic is n't the best at navigating the hard road out of homelessness .
" Have you ever asked yourself " What if I 'm wrong ? " "
You assume one thing that most Christians do - that I do n't want to believe in God , that I never considered it .
When I was homeless there was many a night when I longed to think of God as real .
What complete and total idiot would n't want someone or something to exist that loved them in that situation ?
The physical deprivation and pain of homelessness is dwarfed by the emotional pain , heartbreak , and crushing loneliness of being homeless .
I often prayed , saying , " God , if you are real , please just let me think that you are . "
I was not able to convince myself that God was real .
Even by pretending and acting as if God were real , I could n't .
Maybe it 's the autism but I have a basic inability to believe in ( or even understand why other people believe in ) things that I do n't think are real .
No matter how desirable a thing is , if I do n't think it 's real , I am unable to make myself think it is .
" Were you always an atheist ? "
I never thought God was real .
I thought I could fake myself into believing if I acted like I did ( I had to pretend to believe in God anyway , to get services and to avoid abuse ) , you know , how smiling and acting happy can make some people really be happy , right ?
But I could n't .
Do n't you have any idea how desirable belief is ?
I mean , to actually think that there is a perfect justice waiting for us ?
To think that the good people will be rewarded with paradise ?
To think that the people we loved who died are not truly gone forever ?
Those things are all incredibly desirable but again , I can't force myself to believe in make - believe , not even for just a time .
I even watch a movie and see actors and special effects most of the time , I see art and craftsmanship , I do n't experience suspension of disbelief .
" Did you have a bad experience with a church or a clergy member ? "
Yes , but I did n't think God was real beforehand .
After I was beaten by schoolmates because my parents were outed as non-Christians , several pastors showed up to the hospital and to our home to berate my parents for not raising us as Christians .
One pastor showed up to try to convert me through fear when my parents were n't there to protect me .
He insisted that while the kids were n't right to beat me that it was just a taste of the pain I 'd experience if I did n't accept Jesus into my heart .
He told me my dead brother was suffering in Hell because he had n't been raised Christian - forever and ever and that it was all my parents fault .
" Do you feel that if there was a God he would have preventing certain things from happening , and so therefore chose to believe He does not exist ? "
I do n't think God is real but if a God were real , I would not presume to know what it would or would not do .
As explained earlier , it 's not really a choice at all to think something is real or not .
Give it a try yourself - think of something you think is make - believe , something lovely and desirable , like a unicorn perhaps .
Now believe that it 's real .
You can't , can you ?
Now imagine your only child is dying a horrible , slow , and painful death and a bunch of people have told you that unicorns are real and the touch of a unicorn could save your child 's life .
Do you believe in unicorns yet ?
Now imagine someone you loved told you that not only are unicorns real and their touch can heal any sickness but that if you do n't believe they are real you will be tortured for eternity .
On top of that , imagine that a bunch of really old books say that all of that stuff about unicorns is true .
Now , ask yourself why do n't you believe in unicorns and you 'll have the answer as to why I do n't believe in God .

The Gathering Storm by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson , due for release in late October ( while the folks at Tor are generous , it seems you need to become a member to read it , a painless procedure I assure you ) .
Brandon will be running across the US from
Oh , and in case you were wondering why the heck they did n't release the prologue of The Gathering Storm first , since it seems like it would be in the natural order of things ...
Lo and behold fellow readers , the first chapter of by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson , due for release in late October ( while the folks at Tor are generous , it seems you need to become a member to read it , a painless procedure I assure you ) .
Brandon will be running across the US from book signing to book signing , getting the Wheel turing on the first of the last three books in this gargantuan series .
While there has been significant discussion about Brandon cranking out a few other books in the series , let us for now at least focus on the present and highly anticipated The Gathering Storm .
For your reading pleasure , I give to you the first chapter of what promises to be an uncharacteristically action packed installment .
" You may be wondering why Tor is releasing Chapter 1 before the prologue ?
Yes , technically that ’s out of order .
The prologue is about 20,000 words , while Chapter 1 is only a few thousand ( ie , much shorter ) .
Be forewarned : Although you will have no problems whatsoever following along , chapter 1 does begin after a short scene takes place in the prologue . "

TheOilDrum staff is considering a rebuttal to this article , though if we go point by point to Mr. Lynch it will be a bit like Monty Python skit , " The Argument Clinic " , given he did n't posit many facts .
Below the fold are some brief points followed by an open thread for you to deposit your own .
Today the NYTimes ran an Op-ed by Michael Lynch once again pointing out the " fallacious thinking behind the concept of Peak Oil . "
Here are some points to rebut Lynch :
1 ) Peak Oil has never been about the amount of hydrocarbon molecules that exist , but flow rates , timing and costs .
This post from 2007 gives a general overview of the differences between those concerned about a near term oil peak , and the unconcerned .
2 ) Reserves additions are backdated to date of discovery - even with that global discoveries peaked in 1960s and have declined every decade - we need to find oil before we produce it .
Onshore oil production peaked in 1980 - all growth since then has come from offshore .
30 of the worlds 54 oil producing countries are past peak , with 10 flat or declining and only 12 increasing .
etc .
Graphic by Gail Tverberg , Data from Exxon , Source : Tsoskounoglou , M. ; Ayerides , G. ; Tritopoulou , E. The End of Cheap Oil : Current Status and
Prospects .
Energy Policy 2008 , 36 , 10 , 3797-3806
3 ) New , better technology generally allows us to maintain current oil flow rate at cost of higher future decline , ( which then requires more discoveries , etc. ) .
Look at the example of Cantarell - stagnant production until 1999 when they introduced nitrogen injection - then horizontal drilling in 2002 - production increased for a few years but is now crashing - ( yesterday Mexico announced they are buying oil from Brazil , which means USA is buying oil from Brazil indirectly )
4 ) Lynch and most other natural resource optimists completely ignore net energy analysis - the fact that energy and other natural resource inputs are requirements of oil extraction .
Dollars are only an abstract marker for real biophysical costs .
The energy return on energy invested on oil in USA has gone from 100:1 ( 1930s ) to 30 to 1 ( 1970s ) to 11:1 ( 2000 ) and anecdotally ( we do n't have the data ) is lower now - additionally how much energy and natural resources will it take to rebuild the massive oil / gas infrastructure around the world with 40 + year average life ?
That is n't even included in those energy profit figures quoted above .
5 ) Nobody I know is blaming politics for declining discoveries - more expensive exploration and production , or increasing depletion rates .
Mr Lynch tries to tie the current debate to the oil embargoes from 40 years ago - but tellingly does n't mention one person today .
6 ) His final argument about total resources available being enormous mentions " some geologists " .
Again , he tellingly does n't mention one name or organization to substantiate his claims .
7 ) If the mountain of credit / debt relative to physical resource continues to unwind , the market price signal will cause new investments to stagnate , and the observed decline rate will approach natural decline rate .
8 ) There was no mention of oil as the lynchpin of economic growth and that we need growth to pay back debt .
We import 2/ 3 of our oil , yet are paying for it with fiat markers .
Just today the Obama administration revised the 10 year deficit to $ 9 trillion .
US
Oil production and debt creation , are going in opposite directions .
Lynch and others do n't seem to understand that energy and natural resources are what we have to spend - dollars are just who controls these resources in the current system ( or maybe they do understand ? )

It ’s been announced that Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz , who took over for Ebert & Roeper once they left the “ At The Movies ” program on ABC have been given their notices .
As someone who grew up watching Siskel & Ebert and regularly watched Ebert & Roeper I ’m glad to see Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz go .
The two Bens had tough shoes to fill no doubt when Richard Roeper announced last year that he would be leaving the show since ABC did n’t want to pony up the cash to keep him on board .
Immediately after , Ebert quit despite him not appearing on the program in some time .
Part of the magic that was Ebert & Roeper as well as Siskel & Ebert before it was that the men commanded some respect .
They appeared credible , even if often times they were n’t .
At times Siskel and Ebert were both sort of snobbish jerks , but through the years I ’ve really come to respect Ebert ’s reviewing style .
It ’s something I try to use here on the site .
Which is a basic philosophy that every movie ( or toy , etc ) is graded not against every other movie out there , but against itself .
That ’s not to say you ca n’t make comparisons or even directly contrast it with something else , but that nothing HAS to be compared .
I remember back in 6th grade doing a parody of Siskel & Ebert with my best friend Matt in which we made fun of both guys pretty heavily .
As I recall it was for a pair book reviews and both of us made custom fat suits , eaching being “ Ebert ” in one another ’s book review while the other played Siskel .
Even then I had a deep appreciation for the art of the review , despite performing a parody on it .
When Gene Siskel died it seemed to me that the show could n’t continue to prosper , but in my humble opinion Richard Roeper not only replaced him but did a better job .
He seemed to revitalize the show , giving even Roger Ebert a new outlook on things .
I was sad to hear about all of Ebert ’s troubles in recent years tha eventually took him off the show .
Ebert even lost his use of speech , but continues to write insightful reviews on his website .
Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz just did n’t have the flare .
In fact , they were largely flat out terrible .
I ’m pleased to hear that Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune will be one of the new anchors .
Phillips spent the majority of the last run of Ebert & Roeper filling in for Ebert and he ’s an entertaining reviewer .
Of course ideally I ’d like to see Roeper and Phillips , but I guess that ’s not in the cards .
Speaking of Richard Roeper , if you are n’t reading his blog , you should be .
He has some of the smartest things to say about , well …
Everything .
I also follow his Twitter .
Good riddance Bens and hello to the new crew .
Maybe “ At The Movies ” can survive after all .
昔の私は、大学を卒業してすぐ就職し、そこそこ有名な商社に勤務。
たしかに安定した給料があるので最低限の生活は守られていましたが、もっとバイクに乗りたいしゲームだってしたい。
わがまますぎると自分でも思っていましたが、切り捨てられない願いでもありました。
どころか昨今の不況により、その最低限の生活すら危ぶまれてきました。
老 後2000万円問題なんてのも、まだ先だ～なんて言ってられない状態です。
そこで将来の為に株式投資を始めようと思い期待に胸を膨らませ口座を開設したものの、これがまた面白いほどにうまくいかない(笑)
始めて早々の私は今思い返せば、人から言われるがままに「この銘柄は超有名だから～」とか
「 この業界は今話題になってるから絶対株価が上がる～」だの。。。
そんな何の信憑性もない情報をもとに建玉や決済をしたりで、根拠を持った取引が出来ていませんでした。
もっと具体的でわかりやすく、明確な根拠を示し、かつ大きく稼ぐチャンスに出会える方法。。
そんな夢物語のようなシステムがあるわけない、と思いながらも本気で稼ぎたかった私はついに出会ってしまいました。
たった3つのテンプレート化されたメソッドに従うだけで、迷うことなくベストな銘柄にベストなタイミングで売り買いができる「先乗り投資法」に。
悪評だらけの怪しい商品や詐欺商品が多い世の中。
ここにたどり着くまで、様々な株式投資にまつわる商材に手を出しましたが、正直詐欺まがいのものや私がした失敗と同じく、何の根拠も信憑性もない怪しい内容のものが多かったです。
今回この先乗り投資法を皆さんにお伝えしたい理由としてもちろん失敗してほしくないというのもあるのですが、明らかな詐欺商品や、悪評の絶えない怪しい商品も世にあふれているのも事実。
実際私もたくさんの失敗のなかで、株と同じく間違った商材を買ってしまった経験もあります。
「 本当に評判のいい商品なんてそう簡単に見つからない」
「 本当に稼げるなら、誰にも教えたくないものじゃないのか」
そういう人もいるでしょう。ですが、私は実際にこの先乗り投資法でキッチリと稼いできました。家族や友人にもこの方法はお伝えしてみんなが成功できれば、と願っています。
先乗り投資法が失敗を打ち倒す投資の最強武器
知れば知るほど目が離せない先乗り投資法の稼げる力
さて、ではここからはなぜ「先乗り投資法」が株式投資において最強の武器となりうるのかをご説明いたします。
株を購入する際になぜこのタイミングなのか、なぜこの銘柄なのか、明確な根拠とデータがその理由を裏付けるこの先乗り投資法、たった3つのメソッドで恐ろしく成果を生み出します。
「 STEP1 」～源太指数を使ってお宝銘柄自動発掘～
皆さんもしかして毎朝毎晩チャートとにらめっこしてるのではないですか？
困ったことに、にらめっこに費やした時間と利益は比例しません。
実は初心者時代の私もそうでした。。チャートの見方に始まり、その法則を覚え過去のデータを調べてまた覚え…。その割にはうまく勝てず枕を濡らしました。
更に腹立たしい事に、100億200億の世界で勝ち続ける人達はそもそもチャートなんか見ていないんです。
良い銘柄さえ見つかれば大きく勝てるのは誰だってわかる、でもその良い銘柄を毎日毎日見つけるのが難しいし、５０００もの銘柄から良い銘柄を見つけ出せない多くの人が儲からずに挫折してしまう、まさに魔の森。
源太指数はそんな初心者達を成功に導くコンパスと言っていいでしょう。
源太指数を使って解析しポチポチと入力すれば、これから爆勝ちする銘柄や高騰する銘柄を簡単に見つけ出すことが出来ます。しかも、それが一年で何十個も見つかったら？更にその中に10倍、20倍になる銘柄が含まれていたら？
資産なんて面白いように増えるし、銀行口座のお金はどんどん増える。
今までに見たこともないような残高になっているのが楽しくてしょうがないですよ。
「 STEP2」～源太カレンダーによるベストタイミングでの売り買い戦術～
さて、お目当ての銘柄を見つけ出したら次は。。
この源太カレンダーを使って売買する＜タイミング＞を見極めましょう。
結局、黄金の銘柄を見つけたところで次なる関門はタイミングです。せっかくの武器も使いどころを間違えれば不発して負ける。。
大体タイミングなんてどうやって知るの？誰かが教えてくれるの？初心者時代の自分の嘆きが懐かしいです(笑)
大 口の投資家達はどうやってそこを見極めているのか。源太カレンダーはそこを見逃さない、さしずめ魔法書といったところでしょうか。
大 口投資家たちの売り買いのスケジュールが年間通して決まってるのでそれを知ればいつまでそのトレンドが続くかわかり、利確のタイミングもバッチリ見逃さない。。彼らに相乗りして勝っちゃいましょう。
つまり 「自然に効率よく、損小利大の効率が良い投資ができるようになる。」
まさに魔法の源太カレンダー。
もちろん、この時期私も目を離さず源太カレンダーを利用してましたがコロナ相場でもブレなかった事から、大荒れにも対応しているようです。
「 STEP3 」 ～ 資金管理術を使った鉄板防御と最強の攻撃戦略！～
そしてこ のSTEP3、個人的には一番大切にしています。
優れた武器もハイレベルな魔法も、結局扱うのは自分自身。
投資をする人なら絶対に、100％知っておくべき最も重要な要素。何よりも先に知り、実行していくことが必要不可欠です。それがこの＜資金管理術＞です。
かつての自分に会えるなら、お金よりも、投資術よりもまずはこれを伝えたいと時々思います。
基本的に勝てない人はこれを知らないし、ないがしろにしているからだと本気で思っています。
逆にこれを知っていれば、投資で大きく資金を目減りさせることはほぼなくなるでしょう。
しかも、株式投資はもちろん不動産投資や企業への投資、事業投資や金の売買、果てはギャンブルにまで応用し利用することが出来ます。
お金持ちという存在になるのであれば獲得必須の絶対的スキルといえます。
三種の神器まと め
「 STEP1 」～源太指数を使ってお宝銘柄自動発掘～
「 STEP2」～源太カレンダーによるベストタイミングでの売り買い戦術～
「 STEP3 」 ～ 資金管理術を使った鉄板防御と最強の攻撃戦略！～
この源太流三種の神器を使えば、自然に損小利大の投資が効率よくできるようになり、それをいくつもの優良銘柄に分散していけば、平均化されて安定的に右肩上がりに勝ち続けながら、その中にいくつかの銘柄で時折１０倍２０倍に跳ね上がってさらに資産を大きく拡大できる。
私はこの3ステップで劇的に株式投資の世界が広がり、楽しさと資産が急増しました。
最強武器 「先乗り投資法」を作った大岩川源太とは
ところで、そろそろ皆さん気になっていると思うのですが源太流三種の神器、源太指数や源太カレンダー、、、。源太って誰！？(笑)

一人孤独に戦う必要は無い、たくさんの仲間ができる
ここまで先乗り投資法が生み出す成果について話してきましたが、今回これを利用するメリットをもう一つお話させていただきます。それは、全体交流についてです。
・参加費無料の月２回セミナー

先乗り投資法によって、今までのような負けを経験し挫折してしまうという事は無くなるでしょう。が、一人孤独に戦うというものは大変なものです。

しかし、先乗り投資法では参加していただいた方、全員が儲かるように非常に重要な徹底サポートを提供しています。
サポート期間内なら回数無制限で何度も質問が可能な上にメールはもちろん、電話での質問すらも出来るほど、サポートに関しては非常に手厚いです。
ここにたどり着くまでに色々なものを試しましたが、他と見比べても電話サポートがついてる上、特に期間中何度も質問できるのは本当に珍しいと思います。
私以外の先乗り投資法実行者達の評判・口コミ
発案者の大岩川先生はもちろん、投資を始めて失敗を経験しそれでも挫けないで頑張れたのは多くの方々の支えあってです。
私はこの先乗り投資法をたくさんの方々に利用して頂き、みんなが成果を上げて稼ぎ、自分の求める幸せを掴む事が出来ればと考えています。
私自身、まだまだ目指せる先がある旅の途中なのでそこまで発言に力があるとは思っていません。ですので、私以外の先乗り投資法利用者の賛否両論の声をここに記載させて頂きます。
「知識が無くても稼げるようになるのがいい」（26歳・フリーター・男性）
株はもちろん投資という言葉の意味もはっきりと答えられない状態でスタートした為、三種の神器の凄さを最初は理解できませんでした。
でもどうしても将来の為に投資を始めたくて、手厚いサポートを最大限利用して、月2回のセミナーにも顔を出してるうちに難しい、よりも楽しいが優先していき気が付けば様々な知識と体験が頭に入ってきました。
今最大の謎はそんな自分がどうしてここまで稼げてしまっているかです(笑)
「 簡単すぎて、且つ凄すぎる」（37歳・会社員・男性）
株 は30歳になった頃からちょっとづつ始めました。もともと投資に興味があったのでちょっとした小遣い稼ぎ程度に小さく勝って、小さく負けてを繰り返してました。
ところがこの先乗り投資法、、、ちょっと凄すぎます。自分はかなり慎重なタイプで大勝負なんて絶対やらない！なんて考えてたのに、源太カレンダーの登場で気が付けば当時では考えられない額を稼いでしまいました。。
いつのまにか大きい金額を動かす余裕が口座にも心にも出来ていました。。これから投資をはじめるなら絶対コレです！
「 正直もっと稼げるかと思った」（27歳・フリーター・男性）
たしかにこの先乗り投資法、明確な根拠で作られてるし源太指数と源太カレンダーがあればポチポチしてるだけで稼げるからすごい。
だけどもっと簡単に稼げる副業とか方法あるんじゃないかな？株式投資は興味あったからやってみたけど、、う～ん。
まぁサポートも充実してるから初心者にはオススメかもしれないですね。
「 専業主婦の小遣い稼ぎのつもりが」（42歳・主婦・女性）
20代の頃に将来を考えて株に興味を持ったんですが、当時の私には難しすぎたみたいです。
40歳になった頃、子供も大きくなってきて自分の時間が増えたタイミングでまた株に興味を持ちました。
でも当時の思い出が不安につながりうまく出来るか心配だったんですが、、源太指数を使って銘柄を選ぶようになってからは、迷いなく売り買いができるようになりました。
旦那に内緒でやってたんですが、夕飯のおかずが知らぬ間に贅沢になってたみたいで、、あっさりバレました(笑)今度の結婚記念日に旦那にはお詫びとして新しいスーツを買ってあげる予定です！
「 う～ん。不完全燃焼。」（35歳・飲食店経営・男性）
コロナショックの不況で株を始めたんだけど、先乗り投資法で紹介してる資金管理術って確かにすごく大切だし、これの有無で資産運用の質は大きく変わると思うんだけど。。これを知らない経営者って本当にいるの？
株を売り買いする上では源太指数やカレンダーは本当に感動したし稼がせて貰って感謝してるんだけど、、、。資金管理術、こんな重要な事知られてないっていう驚きの方が大きかったかな。
「 不安が消えた。」（28歳・販売員・女性）
結婚するはずの彼氏に振られたショックで突然株を始めて大損しました。。
当然、そんな不純な動機で始めたもんだから勝てるわけないですよ。
金銭面も家庭面も将来が急激に曇ったんですが、先乗り投資法がギリギリのところで私を救ってくれました。本当に感謝しています。
コロナが落ち着いたら世界旅行に行って元カレが引くぐらいのイケメン彼氏捕まえてきます。
「 なんで公開しちゃうの？！ 」(33歳・運送業・男性）
稼ぎ始めた頃は、あまりの的確さに驚いて自分だけの秘密！なんて狭い事考えてました。
今、生活は潤い家族を安定して養う事が出来ています。この先乗り投資法によって稼いだお金で
貧乏だった時代を支えてくれた方々に感謝をして回っています。
また、もっともっと先乗り投資法が広まり、困っている人や夢を掴みたい人達が成功できますように。
「 夢が夢じゃ無くなった 」 (41歳・デパート勤務・女性 )
いつか自分のブランドを立ち上げたい。そんなことを考えてがむしゃらに仕事してたら、子どもも生まれてどんどん忙しくなり、自分の夢なんてもうかなえられないと諦めていました。株を一から調べて、銘柄を選んで、タイミングを考えて、、、
この時間がかかる作業を先乗り投資法が一瞬で消してしまった。
今、開業資金も溜まったのでついに私は自分の夢に一歩踏み出すことが出来ます。
本当にありがとうございました！
今現在の私の気持ちや伝えたいことについて
皆様の貴重なお時間を割いてここまでお読み頂き、本当にありがとうございます。正直なことを言いますと、ここまで書いてきた事は真実であると同時に一体どれだけの方がこの情報を利用してくださるかという不安もあります。
私は先乗り投資法を使って大きく人生が変わりました。今まで常に感じていた「収入に対する不安」は完全に消え去り、必然的に老後2000万円問題なんて大騒ぎもどこ吹く風で、まったく心配無くなってしまいました。
それどころか自分がしたい事へ費やす時間とお金が増えて楽しい毎日を過ごしています。
そんな劇的に変わった私を見た周囲の人間は、突然増えた収入でめちゃくちゃ遊びまくったり湯水のようにお金を使っていると思っていたみたいです。
もちろん収入の急増に対して、欲に身を任せようと考えた自分がいたのも事実です。が、実際のところ今まで散々迷惑をかけた友人や家族たちへの恩返しに使っていました。
先乗り投資法は、大きな魚を人から貰うのではなく「持続的に大きな魚を釣り上げ続けるための釣り竿であり、環境」と同じだと思っています。自分への贅沢なんていつでも出来ると考えると、
まずはお世話になった方々への恩返しが何よりも優先だと感じて行動しました。
何より、そのチャンスを与えてくれた大岩川源太先生には本当に感謝の気持ちでいっぱいです。ありがとうございます。家族や友人にもこの先乗り投資法をぜひ教えてあげて、
そしてこの記事を読んでくださった皆様がどんどん幸せになることを心より願っています。
最後にこれは私自身が勝手に思っていることなので話半分で聞いて頂ければと思うのですが、世の中お金は大切ですが重要ではありません。ですが、恩返ししたい人達がいる、叶えたい自分の大切な夢がある、等など
これらの行動には大なり小なりお金が必要になってくることも事実です。今日皆様が手に入れるのはお金そのものではなく、収入を長期的かつ安定的に確保し続けるシステムそのものです。
どうか何卒、ご自身の大切な夢とご家族とご友人の為にまずは皆様自身が幸せを掴んでください。先乗り投資法はそれを実現する力になってくれます。
大岩川源太先生や家族や友人への感謝と皆様の成功を願っています。
Cameraphones are n’t just for snapping incriminating photos that unwittingly end up on the internet anymore !
Oh , wait — we guess this still applies : at 2:10 on Friday afternoon in front of 110 Spadina Avenue , this man was witnessed allegedly stealing the rear wheel of a bicycle belonging to Torontoist reader Dean Perlmutter .
According to the witness , when the man was asked if he was stealing the wheel that he just removed , he allegedly threatened the witness and rode off .
Perlmutter continues :
Undeterred , our nameless hero got on his own bike and rode after the [ alleged ] thief and pulled out his iPhone .
He tried to grab some shots of the villain as he rode , even managing to get in front of him .
He finally got off a shot of the man ’s face .
The event was discovered when Perlmutter returned to his bike , enraged to find that the wheel was missing .
A note was secured to the handlebars with the Good Samaritan ’s phone number , and after calling the witness and meeting up , Perlmutter obtained the photos .
A police report was filed today .
It ’s pretty clear that the stolen wheel is n’t likely going to return to its owner , and we ’re continually frustrated with the low priority the Toronto Police seem to put on petty bicycle theft , so props to the camera - wielding vigilante for thinking quickly .
According to Perlmutter , the witness approached a nearby police cruiser within minutes of the alleged theft , but the officers were dismissive — however , he counters that the police were interested and extremely helpful when filing the report , probably because there was solid evidence .
Anyone with further information can contact 14 Division and cite incident # 3539431 .

The Attorney - Client relationship is one of the most important business relationships that you will develop throughout your life .
Our clients trust that their communications with our firm are confidential and protected .
We do n't judge our clients , we protect them .
Do n't trust your legal matter to " legal software " or legal websites that provide " self - help at your specific direction . "
We are California estate planning attorneys with a proven track record and the legal training to understand and solve your most difficult legal challenges .
Be sure to take your time when hiring an attorney .
Make sure your attorney has the knowledge that you need to solve your legal matter .
Based in the San Jose area , our estate planning attorneys can help you protect the future of your loved ones and ensure that your wishes are respected after your death or disability .
We also can advise and represent you in matters related to trust administration and trust litigation , as well as business formation and litigation .
If you die without a will or trust in California , the laws of intestacy will determine to whom and how your property will be distributed .
The first in line to inherit will be your spouse and children , and if there is no spouse or child , your grandchildren or parents will inherit .
Estate planning allows you to have greater control over your assets and direct their distribution as you see fit .
You may use a will to name an executor , leave your property to particular individuals or organizations , and name someone to take care of your kids and manage any property that you leave them .
In order to finalize your will , you will need to sign the will in front of two independent witnesses , who also must sign it .
In order to avoid probate , a time consuming , expensive and public court proceeding , you may create a living trust , which is an arrangement whereby a trustee holds legal title to assets for the benefit of beneficiaries ( usually your spouse or children ) .
An estate worth $ 1 million dollars in California would cost $ 46,000 in fees to executives , attorneys and probate court .
The person who makes the trust is known as the settlor .
You may serve as the trustee ( manager ) of your living trust and keep control of the assets that are held in trust .
You may name someone to succeed you upon your death ( successor trustee ) or have the assets distributed to beneficiaries upon your death .
Estate planning should also include creating a durable power of attorney .
If you sign a durable power of attorney , you may designate a trusted friend ( or agent ) to handle your affairs in case of your disability or incapacitation .
The durable power of attorney will allow your attorney in fact to pay your bills and taxes , handle your legal affairs and conduct other affairs on your behalf .
You also need a similar document for health care decisions called an Advanced Health Care Directive .
Our San Jose estate planning lawyers are familiar with crafting these instruments .
When one or both settlors of a trust die , the terms of the trust must be administered ( or followed exactly ) .
It is almost always helpful for a trustee to work with an attorney to make sure that the trust is administered properly and that the assets are sufficiently protected .
The successor trustee has personal liability if he / she fails to follow the terms of the trust and probate exactly .
The start of trust administration involves providing a particular probate code notice to the beneficiaries of the trust within 60 days of the settlor 's death , after which the recipients have 120 days to file a trust contest .
The notice should include the settlor 's identity , the date on which the trust was executed , the contact information for the trustees , the address of the principal place of trust administration in case the recipient wants to file a trust contest , and a notification that the recipient has a right to get a true and complete copy of the trust terms .
However , most attorneys typically just attach a copy of the trust to the formal notice to expedite the process .
Sometimes disputes arise regarding how a trust is administered .
These may include claims that the settlor was not competent to make the trust , that undue influence was used on the settlor , and other claims of fraud , duress or mistake .
A beneficiary may have problems with how the trust is being administered by a trustee .
A petition to challenge the terms of a trust must be filed within 120 days from the time that the notice to file a case is received .
More time is available if no notice was provided .
Among the duties owed by a trustee is the duty to avoid self - dealing , such as stealing from the trust .
If a trustee is engaged in activities that help them and harm the beneficiary , this is a breach of fiduciary duty .
The beneficiaries may sue the trustee for breach of fiduciary duty in order to recover damages .
Trustees that engage in self - dealing may be removed from their position by bringing a petition to probate court .
Trustees have many duties and obligations to beneficiaries when administering a trust .
They owe a duty of fiduciary care , the highest standard of care , to the beneficiaries .
They must place the beneficiaries ' interests above their own .
Trustees must avoid conflict of interest and have a duty of loyalty to the beneficiaries .
Trustees have the following trustee duties :

Discretionary powers to be used reasonably §§16080,16081

You should only choose a trustee that will precisely follow the terms you set forth in your “ family rule book ” your living trust .

In order to grok fully the utter totality of this beatdown I have broken this video down into it 's Nonsense and Smackdown sections .
On Birthers
Nonsense :
Pat :
It 's the same reason people thought George Bush did n't act on New Orleans because African Americans were hurt .
All conspiracy theories are not created equally , though 99 % of them are utter bullshit and the other 1 % is bullshit until proven otherwise .
We have an idea as to why New Orleans was allowed to drown .
Incompetence .
Incompetence , cronyism and the desire to make money .
If NOLA does n't drown it is hard to let Haliburton and Bechtel rebuild it .
More on teh birthers
Nonsense Pat :
Why are you in the conversation then ?
Tweety : Because it 's huge ?
Pat : It is Not huge !?!
Just the tone in Pat 's voice as he defends the fact that the birthers are not a problem is a delight to my ears , but the smackdown is even better .
The smackdown of teh birthers
Joe Conason :
The leadership of their party is in talk radio .
It 's in the wilder reaches of the blogosphere .
Those are the people who have put this forward , and , the people who believe this in the Republican base really do n't care what the politicians in their party are saying about it .
They give a mealy mouthed answer like Bob Corker ( who was on moments before ) , " You know , well , I think so ( that Obama is an American ) , but I am sure glad to hear from the people that do n't . "
They are listening to the people with conviction who are on talk radio , and they are saying " Hey , Barack Obama is from another country ! " and you know why they are saying it , they are trying to create fear of the other , fear of a black president .
~snip ~
It lies in the weakness of the Republican leadership as it is , and the strength of the crazy fringe .
We have nothing to fear but fear itself .
- Democratic Presdident F.D.R. 1937
If the Democrats win this election there is a good chance we will be attacked by terrorists again .
- Republican Vice President Dick Cheney 2006
Fear , lies , stupidity .
These are the things you must shove down the electorates throat to get these Republicans elected without any ideas .
On the future of the Republican party
Nonsense : Pat ( Defensively and pleading ) : The Republican party is not in bad shape .
The Republican party is getting in better shape . . .
Tweety : Because of this ?!?
~ snip ~ Pat : Republicans are doing fine ~snip ~
Pat : I 'm telling you will we pick up , I believe , we will pick up thirty seats in the House ~snip ~
Pat :
We will not nominate another moderate .
They lose every time for the Presidency .
You nominate a conservative for 2012 and he can beat Barack Obama .
The smackdown :
Pat does it to himself .
The GOP is doing it to themselves .
We just learned through
The most recent Gallup polls that only four states can be considered strong Republican states , and Pat Buchanan thinks that the GOP can win by being more conservative ?
Really ?
If only they could get enough voters who would agree with them .
Unless they win every white undecided vote and lose no more of their own party , I think Pat may be in for a surprise .
Oh , and He ?
So , we do n't need minorities OR women ?
But the GOP is going to win 30 seats back in two years with this crowd of birthers , climate change deniers , evolution deniers and know - nothings ?
We have kinda figured out the tax cut thing , when you guys talk about tax cuts you are talking about the Monopoly man , not us .
How are they going to win with no new ideas , no new faces , no new anything , just the same old everything ?
Really ?
How ?
Think about this .
When redistricting comes up , if the GOP does n't pull off a 30 seat coup , they are really up shit 's creek .
No more gerrymandered House districts mean that even more GOP incumbents will be at risk to competitive races with Democrats .
The whiging out might be just around the corner , if the Democrats play their cards right .
Of course , that is a BIG IF .
On climate change
Nonsense : Pat :
They got this , global warming is now a hoax .
Tweety :
You think global warming is a hoax ?
Pat : I do think it IS a hoax !
~ snip ~
Tweety :
So people like Al Gore have cooked this up ?
Pat : I think he believes it , just like the birthers believe it .
He is just like they are , it is a religious belief for them .
The Smackdown Tweety : So science and anti- science are equal ?
Joe Conason : Democrats will be very lucky if the Republicans listen to people like Pat , who spread ideas that are very outmoded , they were outmoded when he started to spread them 40 years ago , particularly about race and entitlement to white people and all the rest of that .
This is a party that is in decline , partly because the leadership of it is nuts on talk radio , and party because they have no answers to the problems that really exist , whether it is climate change , or whether it is a health care system that does n't work for most Americans anymore .
No ideas .
None .
Nothing .
Zip. Zero .
And finally , the coup de grace of batshit nonsense .
On evolution
Nonsense
Tweety :
Let me tell you what the problem with your party is .
I can have a Presidential debate at the Reagan library , and we can ask who believes in evoultion here , and you can get a show of hands of people who do n't !
~snip ~ Pat : I did n't take biology .
They made me take Greek .
The Smackdown ( courtesy of Pat ) Pat :
Do I believe that a big bang created the earth ?
Or man came out of some , tadpoles ?
No !
I do n't believe that , and I do n't believe you do either !
Tweety :
Did you climb trees as a kid ?
How many trees has Pat Buchanan fallen out of , and how many ugly branches did he hit on the way down ?
Now THAT is how they should use Pat Buchanan at MSNBC .
That is worth paying him for .
Whenever a Republican sell out like Senator Corker comes out and says some nonsense like " You know , well , I think so ( that Obama is an American ) , but I am sure glad to hear from the people that do n't. " , the next thing you should do is bring on feeble old Pat and let him prattle on about how Al Gore is just like the birthers in his crazy conspiracy fed belief that the reason it is almost 100 degrees in Seattle this summer has something to do with man made climate change .
MSNBC had one of their best days EVER yesterday , between KO 's Special Comment , Maddow 's brilliant satriric reporting and this episode of Hardball which had many other highlightable moments .
Pat the analysist is a fool , and not worth the money .
But Pat the Partisan is a caricature of America from 40 years ago , and he should be carted on stage and laughed at whenever the opportunity arises .
Let Pat wallow in the idea that all the GOP needs to do is say No and obstruct until America falls apart , and then we will turn to a REAL CONSERVATIVE to save the day , not like that fake Conservative John McCain .
Let Pat believe that God created the earth 6000 years ago and real science does n't matter because he says so , and I will sit here and count the angeles that dance on the head of a pin , which is the same size as the common sense locked within a GOP Leaders ability to judge the American electorate at this point .
They are so out of touch they are no longer on planet earth .
Amazingly , Pat Buchanan really does speak to and for the Religious Right .
Just let that sink in for another , oh , I 'd say year and a half or so .
Finally , to complete the Brutal Beatdown of Pat Buchanan .
Chris Matthews : I never know when you are going to be an analysist and when you are going to be a full mooner .
You could say the same thing about the whole party .
Serious ?
Or Howling at the moon ?
And that is the core of the GOP 's problem .
They can not be the voice of reason AND the fringe at the same time .
We see the players changing costume on stage and it ruins the illusion .
Much like in 1984 , the inner party requires the most indoctrination .
Us proles do not have to believe , we just do n't have to fight back .
As long as we do n't fight back , the matrix works .
But now the system is breaking down .
We are starting to learn .
But the GOP truly believes .
They believe their own spin .
They are losing it .
They are howling at the moon , and can't do it with a straight face .
A moon which was made of green cheese 6000 years ago , where Obama was born by Mooninite parents and while the sun revolves around a flat earth that is getting colder .
Priceless .

Paying people who generate green energy and feed it back to the grid is the best way to boost uptake of renewable energy .
ONE day , 100 per cent of our energy will have to come from renewable sources .
But how do we make it happen ?
There is a proven way to rapidly boost the adoption of renewable energy – give companies or individuals who want to generate green energy access to the grid and promise to pay them extra for the electricity they “ feed in ” over the next 20 years or so .
This approach is known as a feed - in tariff , and since Germany introduced feed - in tariffs in 1990 , the proportion of electricity it generates from renewable sources has grown from less than 3 per cent to about 15 per cent in 2008 .
By comparison , the UK , which tried to boost renewable energy through an alternative “ green certificate ” scheme , generated just 5 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources in 2008 .
Other countries are now trying to emulate Germany ’s success .
To date , 21 European countries have introduced some form of feed - in tariff , and this year the UK , South Africa and the Canadian province of Ontario announced plans to implement similar schemes .
The catch with feed - in tariffs is that consumers or taxpayers have to foot the bill for the higher price paid for renewable energy .
Partly for this reason , they generally favour or are limited to smaller generators .
While this is not ideal , small power generators can make a big difference if …

Background :
This uninhabited island was claimed by the US in 1857 for its guano , and mining took place between 1865 and 1898 .
The lighthouse , built in 1917 , was shut down in 1996 and administration of Navassa Island transferred from the Coast Guard to the Department of the Interior .
A 1998 scientific expedition to the island described it as a unique preserve of Caribbean biodiversity ; the following year it became a National Wildlife Refuge .
A lot of countries have dual court systems ; one that applies to non-Muslims , the other to Muslims .
Malaysia is a good example of this .
I would like to see your Christian court system , created by what you know of Christianity .
Keep in mind this is n't the Jewish example .
Jesus came and died for your sins , so some are n't really sins anymore , are they ?
The rules have changed .
Based on your knowledge of the Jesus cult , what laws still apply ?
Here are some of the basic rules :
To denounce your faith or to convert to another is punishable by death .
( As documented in religious texts . )
The decision of a religious court cannot be overturned by the secular one .
( So human rights violations in the Bible must be legal punishments . )
Ready ?
Go !
I want a functioning dual - legal system by this time next week !
The man ran across the pitch waving a West Ham shirt A youth football worker has reacted with anger to the sight of a West Ham fan joining a pitch invasion with a boy of about four on his shoulders .
The man ran on to the pitch amid chaotic scenes during Tuesday 's Carling Cup game between West Ham and Millwall .
Joe Long , chairman of the East London and Essex Junior Football League ( ELE ) , called the man 's actions " disgusting " .
A Football Association spokesman condemned the behaviour and said the man should receive a lifetime ban .
He joined in with one of three pitch invasions at the game which was marred by fighting .
The message it is sending is very disturbing
Joe Long , ELE chairman
Read your comments and reaction
One man was stabbed before the match outside the ground and at least 13 people were arrested during the course of the evening .
Video footage shows the supporter in question running along the side of the pitch waving a West Ham football strip in one hand .
A boy who appears to be about four clings to his shoulders .
Mr Long said : " It is sickening - absolutely disgusting .
The message it is sending is very disturbing .
" Running on the pitch with a young child on your shoulders is not an example to give to young people . "
A spokesman for the FA - which has been trying to attract more families to the game - said : " Clearly , it is a criminal offence for anyone to encroach upon the playing area .
" All I can do is again condemn any such behaviour . "
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said he could not discuss individual cases .
A spokesman for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said they had no comment .

New York
In 1987 , Congress passed a joint resolution declaring jazz to be “ a rare and valuable national treasure . ”
Nowadays the music of Louis Armstrong , Duke Ellington , Charlie Parker and Miles Davis is taught in public schools , heard on TV commercials and performed at prestigious venues such as New York ’s Lincoln Center , which even runs its own nightclub , Dizzy ’s Club Coca - Cola .
Here ’s the catch : Nobody ’s listening .
No , it ’s not quite that bad — but it ’s no longer possible for head - in - the - sand types to pretend that the great American art form is economically healthy or that its future looks anything other than bleak .
The bad news came from the National Endowment for the Arts ’ latest Survey of ­Public Participation in the Arts , the fourth to be conducted by the NEA ( in participation with the U.S. Census Bureau ) since 1982 .
These are the findings that made jazz musicians sit up and take ­notice :
Certainly the most stunning 1 - bedroom place I ’ve come across ; the residence at 55 Blair Road in Singapore is a beautiful solution to the design challenges of a long and narrow space .
The most eye - catching and unique feature of this residence is the private outdoor pool that separates the kitchen , powder room , maids ’ area and rooftop terrace from the rest of the main residence .
With dramatic aluminum walls that span the height of the building , natural light ( which reflects well off the aluminum ) and ventilation fill the household .
The main staircase that leads to the second floor and attic is a beautiful wide spiral design that saves a tremendous amount of space .
Most spiral staircases I ’ve seen are far too narrow and impractical , but this particular design in the middle of the living room works very nicely .
The spiral design is employed again at the back of the property to go from the main floor kitchen to rooftop terrace .
On the second floor we find the master bedroom with en-suite that has an exquisite bathtub overlooking the pool .
On the other side , there is also a large void that not only allows a view onto the first - floor , but separates the bedroom area from the connecting study / lounge area .
Rich walnut planks run throughout the second and third floor .

55 Blair road was a renovation / restoration to a traditional art deco style shop house .
Originally , the house was renovated 10 years ago but the new owner believed it was too dark and wanted more natural light in the living spaces .
The width of the space was certainly a restraint measuring about 5 meters or 16.5 feet across .
Overall I think this is a beautiful and unique design .
The layout is not suitable for a large family as there is only one master bedroom and a small guest bed in the attic .
I wonder about the inconvenience of the outdoor pool separating you from the kitchen during heavy rainstorms but I suppose that ’s what the maid / help is for ?
The interior design is not really my taste but that can be altered easily .
I love a clean , simple look but it ’s a little too white and sterile for me .
I would be overridden with guilt should I dirty anything or move an object from its place , but again , I guess that ’s what the maid / help is for ?
I do love the pool concept and the gnarled tree is a perfect compliment .
There is a definite tranquility about the place that is very appealing .
Oh , and no loud music or excessive noise is permitted here , I think the house would get very upset with you .

If you enjoyed this article , the Sifter recommends : The House with the Grass Roof in Ksiazenice , Poland
CNN , ABC , and Fox got interviews with Sarah Palin in the last 24 hours .
When the other interviews become available , I ’ll add that to this post , but we have the CNN interview , conducted by Drew Griffen yesterday afternoon .
It ’s lengthy but worthwhile :
ABC has a report out on its interview , conducted by Kate Snow :
“ You know conditions have really changed in Alaska in the political arena since Aug. 29 , since I was tapped to run for VP .
When that opposition research — those researchers really bombarded Alaska — started digging for dirt and have not let up .
They ’re not gonna find any dirt , ” she said .
“ We keep proving that every time we win an ethics violation lawsuit and we ’ve won every one of them .
But it has been costing our state millions of dollars .
It ’s cost Todd and me .
You know the adversaries would love to see us put on the path of personal bankruptcy so that we ca n’t afford to run . ”
But when I asked Palin if she ever decided to pursue national office again , as she did less than a year ago when she joined Sen.
John McCain , R - Ariz. , in the race for the White House , would n’t she encounter the same political blood sport ?
Can such ugliness ever be avoided ?
Palin said there is a difference between the White House and what she has experienced in Alaska .
If she were in the White House the “ department of law ” would protect her from baseless ethical allegations .
“ I think on a national level your department of law there in the White House would look at some of the things that we ’ve been charged with and automatically throw them out , ” she said .
There is no “ Department of Law ” at the White House .
Another major reason that Palin said she is walking away from her first term as Alaska ’s governor is because after she made the decision not to seek a second term as governor she would be a lame duck and she said she refuses to “ milk ” that status .
She said most politicians “ say it ’s a paycheck , it ’s a paycheck and I get to travel around .
No !
That ’s politics as usual . ”
If Palin wants us to accept this at “ face value , ” as she says in both the CNN and ABC interviews , then she needs to stop talking about her supposed lame - duck status .
She would n’t have been a lame duck for 16 months .
George Bush was not a lame duck in 2005 , 2006 , 2007 , or even most of 2008 as president .
In that time , Bush got two Supreme Court appointments confirmed , began holding the line on spending after the 2006 election , and most importantly kept Iraq from being abandoned by Congress .
During the last two years , Bush fought off legal action by Congress and a variety of political opponents , much as the Clintons did in their last term , and neither quit to do it , even after Clinton was invited to do so by the House of Representatives .
Otherwise , the CNN shows a relaxed Palin , more herself than at any time , taking tough but fair questions from Griffen with aplomb .
I do n’t think this will convince those who have made up their minds one way or the other , but it ’s better to have Palin answering these questions directly .
Update : Time Magazine gets the print - venue exclusive with Sarah Palin .
And here ’s the Fox video :
Naturally , cooking ranks with the Navy and the yakuza as one of the great tattooed vocations , though the images sometimes differ .
The most committed chefs are known to ink tools and ingredients onto their bodies -- a sign that they 're in it for more than just the endless desserts .
Not that chefs are n't already marked by their trade .
Look at their hands , and you 'll see cuts , calluses , scars ; look at their arms , and you 'll see burn marks from reaching into an oven in a busy kitchen .
Once a friend was buying a knife at Bridge Kitchenware , and he asked for a professional discount , a standard practice , but he had forgotten his restaurant 's business card .
He held up his ruined hands and asked , '' Will these do ? ''
The chefs on these pages could have shown their tattoos .

Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has a rather curious new addition built in to his latest oversized yacht .
The 557 - foot boat Eclipse , the price tag of which has almost doubled since original plans were drawn to almost $ 1.2 billion , set sail this week with a slew of show - off features , from two helipads , two swimming pools and six - foot movie screens in all guest cabins , to a mini-submarine and missile - proof windows to combat piracy .
It might not seem like somebody with such ostentatious tastes would crave privacy , but along with these expensive toys , Ambramovich has installed an anti-paparazzi “ shield ” .
Lasers sweep the surroundings and when they detect a CCD , they fire a bolt of light right at the camera to obliterate any photograph .
According to the Times , these do n’t run all the time , so friends and guests should still be able to grab snaps .
Instead , they will be activated when guards spot the scourge of professional photography , paparazzi , loitering nearby .
We dig it , although the British courts might not be so pleased .
UK photo magazine Amateur Photographer asked a London lawyer about the legalities of destroying photos from afar .
Here ’s what he said : “ intermeddling with goods belonging to someone else , or altering their condition , is a trespass to goods and will entitle the photographer to claim compensation without having to prove loss . ”
Any sentence containing the word “ intermeddling ” is of course wonderful .
The lawyer spoils it somewhat by ( inevitably ) mentioning James Bond and mixing up lasers with laser guns : “ I would also be worried that lasers cause collateral damage , both to the camera and / or the claimant ’s health . ”

What is OLED ?
These days this advanced TV panel technology can be found in a lot of new and premium televisions .
We ’re not surprised you might want to know more what you 're paying for before you buy .
OLED stands for ' Organic Light Emitting Diode ' .
This describes the kind of panel used to display images , colors , and light in your TV – in contrast to other kinds of TV panel technologies , including CRT ( cathode ray tube ) , LED - LCD , or QLED ( quantum dot ) .
You will find OLED tech is used in a host of display devices , but you ’ll most often find it in OLED TVs , as well as certain high - end smartphones , including the iPhone 11 Pro .
We do n’t think you need to get to grips with every acronym when you want to buy a TV , but OLED is an important term to familiarise yourself with if you 're on the lookout for a new smart TV , or you ’re just keen to understand the latest chatter around today 's best TVs on the market right now .
That 's because so many of the latest and greatest televisions have OLED panels built - in , with only Samsung 's QLED panels offering a rival type of TV tech .

But although OLED is ( almost ) everywhere , that does n't mean it is n't worth shouting about .
Compared to its predecessors – and most of the LCDs currently on the market – OLED TVs bring you much better image quality ( think blacker blacks and brighter whites ) , as well as faster response times and reduced power consumption .
Not everyone owns an OLED TV , of course , because of a pretty steep price barrier .
Fortunately , that ’s slowly changing , largely thanks to more affordable models , including the LG B9 , and a smaller 48 - inch size for the CX OLED and Sony A9G OLED .
The question you need to answer if you ’re in the market for a new TV is : should you believe the OLED hype ?
Do n’t worry , we 've run you through everything you need to know about the big screen buzzword in the guide below .

Should I worry about OLED burn - in ?
Probably not .
Image retention is n't a widespread problem , and you 're unlikely to be affected – though we have more information on this below .
OLED explained
What is OLED , and how is it different ?
OLED stands for Organic Light - Emitting Diode , with " organic " referring to the carbon film that sits inside the panel before the glass screen .
OLED panels emit their own light when an electric current is passed through , whereas cells in a LCD - LED display require an external light source , like a giant backlight , for brightness .
This backlight is what separated LCD screens from their LED variants .
A traditional LCD screen has a backlight ( called a cold - cathode fluorescent light , or CCFL ) which is uniform across the entire back of the screen .
This means that whether the image is black or white , it is being lit by exactly the same brightness across the panel .
This reduces what we call " hotspots , " or areas of super bright light , because the actual light source illuminating them is uniform .
This all started a few years back when engineers at companies like Samsung and Sony introduced an array of LEDs as a backlight , which meant that if a certain part of the screen was black then those LEDs behind that portion could be turned off to make it appear blacker .
This is a better solution than a CCFL backlight , but it still has its problems .
Since it 's a light behind the LCD producing the illumination rather than the LCD layer itself , the illumination is not entirely in - sync with the pixel in front of it .
The result is an effect called ' blooming ' , whereby LED light from bright portions of the image bleeds over into areas of blackness .
This is what separates OLEDs from LCD / LED displays .
In an OLED TV display , the pixels themselves are the things producing the light , and so when they need to be black they are able to turn off completely , rather than relying on a backlight to turn off on their behalf .
Most OLED
TVs offer exceptional picture quality , though they need to be paired with a high - spec processor to really do sources justice ( Image credit : Panasonic )
OLED : what are the advantages ?
The result is remarkably dark blacks in an image , and when you combine this with the bright whites of an OLED panel , you 're left with a fantastically vibrant image .
LG and Panasonic , pretty much the most consistent producers of OLED televisions on the planet , like to use the term " infinite contrast " to describe how the self - lighting pixels switch off completely when reproducing black giving it an " absolute " black color instead of a " relative " black that only describes how dark one pixel can get compared to the brightest pixel on the screen .
For years there was a question mark about longevity of OLED panels , while production lines have been impossible to make profitable due to high failure rates .
But as companies like LG invest billions in development of OLED – with the likes of Philips and Sony joining the fray – its affordability is improving , even if it 's still more expensive than competing technologies .
Current production issues for LG 's most recently - opened TV factory wo n't be helping that price drop come quicker , either .
The advantages of OLED go beyond simple static image quality , though , to the responsiveness and smoothness of the display itself , meaning gamers and home cinema aficionados are going to absolutely love OLED TV .
OLED panels are capable of a refresh rate of as low as 0.001 ms , which for reference , is around 1,000 times faster than a standard LED - backlit LCD panel , while also being superior to the now - discontinued plasma tech , too .
And , because the lighting source they use is so tiny , the depth of screen sizes has shrunk at the same rate .
That means OLED TVs have awesomely deep blacks and bright , peak whites , improved color accuracy as well as smooth responsive motion - and all from a form factor that 's just a few millimeters in depth and much lighter than standard TVs .

OLED : which OLED TVs are out now ?
OLED TVs have been on the market since 2012 , and a variety of manufacturers have tackled the technology over the years .
It used to be the case that OLEDs were produced by just Samsung and LG .
But Samsung dropped the technology over its cost and how difficult it was to produce , and has no intention of restarting production any time soon .
More recently , Hisense ditched its OLED focus too .
LG , on the other hand , has been releasing OLED sets consistently over the last few years .
The 2020 LG TV line - up has seen a new LG CX Series OLED , an LG GX ‘ Gallery ’ Series OLED to replace the old LG E9 , an LG Signature ZX 8K OLED , as well as many others .
If you 're not big into LG TVs , there are plenty more OLED TVs to look forward to in 2020 too .
The Panasonic 2020 TV line - up includes the high - end Panasonic HZ2000 OLED , as well as a more affordable HZ980 series that 's new for this year – while more mid-range OLED sets like the Philips 55OLED754 continue to perform well in our tests .

OLED : how much does it cost ?
OLED
TVs are definitely getting cheaper , but they 're still a long way from what we 'd call affordable .
The prices of new LG TVs start at $ 1,600 in the US and £ 1,500 in the UK , and Panasonic 's are more expensive still .
The scarcity of OLED TVs on the market means that those small number of players in the market are more or less free to charge exactly what they want .
An increase in competition , though , is helping to change that , as is the introduction of a new 48 - inch panel size and a scaling up of production .
It 's significantly cheaper to buy a 2019 OLED right now , with the budget LG B9 costing just $ 1,300 / £ 1,100 and the Philips OLED 754 retailing at only £ 999 – not cheap compared to some LCD sets , but still the cheapest way to get a decent OLED into your home .

Burn-in
Do I need to worry about OLED burn -in ?
What is OLED burn - in ?
Burn in , or image retention , is when an image or sequence is played so often and continuously on a television set that it leaves a permanent mark on the panel – obviously not ideal for a home television .
You do n't particularly need to worry , as it largely happens only when displaying a static image or sequence on repeat , as with a display unit in a showroom or retail store .
You should get several years warranty , anyhow , and we do n't see many home cinema fans using their OLED TV in this way .
TV makers like LG are also working to limit the risk of this , with screen saver features , a Screen Shift function that " moves the screen slightly at regular intervals to preserve image quality " , and " Logo Luminance Adjustment , which can detect static logos on the screen and reduce brightness to help decrease permanent image retention " ( via LG.com ) .
But if you 're planning on leaving your TV for countless hours at a time – say , to parent the children in your absence , or to play the same looping video over and over – then OLED may not be the right panel technology for you .
Burn - in should n't worry you , thanks to Screen Shift functions and improving manufacturing processes ( Image credit : Toshiba )
What 's next ?
What 's the future for OLED ?
OLED is an expensive panel technology that has finally managed to gain traction – after spending so long as an outlier than we wrote an opinion piece in 2014 about how the technology might be dead .
Obviously that did n't turn out to be the case , and we 're seeing plenty of stunning OLED models hitting the market , even if price points are still taking an age to drop within reach of regular consumers .
But just because OLED is n't affordable yet does n't mean it 's not getting better .
An $ 1,600 / £ 1,200 price tag is n't what we 'd consider budget , but it 's a great deal cheaper than what OLED was retailing for even just a year ago .
That trend is always going to be good news for the consumer , though manufacturers may have other things in mind .
Samsung is one of several TV makers looking to develop what 's called QD - OLED : a new type of OLED panel that uses quantum dot emitters to improve brightness .
The tech is very much in development , but when it arrives , it could meld the competing QLED and OLED technologies and render previous methods of production obsolete .

A quantum photonic experiment .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A primitive quantum computer that uses single particles of light ( photons ) whizzing through a silicon chip has performed its first mathematical calculation .
This is the first time a calculation has been performed on a photonic chip and it is major step forward in the quest to realise a super - powerful quantum computer .
The chip takes four photons that carry the input for the calculation , it then implements a quantum programme ( Shor ’s algorithm ) to find the prime factors of 15 , and outputs the answer - 3 and 5 .
The results are reported by a team of physicists and engineers from the University of Bristol in today ’s issue of Science .
“ This task could be done much faster by any school kid , ” said PhD student , Alberto Politi , who , together with fellow PhD student Jonathan Matthews performed the experiment , “ but this is a really important proof - of - principle demonstration . ”
Finding prime factors may seem like a mathematical abstraction , but it lies at the heart of modern encryption schemes , including those used for secure internet communication .
The ability of quantum computers to simulate quantum systems may also prove to be a powerful tool in the development of new materials or pharmaceuticals .
The team from the University of Bristol ’s newly established Centre for Nanoscience and Quantum Information have spent several years developing devices where photons propagate in silica waveguides — much like in optical fibres — micro-fabricated on a silicon chip .
“ This approach results in miniature , high - performance and scalable devices , ” said Professor Jeremy O’Brien , Director of the Centre for Quantum Photonics , who led the research .
“ The realisation of a quantum algorithm on a chip is an extremely important step towards an all - optical quantum computer ”
“ Despite recent advances , the ability to perform even small - scale quantum algorithms has largely been missing , ” said Matthews .
“ For the last few years , researchers at the Centre for Quantum Photonics have been working towards building fully functional quantum circuits on a chip to solve this issue , ” added O’Brien .

The team coupled four photons into and out of the chip using optical fibres .
On the chip the photons traveled through silica waveguides that were brought together to form a sequence of quantum logic gates .
The output was determined by which waveguides the photons exited the chip in .
By detecting the photons at the output of the device they confirmed high - performance operation of the quantum algorithm .
“ As well as quantum computing and quantum metrology , ‘ on - chip ’ photonic quantum circuits could have important applications in quantum communication , since they can be easily integrated with optical fibres to send photons between remote locations , ” said Politi .
O’Brien concurred and added : “ The really exciting thing about this result is that it will enable the development of large scale quantum circuits for photons .
This opens up all kinds of possibilities ” .

The Department of Energy still has 98.8 percent of its stimulus cash sitting in the bank .
Only $ 451 million of the $ 36.7 billion the DOE received when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was signed into law in February has been accounted for as " spent . "
It 's a stunning number , but it 's likely more money has already been spent , even if it has n't made it onto the agency 's books yet .
It just takes a while for the money spent on new jobs or projects to be recorded , said Matt Rogers , a senior advisor to Secretary of Energy , Steven Chu , and the department 's Recovery Act czar .
" We have moved $ 9.8 billion out the door , " Rogers told Wired.com .
" I think we 're right on track with where we expected to be . "
The DOE has only awarded $ 10 billion to companies , which works out to a little over a quarter of its total stimulus cash .
That does n't compare favorably with the average agency .
Thirty - five percent of the total sum of money that all federal agencies received has already been spent .
But perhaps we should expect the DOE to take a little more time reviewing applications .
The DOE spending situation is paralleled at the other science - based agencies like the National Science Foundation , NASA , and Environmental Protection Agency .
Together , those agencies have only registered 1.2 percent of their $ 44 billion in Recovery
Act money spent .
Rogers argued the DOE 's pace and process were most advantageous for taxpayers , though .
He referenced the competitive applications that were submitted by companies in hopes of grabbing $ 2.4 billion for advanced batteries .
More than 2,000 peer reviewers are helping vet applications for the DOE .
" We awarded one out of every five projects , so the projects we were able to select are terrific projects , " Rogers said .
" If we do n’t go through this competitive process , you do n’t see the best projects .
There 's a time - quality trade - off . "
The agency expects to award $ 16 billion by the end of September and $ 30 billion by the end of 2009 , Rogers said .
An additional $ 4 billion in loan guarantees might not show up in the books for months , but that money is headed into the field , too .
If they hit their targets , more than 90 percent of the cash that Congress gave the DOE will be out of the agency 's hands , even if it technically remains in the bank .
" We have a lag between obligation and costing , " Rogers said .
" I 've been less focused on the costing column because I do n't think it is illustrative of the hiring and impact in the marketplace .
I 'm going to be more worried about that if we do n’t see it moving by the end of the year . "
Departments like Labor , Agriculture , and Commerce used their cash for projects that did n't require a competitive grant application process .
Thus , the Department of Labor has spent nearly 68 percent of its $ 24.7 billion allotment and the Department of Health and Human Services 65 percent of its $ 42.3 billion .
Curt Rich , head of public policy practice at Van Ness Feldman , said the DOE had an uphill battle getting the funds out quickly .
He noted that the main internal beneficiary of the DOE , the office for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy had never seen this kind of money .
And it all came flowing in under a new administration and DOE chief .
" While folks were waiting for solicitations to come out , there was some grousing , " Rich said .
" I think in hindsight , what they 've been able to get done in six months is very impressive . "
One would - be DOE stimulus money recipient , Oakland solar thermal company , Brightsource , gave the process high marks , too , even if it was taking a while .
" My opinion is that the DOE is doing a really good job in balancing the need for immediate stimulus while protecting the taxpayers ' interest , " said Keely Wachs , a spokesperson for the company , which has been negotiating a loan guarantee deal with the agency for months .
" When I put only my Brightsource hat on , I think , ' Let 's get it done . '
But as a taxpayer , I want to make sure that those funds are being used appropriately . "
Many in the clean tech industry , which will receive the lion 's share of the funds , expect the DOE to ramp up pay - outs to companies over the next few weeks .
" We 've got very high assurances that the floodgates are about to open in early September , " said Dallas Kachan , managing director of the Cleantech Group .
Rogers said to expect major announcements out of the DOE every couple of weeks .
For example , the grant winners receiving some of the $ 4.5 billion allocated to smart grid equipment will be announced soon .
" We 'll see the big , investment - focused pieces now , " Rogers said .
" That 's going to be the primary story as we work through the fall . "

Introduction
Gamers have competitive streaks , plain and simple .
Does n’t matter whether you ’re a casual or hardcore gamer , by definition you want to compete at some level .
Most games are about winning at some level of purpose , and competition tends to bring out the passion in people .
Manchester United ?
New York Yankees ?
Toronto Maple Leafs ?
Yes , we have our favourite teams , and competition does indeed bring out the fans .
Passion can be a good thing , when harnessed , and computer gamers certainly have passionate streaks as well .
A result of passion , when directed to a particular thing or company , is properly termed brand loyalty .
Companies love brand loyalty , and they spend very large sums of money to cultivate and foster brand loyalty .
In the tech world , those that have a strong brand loyalty are usually known by another , more common name : fanboys .
Ah yes , the ATI vs Nvidia , AMD vs Intel flame wars ; nothing quite stirs a tech forum than such lively debates .
Today we ’re interested in the latter of those : AMD vs Intel .
Yes , dear friends , it does n’t get much more contentious than that .
We ’ve decided to tackle the debate head - on , and specifically a hot topic that sets off the passion : is AMD or Intel better for gaming ?
Specifically , the Phenom II and Core i7 respectively .
There are pros and cons to each , and we ’ve seen some people attempt to tackle that debate , but to date we believe the comparisons are fundamentally flawed , such as using different graphics cards or dual / quad cores to compare .
That ’s about as good as comparing apples to horseshoes .
No , today , we ’ll attack the big question straight up by using the exact same setups except for the AMD / Intel core components .
And we ’re going to chart the performance differences in many different scenarios , at stock and overclocked CPU speeds , in single and dual graphics card configurations , and at different resolutions .
And as an added bonus , we ’re also going to compare prices and evaluate gaming value ; does that money on a Core i7 give you better framerates ?
If so , how much is that extra worth ?
Will the Phenom II framerates tank in Crysis ?
Yes , those are exactly the things we ’re going to show you .
There ’s a ton of ground to cover , so strap on your flak jacket and buckle up .
This is about to get very , very interesting .
Random thoughts from outside the comfort zone .
Editor 's note : Wendell Potter has served since May 2009 as senior fellow on health care at the Center for Media and Democracy , a nonprofit organization that says it seeks to expose " corporate spin and government propaganda . "
After a 20 - year career as a corporate public relations executive , Potter left his job last year as head of communications for one of the nation 's largest health insurers , CIGNA Corporation .
Ex-insurance company spokesman Wendell Potter says the industry seeks to drive the health care debate .
( CNN ) --
Having grown up in one of the most conservative and Republican places in the country -- East Tennessee --
I understand why many of the people who are showing up at town hall meetings this month are reacting , sometimes violently , when members of Congress try to explain the need for an expanded government role in our health care system .
I also have a lot of conservative friends , including one former co-worker who was laid off by CIGNA several years ago but who nonetheless worries about a " government takeover " of health care .
The most vocal folks at the town hall meetings seem to share the same ideology as my kinfolks in East Tennessee and my former CIGNA buddy : the less government involvement in our lives , the better .
That point could n't have been made clearer than by the man standing in line to get free care at Remote Area Medical 's recent health care " expedition " at the Wise County , Virginia , fairgrounds , who told a reporter he was dead set against President Obama 's reform proposal .
Even though he did n't have health insurance , and could see the desperation in the faces of thousands of others all around him who were in similar straits , he was more worried about the possibility of having to pay more taxes than he was eager to make sure he and his neighbors would n't have to wait in line to get care provided by volunteer doctors in animal stalls .
Watch Potter interview with Sanjay Gupta »
Friday morning my former CIGNA buddy sent me an e-mail challenging something he said his wife heard me say in a radio report about my press conference in the Capitol on Wednesday with Rep. Louise Slaughter , D - New York , chairwoman of the House Rules Committee .
" She heard you say that these protestors are funded by the insurance companies .
Frankly , nothing would surprise me , but certainly not each and every person , " he wrote .
" If there was a meeting near me , I certainly would tell my local representative how I feel about this entire subject ( and it would n't be pretty ) , and I certainly am not funded by anyone .
So I am ultimately wondering what proof there is that seemingly ordinary Americans are finally protesting what is going in Washington and there are all of these suggestions of a greater conspiracy . "
If the radio report had carried more of my remarks , he might have a better understanding of how the health insurance and its army of PR people are influencing his opinions and actions without his even knowing it .
Until I quit my job last year , I was one of the leaders of that army .
I had a very successful career and was my company 's voice to the media and the public for several years .
It was my job to " promote and defend " the company 's reputation and to try to persuade reporters to write positive stories about the industry 's ideas on reform .
During the last couple of years of my career , however , I became increasingly worried that the high - deductible plans insurers were beginning to push Americans into would force more and more of us into bankruptcy .
The higher I rose in the company , the more I learned about the tactics insurers use to dump policyholders when they get sick , in order to increase profits and to reward their Wall Street investors .
I could not in good conscience continue serving as an industry mouthpiece .
And I did not want to be part of yet another industry effort to kill meaningful reform .
I explained during the press conference with Rep. Slaughter how the industry funnels millions of its policyholders ' premiums to big public relations firms that provide talking points to conservative talk show hosts , business groups and politicians .
I also described how the PR firms set up front groups , again using your premium dollars and mine , to scare people away from reform .
What I 'm trying to do as I write and speak out against the insurance industry I was a part of for nearly two decades is to inform Americans that when they hear isolated stories of long waiting times to see doctors in Canada and allegations that care in other systems is rationed by " government bureaucrats , " someone associated with the insurance industry wrote the original script .
The industry has been engaging in these kinds of tactics for many years , going back to its successful behind - the - scenes campaign to kill the Clinton reform plan .
A story in Friday 's New York Times about the origin of the absurdly false rumor that President Obama 's health care proposal would create government - sponsored " death panels " bears out what I have been saying .
The story notes that the rumor emanated " from many of the same pundits and conservative media outlets that were central in defeating Bill Clinton 's health care proposal 16 years ago , including the editorial board of The Washington Times , the American Spectator magazine and Betsy McCaughey , whose 1994 health care critique made her a star of the conservative movement ( and ultimately , the lieutenant governor of New York ) . "
The big PR firms that work for the industry have close connections with those media outlets and stars in the conservative movement .
One of their PR firms , which created and staffed a front group in the late '90s to kill the proposed " Patients ' Bill of Rights , " launched a PR and advertising campaign in conservative media outlets to drum up opposition to the bill .
The message : President Clinton " owed a debt to the liberal base of the Democrat Party and would try to pay back that debt by advancing the type of big government agenda on health care that he failed to get in 1994 . "
The industry goes to great lengths to keep its involvement in these campaigns hidden from public view .
I know from having served on numerous trade group committees and industry - funded front groups , however , that industry leaders are always full partners in developing strategies to derail any reform that might interfere with insurers ' ability to increase profits .
So the next time you hear someone warning against a " government takeover " of our health care system , or that the creation of a public health insurance option would send us down the " slippery slope toward socialism , " know that someone like I used to be wrote those terms , knowing it might turn many of the very people who would benefit most from meaningful reform into unwitting spokespeople for the industry .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wendell Potter .

With several recent comments suggesting Israel may be just weeks from formally announcing a 6 - 9 month “ freeze ” in new construction in the West Bank , Israeli officials are confirming tonight that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to authorize hundreds of new housing units across settlements in the West Bank , a serious test to the Obama Administration ’s repeated demands to stop .
The White House expressed “ regret ” over the announcement but then went on to praise Israel ’s “ stated intent to place limits on settlement activity ” and to vow that “ the US commitment to Israel ’s security is and will remain unshakeable . ”
The Israeli government ’s move is likely at least as much about placating its own hawkish coalition partners ’ anger about the prospect of a pause in growth in the settlements as it is about testing the Obama Administration ’s apparent 180 on its demands to halt all construction .
It was only last week that President Obama had backed off of materially all the demands it had made to Israel regarding the settlements , in return for a promise to eventually approve a short term pause in new construction : initially reported as “ up to a year ” but now apparently between six and nine months .
Today ’s reaction from the White House certainly suggests this position has not changed .
SALEM -- Several members of the Penns Grove Police Department , including its chief , are being sued in state Superior Court here for an incident of alleged excessive force and mistreatment that occurred more than two years ago .
According to a lawsuit filed late last month , a woman , man , juvenile and their mother were allegedly assaulted by several officers on the front porch of their home on Broad Street just after 1 a.m. on Aug. 26 , 2007 .
None were ever found guilty of a crime stemming from that night , the lawsuit maintains .
Listed in the suit are officers Joseph DiCarolis , Allan Moore , John Boucher , Sgt. Charles Brown , Sgt. John Stranahan and Chief Gary Doubledee , as well as unknown police also on the scene but not recognized .
It was filed by New Brunswick attorney Martin Perez on behalf of matriarch Margarita Rodriguez and her children Ricardo Gonzalez , Jocelyn Mercado and Eduardo Rodriguez , a minor .
The lawsuit details that Gonzalez was told to stop by police but walked into his house .
When Gonzalez is ordered outside , he again refuses and a Margarita Rodriguez encourages him to step outside , the suit claims .
As she is doing so , " both Rodriguez and Gonzalez are maced by defendant Moore who had arrived on the scene , " according to the suit .
DiCarolis then allegedly slams Gonzalez to the porch and puts his knee in his throat so he cannot breath .
Multiple officers arrive and begin kneeing and kicking him in the head and body while he is on the ground , the lawsuit alleges .
Mercado then comes from inside , at which point she is allegedly grabbed by her T - shirt , punched in the face , slammed over a railing and dragged down the porch stairs , the lawsuit reads .
When the juvenile came onto the porch from inside , he was allegedly punched so hard in the nose he fell flat on his face , according to the suit .
" All defendants were unlawfully detained , seized , arrested , removed from their home and taken to the Penns Grove Police Department for booking , " according to Perez .
" All defendants were held for several hours ... handcuffed to a bench . "
Perez alleges that medical attention was not provided and Gonzalez was held in jail for several days until he was able to post bail .
A trial by jury is demanded in the case .
Borough solicitor Adam Telsey could not be reached for comment Friday .
A phone call seeking comment from Doubledee and Stranahan was not returned Friday .
Compensatory and punitive damages of an unspecified amount are being sought along with statutory penalties and other fees on the grounds of civil right violations , negligence , assault and battery , malicious prosecution and a host of other charges .
Indictments were brought by police against Ricardo Rodriguez and Mercado .
According to the lawsuit , all charges were dismissed .

Really dry and present . ”
“ If we ’re gonna go for it then we might as well just do it and not hold back .
There are some good tunes already . ”
“ Yeah .
We should aim for something a bit more song - based now , change it up a bit .

Lost in the huge media fracas about how President Obama called Kanye West a " jackass " and whether ABC should have reported it and whether ABC 's groveling apology would restore its access to precious Obama scoops is the observation that Obama played this brilliantly .
To wit :
Obama is way too smart not to know that calling Kanye West a jackass on a live feed monitored by several rabidly competitive reporters would not get reported by someone .
Obama is also smart enough to know that :
Kanye West WAS a jackass when he grabbed the microphone away from Taylor Swift , so few people would disagree with this characterization
The word " jackass " is colorful and startling , but harmless -- and therefore very well chosen .
Obama just looks like a regular guy telling it like it is .
The Glenn Beck fans who believe that Obama is a racist whose policies and actions are driven by a " deep - seated hatred " of half the country because of their skin color will have a hard time fitting this remark into their theory -- given the respective skin colors of Kanye West and Taylor Swift .
Such a remark could never be made on the record in a normal setting , because it would be inappropriate for the President of The United States to share an opinion on such matters .
The " off the record " convention around these White House interviews would focus much of the ensuing media tumult on whether Obama had been wronged by the media -- as opposed to whether he should have said what he said .
The news organization whose reporter reported the remark would be so terrified of being given less Obama access that it would issue a groveling apology , furthering the impression that Obama had been wronged ( which ABC already has ) .
Well done , Mr. President !

BBC News , Seoul
N Korea 's media sometimes makes bombastic , even vitriolic , comments South Korea has even begun to keep count .
A government official recently claimed that North Korea 's official state media has insulted the South Korean president more than 1,700 times this year alone .
That is an average of 10 insults a day .
He is variously called " a lackey " , " a stooge " , " a dictator " and the leader of " a gang of traitors " .
The official admitted that the jibes were sometimes " downright silly " .
But the language chosen by North Korea to attack its opponents can border on the terrifying .
Last year , for example , it threatened to reduce South Korea " to ashes " and , more recently , warned of a " fire shower " of nuclear retaliation .
So , just how much attention should we be paying to this kind of rhetoric ?
Is it mere bluster , or is there a real risk that the bombastic outbursts will be translated into action ?
' Wolf in sheep 's clothing ' Michael Harrold has an unusual claim to fame .
In 1987 he became the first British citizen to be employed by the North Korean government in Pyongyang .
SELECTION OF N KOREAN QUOTES
The American Yankee is a wolf in sheep 's clothing About the US :
Even piles of manure in the fields are fuming out smoke of hatred [ S Korean leader Lee Myung - bak ] is a political charlatan , an absent - minded traitor and a US sycophant US imperialists are the greatest threat to humanity [ in the 20th Century ]
We will tear the limbs from the United States , which is an empire of evil
The situation is inching close to the brink of war due to the brigandish moves of the US His mission was to offer advice on the correct use of English for the translations of North Korean propaganda .
At the start of his seven - year posting , having arrived in a strange and bewildering city , he remembers buying himself a Korean phrase book .
" The second from last chapter was called ' useful phrases ' , " he tells me .
It included such choice essentials as : " The American Yankee is a wolf in sheep 's clothing " , and " the US imperialists are the greatest threat to humanity in the 20th Century " .
Unlikely to trip off a beginner 's tongue perhaps , but the run -of - the - mill phrase book was his first lesson in how all pervasive this kind of language is inside the reclusive country .
External enemy
So does the average North Korean go about his daily life peppering his speech with such casual insults ?
Is North Korea really one of the angriest places on the planet ?
At times when the relationship with the outside world is more peaceful they use softer language .
But when relations get worse , that 's when it gets much tougher
Prof Paik Hak - soon Joo Sung - ha , who defected from North Korea seven years ago , thinks it might be .
He is now a journalist working on the foreign desk of the Dong - A Ilbo , a South Korean broadsheet , with regular cause to analyse the propaganda coming out of Pyongyang .
" It is a unique aspect of socialist societies in general , " he tells me .
" People learn to use this kind of strong language , even in everyday life .
It is instilled into society . "
The state - run newspapers are certainly full of it , a constant hard - blowing of warnings and threats aimed at an external enemy kept constantly in the forefront of people 's minds .
But if the rhetoric is designed to rally citizens to the leadership 's cause , it may have limited effect , according to Mr Joo .
" People are too used to it .
They learn to read between the lines for the real meaning , and the often repeated words like ' war ' do n't even register . "
' Nuclear maniac '
They register in South Korea though .
So much so that North Korean propaganda is still illegal here , banned under the country 's national security laws .
To read a North Korean newspaper you need special permission to access one of the secure collections , like the one held at the Sejong Institute , a private think - tank , located just outside Seoul .
Professor Paik Hak - soon shows me round , and pulling a large volume of the Pyongyang Times off the shelves , it falls open at an edition from March 1988 .
North Korea recently threatened a ' fire shower ' of attack Little has changed , it seems .
Right there in the first paragraph is the talk of the " US imperialists " and the South Korean " military fascist clique " .
The individual words might not tell you much , but according to Professor Paik , it is worth trying to follow the trend , the rising and falling tone of North Korean rhetoric .
" There are ups and downs , " he says .
" At times when the relationship with the outside world is more peaceful , they use softer language .
But when relations get worse , that 's when it gets much tougher . "
North Korean propaganda , the theory goes , can be used like a barometer , giving clues about the current thinking of the leadership in Pyongyang .
President George W Bush was " a gangster " and " a nuclear maniac " , but despite the abuse heaped on current US policy , no personal insult has yet been levelled at President Barack Obama .
If and when it comes , it might tell us something about North Korea 's assessment of the prospects for dialogue and engagement with his administration .
' Piles of manure '
At times of extreme hostility the language turns flamboyant , even poetic .
America sank so low in 2003 , according to state radio , that even the " piles of manure in the fields " were " fuming out the smoke of hatred . "
It is strong stuff , no doubt , but sometimes the outside world can be tempted to analyse too deeply .
' Great Leader ' became a bit repetitious , says Michael Harrold Michael Harrold has written a book about his seven years in Pyongyang , entitled Comrades and Strangers : Behind the Closed Doors of North Korea .
" One very senior translator once asked me whether using the title Great Leader every time we referred to Kim Il - sung was perhaps too repetitive and limited its impact , and I agreed , " he tells me .
So , for a time , the term was occasionally dropped from North Korea 's English language news reports , much to the excitement of foreign journalists .
Speculation began to run rife , Mr Harrold recalls , that the leader was losing his grip on power .
" I think they were somewhat disappointed when I told them it was simply a translation issue , " he says .
Brigandish ?
The anecdote helps explain why North Korea 's statements sometimes read so strangely .
Mr Harrold was employed as a proof - reader , but the English translation itself is always done in - house by North Korean nationals .
Joo Sung - ha says North Koreans use angry rhetoric on a daily basis
And it is the English language news reports from the country 's state - run news agency that make up the bulk of what appears in the foreign press .
Joo Sung - ha , the defector turned South Korean journalist , says there is an easy explanation for North Korea 's use of seemingly antiquated words like " brigandish " to refer to its opponents .
" They 're using old dictionaries , " he says .
" Many were published in the 1960s with meanings that have now fallen out of use , and there are very few first - language English speakers available to make the necessary corrections . "
So , while North Korea 's rhetoric is certainly worthy of analysis , perhaps we should n't be too alarmed by every outburst .
To be fair , even its most inflammatory statements are not always what they seem .
That " fire shower " of nuclear attack made a great headline for journalists , but many gave less emphasis to an important proviso : as so often with North Korea , the warning was conditional , to be acted upon only if someone else started the fight .

Ancient History Sourcebook :
Suetonius : De Vita Caesarum -- Nero , c. 110 C.E. Translated by J. C. Rolfe . [ Arkenberg Introduction ] .
Rolfe 's annotations appear in brackets with no attribution ; mine are noted .
I have also replaced modern place names , as used by Rolfe , with those in use by the Romans and Hellenes ; thus , for example , Rolfe 's " Italy " is now " Italia " .
I. OF the Domitian family two branches have acquired distinction , the Calvini and the Ahenobarbi .
The latter have as the founder of their race and the origin of their surname Lucius Domitius , to whom , as he was returning from the country , there once appeared twin youths of more than mortal majesty , so it is said , and bade him carry to the Senate and People the news of a victory which was as yet unknown .
And as a token of their divinity it is said that they stroked his cheeks and turned his black beard to a ruddy hue , like that of bronze .
This sign was perpetuated in his descendants , a great part of whom had red beards .
After they had attained seven consulships [ 261 , 122 , 96 , 94 , 54 , & 32 B.C.E. ; 32 C.E. ] , a triumph , and two censorships , and were enrolled among the patricians , they all continued to use the same surname .
They confined their forenames to Gnaeus and Lucius , and used even these with a noteworthy variation , now conferring each one on three members of the family in succession , and now giving them to individual members in turn .
Thus the first , second , and third of the Ahenobarbi , we are told , were called Lucius , the next three in order Gnaeus , while all those that followed were called in turn first Lucius and then Gnaeus .
It seems to me worth while to give an account of several members of this family , to show more clearly that though Nero degenerated from the good qualities of his ancestors , he yet reproduced the vices of each of them , as if transmitted to him by natural inheritance .
II .
To begin then somewhat far back , his great - grandfather 's grandfather , Gnaeus Domitius , when tribune of the commons , was enraged at the pontiffs for choosing another than himself in his father 's place among them , and transferred the right of filling vacancies in the priesthoods from the colleges themselves to the Senate .
Then , having vanquished the Allobroges and the Arverni in his consulship [ 122 B.C.E. ] , he rode through the province on an elephant , attended by a throng of soldiers , in a kind of triumphal procession .
He it was of whom the orator Licinius Crassus said that it was not surprising that he had a brazen beard , since he had a face of iron and a heart of lead .
His son , who was praetor at the time , summoned Gaius Caesar to an investigation before the Senate at the close of his consulship , because it was thought that his administration had been in violation of the auspices and the laws .
Afterwards , in his own consulship [ 64 B.C.E. ] , he tried to deprive Caesar of the command of the armies in Gallia , and being named Caesar 's successor by his party , was taken prisoner at Corfinium at the beginning of the civil war .
Granted his freedom , he at first gave courage by his presence to the people of Massilia , who were hard pressed by their besiegers , but suddenly abandoned them and at last fell in the battle at Pharsalos .
He was a man of no great resolution , though he had a violent temper , and when he once attempted to kill himself in a fit of despair and terror , he so shrank from the thought of death that he changed his mind and vomited up the poison , conferring freedom on his physician , since , knowing his master , he had purposely given him what was not a fatal dose .
When Gnaeus Pompeius brought forward the question of the treatment of those who were neutral and sided with neither party , he alone was for regarding them as hostile .
III .
He left a son , who was beyond all question better than the rest of the family .
He was condemned to death by the Pedian law among those implicated in Caesar 's death , though he was guiltless , and accordingly joined Brutus and Cassius , who were his near relatives .
After the death of both leaders he retained the fleet of which he had previously been made commander , and even added to it , and it was not until his party had been everywhere routed that he surrendered it to Marcus Antonius , of his own free will and as if it were a great favor .
He , too , was the only one of those who were condemned by that same law who was allowed to return to his native land , where he successively held all the highest offices .
When the civil strife was subsequently renewed , and he was appointed one of Antony 's lieutenants , he did not venture , owing to a sudden attack of illness , to accept the chief command when it was offered him by those who were ashamed of Cleopatra , nor yet positively to decline it ; but he went over to Augustus and a few days later died .
Even he did not escape with an unblemished reputation , for Antonius openly declared that he had changed sides from desire for the company of his mistress , Servilia Nais .
IV .
He was the father of the Domitius who was later well known from being named in Augustus ' will as the purchaser of his goods and chattels , a man no less famous in his youth for his skill in driving than he was later the winning the insignia of a triumph in the war in Germania .
But he was haughty , extravagant , and cruel , and when he was only an aedile , forced the censor Lucius Plancus to make way for him on the street .
While holding the offices of praetor and consul , he brought Roman equites and matrons on the stage to act a farce .
He gave beast - baitings both in the Circus and in all the regions of the city ; also a gladiatorial show , but with such inhuman cruelty that Augustus , after his private warning was disregarded , was forced to restrain him by an edict .
V . He had by the elder Antonia a son , Domitius , who became the father of Nero , a man hateful in every walk of life ; for when he had gone to the East on the staff of the young Gaius Caesar [ Caligula ] , he slew one of his own freedmen for refusing to drink as much as he was ordered , and when he was in consequence dismissed from the number of Gaius ' friends , he lived not a whit less lawlessly .
On the contrary , in a village on the Appian Way , suddenly whipping up his team , he purposely ran over and killed a boy , and right in the Roman Forum he gouged out the eye of a Roman eques for being too outspoken in chiding him .
He was , moreover , so dishonest that he not only cheated some bankers of the prices of wares which he had bought , but in his praetorship he even defrauded the victors in the chariot races of the amount of their prizes .
When for this reason he was held up to scorn by the jests of his own sister , and the managers of the troupes made complaint , he issued an edict that the prizes should thereafter be paid on the spot .
Just before the death of Tiberius he was also charged with treason , as well as with acts of adultery and with incest with his sister Lepida , but escaped owing to the change of emperors , and died of dropsy at Pyrgi , after acknowledging Nero son of Agrippina , the daughter of Germanicus .
VI .
Nero was born at Antium nine months after the death of Tiberius , on the eighteenth day before the Kalends of January [ December 15 , 37 C.E. ] , just as the sun rose , so that he was touched by its rays almost before he could be laid upon the grounds .
Many people at once made many direful predictions from his horoscope , and a remark of his father Domitius was also regarded as an omen ; for while receiving the congratulations of his friends , he said that " nothing that was not abominable and a public bane could be born of Agrippina and himself . "
Another manifest indication of Nero 's future unhappiness occurred on the day of his purification ; for when Gaius Caesar was asked by his sister to give the child whatever name he liked , he looked at his uncle Claudius , who later became emperor and adopted Nero , and said that he gave him his name .
This he did , not seriously , but in jest , and Agrippina scorned the proposal , because at that time Claudius was one of the laughing - stocks of the court .
At the age of three he lost his father , being left heir to a third of his estate ; but even this he did not receive in full , since his fellow heir Gaius seized all the property .
Then his mother was banished too , and he was brought up at the house of his aunt Lepida almost in actual want , under two tutors , a dancer and a barber .
But when Claudius became emperor , Nero not only recovered his father 's property , but was also enriched by an inheritance from his stepfather , Passienus Crispus .
When his mother was recalled from banishment and reinstated , he became so prominent through her influence that it leaked out that Messalina , wife of Claudius , had sent emissaries to strangle him as he was taking his noonday nap , regarding him as a rival of Britannicus .
An addition to this bit of gossip is , that the would - be assassins were frightened away by a snake which darted out from under his pillow .
The only foundation for this tale was , that there was found in his bed near the pillow the slough of a serpent ; but nevertheless at his mother 's desire he had the skin enclosed in a golden bracelet , and wore it for a long time on his left arm .
But when at last the memory of his mother grew hateful to him , he threw it away , and afterwards in the time of his extremity sought it again in vain .
VII .
While he was still a young , half - grown boy , he took part in the game of Troy at a performance in the Circus with great self - possession and success .
In the eleventh year of his age [ 50 C.E. ] he was adopted by Claudius and consigned to the training of Annaeus Seneca , who was then already a senator .
They say that on the following night Seneca dreamt that he was teaching Gaius Caesar , and Nero soon proved the dream prophetic by revealing the cruelty of his disposition at the earliest possible opportunity .
For merely because his brother Britannicus had , after his adoption , greeted him as usual as Ahenobarbus , he tried to convince his father [ Claudius ] that Britannicus was a changeling .
Also , when his aunt Lepida was accused , he publicly gave testimony against her to gratify his mother , who was using every effort to ruin Lepida .
At his formal introduction into public life he announced a largess to the people and a gift of money to the soldiers , ordered a drill of the praetorians and headed them shield in hand ; and thereafter returned thanks to his father in the Senate .
In the latter 's consulship he pleaded the cause of the people of Bononia before him in Latin , and of those of Rhodes and Ilium in Greek .
His first appearance as judge was when he was prefect of the city during the Latin festival , when the most celebrated pleaders vied with one another in bringing before him , not trifling and brief cases according to the usual custom , but many of the highest importance , though this had been forbidden by Claudius .
Shortly afterwards he took Octavia to wife and gave games and a beast - baiting in the Circus , that health might be vouchsafed Claudius .
VIII .
When the death of Claudius [ 54 C.E. ] was made public , Nero , who was seventeen years old , went forth to the watch between the sixth and seventh hour , since no earlier time for the formal beginning of his reign seemed suitable because of bad omens throughout the day .
Hailed emperor on the steps of the Palace , he was carried in a litter to the Praetorian camp , and after a brief address to the soldiers was taken from there to the Curia , which he did not leave until evening , of the unbounded honors that were heaped upon him refusing but one , the title of father of his country , and that because of his youth .
IX .
Then , beginning with a display of filial piety , he gave Claudius a magnificent funeral , spoke his eulogy , and deified him .
He paid the highest honors to the memory of his father Domitius .
He left to his mother the management of all public and private business .
Indeed , on the first day of his rule he gave to the tribune on guard the watchword " The Best of Mothers , " and afterwards he often rode with her through the streets in her litter .
He established a colony at Antium , enrolling the veterans of the Praetorian Guard , and joining with them the wealthiest of the chief centurions , whom he compelled to change their residence ; and he also made a harbor there at great expense .
X . To make his good intentions still more evident , he declared that he would rule according to the principles of Augustus , and he let slip no opportunity for acts of generosity and mercy , or even for displaying his affability ..
The more oppressive sources of revenue he either abolished or moderated .
He reduced the rewards paid to informers against violators of the Papian law to one fourth of the former amount .
He distributed four hundred sesterces to each man of the people , and granted to the most distinguished of the senators who were without means an annual salary , to some as much as five hundred thousand sesterces ; and to the praetorian cohorts he gave a monthly allowance of grain free of cost .
When he was asked according to custom to sign the warrant for the execution of a man who had been condemned to death , he said : " How I wish I had never learned to write ! "
He greeted men of all orders offhand and from memory .
When the Senate returned thanks to him , he replied , " When I shall have deserved them . "
He admitted even the commons to witness his exercises in the Campus , and often declaimed in public .
He read his poems too , not only at home but in the theater as well , so greatly to the delight of all that a thanksgiving was voted because of his recital , while that part of his poems was inscribed in letters of gold and dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinus .
XI .
He gave many entertainments of different kinds : the Juvenales , chariot races in the Circus , stage - plays , and a gladiatorial show .
At the first - mentioned , he had even old men of consular rank and aged matrons take part .
For the games in the Circus he assigned places to the equites apart from the rest , and even matched chariots drawn by four camels .
At the plays which he gave for the " Eternity of the Empire , " which by his order were called the Ludi Maximi , parts were taken by several men and women of both the orders ; a well known Roman eques mounted an elephant and rode down a rope ; a Roman play of Afranius , too , was staged , entitled " The Fire , " and the actors were allowed to carry off the furniture of the burning Curia and keep it .
Every day all kinds of presents were thrown to the people ; these included a thousand birds of every kind each day , various kinds of food , tickets for grain , clothing , gold , silver , precious stones , pearls , paintings , slaves , beasts of burden , and even trained wild animals ; finally , ships , blocks of houses , and farms .
XII .
These plays he viewed from the top of the proscenium .
At the gladiatorial show , which he gave in a wooden amphitheatre , erected in the district of the Campus Martius within the space of a single year [ 58 C.E. ] , he had no one put to death , not even criminals .
But he compelled four hundred senators and six hundred Roman equites , some of whom were well - to - do and of unblemished reputation , to fight in the arena .
Even those who fought with the wild beasts and performed the various services in the arena were of the same orders .
He also exhibited a naval battle in salt water with sea monsters swimming about in it ; besides pyrrhic dances by some Greek youths , handing each of them certificates of Roman citizenship at the close of his performance .
The pyrrhic dances represented various scenes .
In one , a bull mounted Pasiphae , who was concealed in a wooden image of a heifer ; at least many of the spectators thought so .
Icarus at his very first attempt fell close by the imperial couch and bespattered the emperor with his blood ; for Nero very seldom presided at the games , but used to view them while reclining on a couch , at first through small openings , and then with the entire balcony uncovered .
He was likewise the first to establish at Rome a quinquennial contest in three parts , after the Greek fashion , that is in music , gymnastics , and riding , which he called the " Veronia " ; at the same time he dedicated his baths and gymnasiums supplying every member of the senatorial and equestrian orders with oil .
To preside over the whole contest he appointed ex-consuls , chosen by lot , who occupied the seats of the praetors .
Then he went down into the orchestra among the senators and accepted the prize for Latin oratory and verse , for which all the most eminent men had contended , but which was given to him with their unanimous consent ; but when that for lyre - playing was also offered him by the judges , he knelt before it and ordered that it be laid at the feet of Augustus ' statue .
At the gymnastic contest , which he gave in the Saepta , he shaved his first beard to the accompaniment of a splendid sacrifice of bullocks , put it in a golden box adorned with pearls of great price , and dedicated it in the Capitol .
He invited the Vestal Virgins also to witness the contests of the athletes , because at Olympia the priestesses of Ceres were allowed the same privilege .
XIII .
I may fairly include among his shows the entrance of Tiridates into the city .
He was a king of Armenia , whom Nero induced by great promises to come to Rome ; and since he was prevented by bad weather from exhibiting him to the people on the day appointed by proclamation , he produced him at the first favorable opportunity , with the Praetorian cohorts drawn up in full armor about the temples in the Forum , while he himself sat in a curule chair on the rostra in the attire of a triumphing general , surrounded by military ensigns and standards .
As the king approached along a sloping platform , the emperor at first let him fall at his feet , but raised him with his right hand and kissed him .
Then , while the king made supplication , Nero took the turban from his head and replaced it with a diadem , while a man of praetorian rank translated the words of the suppliant and proclaimed them to the throng .
From there the king was taken to the theater [ Of Pompeius Magnus ] , and when he had again done obeisance , Nero gave hint a seat at his right hand .
Because of all this Nero was hailed as Imperator , and after depositing a laurel wreath in the Capitol [ This was usual only when a triumph was celebrated ] , he closed the two doors of the temple of Janus , as a sign that no war was left anywhere .
XIV .
He held four consulships , the first for two months , the second and the last for six months each , the third for four months [ 55 , 57 - 58 , 60 C.E. ] .
The second and third were in successive years , while a year intervened between these and each of the others [ He assumed a fifth consulship in 68 ] .
XV .
In the administration of justice he was reluctant to render a decision to those who presented cases , except on the following day and in writing .
The procedure was , instead of continuous pleadings , to have each point presented separately by the parties in turn .
Furthermore , whenever he withdrew for consultation , he did not discuss any matter with all his advisers in a body , but had each of them give his opinion in written form ; these he read silently and in private and then gave a verdict according to his own inclination , as if it were the view of the majority .
For a long time he would not admit the sons of freedmen to the Senate and he refused office to those who had been admitted by his predecessors .
Candidates who were in excess of the number of vacancies received the command of a legion as compensation for the postponement and delay .
He commonly appointed consuls for a period of six months .
When one of them died just before the Kalends of January , he appointed no one in his place , expressing his disapproval of the old - time case of Caninius Rebilus , the twenty - four hour consul [ See Jul. lxxvi .2 , where , however , the man 's name is not mentioned ] .
He conferred the triumphal regalia even on men of the rank of quaestor , as well as on some of the equites , and sometimes for other than military services .
As regards the speeches which he sent to the Senate on various matters , he passed over the quaestors , whose duty it was to read them [ See Aug. lxv.2 ] , and usually had them presented by one of the consuls .
XVI .
He devised a new form for the buildings of the city and in front of the houses and apartments be erected porches , from the flat roofs of which fires could be fought [ This was undoubtedly after the great fire ] ; and these he put up at his own cost .
He had also planned to extend the walls as far as Ostia and to bring the sea from there to Rome by a canal .
During his reign many abuses were severely punished and put down , and no fewer new laws were made : a limit was set to expenditures ; the public banquets were confined to a distribution of food , the sale of any kind of cooked viands in the taverns was forbidden , with the exception of pulse and vegetables , whereas before every sort of dainty was exposed for sale .
Punishment was inflicted on the Christians , a class of men given to a new and mischievous superstition .
He put an end to the diversions of the chariot drivers , who from immunity of long standing claimed the right of ranging at large and amusing themselves by cheating and robbing the people .
The pantomimic actors and their partisans were banished from the city [ Because of their disorderly conduct ] .
XVII .
It was in his reign that a protection against forgers was first devised , by having no tablets signed that were not bored with holes through which a cord was thrice passed [ The tablets consisted of three leaves , two of which were bound together and sealed .
The contract was written twice , on the open leaf and on the closed ones .
In cases of dispute the seals were broken in the presence of the signers and the two versions compared ] .
In the case of wills it was provided that the first two leaves should be presented to the signatories [ As witnesses .
The testator afterwards wrote the names of the heirs on these leaves ] with only the name of the testator written upon them , and that no one who wrote a will for another should put down a legacy for himself ; further , that clients should pay a fixed and reasonable fee for the services of their advocates [ The Cincian law of 204 B.C.E. forbade fees .
Augustus renewed the law in 17 B.C.E. ( Dio 54.18 ) .
Claudius limited fees to 10,000 sesterces ( Tac. Ann. 11.5 - 6 ) .
The Senate again abolished fees at the beginning of Nero 's reign ( Tac. Ann. 13.5 ) , but Nero apparently revived the law of Claudius , with a provision against the addition of " costs . " ] , but nothing at all for benches , as which were to be furnished free of charge by the public treasury ; finally , as regarded the pleading of cases , that those connected with the treasury should be transferred to the Forum [ Instead of coming before the prefects of the treasury ; cf. , Claud. ix.2 ] , and a board of arbiters , and that any appeal from the juries should be made to the Senate .
XVIII .
So far from being actuated by any wish or hope of increasing or extending the empire , he even thought of withdrawing the army from Britain and changed his purpose only because he was ashamed to seem to belittle the glory of his father [ That is , his adoptive father Claudius ] .
He increased the provinces only by the realm of Pontus , when it was given up by Polemon , and that of Cottius in the Alps on the latter 's death .
XIX .
He planned but two foreign tours , to Alexandria and Achaia ; and he gave up the former on the very day when he was to have started , disturbed by a threatening portent .
For as he was making the round of the temples and had sat down in the shrine of Vesta , first the fringe of his garment caught when he attempted to get up , and then such darkness overspread his eyes that he could see nothing .
In Achaia he attempted to cut through the Isthmus [ Of Corinth ] , and called together the Praetorians and urged them to begin the work ; then at a signal given on a trumpet he was first to break ground with a mattock and to carry of a basketful of earth upon his shoulders .
He also prepared for an expedition to the Caspian Gates , after enrolling a new legion of raw recruits of Italian births each six feet tall [ Roman measure , a little over 5 ft. 8 in .
English ] , which he called the " phalanx of Alexander the Great . "
I have brought together these acts of his , some of which are beyond criticism , while others are even deserving of no slight praise , to separate them from his shameful and criminal deeds , of which I shall proceed now to give an account .
XX .
Having gained some knowledge of music in addition to the rest of his early education , as soon as he became emperor he sent for Terpnus , the greatest master of the lyre in those days , and after listening to him sing after dinner for many successive days until late at night , he little by little began to practice himself , neglecting none of the exercises which artists of that kind are in the habit of following , to preserve or strengthen their voices .
For he used to lie upon his back and hold a leaden plate on his chest , purge himself by the syringe and by vomiting , and deny himself fruits and all foods injurious to the voice .
Finally , encouraged by his progress , although his voice was weak and husky , he began to long to appear on the stage , and every now and then in the presence of his intimate friends he would quote a Greek proverb meaning " Hidden music counts for nothing " [ Cf. , Gell. 13.31.3 ] .
And he made his debut at Neapolis [ Arkenberg : modern Naples ] , where he did not cease singing until he had finished the number which he had begun , even though the theater was shaken by a sudden earthquake shock [ It collapsed in consequence , but not until the audience had dispersed ; see Tac. Ann. 15.34 ] .
In the same city he sang frequently and for several successive days .
Even when he took a short time to rest his voice , he could not keep out of sight , but went to the theater after bathing , and dined in the orchestra with the people all about him , promising them in Greek that when he had wet his whistle a bit , he would ring out something good and loud .
He was greatly taken , too , with the rhythmic applause of some Alexandrians , who had flocked to Neapolis from a fleet that had lately arrived , and summoned more men from Alexandria .
Not content with that , he selected some young men of the order of equites and more than five thousand sturdy young plebeians , to be divided into groups and learn the Alexandrian styles of applause ( they called them " the bees , " " the roof - tiles , " and " the bricks " )
[ The first seems to have derived its name from the sound , which was like the humming of bees , the second and third from clapping hands rounded or hollowed , like roof - tiles , or flat , like bricks or flat tiles ] , and to ply them vigorously whenever he sang .
These men were noticeable for their thick hair and fine apparel ; their left hands were bare and without rings , and the leaders were paid four hundred thousand sesterces each .
XXI .
Considering it of great importance to appear in Rome as well , he repeated the contest of the Neronia before the appointed time , and when there was a general call for his " divine voice , " he replied that if any wished to hear him , he would favor them in the gardens ; but when the guard of soldiers which was then on duty seconded the entreaties of the people , he gladly agreed to appear at once .
So without delay he had his name added to the list of the lyre - players who entered the contest , and casting his own lot into the urn with the rest , he came forward in his turn , attended by the Prefects of the Guard carrying his lyre , and followed by the tribunes of the soldiers and his intimate friends .
Having taken his place and finished his preliminary speech [ probably asking for the favorable attention of the audience ; cf. , Dio , 61.20 ] , he announced through the ex-consul Cluvius Rufus that " he would sing Niobe " ; and he kept at it until late in the afternoon , putting off the award of the prize for that event and postponing the rest of the contest to the next year , to have an excuse for singing oftener .
But since even that seemed too long to wait , he did not cease to appear in public from time to time .
He even thought of taking part in private performances among the professional actors , when one of the praetors offered him a million sesterces .
He also put on the mask and sang tragedies representing gods and heroes and even heroines and goddesses , having the masks fashioned in the likeness of his own features or those of the women of whom he chanced to be enamored .
Among other themes he sang " Canace in Labor , " " Orestes the Matricide , " " The Blinding of Oedipus " and the " Frenzy of Hercules . "
At the last named performance they say that a young recruit , seeing the emperor in mean attire and bound with chains , as the subject required , rushed forward to lend him aid .
XXII .
From his earliest years , he had a special passion for horses and talked constantly about the games in the Circus , though he was forbidden to do so [ By his guardians and teachers ] .
Once , when he was lamenting with his fellow pupils the fate of a charioteer of the " Greens , " who was dragged by his horses , and his preceptor scolded him , he told a lie and pretended that he was talking of Hector .
At the beginning of his reign he used to play every day with ivory chariots on a board , and he came from the country to all the games , even the most insignificant , at first secretly , and then so openly that no one doubted that he would be in Rome on that particular day .
He made no secret of his wish to have the number of prizes increased , and in consequence more races were added and the performance was continued to a late hour , while the managers of the troupes no longer thought it worthwhile to produce their drivers at all except for a full day 's racing .
He soon longed to drive a chariot himself and even to show himself frequently in public ; so after a trial exhibition in his gardens before his slaves and the dregs of the populace , he gave all an opportunity of seeing him in the Circus Maximus , one of his freedmen dropping the napkin [ the signal for the start ] from the place usually occupied by the magistrates .
Not content with showing his proficiency in these arts at Rome , he went to Achaia , as I have said , influenced especially by the following consideration .
The cities in which it was the custom to hold contests in music had adopted the rule of sending all the lyric prizes to him .
These he received with the greatest delight , not only giving audience before all others to the envoys who brought them , but even inviting them to his private table .
When some of them begged him to sing after dinner and greeted his performance with extravagant applause , he declared that " the Greeks were the only ones who had an ear for music and that they alone were worthy of his efforts . "
So he took ship without delay and immediately on arriving at Cassiope made a preliminary appearance as a singer at the altar of Jupiter Cassius , and then went the round of all the contests .
XXIII .
To make this possible , he gave orders that even those which were widely separated in time should be brought together in a single year , so that some had even to he given twice , and he introduced a musical competition at Olympia also , contrary to custom .
To avoid being distracted or hindered in any way while busy with these contests , he replied to his freedman Helius , who reminded him that the affairs of the city required his presence , in these words : " However much it may be your advice and your wish that I should return speedily , yet you ought rather to counsel me and to hope that I may return worthy of Nero . "
While he was singing no one was allowed to leave the theater even for the most urgent reasons .
And so it is said that some women gave birth to children there , while many who were worn out with listening and applauding , secretly leaped from the wall , since the gates at the entrance were closed , or feigned death and were carried out as if for burial .
The trepidation and anxiety with which he took part in the contests , his keen rivalry of his opponents and his awe of the judges , can hardly be credited .
As if his rivals were of quite the same station as himself , he used to show respect to them and try to gain their favor , while he slandered them behind their backs , sometimes assailed them with abuse when he met them , and even bribed those who were especially proficient .
Before beginning , he would address the judges in the most deferential terms , saying that he had done all that could be done , but the issue was in the hand of Fortuna ; they however , being men of wisdom and experience , ought to exclude what was fortuitous .
When they bade him take heart , he withdrew with greater confidence , but not even then without anxiety , interpreting the silence and modesty of some as sullenness and ill - nature , and declaring that he had his suspicions of them .

In competition he observed the rules most scrupulously , never daring to clear his throat and even wiping the sweat from his brow with his arm [ the use of a handkerchief was not allowed ; see also Tac. Ann. 16.4 ] .
Once , indeed , during the performance of a tragedy , when he had dropped his scepter but quickly recovered it , he was terribly afraid that he might be excluded from the competition because of his slip , and his confidence was restored only when his accompanist [ the " hypocrites " made the gestures and accompanied the tragic actor on the flute , as he spoke his lines ] swore that it had passed unnoticed amid the delight and applause of the people .
When the victory was won , he made the announcement himself ; and for that reason he always took part in the contests of the heralds .
To obliterate the memory of all other victors in the games and leave no trace of them , their statues and busts were all thrown down by his order , dragged off with hooks , and cast into privies .
He also drove a chariot in many places , at Olympia even a ten - horse team , although in one of his own poems he had criticized Mithridates for just that thing .
But after he had been thrown from the car and put back in it , he was unable to hold out and gave up before the end of the course ; but he received the crown just the same .
On his departure he presented the entire province with freedom [ That is , with local self - government , not with actual independence ] , and at the same time gave the judges Roman citizenship and a large sum of money .
These favors he announced in person on the day of the Isthmian Games , standing in the middle of the stadium .
XXV .
Returning from Greece , since it was at Neapolis that he had made his first appearance , he entered that city with white horses through a part of the wall which had been thrown down , as is customary with victors in the sacred games .
In like manner he entered Antium , then Albanum , and finally Rome ; but at Rome he rode in the chariot which Augustus had used in his triumphs in days gone by , and wore a purple robe and a Greek cloak adorned with stars of gold , bearing on his head the Olympic crown and in his right hand the Pythian , while the rest were carried before him with inscriptions telling where he had won them and against what competitors , and giving the titles of the songs or the subject of the plays .
His car was followed by his clique as by the escort of a triumphal procession , who shouted that they were the attendants of Augustus and the soldiers of his triumph .
Then through the arch of the Circus Maximus , which was thrown down , he made his way across the Velabrum and the Forum to the Palatine and the temple of Apollo .
All along the route victims were slain , the streets were sprinkled from time to time with perfume , while birds , ribbons , and sweetmeats were showered upon him .
He placed the sacred crowns in his bed chamber around his couches , as well as statues representing him in the guise of a lyre - player ; and he had a coin , too , struck with the same device .
So far from neglecting or relaxing his practice of the art after this , he never addressed the soldiers except by letter or in a speech delivered by another , to save his voice ; and he never did anything for amusement or in earnest without an elocutionist by his side , to warn him to spare his vocal organs and hold a handkerchief to his mouth .
To many men he offered his friendship or announced his hostility , according as they had applauded him lavishly or grudgingly .
XXVI .
Although at first his acts of wantonness , lust , extravagance , avarice and cruelty were gradual and secret , and might be condoned as follies of youth , yet even then their nature was such that no one doubted that they were defects of his character and not due to his time of life .
No sooner was twilight over than he would catch up a cap or a wig and go to the taverns or range about the streets playing pranks , which however were very far from harmless ; for he used to beat men as they came home from dinner , stabbing any who resisted him and throwing them into the sewers .
He would even break into shops and rob them , setting up a market in the Palace , where he divided the booty which he took , sold it at auction , and then squandered the proceeds .
In the strife which resulted he often ran the risk of losing his eyes or even his life , for he was beaten almost to death by a man of the senatorial order whose wife he had maltreated .
Warned by this , he never afterwards ventured to appear in public at that hour without having tribunes follow him at a distance and unobserved .
Even in the daytime he would be carried privately to the theater in a litter , and from the upper part of the proscenium would watch the brawls of the pantomimic actors and egg them on ; and when they came to blows and fought with stones and broken benches , he himself threw many missiles at the people and even broke a praetor 's head .
XXVII .
Little by little , however , as his vices grew stronger , he dropped jesting and secrecy and with no attempt at disguise openly broke out into worse crime .
He prolonged his revels from midday to midnight , often livening himself by a warm plunge , or , if it were summer , into water cooled with snow .
Sometimes , too , he closed the inlets and banqueted in public in the great tank in the Campus Martius , or in the Circus Maximus , waited on by harlots and dancing girls from all over the city .
Whenever he drifted down the Tiber to Ostia , or sailed about the Gulf of Baiae , booths were set up at intervals along the banks and shores , fitted out for debauchery , while bartering matrons played the part of inn- keepers and from every hand solicited him to come ashore .
He also levied dinners on his friends , one of whom spent four million sesterces for a banquet at which turbans were distributed , and another a considerably larger sum for a rose dinner .
XXVIII .
Besides abusing freeborn boys and seducing married women , he debauched the vestal virgin Rubria .
The freedwoman
Acte he all but made his lawful wife , after bribing some ex-consuls to perjure themselves by swearing that she was of royal birth .
He castrated the boy Sporus and actually tried to make a woman of him ; and he married him with all the usual ceremonies , including a dowry and a bridal veil , took him to his home attended by a great throng , and treated him as his wife .
And the witty jest that someone made is still current , that it would have been well for the world if Nero 's father Domitius had had that kind of wife .
This Sporus , decked out with the finery of the empresses and riding in a litter , he took with him to the courts and marts of Greece , and later at Rome through the Street of the Images , fondly kissing him from time to time .
That he even desired illicit relations with his own mother , and was kept from it by her enemies , who feared that such a relationship might give the reckless and insolent woman too great influence , was notorious , especially after he added to his concubines a courtesan who was said to look very like Agrippina .
Even before that , so they say , whenever he rode in a litter with his mother , he had incestuous relations with her , which were betrayed by the stains on his clothing .
XXIX .
He so prostituted his own chastity that after defiling almost every part of his body , he at last devised a kind of game , in which , covered with the skin of some wild animal , he was let loose from a cage and attacked the private parts of men and women , who were bound to stakes , and when he had sated his mad lust , was dispatched by his freedman Doryphorus ; for he was even married to this man in the same way that he himself had married Sporus , going so far as to imitate the cries and lamentations of a maiden being deflowered .
I have heard from some men that it was his unshaken conviction that no man was chaste or pure in any part of his body , but that most of them concealed their vices and cleverly drew a veil over them ; and that therefore he pardoned all other faults in those who confessed to him their lewdness .
XXX .
He thought that there was no other way of enjoying riches and money than by riotous extravagance , declaring that only stingy and niggardly fellows kept a correct account of what they spent , while fine and genuinely magnificent gentlemen wasted and squandered .
Nothing in his uncle Gaius [ Caligula ] so excited his envy and admiration as the fact that he had in so short a time run through the vast wealth which Tiberius had left him .
Accordingly , he made presents and wasted money without stint .
On Tiridates , though it would seem hardly within belief , he spent eight hundred thousand sesterces a day , and on his departure presented him with more than a hundred millions .
He gave the lyre - player Menecrates and the gladiator Spiculus properties and residences equal to those of men who had celebrated triumphs .
He enriched the monkey - faced usurer Panerotes with estates in the country and in the city and had him buried with almost regal splendor .
He never wore the same garment twice .
He played at dice for four hundred thousand sesterces a point .
He fished with a golden net drawn by cords woven of purple and scarlet threads .
It is said that he never made a journey with less than a thousand carriages , his mules shod with silver and their drivers clad in wool of Canusium , attended by a train of Mazaces [ noted horsemen of Mauretania ] , and couriers with bracelets and trappings .
XXXI .
There was nothing , however , in which he was more ruinously prodigal than in building .
He made a palace extending all the way from the Palatine to the Esquiline , which at first he called the House of Passage , but when it was burned shortly after its completion and rebuilt , the Golden House .
Its size and splendor will be sufficiently indicated by the following details .
Its vestibule was large enough to contain a colossal statue of the emperor a hundred and twenty feet high ; and it was so extensive that it had a triple colonnade a mile long .
There was a pond too , like a sea , surrounded with buildings to represent cities , besides tracts of country , varied by tilled fields , vineyards , pastures and woods , with great numbers of wild and domestic animals .
In the rest of the house all parts were overlaid with gold and adorned with gems and mother - of - pearl .
There were dining - rooms with fretted ceilings of ivory , whose panels could turn and shower down flowers and were fitted with pipes for sprinkling the guests with perfumes .
The main banquet hall was circular and constantly revolved day and night , like the heavens .
He had baths supplied with sea water and sulphur water .
When the edifice was finished in this style and he dedicated it , he deigned to say nothing more in the way of approval than that he was at last beginning to be housed like a human being .
He also began a pool , extending from Misenum to the Lake of Avernus , roofed over and enclosed in colonnades , into which he planned to turn all the hot springs in every part of Baiae ; a canal from Avernus all the way to Ostia , to enable the journey to be made by ship yet not by sea ; its length was to be a hundred and sixty miles and its breadth sufficient to allow ships with five banks of oars to pass each other .
For the execution of these projects he had given orders that the prisoners all over the empire should be transported to Italy , and that those who were convicted even of capital crimes should be punished in no other way than by sentence to this work .
He was led to such mad extravagance , in addition to his confidence in the resources of the empire , by the hope of a vast hidden treasure , suddenly inspired by the assurance of a Roman eques , who declared positively that the enormous wealth which Queen Dido had taken with her of old in her flight from Tyre was hidden away in huge caves in Africa and could be recovered with but trifling labor .
XXXII .
When this hope proved false , he resorted to false accusations and robbery , being at the end of his resources and so utterly impoverished that he was obliged to postpone and defer even the pay of the soldiers and the rewards due to the veterans .
First of all he made a law , that instead of one - half , five - sixths of the property of deceased freedmen should be made over to him , if without good and sufficient reason they bore the name of any family with which he himself was connected ; further , that the estates of those who were ungrateful to their emperor should belong to the privy purse , and that the advocates who had written or dictated such wills should not go unpunished .
Finally , that any word or deed on which an informer could base an action should be liable to the law against lese - majesty .
He demanded the return of the rewards which he had given in recognition of the prizes conferred on him by any city in any competition .
Having forbidden the use of amethystine or Tyrian purple dyes , he secretly sent a man to sell a few ounces on a market day and then closed the shops of all the dealers .
It is even said that when he saw a matron in the audience at one of his recitals clad in the forbidden color he pointed her out to his agents , who dragged her out and stripped her on the spot , not only of her garment , but also of her property .
He never appointed anyone to an office without saying : " You know what my needs are , " and " Let us see to it that no one possess anything . "
At last he stripped many temples of their gifts and melted down the images of gold and silver , including those of the Penates , which however Galba soon afterwards restored .
XXXIII .
He began his career of parricide and murder with Claudius , for even if he was not the instigator of the emperor 's death , he was at least privy to it , as he openly admitted ; for he used afterwards to laud mushrooms , the vehicle in which the poison was administered to Claudius , as " the food of the gods , as the Greek proverb has it . "
At any rate , after Claudius ' death he vented on him every kind of insult , in act and word , charging him now with folly and now with cruelty ; for it was a favorite joke of his to say that Claudius had ceased " to play the fool among mortals , " lengthening the first syllable of the word morari , and he disregarded many of his decrees and acts as the work of a madman and a dotard .
Finally , he neglected to enclose the place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall .
He attempted the life of Britannicus by poison , not less from jealousy of his voice ( for it was more agreeable than his own ) than from fear that he might sometime win a higher place than himself in the people 's regard because of the memory of his father .
He procured the potion from an arch - poisoner , one Locusta , and when the effect was slower than he anticipated , merely physicking Britannicus , he called the woman to him and flogged her with his own hand , charging that she had administered a medicine instead of a poison ; and when she said in excuse that she had given a smaller dose to shield him from the odium of the crime , he replied : " It 's likely that I am afraid of the Julian law ; " and he forced her to mix as swift and instant a potion as she knew how in his own room before his very eyes .
Then he tried it on a kid , and as the animal lingered for five hours , had the mixture steeped again and again and threw some of it before a pig .
The beast instantly fell dead , whereupon he ordered that the poison be taken to the dining - room and given to Britannicus .
The boy dropped dead at the very first taste , but Nero lied to his guests and declared that he was seized with the falling sickness , to which he was subject , and the next day had him hastily and unceremoniously buried in a pouring rain .
He rewarded Locusta for her eminent services with a full pardon and large estates in the country , and actually sent her pupils .
XXXIV .
His mother offended him by too strict surveillance and criticism of his words and acts , but at first he confined his resentment to frequent endeavors to bring upon her a burden of unpopularity by pretending that he would abdicate the throne and go off to Rhodes .
Then depriving her of all her honors and of her guard of Roman and German soldiers , he even forbade her to live with him and drove her from the Palace .
After that he passed all bounds in harrying her , bribing men to annoy her with lawsuits while she remained in the city , and after she had retired to the country , to pass her house by land and sea and break her rest with abuse and mockery .
At last terrified by her violence and threats , he determined to have her life , and after thrice attempting it by poison and finding that she had made herself immune by antidotes , he tampered with the ceiling of her bedroom , contriving a mechanical device for loosening its panels and dropping them upon her while she slept .
When this leaked out through some of those connected with the plot , he devised a collapsible boat to destroy her by shipwreck or by the falling in of its cabin .
Then he pretended a reconciliation and invited her in a most cordial letter to come to Baiae and celebrate the feast of Minerva with him .
On her arrival , instructing his captains to wreck the galley in which she had come , by running into it as if by accident , he detained her at a banquet , and when she would return to Bauli , offered her his contrivance in place of the craft which had been damaged , escorting her to it in high spirits and even kissing her breasts as they parted .
The rest of the night he passed sleepless in intense anxiety , awaiting the outcome of his design .
On learning that everything had gone wrong and that she had escaped by swimming , driven to desperation he secretly had a dagger thrown down beside her freedman Lucius Agelmus , when he joyfully brought word that she was safe and sound , and then ordered that the freedman be seized and bound , on the charge of being hired to kill the emperor ; that his mother be put to death , and the pretense made that she had escaped the consequences of her detected guilt by suicide .
Trustworthy authorities add still more gruesome details : that he hurried off to view the corpse , handled her limbs , criticizing some and commending others , and that becoming thirsty meanwhile , he took drink .
Yet he could not either then or ever afterwards endure the stings of conscience though soldiers , Senate and people tried to hearten him with their congratulations ; for he often owned that he was hounded by his mother 's ghost and by the whips and blazing torches of the Furies .
He even had rites performed by the Magi , in the effort to summon her shade and entreat it for forgiveness .
Moreover , in his journey through Greece he did not venture to take part in the Eleusinian mysteries , since at the beginning the godless and wicked are warned by the herald 's proclamation to go hence .
To matricide he added the murder of his aunt .
When he once visited her as she was confined to her bed from costiveness , and she , as old ladies will , stroking his downy beard ( for he was already well grown ) happened to say fondly : " As soon as I receive this [ that is , " when I see you arrived at man 's estate . "
The first shaving of the beard by a young Roman was a symbolic act , usually performed at the age of twenty - one with due ceremony .
According to Tac. Ann. 14.15 , and Dio 61.19 , Nero first shaved his beard in 59 C.E. , at the age of twenty - one and commemorated the event by establishing the Juvenalia ] , I shall gladly die , " he turned to those with him and said as if in jest : " I 'll take it off at once . "
Then he bade the doctors give the sick woman an overdose of physic and seized her property before she was cold , suppressing her will , that nothing might escape him .
XXXV .
Besides Octavia he later took two wives , Poppaea Sabina , daughter of an ex-quaestor and previously married to a Roman eques , and then Statilia Messalina , daughter of the great - grand - daughter of Taurus , who had been twice consul and awarded a triumph .
To possess the latter he slew her husband Atticus Vestinus while he held the office of consul .
He soon grew tired of living with Octavia , and when his friends took him to task , replied that " she ought to be content with the insignia of wifehood . "
Presently , after several vain attempts to strangle her , he divorced her on the ground of barrenness , and when the people took it ill and openly reproached him , he banished her besides ; and finally he had her put to death on a charge of adultery that was so shameless and unfounded , that when all who were put to the torture maintained her innocence , he bribed his former preceptor Anicetus to make a pretended confession that he had violated her chastity by a stratagem .
He dearly loved Poppaea , whom he married twelve days after his divorce from Octavia , yet he caused her death too , by kicking her when she was pregnant and ill , because she had scolded him for coming home late from the races .
By her he had a daughter , Claudia Augusta , but lost her when she was still an infant .
Indeed , there is no kind of relationship that he did not violate in his career of crime .
He put to death Antonia , daughter of Claudius , for refusing to marry him after Poppaea 's death , charging her with an attempt at revolution ; and he treated in the same way all others who were in any way connected with him by blood or by marriage .
Among these was the young Aulus Plautius , whom he forcibly defiled before his death , saying " Let my mother come now and kiss my successor , " openly charging that Agrippina had loved Plautius and that this had roused him to hopes of the throne .
Rufrius Crispinus , a mere boy , his stepson and the child of Poppaea , he ordered to be drowned by the child 's own slaves while he was fishing , because it was said that he used to play at being a general and an emperor .
He banished his nurse 's son Tuscus , because when procurator in Egypt he had bathed in some baths which were built for a visit of Nero .
He drove his tutor Seneca to suicide , although when the old man often pleaded to be allowed to retire and offered to give up his estates , he had sworn most solemnly that he did wrong to suspect him and that he would rather die than harm him .
He sent poison to Burrus , prefect of the Guard , in place of a throat medicine which he had promised him .
The old and wealthy freedmen who had helped him first to his adoption and later to the throne , and aided him by their advice , he killed by poison , administered partly in their food and partly in their drink .
XXXVI .
Those outside his family he assailed with no less cruelty .
It chanced that a comet [ Tacitus mentions two comets , one in 60 and the other in 64 ; see Ann. 14.22 , 15.47 ] had begun to appear on several successive nights , a thing which is commonly believed to portend the death of great rulers .
Worried by this , and learning from the astrologer Balbillus that kings usually averted such omens by the death of some distinguished man , thus turning them from themselves upon the heads of the nobles , he resolved on the death of all the eminent men of the State ; but the more firmly , and with some semblance of justice , after the discovery of two conspiracies .
The earlier and more dangerous of these was that of Piso at Rome ; the other was set on foot by Vinicius at Beneventum and detected there .
The conspirators made their defense in triple sets of fetters , some voluntarily admitting their guilt , some even making a favor of it , saying that there was no way except by death that they could help a man disgraced by every kind of wickedness .
The children of those who were condemned were banished or put to death by poison or starvation ; a number are known to have been slain all together at a single meal along with their preceptors and attendants , while others were prevented from earning their daily bread .
XXXVII .
After this he showed neither discrimination nor moderation in putting to death whomsoever he pleased on any pretext whatever .
To mention but a few instances , Salvidienus Orfitus was charged with having let to certain states as headquarters three shops which formed part of his home near the Forum ; Cassius Longinus , a blind jurist , with retaining in the old family tree of his House the mask of Gaius Cassius , the assassin of Julius Caesar ; Paetus Thrasea with having a sullen mien , like that of a preceptor .
To those who were bidden to die he never granted more than an hour 's respite , and to avoid any delay , he brought physicians who were at once to " attend to " such as lingered ; for that was the term he used for killing them by opening their veins .
It is even believed that it was his wish to throw living men to be torn to pieces and devoured by a monster of Egyptian birth , who would crunch raw flesh and anything else that was given him .
Transported and puffed up with such successes , as he considered them , he boasted that no princeps had ever known what power he really had , and he often threw out unmistakable hints that he would not spare even those of the Senate who survived , but would one day blot out the whole order from the State and hand over the rule of the provinces and the command of the armies to the Roman equites and to his freedmen .
Certain it is that neither on beginning a journey nor on returning did he kiss any member or even return his greeting ; and at the formal opening of the work at the Isthmus the prayer which he uttered in a loud voice before a great throng was that the event might result favorably " for himself and the people of Rome , " thus suppressing any mention of the Senate .
XXXVIII .
But he showed no greater mercy to the people or the walls of his capital .
When someone in a general conversation said : " When I am dead , be earth consumed by fire , " he rejoined " Nay , rather while I live , " and his action was wholly in accord .
For under cover of displeasure at the ugliness of the old buildings and the narrow , crooked streets , he set fire to the city so openly that several ex-consuls did not venture to lay hands on his chamberlains although they caught them on their estates with tow and firebrands , while some granaries near the Golden House , whose room he particularly desired , were demolished by engines of war and then set on fire , because their walls were of stone .
For six days and seven nights destruction raged , while the people were driven for shelter to monuments and tombs .
At that time , besides an immense number of dwellings , the houses of leaders of old were burned , still adorned with trophies of victory , and the temples of the gods vowed and dedicated by the kings and later in the Punic and Gallic wars , and whatever else interesting and noteworthy had survived from antiquity .
Viewing the conflagration from the tower of Maecenas , and exulting , as he said , " with the beauty of the flames , " he sang the whole time the " Sack of Ilium , " in his regular stage costume .
Furthermore , to gain from this calamity too the spoil and booty possible , while promising the removal of the debris and dead bodies free of cost , allowed no one to approach the ruins of his own property ; and from the contributions which he not only received , but even demanded , he nearly bankrupted the provinces and exhausted the resources of individuals XXXIX .
To all the disasters and abuses thus caused bu the princeps there were added certain accidents of fortune ; a plague which in a single autumn entered thirty thousand deaths in the accounts of Libitina ; a disaster in Britain , where two important towns were sacked [ Camulodunum ( modern Colchester ) and Verulamium ( modern St. Albans ) ; according to Xiphilinus 80,000 perished ] and great members of citizens and allies were butchered ; a shameful defeat in the Orient , in consequence of which the legions in Armenia were sent under the yoke and Syria was all but lost .
It is surprising and of special note that all this time he bore nothing with more patience than the curses and abuse of the people , and was particularly lenient towards those who assailed him with gibes and lampoons .
Of these many were posted or circulated both in Greek and Latin , for example the following : " Nero , Orestes , Alcmeon their mothers slew . "
" A calculation new .
Nero his mother slew . "
" Who can deny the descent from Aeneas ' great line of our Nero ?
One his mother took off , the other one took off his sire . "
" While our ruler his lyre does twang and the Parthian his bowstring ,
Paean - singer our princeps shall be , and Far - darter our foe . "
" Rome is becoming one house ; off with you to Veii , Quirites !
If that house does not soon seize upon Veii as well . "
He made no effort , however , to find the authors , in fact , when some of them were reported to the Senate by an informer , he forbade their being very severely punished .
As he was passing along a public street , the Cynic Isidorus loudly taunted him , " because he was a good singer of the ills of Nauplius , but made ill use of his own goods . "
Datus also , an actor of Atellan farces , in a song beginning : " Farewell to thee , father ; farewell to thee , mother , " represented drinking and swimming in pantomime , referring of course to the death of Claudius and Agrippina ; and in the final tag , " Orcus guides your steps , " he indicated the Senate by a gesture .
Nero contented himself with banishing the actor and the philosopher from the city , either because he was impervious to all insults , or to avoid sharpening men's wits by showing his vexation .
XL .
After the world had put up with such a ruler for nearly fourteen years , it at last cast him off , and the Gauls took the first step under the lead of Julius Vindex , who at that time governed their province as propraetor .
Astrologers had predicted to Nero that he would one day be repudiated , which was the occasion of that well known saying of his : " A humble art affords us daily bread , " doubtless uttered to justify him in practicing the art of lyre - playing , as an amusement while emperor , but a necessity for a private citizen .
Some of them , however , had promised him the rule of the East , when he was cast off , a few expressly naming the sovereignty of Jerusalem , and several the restitution of all his former fortunes .
Inclining rather to this last hope , after losing Armenia and Britain and recovering both , he began to think that he had suffered the misfortunes which fate had in store .
And after consulting the oracle at Delphi and being told that he must look out for the seventy - third year , assuming that he would die only at that period , and taking no account of Galba 's years , he felt so confident not only of old age , but also of unbroken and unusual good fortune , that when he had lost some articles of great value by shipwreck , he did not hesitate to say among his intimate friends that the fish would bring them back to him .
He was at Neapolis when he learned of the uprising of the Gallic provinces , on the anniversary of his mother 's murder , and received the news with such calmness and indifference that he incurred the suspicion of actually rejoicing in it , because it gave him an excuse for pillaging those wealthy provinces according to the laws of war .
And he at once proceeded to the gymnasium , where he watched the contests of the athletes with rapt interest .
At dinner , too , when interrupted by more disturbing letters , he filled up only so far as to threaten vengeance on the rebels .
In short , for eight whole days making no attempt to write a reply to anyone , none to give any commission or command , he blotted out the affair with silence .
XLI .
At last he was driven by numerous insulting edicts of Vindex , to urge the Senate in a letter to avenge him and the state , alleging a throat trouble as his excuse for not appearing in person .
Yet there was nothing which he so much resented as the taunt that he was a wretched lyre - player and that he was addressed as Ahenobarbus instead of Nero .
With regard to his family name , which was cast in his teeth as an insult , he declared that he would resume it and give up that of his adoption .
He used no other arguments to show the falsity of the rest of the reproaches than that he was actually taunted with being unskilled in an art to which he had devoted so much attention and in which he had so perfected himself , and he asked various individuals from time to time whether they knew of any artist who was his superior .
Finally , beset by message after message , he returned to Rome in a panic ; but on the way , when but slightly encouraged by an insignificant omen , for he noticed a monument on which was sculptured the overthrow of a Gallic soldier by a Roman horseman , who was dragging him along by the hairs he leaped for joy at the sight and lifted up his hands to heaven .
Not even on his arrival did he personally address the Senate or people , but called some of the leading men to his house and after a hasty consultation spent the rest of the day in exhibiting some water - organs of a new and hitherto unknown form , explaining their several features and lecturing on the theory and complexity of each of them ; and he even declared that he would presently produce them all in the theater " with the kind permission of Vindex . "
XLII .
Thereafter , having learned that Galba also and the Spanish provinces had revolted , he fainted and lay for a long time insensible , without a word and all but dead .
When he came to himself , he rent his robe and beat his brow , declaring that it was all over with him ; and when his old nurse tried to comfort him by reminding him that similar evils had befallen other princes before him , he declared that unlike all others he was suffering the unheard of and unparalleled fate of losing the supreme power while he still lived .
Nevertheless he did not abandon or amend his slothful and luxurious habits ; on the contrary , whenever any good news came from the provinces , he not only gave lavish feasts , but even ridiculed the leaders of the revolt in verses set to wanton music , which have since become public , and accompanied them with gestures ; then secretly entering the audience room of the theater , he sent word to an actor who was making a hit that he was taking advantage of the emperor 's busy days .
XLIII .
At the very beginning of the revolt it is believed that he formed many plans of monstrous wickedness but in no way inconsistent with his character : to depose and assassinate the commanders of the armies and the governors of the provinces , on the ground that they were all united in a conspiracy against him ; to massacre all the exiles everywhere and all men of Gallic birth in the city : the former , to prevent them from joining the rebels ; the latter , as sharing and abetting the designs of their countrymen ; to turn over the Gallic provinces to his armies to ravage ; to poison the entire Senate at banquets ; to set fire to the city , first letting the wild beasts loose , that it might be harder for the people to protect themselves .
But he was deterred from these designs , not so much by any compunction , as because he despaired of being able to carry them out , and feeling obliged to take the field , he deposed the consuls before the end of their term and assumed the office alone in place of both of them , alleging that it was fated that the Gallic provinces could not be subdued except by a consul .
Having assumed the fasces , he declared as he was leaving the dining room after a banquet , leaning on the shoulders of his comrades , that immediately on setting foot in the province he would go before the soldiers unarmed and do nothing but weep ; and having thus led the rebels to change their purpose , he would next day rejoice among his rejoicing subjects and sing paeans of victory , which he ought at that very moment to be composing .
XLIV .
In preparing for his campaign his first care was to select wagons to carry his theatrical instruments , to have the hair of his concubines , whom he planned to take with him , trimmed man-fashion , and to equip them with Amazonian axes and shields .
Next he summoned the city tribes to enlist , and when no eligible person responded , he levied from their masters a stated number of slaves , accepting only the choicest from each household and not even exempting paymasters and secretaries .
He also required all classes to contribute a part of their incomes , and all tenants of private houses and apartments to pay a year 's rent at once to the privy purse [ Instead of to their landlords .
These people had no rating on the census list and their contribution took this form ] .
With great fastidiousness and rigor he demanded newly minted coin , refined silver , and pure gold [ that is , tested by fire ; see Pliny , Nat. Hist. 33.59 ] , so that many openly refused to make any contribution at all , unanimously demanding that he should rather compel the informers to give up whatever rewards had been paid them .
XLV .
The bitter feeling against him was increased because he also turned the high cost of grain to his profit [ by using for his own purposes ships which would otherwise have been loaded with grain ; but the text and the meaning are uncertain ] ; for indeed , it so fell out that while the people were suffering from hunger it was reported that a ship had arrived from Alexandria , bringing sand for the court wrestlers .
When he had thus aroused the hatred of all , there was no form of insult to which he was not subjected .
A curl [ doubtless an allusion to the long hair which he wore during his Greek trip ] was placed on the head of his statue with the inscription in Greek : " Now there is a real contest [ in contrast with those of the stage ] , and you must at last surrender . "
To the neck of another statue a sack was tied and with it the words : " I have done what I could , but you have earned the sack " [ the one in which parricides were put ; see Aug. xxxiii.1 ] .
People wrote on the columns that he had stirred up even the Gauls [ there is obviously a pun on " Galli " ( or " Gauls " ) and " galli " ( or " cocks " ) , and on " cantare " in the sense of " sing " and of " crow " ] by his singing .
When night came on , many men pretended to be wrangling with their slaves and kept calling out for a defender [ punning , of course , on Vindex , the leader of the revolt ] .
XLVI .
In addition , he was frightened by manifest portents from dreams , auspices and omens , both old and new .
Although he had never before been in the habit of dreaming , after he had killed his mother it seemed to him that he was steering a ship in his sleep and that the helm was wrenched from his hands ; that he was dragged by his wife Octavia into thickest darkness , and that he was now covered with a swarm of winged ants , and now was surrounded by the statues of the nations which had been dedicated in Pompeius Magnus ' theater and stopped in his tracks .
An Hispanic steed of which he was very fond was changed into the form of an ape in the hinder parts of its body , and its head , which alone remained unaltered , gave forth tuneful neighs .
The doors of the Mausoleum flew open of their own accord , and a voice was heard from within summoning him by name .
After the Lares had been adorned on the Kalends of January , they fell to the ground in the midst of the preparations for the sacrifice .
As he was taking the auspices , Sporus made him a present of a ring with a stone on which was engraved the rape of Proserpina .
When the vows were to be taken [ on the first of January , for the prosperity of the emperor and the state ] and a great throng of all classes had assembled , the keys of the Capitol could not be found for a long time .
When a speech of his in which he assailed Vindex was being read in the Senate , at the words " the wretches will suffer punishment and will shortly meet the end which they deserve , " all who were present cried out with one voice : " You will do it , Augustus " [ of course , used in a double sense ] .
It also had not failed of notice that the last piece which he sang in public was " Oedipus in Exile , " and that he ended with the line : " Wife , father , mother drive me to my death . "
XLVII .
When meanwhile word came that the other armies had revolted , he tore to pieces the dispatches which were handed to him as he was dining , tipped over the table , and dashed to the ground two favorite drinking cups , which he called " Homeric , " because they were carved with scenes from Homer 's poems [ Pliny , Nat. Hist. 37.29 tells us that the cups were of crystal ] .
Then taking some poison from Locusta and putting it into a golden box , he crossed over into the Servilian gardens , where he tried to induce the tribunes and centurions of the Guard to accompany him in his flight , first sending his most trustworthy freedmen to Ostia , to get a fleet ready .
But when some gave evasive answers and some openly refused , one even cried : " Is it so dreadful a thing then to die ? " [ Verg. Aen. 12.646 ]
Whereupon he turned over various plans in his mind , whether to go as a suppliant to the Parthians or Galba , or to appear to the people on the Rostra , dressed in black , and beg as pathetically as he could for pardon for his past offences ; and if he could not soften their hearts , to entreat them at least to allow him the prefecture of Egypt .
Afterwards , a speech composed for this purpose was found in his writing desk ; but it is thought that he did not dare to deliver it for fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum .
Having therefore put off further consideration to the following day , he awoke about midnight , and finding that the guard of soldiers had left , he sprang from his bed and sent for all his friends .
Since no reply came back from anyone , he went himself to their rooms a with a few followers .
But finding that the doors were closed and that no one replied to him , he returned to his own chamber , from which now the very caretakers had fled , taking with them even the bed - clothing and the box of poison .
Then he at once called for the gladiator Spiculus or any other adept at whose hand he might find death , and when no one appeared , he cried " Have I then neither friend nor foe ? " and ran out as if to throw himself into the Tiber .
XLVIII .
Changing his purpose again , he sought for some retired place , where he could hide and collect his thoughts ; and when his freedmen Phaon offered his villa in the suburbs between the Via Nomentana and the Via Salaria near the fourth milestone , just as he was , barefooted and in his tunic , he put on a faded cloak , covered his head , and holding a handkerchief before his face , mounted a horse with only four attendants , one of whom was Sporus .
At once he was startled by a shock of earthquake and a flash of lightning full in his face , and he heard the shouts of the soldiers from the camp hard by , as they prophesied destruction for him and success for Galba .
He also heard one of the wayfarers whom he met say : " These men are after Nero , " and another ask : " Is there anything new in the city about Nero ? "
Then his horse took fright at the smell of a corpse which had been thrown out into the road , his face was exposed , and a retired soldier of the Guard recognized him and saluted him .
When they came to a by - path leading to the villa , they turned the horses loose and he made his way amid bushes and brambles and along a path through a thicket of reeds to the back wall of the house , with great difficulty and only when a robe was thrown down for him to walk on .
Here the aforesaid Phaon urged him to hide for a time in a pit , from which sand had been dug , but he declared that he would not go under ground while still alive , and after waiting for a while until a secret entrance into the villa could be made , he scooped up in his hand some water to drink from a pool close by , saying : " This is Nero 's distilled water " [ referring to a drink of his own contrivance , distilled water cooled in snow ; cf. , Pliny , Nat. Hist. 31.40 ] .
Then , as his cloak had been torn by the thorns , he pulled out the twigs which had pierced it , and crawling on all fours through a narrow passage that had been dug , he entered the villa and lay down in the first room [ " Cella " implies a small room , for the use of slaves ] he came to , on a couch with a common mattress , over which an old cloak had been thrown .
Though suffering from hunger and renewed thirst , he refused some coarse bread which was offered him , but drank a little lukewarm water .
XLIX .
At last , while his companions one and all urged him to save himself as soon as possible from the indignities that threatened him , he bade them dig a grave in his presence , proportioned to the size of his own person , collect any bits of marble that could be found , and at the same time bring water and wood for presently disposing of his body [ the water was for washing his corpse and the fire for burning it ] .
As each of these things was done , he wept and said again and again : " What an artist the world is losing ! "
While he hesitated , a letter was brought to Phaon by one of his couriers .
Nero snatching it from his hand read that he had been pronounced a public enemy by the Senate , and that they were seeking him to punish him in the ancient fashion [ Cf. , Claud. xxxiv.1 ] , and he asked what manner of punishment that was .
When he learned that the criminal was stripped , fastened by the neck in a fork [ two pieces of wood , fastened together in the form of a " V " ] , and then beaten to death with rods , in mortal terror he seized two daggers which he had brought with him , and then , after trying the point of each , put them up again , pleading that the fated hour had not yet come .
Now he would beg Sporus to begin to lament and wail , and now entreat someone to help him take his life by setting him the example ; anon he reproached himself for his cowardice in such words as these : " To live is a scandal and shame --- this does not become Nero , does not become him --- one should be resolute at such times --- come , rouse oneself ! "
And now the horsemen were at hand who had orders to take him off alive .
When he heard them , he quavered : " Hark , now strikes on my ear the trampling of swift - footed coursers ! " [ Iliad 10.535 ] , and drove a dagger into his throat , aided by Epaphroditus , his private secretary [ See Domitian xiv.4 ] .
He was all but dead when a centurion rushed in , and as he placed a cloak to the wound , pretending that he had come to aid him , Nero merely gasped : " Too late ! " and " This is fidelity ! "
With these words he was gone , with eyes so set and starting from their sockets that all who saw him shuddered with horror .
First and beyond all else he had forced from his companions a promise to let no one have his head , but to contrive in some way that he be buried unmutilated .
And this was granted by Icelus , Galbas ' freedman [ See Galba xiv.2 ] , who had shortly before been released from the bondage to which he was consigned at the beginning of the revolt .
L. He was buried at a cost of two hundred thousand sesterces and laid out in white robes embroidered with gold , which he had worn on the Kalends of January .
His ashes were deposited by his nurses , Egloge and Alexandria , accompanied by his mistress Acte , in the family tomb of the Domitii on the summit of the Hill of Gardens [ the modern Pincio ] , which is visible from the Campus Martius .
In that monument his sarcophagus of porphyry , with an altar of Luna marble standing above it , is enclosed by a balustrade of Thasian stone .
LI .
He was about the average height , his body marked with spots and malodorous , his hair light blond , his features regular rather than attractive , his eyes blue and somewhat weak , his neck over thick , his belly prominent , and his legs very slender .
His health was good , for though indulging in every kind of riotous excess , he was ill but three times in all during the fourteen years of his reign , and even then not enough to give up wine or any of his usual habits .
He was utterly shameless in the care of his person and in his dress , always having his hair arranged in tiers of curls , and during the trip to Greece also letting it grow long and hang down behind ; and he often appeared in public in a dining - robe [ the " synthesina " was a loose robe of bright - colored silk , worn at dinner , during the Saturnalia , and by women at other times .
Nero's is described by Dio , 63.13 , as " a short , flowered tunic with a muslin collar . " ] , with a handkerchief bound about his neck , ungirt and unshod [ probably meaning " in slippers " ] .
LII .
When a boy , he took up almost all the liberal arts ; but his mother turned him from philosophy , warning him that it was a drawback to one who was going to rule , while Seneca kept him from reading the early orators , to make his admiration for his teacher endure the longer .
Turning therefore to poetry , he wrote verses with eagerness and without labor , and did not , as some think , publish the work of others as his own .
I have had in my possession note - books and papers with some well - known verses of his , written with his own hand and in such wise that it was perfectly evident that they were not copied or taken down from dictation , but worked out exactly as one writes when thinking and creating ; so many instances were there of words erased or struck through and written above the lines .
He likewise had no slight interest in painting and sculpture .
LIII .
But above all he was carried away by a craze for popularity and he was jealous of all who in any way stirred the feeling of the mob .
It was the general belief that after his victories on the stage he would at the next lustrum have competed with the athletes at Olympia ; for he practiced wrestling constantly , and all over Greece he had always viewed the gymnastic contests after the fashion of the judges , sitting on the ground in the stadium ; and if any pairs of contestants withdrew too far from their positions , he would force them forward with his own hand .
Since he was acclaimed as the equal of Apollo in music and of the Sun in driving a chariot , he had planned to emulate the exploits of Hercules as well ; and they say that a lion had been specially trained for him to kill naked in the arena of the amphitheatre before all the people , with a club or by the clasp of his arms .
LIV .
Towards the end of his life , in fact , he had publicly vowed that if he retained his power , he would at the games in celebration of his victory give a performance on the water - organ , the flute , and the bagpipes and that on the last day he would appear as an actor and dance " Vergil 's Turnus . "
Some even assert that he put the actor Paris to death as a dangerous rival .
LV .
He had a longing for immortality and undying fame , though it was ill - regulated .
With this in view he took their former appellations from many things and numerous places and gave them new ones from his own name .
He also called the month of April Neroneus and was minded to name Rome Neropolis .
LVI .
He utterly despised all cults , with the sole exception of that of the Syrian Goddess [ Atargatis , the principal deity of Northern Syria , identified with Magna Mater and Caelestis ; often mentioned in inscriptions and called by Apul.
Metam . 8.25 , omnipotens et omniparens ] , and even acquired such a contempt for her that he made water on her image , after he was enamored of another , superstition , which was the only one to which he constantly clung .
For he had received as a gift from some unknown man of the commons , as a protection against plots , a little image of a girl ; and since a conspiracy at once came to light , he continued to venerate it as a powerful divinity and to offer three sacrifices to it every day , encouraging the belief that through its communication he had knowledge of the future .
A few months before his death he did attend an inspection of victims , but could not get a favorable omen .
LVII .
He met his death in the thirty - second year of his age , on the anniversary of the murder of Octavia , and such was the public rejoicing that the people put on liberty - caps and ran about all over the city .
Yet there were some who for a long time decorated his tomb with spring and summer flowers , and now produced his statues on the Rostra in the fringed toga , and now his edicts , as if he were still alive and would shortly return and deal destruction to his enemies .
Nay more , Vologaesus , King of the Parthians , when he sent envoys to the Senate to renew his alliance , earnestly begged this too , that honor be paid to the memory of Nero .
In fact , twenty years later , when I was a young man , a person of obscure origin appeared , who gave out that he was Nero , and the name was still in such favor with the Parthians , that they supported him vigorously and surrendered him with great reluctance .

Strange Congress : 1856 , Preston Brooks vs. Charles Sumner
On May 22nd , 1856 , Preston Brooks , a Democratic Congressman from South Carolina beat and severely injured Senator Charles Sumner , a Republican from Massachusetts with his gutta - percha ( a type of tree ) cane .
The story starts on May 19th of the same year , when Senator Sumner gave a rousing two - day speech of the floor of the United States Senate where he not only criticized then President Franklin Pierce , but also went even further to single out specific sympathizers of the pro-slavery - driven violence that was occurring in Kansas .
One of the individuals singled out by Senator Sumner was Senator Andrew Pickens Butler , a Democrat from South Carolina and a cousin of Preston Brooks .
Upon hearing of Sumner ’s speech , the South Carolina Congressman , complete with his understanding of Code Duello ( Southern Code of Honor ) , and his gutta - percha cane , entered the Chambers of the United States Senate with Congressman Laurence Massillon Keitt , a fellow South Carolina Democrat and Virginia Congressman Henry Alonzo Edmundson ( also a Democrat ) and approached Sumner .
Upon stating that he had read Sumner ’s speech , Brooks began to viciously beat him in the head with his cane until it broke .
By the time Brooks was done with his attack , Sumner was left fading in and out of consciousness , which injuries that would keep him out of the Senate for three years .

While punishment was sought against Brooks , the two - thirds vote needed to expel him from House of Representatives could n’t be reached .
Even so , Brooks resigned from Congress on July 15 , 1856 , but later was quickly re-elected on August 1 , 1856 , where he served until his death on January 27 , 1857 .
Despite the physical and emotional trauman faced by Sumner , he returned to the Senate three years later and became a an outspoken leader for the Radical Republicans .
Sumner remained in the Senate until his death on March 11 , 1864 1874 .

Mexico last month adopted a law that decriminalizes the possession of small amounts of marijuana and harder drugs , including cocaine and heroin .
Other countries in Latin America are considering similar changes in their laws , prompting antidrug groups in the U.S. to say that pressure from south of the border will push the United States toward decriminalization , if not legalization , of drugs .
What effect will the new policy will have in Mexico and , possibly , in the United States ?
Will it draw so - called drug tourists from across the border ?
Is the Obama administration doing the right thing by taking a wait - and - see attitude , in contrast to the Bush administration ’s vehement opposition to a similar plan proposed in Mexico in 2006 ?
A Modest and Gigantic Shift
Tony Payan is an associate professor of political science at the University of Texas at El Paso and is also on the faculty of the Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez .
Mexico decriminalized the possession ( but not the production , trade , and distribution ) of drugs .
So did Argentina and Colombia .
The move is , as politicians explain it , designed to curb police corruption — bribing people when caught with small amounts of drugs .
The new policies in conservative Latin America reflect disillusionment with the United States war on drugs .
If they said any more about it , they would be wrong — and they know it , as they do not make any claims that this measure will result in less drug - related violence .
Indeed , if they asked me , will decriminalization of the possession of small amounts of drugs save a single life in Ciudad Juárez , where there have been about 3,200 murders in 21 months , my answer would be a rotund no .
But decriminalizing drug possession is in and of itself a change of , paradoxically , gigantic and modest proportions .
Gigantic because it is a solid first step to pave the way for 1 ) distinguishing between drug use and drug abuse 2 ) paving the way for fully medicalizing abuse , that is , reinforcing the idea that we should treat drug addicts much as alcoholics and offer them help instead of prison time , and 3 ) focusing state resources on the production , trafficking and distribution networks .
But modest because it still commits governments to continue their war on drugs , just not on the user .
What is surprising is the fact that this change is coming from Latin America , a Catholic , largely conservative continent .
This represents a cultural shift that may mean that Latin America is changing but also that it is increasingly disappointed with the American approach to drugs and the futility of its strategies and tactics .

In the end the United States may be left alone to fight a 40 - year - old failed “ war on drugs ” or join the rest and craft a more nuanced strategy to consider other possibilities in dealing with psychotropic substances .
Perhaps this time change will come from South to North , instead of North to South .
President Obama has not defined his own strategy , adopting by default the policy in place for almost a century .
But before he does , he would do well engaging former and current Latin American presidents and figure out what they perceive that he can not yet see .
What Decriminalization ?
Jorge Castañeda is the Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University .
He was foreign minister of Mexico from 2000 to 2003 .
The recently approved new “ drug ” law in Mexico is in fact not a step toward decriminalization , but rather toward mandatory sentencing .
Until last month , possession of small ( unspecified ) amounts of drugs was not a criminal offense in Mexico ; only the sale or purchase was .
The new law establishes a minuscule limit on legal possession , meaning that today , almost anyone caught carrying any drug is subject to arrest , prosecution and jail .
If anything , the new law criminalizes drug use much more radically than before .
If anything , the new law criminalizes drug use much more radically than before , and it is probably for this reason that President Calderón signed it , and that the Obama administration has looked the other way .
It will almost certainly not attract US “ drug tourists ” to Mexico , since the risk of being arrested for possession has grown considerably with the new law , whereas before the real risk was just a shakedown by the authorities .
The law actually is part of a campaign to justify President Calderón ’s war of choice on drugs by stating that drug consumption in Mexico has increased over the past 10 years .
In fact , the government ’s own unpublished but leaked National Addiction Survey for 2008 shows that this is not the case .
The growth of marijuana , heroin and metaphetamine consumption is flat in all categories ( addiction , occasional use , at - least - once - in - a - lifetime use ) , and while cocaine addiction , for example , did rise from 300 000 victims in 2002 to 450 000 in 2008 ( a 50 percent increase , or roughly 6 percent per year ) , it did so from a tiny baseline , for a tiny percentage ( 0.4 percent ) of Mexico ’s population , a much smaller share than for the U.S. , Western Europe and practically every country in Latin America .

Mexico should move toward decriminalization , but it cannot do so if the United States does not .
Among the many reasons is the so - called Zurich effect , i.e. , what occurred in the Swiss city in the 80’s and 90’s when it was one of only a couple of European towns that had legalized virtually all drug use , and consequently attracted thousands of users from across Europe , eventually forcing the city to shut down its “ needle park ” and abrogate decriminalization .
If the current movement toward legalized medical use of marijuana and / or decriminalization prospers and expands in the U.S. , Mexico will be able to move in the same direction , and perhaps reduce the tremendous cost the war on drugs is imposing on Mexican society , without any visible results or hope for success .
Danger of a Domino Effect
Calvina Fay is executive director of Drug Free America Foundation Inc .
Mexico ’s President Calderon got it wrong on decriminalizing drugs .
I fear for the future of Mexico and the domino effect here at home .
Creating an environment where it is easier to use drugs will enhance the market for traffickers .
A better way to distinguish users from dealers is to increase drug courts and treatment facilities and the frequency of referrals of low - level drug offenders into these programs .
Drug courts save lives , holding users accountable while leveraging them into treatment .
Treating users as though they merely were speeding by imposing a minor fine is not in the best interest of Mexico ’s citizens .
Ignoring the behavior or fining them eliminates the opportunity for meaningful intervention .
Drug users are not innocent .
They support the vicious drug cartels .
Without their demand for drugs , the supply side has no purpose .
Since terrorists depend on the drug market to fund their activities , users are potentially aiding terrorism .
Because drug traffickers are frequently linked with weapons and human trafficking , users are also supporting these activities .
Drugs put more impaired drivers on the highways , endangering others .
They make workers less productive and less safe .
Users utilize more health - care benefits , increasing insurance costs .
In the U.S. , about 75 percent of children in foster care are victims of drug - abusing parents and roughly 60 percent of domestic abuse and 80 percent of workplace thefts are drug - related .
Drug use is linked to crime , school dropout , and teenage pregnancy .
All of this will likely increase , further burdening Mexico ’s judicial system , which is already hanging by a thin thread .

The rule of law – the process of being physically safe – is fragile .
Creating an environment where it is easier to use drugs while enhancing the market for drug traffickers could tilt things in Mexico bringing on utter destruction of it as an orderly society .
A Welcome Shift
Peter Reuter is a professor in the School of Public Policy and the Department of Criminology at the University of Maryland .
Mexico is one of several Latin American countries that want to avoid a war on local drug users — even as it deals with horrific violence arising from the international drug trade .
The country has therefore considered decriminalizing the possession of illicit drugs for personal use .
Mexico ’s most severe drug - related crime and violence arise almost entirely from U.S. demand for illicit drugs .
Evidence from other countries suggests that decriminalization could be modestly helpful in addressing Mexico ’s recent difficulties .
The most analogous recent experience is that of Portugal , which decriminalized drug possession in 2001 .
When these measures were implemented , critics feared that decriminalization would lead to increased drug use , and that drug users across the European Union would congregate there .
To all outward appearances , decriminalization produced none of the feared effects .
Given that drug users in Portugal were hardly ever arrested before 2001 , the result was not surprising .
Mexico has been similarly restrained in enforcing its own drug possession laws .
Removing the possible deterrent effect of criminal prosecution is thus unlikely to make much difference to the decision to experiment with drugs in Mexico .
Given the corruption that has been revealed in endless scandals at all levels of Mexican drug enforcement , one major attraction of decriminalization is that it reduces the number of ways that local police can extort the populace , including U.S. college students sampling various intoxicants on their spring vacations .

The prior U.S. drug czar would no doubt have lectured Mexico about spreading poison , as he lectured Canada when it was contemplating decriminalizing marijuana .
The current czar , perhaps observing that our nation is by far this hemisphere ’s largest consumer , is showing admirable good sense and restraint in letting other nations experiment with policies that would be politically unacceptable within our own borders .
Unfortunately , decriminalization will not address Mexico ’s most severe drug - related crime and violence .
These problems arise almost entirely from U.S. demand for illicit drugs .
Decriminalizing drug possession within Mexico may thus prove entirely sensible .
Even so , these policies are likely to leave our southern neighbor with much the same constellation of drug - related violence as it now confronts .
Fear - Mongering Is Unjustified
Ethan Nadelmann is executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance .
The recent decriminalization of drug possession in Mexico is good for Mexico , good for the U.S. , and consistent with the broader trend in Europe , Latin America and elsewhere .
The Jamaican drug tourism industry has nothing to fear from Mexico ’s reform .
The new law eliminates criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of drugs , authorizes treatment instead of incarceration for addicts , refrains from forcing “ rehabilitation ” on consumers who are not addicted , and legitimizes the ritual and cultural use of drugs like peyote .
This should , in theory , result in fewer people being incarcerated for nothing more than drug use or possession , and allow police to focus on more serious crimes .
Such reforms generally do not result in higher rates of drug use — at least that ’s the evidence from other countries .
And it will have no impact on President Calderon ’s battle with the major drug trafficking organizations .
It ’s hard to see the law encouraging “ drug tourism ” from the United States , and certainly nothing to compare with the “ tourism ” generated by Mexico ’s lower drinking age and easy access to lower cost pharmaceutical drugs .
Nothing in the law authorizes the creation of Dutch - like coffee shops selling marijuana openly .
The Jamaican tourism industry has nothing to fear from Mexico ’s reform .
And Americans generally prefer the higher quality marijuana grown in our own country .
Why did the Obama administration refrain from criticizing the Mexican reform ?
Probably because it understands that it will have no impact on drug use or trafficking in the United States .
But perhaps it also is coming to the conclusion that criminalization of drug possession typically does more harm than good .
Twenty - one - year - old Kaila Morris got into a van Thursday and has n''t been home since .
Morris '' parents reported the part - time Mississippi State University student missing after her step father , Robert Triplett , saw her get into a van and leave her personal belongings behind when she was supposed to be headed to a friend ''s house in Alabama .
" She was supposed to be going to a friend ' 's house in Carrollton , ( Ala. ) and never showed up , " said Lowndes County Sheriff ' 's Office Investigator , Lt. Tony Perkins .

So ...
Tom Ridge came clean this week .
Woo - hoo .
What a brave and selfless act .
Reminds me of Colin Powell completely and totally kinda sorta dissing the Iraq invasion .
Great to hear that everything we knew and said and got clobbered for saying at the time was in fact true .
Thanks a lot , General .
That 's really helpful .
Not so great about the whole timing thing though .
Colin Powell was probably the only human on the planet who could have stopped the Iraq holocaust , but he waited instead .
He seems to think that loyalty to the president is more important than loyalty to the country , loyalty to principle , or loyalty to the idea of preserving lives .
Or so he claims .
Given what he has said since he sold the war to Americans with his unconscionably despicable Security Council dog-and - pony show , I 'm hard - pressed to see how he 's been loyal even to Bush .
Seems kinda like he 's only loyal to Colin , trying to save a place for himself in the history books .
Mr. Ridge , on the other hand , has a book for sale , just in case no one noticed that particular coincidence .
Perhaps that explains why he is now revealing the truth about the politicization of the buffoonish ' terrorism ' color - coding system , a mere five years after he claims it was used to justify the Bush administration 's continued existence , and almost used - save for the brave interventions of , wait for it now ... , one Tom Ridge - to put Bush over the top on the eve of the 2004 election .
Once again , a bit of timely honesty from Ridge at exactly that moment would almost certainly have terminated the Bush nightmare at a ' mere ' sickening four years .
Imagine the effect on votershad the Little Emperor 's Secretary of Homeland Security resigned in protest on the eve of that election , and said exactly why .
Alas ,
Tom seems to think 2009 a more timely year for his revelations .
And then , of course , there 's the book ...
All of this has me thinking - as I 'm afraid I 've found myself doing pretty much every day for at least the last decade - " What the hell happened to America ? "
This country seems to have deteriorated mightily over the course of my lifetime , and I know from the email that I get that I 'm hardly alone in believing that .
I 'll confess right off the bat that I am more than a little suspicious of the question itself .
Does n't every generation think that life was better back in the day ?
Could it be that I 'm just part of the latest cast of regular , vanilla - flavored narcissists now busy transforming themselves into full - blown , old and bitter narcissists ?
There 's some pretty good reason to think so .
Iraq is a disgusting piece of savagery that was sold on lies and never should have happened in a remotely moral universe .
But Vietnam was worse .
The Caligula Kid - George W. Bush - and his growly pally , Dick " Dick " Cheney , are about the last persons out of the whole 300 million of us who should have been selected to reside in the White House .
But so was Nixon and , in some ways , Johnson too .
Karl Rove was a monster who cheapened American politics and the practice of government in every fashion he could possibly imagine .
But so did his mentor , Lee Atwater .
And so did Atwater 's spiritual antecedent , Joe McCarthy .
It many ways , the present disaster often looks like just more of the same , history 's proverbial one damn thing after another .
But my gut tells me that the feelings rumbling around in there are not just the bitter ruminations of some geezer who is n't even old enough yet to qualify as an old man .
I do think something profound and fundamental has changed .
It 's hard to put your finger on it , though .
For one thing , it 's not just one thing .
It 's not just the politicians .
It 's not just the media .
It 's not just the institutions of government or the political parties .
It 's not just the public .
It 's all of that , and a lot more .
And for another thing , it 's not just this or that deadly sin , but all of them , plus a few that were n't even on the original manufacturer 's list .
Is it that we 've become more deceitful , or more fearful that is the problem ?
More corrupt , or more vicious ?
More slothful , or more greedy ?
And so on , and so on .
So many ways to destroy a culture , so little time ...
At the risk of sounding a bit too much like the very people I most loathe in the American political and cultural discourse , I think what 's happened is that the society has fundamentally lost its moral bearings .
No , I 'm not talking about some hyped - up , jerked - off , compulsive obsession with all things sexual .
That regressive fixation , complete with enough hypocrisy to sink a small continent , is of course so much a part of the problem , not the solution .
What I 'm referring to is an unmooring from basic , just , unselfish - and one might even say , patriotic , in the true sense of the term - dignity , generosity , humanity .
Look , let 's not kid ourselves .
There 's always been a dark side to the human spirit , and you 'll never go broke betting on the proposition that politics draws more needy and black souls to its practice than do most other professions .
As already noted , before Rove there was the shameful scourge of McCarthy , and he was hardly the first political practitioner of the dark arts , in America or elsewhere .
But it 's different today .
To begin with , this country has unquestionably drifted to the right over the last thirty years .
This is not an entirely simple equation , and indeed , in the domain of social issues such as gay rights or the integration of women and minorities into the economic and political institutions of society , I would even argue that we 've witnessed a progressive turn during these last decades .
Moreover , it 's even possible that we are in the early stages of a leftward turn in other domains as well , given the current crises of American capitalism and foreign policy .
Nevertheless , even with all those caveats , who would have imagined in 1970 that America would be far more regressive four decades later , rather than far less ?
It 's a libertarian sort of regressivism , to be sure , hence the aforementioned drift to the left on social issues , and perhaps even a new isolationist cast on foreign - policy questions , rejecting the worst excesses of imperialist predation .
That 's hard to say .
The Iraq experience provides evidence for both a more optimistic or a more pessimistic interpretation of public opinion when it comes to foreign adventures .
But where you really see the rightward turn is in the economic domain .
Once , thirty or forty years ago , it was literally a national project to worry about the poor .
So much so , in fact , that we decided to fight a war on poverty .
By the 1990s , however , that war was lost through an abandonment of the battlefield equating to unconditional surrender .
One of the most profoundly significant , and yet simultaneously most subtle developments of the Clinton years was the new and near total emphasis on the lot of the middle class .
Not only had America 's poor fallen off the radar screen , but in fact , if they got in the way of the middle class achieving all its bourgeois aspirations and acquiring all its requisite trinkets , then not only would the poor cease to receive additional aid and attention , they would also be cut off from their pathetically minuscule existing forms of relief .
This is the true meaning of the welfare reform bill , signed by Clinton in order to guarantee an election he already had in his pocket .
The middle class was saying that it wanted tax breaks and a balanced budget , which meant something had to give .
There went welfare , and with it the war on poverty .
Just a quick glance at the current political landscape and the figures who populate it gives you a sense of the change that 's transpired .
The center of gravity in American politics has moved considerably to the right .
Once , not so long ago , the Republican Party was dominated by its centrists , and people like Ronald Reagan were viewed as kooks .
It 's worth remembering that in the 1970s Reagan 's presidential aspirations were literally the butt of endless jokes by political comedians .
But the guy went from joke to president to saint , and that says a lot about where we are today .
At this point , there are almost no center - right figures in the Republican Party , at least at the national level .
The movement of the Democratic Party has followed a similar trajectory .
You 'd never know it , of course , by listening to the screaming inanities of regressive lunatics , whether elite or rank - and - file .
Notwithstanding their foaming rants about Clinton or Obama or Reid or Pelosi being socialists , however , the truth is none of these figures are even vaguely liberal by traditional standards .
Compare them to Franklin Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson or even Harry Truman and this is easy to see .
Ditto any comparison of these folks to progressives in other Western democracies .
Watch what they do n't do - whether that is ending an obscene war or legislating universal single - payer healthcare , or standing up for gay rights - and one can instantly appreciate how little these figures are willing to fight for progressive politics , and how lacking in progressivity are the politics for which they are unwilling to fight .
In addition to the proliferation of adherents to truly scary right - wing politics , and the shifting of the political landscape to the right - which may be more properly considered as the mainstreaming of extremism - I think we 've also experienced a decimation in the ranks of the politically courageous , people willing to sacrifice career , reputation or even their lives in order to stand fast against the worst impulses in American politics and the most vicious purveyors of those ideas and attitudes .
It 's not so much that these people were progressives and now they 're not as it is that they were Americans with integrity , outliers filled with enough decency and courage to stand against the collection of scary monster outliers of the regressive right .
Yes , there was Joseph McCarthy .
But there was also Joseph Welch .
Yes , there was Father Coughlin .
But there was also Edward R. Murrow .
Yes , there was Richard Nixon .
But there was also George McGovern .
Those white knights of integrity seem all but disappeared today .
I can remember my astonishment during the Bush versus Gore debacle of 2000 that there was n't one single elder statesman of American politics - some Jerry Ford - like figure - who stood up and said " I 'm sorry , but this is wrong " .
Who risked the alienation of his party and peers by making the case that it's far less important who wins the vote than it is that the vote be legitimately won .
I remember during the Clinton fiasco - when a sitting president the United States was being impeached for lying about a blow job , when he was almost hounded out of office by members of Congress who literally were stalking boy interns or trolling airport men's rooms for sex , having serial affairs and dumping their wives for their paramours as their spouses lay in the hospital cancer ward on their recovery bed , or fathering children in second families no one knew about - I remember thinking who will call an end to this madness which has infected the American body politic ?
But nobody of stature did .
Nor did they , of course , in the worst instance of all , as a handful of psychopaths invented a couple of absurd pretexts and marched the country off into a completely unnecessary war in Iraq , which has now claimed perhaps a million lives .
How is it that nobody of standing had the courage to stand up and say to the American public , " Come to your senses , this is wrong , the administration is lying to you , think for yourself ! " ?
So much is wrong in American politics today - genuinely more so , I think , than in the past .
So many are culpable .
Congress is more worthless than ever , and that 's really saying something .
The Democratic Party has thrilled the biology community by creating a whole new class of invertebrates , utterly worthless in office , and wholly undeserving of the title of opposition party when not .
The mass media has become the most despicable collection of whores to power imaginable .
Whatever sense there once was - from the original notions of the Founders up through the era of Cronkite - of the media serving the public interest as critical watchdogs over government has long since transmogrified into just another profit center on corporate balance sheets .
But even more fundamentally , something has changed at the level of political culture .
Something is broken at the level of human decency .
The toxic combination of rampant American individualism , right - wing successes in framing public attitudes in all the sickest and most corrosive ways , a litany of false prophets preaching bogus religious salvation through even more deceitful notions of political morality , and the gravitational pull from the declining trajectory of an empire that has most assuredly now passed its sell - by date - all of this has conspired to produce a monstrous polity lurching about the global landscape without a heart or a conscience , and eating itself from within for the very same reasons .
Worse still , as time marches on , fewer and fewer will remain who remember that it was n't forever thus .
That once there were lines that were not crossed in American politics .
That there were notions of decency that transcended partisanship and ideology .
That those who left flesh overseas fighting the country 's wars and brought home Purple Hearts instead were not vitiated during political campaigns as allies of America 's adversaries , and especially not by cowards who somehow managed to skip their generation 's major national security engagement .
That there were political crimes that simply required courageous responses , regardless of the sacrifices involved .
That political leaders could and should sacrifice their positions and perhaps even their careers in order to avoid the taint of association with morally repugnant policies .
That even troubadours had a responsibility to sing great anthems in protest against injustice , rather than cashing out and selling panties and bras for Victoria 's Secret .
That there was once a thing known as true patriotism , elevating the public interest over everything else .
And , yes , even over personal profit .

Drug treatment options for depression can take weeks for the beneficial effects to emerge , which is clearly inadequate for those at immediate risk of suicide .
However , intravenous ( IV ) ketamine , a drug previously used as an anesthetic , has shown rapid antidepressant effects in early trials .
Researchers have now explored ketamine ’s effects on suicidality in patients with treatment - resistant depression , and are publishing their results in the Sept. 1 issue of Biological Psychiatry .
Ketamine acutely reduced suicidal thoughts when patients were assessed 24 hours after a single infusion .
This reduction in suicidality was maintained when patients received repeated doses over the next two weeks .
Corresponding author Rebecca Price commented on these encouraging findings : “ If these findings hold up in larger samples of high - risk suicidal patients , IV ketamine could prove an attractive treatment option in situations where waiting for a conventional antidepressant treatment to take effect might endanger the patient 's life . ”
Since this was a preliminary study in a small group of depressed patients , further research is needed to replicate these results .
However , the findings are promising and could result in improved treatment for suicidal patients in the future .
Against a backdrop of multicoloured pre-fabricated housing blocks , a tanning salon and a travel agent offering last - minute deals to the Baltic coast , Frank Spieth handed out red balloons , pens and advice in equal measure .
The concerns of those who approached his campaign bus in Erfurt , the former communist east of Germany , were primarily local : a woman fighting for compensation from a hospital after contracting MRSA , another seeking a ramp access to her building , a man complaining about the state of windows in the city 's schools , which he said needed replacing even before the fall of the wall 20 years ago .
But in little more than a week , when Germans vote for a new parliament , Spieth and his allies are hoping to make a national impact .
His anti-capitalist , pro-social justice Die Linke is striking a chord with an increasingly disenfranchised electorate , espousing causes – such as inequality , reunification issues and , crucially , the war in Afghanistan – that are finding a receptive audience in both east and west .
" Our voters are representative of millions of Germans who feel cut off from the political process and they could have a significant impact on Germany 's political landscape , " said 62 - year - old Spieth , who left the Social Democratic party ( SPD ) in 2003 after 37 years in protest at its restructuring of the social welfare state .
While Die Linke 's rivals have mercilessly attacked it for its radical wealth redistribution plans and its links to the defunct communist regime , its message is clearly getting through .
" The promises [ of the mainstream parties ] to us about the blossoming landscapes which would follow after unification are mere speech bubbles , " said 68 - year old Erika Seebach , the MRSA sufferer , in Erfurt .
" While some might accuse Die Linke of populism , they get things on to the agenda that really matter . "
Polls gives the party about 14 % , but after huge gains recently made in key regional elections at the end of August , where it won 21 % in the western state of Saarland , Die Linke is being seen as the party that could shake up the political landscape in the 27 September vote .
The policies of bigger parties , including the chancellor Angela Merkel 's CDU and its junior Social Democrat partner , are now seen to be disturbingly similar in comparison .
" Generally there are only a few themes that particularly distinguish most of the parties , " according to Renate Köcher , joint head of the Allensbach Institute for Demoscopy .
" It 's only really Die Linke that stands out , in particular for their critical position regarding the German economy and societal order . "
Spieth embodies the verve and drive of many in Die Linke .
The party , founded just two years ago is , he admits , " a motley crew of democratic socialists , social democrats , communists , Christians , you name it " .
Broadly speaking it consists of disillusioned easterners , former members of the ruling communists , and disaffected members of the centre - left SPD .
Die Linke is promising to redress the rich - poor divide by pumping € 200bn ( £ 178bn ) a year into job creation and financing a gigantic public spending programme , a plan opponents dismiss as unworkable .
Its anti-capitalist stance has raised its profile at a time when expressing such views has become increasingly fashionable , though it has failed to cash in on the economic crisis as growth resumes in Europe 's largest economy .
But it came into its own in the aftermath of a recent Nato air strike , ordered by the German military , in northern Afghanistan .
The attack triggered a fierce debate about pulling German forces out of Afghanistan .
Die Linke is the only party in parliament that is calling for the immediate withdrawal of German troops .
As many as 80 % of people in Germany are against the Afghan mission .
" It 's got people talking about the war , which the other parties had wanted to exclude from the discussion , and that can only be a good thing for us , " said Oskar Lafontaine , a former SPD finance minister and one of Die Linke 's most prominent leaders .
" The majority of people are against this war due to our own appalling experiences in two world wars but if we do n't keep this issue on the agenda , no one will , " he told the Guardian at an anti-war rally at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin .
As he went on stage there were roars of approval as he punched the air and with sweat dripping down his shirt , proclaimed : " We 're proud to be anti-war .
As Willy Brandt said there should never be war on German soil ever again .
That should be the message for now and the future .
" Christoph Hein , a leading German novelist from Leipzig , who as a pacifist said he was a Die Linke supporter , albeit a reluctant one , put the rise in its popularity down to the increase in floating voters .
" The days when people voted for one party are over .
People feel deceived by the other parties , but at least they feel Die Linke speaks their language , and this war issue is a good example of that .
"
If there is one factor holding the party back , it is the claim that it is a home for the " loony left " .
It has been accused of not standing up sufficiently to the crimes committed by the East German regime , even for giving a home to people who have called for the reintroduction of the communist - era secret police , the Stasi , or who have compared the Bundeswehr mission with East German soldiers ' orders to shoot those who tried to cross the border between the GDR and the West .
The Nobel prizewinning writer Günter Grass , a staunch SPD supporter , has given voice to those who believe that Die Linke has not sufficiently distanced itself from the crimes of the communist era .
" Before we could even begin to talk to them they would have to apologise for their persecution of Social Democrats , " he said at a recent rally .
A steady rise in the polls and the party 's inclusion in regional governments are giving it a stamp of acceptability , but its prospects of national government are slim because its putative allies – the SPD and the Greens – say they are unwilling to accept its demands .
" The problem for the SPD is by opening the gates to let Die Linke in , the SPD would help contribute to their social acceptability , " said Manfred Güllner of the Forsa polling institute .
But Petra Pau , one of the first two representatives in the Bundestag of the party when it was in its infancy , insisted Die Linke was not interested in entering government , where its policies would become diluted and wanted to stay in opposition instead where it would have a better chance of enacting change .
" If you look at issues for which I was laughed at when I first put them on the agenda , such as the minimum wage , now they 're part of mainstream debate , " the politician , who is famous for her spiky red hairstyle , told The Guardian .
" Our aim is to strengthen our position first rather than risk betraying our supporters by compromising on issues , " she said .
At the anti-war rally , Ursula Albert , 72 , a retired book keeper who spent most of her life in communist east Germany , stood among rainbow peace flags and banners reading " Make Capitalism History " and " Get out of Afghanistan " .
Die Linke , she said , was the only party that was trying to redress the inequalities in a reunited Germany , such as the fact that her pension is about 15 - 20 % less than that of a pensioner in the west even though costs were on the same level .
" A small group is getting ever richer , child poverty is on the rise .
When Germany was divided it was better , " she said .

Taylor and I signed for our very own two bedroom single - story half - of - a- duplex on Wednesday .
The instant my pen hit the paper there was a brief feeling of weightlessness , dare I say , a sense of relief that sent my brain spiraling giddily up into the atmosphere .
Granted , it was only about five minutes before I got sucked into the jet engines of unemployment , but I am focusing today and the excitement of our finding a place to live .
I waited so long to share the news because I wanted a way to properly introduce you people to the new place .
So I used my video camera to shoot a little something that properly conveys both the physical dimensions of our apartment .
But I never can resist a proper boogie .
Coming straight from Steve Job ’s mouth ( YAY ! HES BACK !) during today ’s Apple Keynote , the rumors have been confirmed .
To compete against the growing Flip video camera market , Apple has added video recording to their new iPod Nanos as well as FM tuning , a Pedometer ( not PEDO – Meter ) , and Voice recording .
Starting today , the 8GB nano will cost $ 150 while the 16GB comes in at $ 180 .

Ray McGovern Warns of ' Two CIAs ' Editor ’s Note : Some years ago , before his death in 1991 , legendary CIA officer Miles Copeland talked cryptically about what he called “ the CIA within the CIA , ” a self - appointed group of intelligence insiders who knew America ’s “ interests ” better than the elected politicians did .
[ See Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
In this guest essay , Brad Friedman of Bradblog.com recounts similar concerns voiced by ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern as he puzzles over the timidity that President Barack Obama and CIA Director Leon Panetta have shown before entrenched CIA insiders .
During my interview last week with 27 - year CIA analyst Ray McGovern on the Mike Malloy Show ( which I 've been guest hosting all this week ) , the man who used to personally deliver the CIA 's Presidential Daily Briefings to George Bush Sr. , among other Presidents , offered an extraordinarily chilling thought --- particularly coming from someone with his background .
Email

In a conversation at the end of the hour ( audio and transcript below ) , as I was trying to pin him down for an opinion on whether or not he felt it was appropriate for CIA Director Leon Panetta to have reportedly attempted to block a lawful investigation into torture and other war crimes committed by the CIA , McGovern alluded to a book about the assassination of John F. Kennedy , and noted he felt it likely that both Panetta and President Obama may have reason to fear certain elements of the CIA .
" Let me just leave you with this thought , " he said , " and that is that I think Panetta , and to a degree President Obama , are afraid --- I never thought I 'd hear myself saying this --- I think they 're afraid of the CIA . "
McGovern went on to note " the stakes are very high here , " in relation to Attorney General Eric Holder 's recently announced investigation of the CIA now under the direction of Panetta .
" His main advisers and his senior staff are liable for prosecution for war crimes .
The War Crimes statute includes very severe penalties , including capital punishment for those who , if under their custody , detainees die .
And we know that at least a hundred have , so this is big stakes here . "
He then recommended James W. Douglass ' new book , JFK and the Unspeakable : Why He Died and Why It Matters .
" He makes a very very persuasive case that it was President Kennedy 's , um , the animosity that built up between him and the CIA after the Bay of Pigs , and the Joint Chiefs of Staff , because he was reaching out to the Russians and so forth and so on .
It 's a very well - researched book and his conclusion is very alarming , " the long - time CIA veteran noted in what turned out to be a chilling end to our interview in which he described " two CIAs . "
One , he says , was created by President Truman to " give him the straight scoop without any fear or favor .
And then its covert action arm , which really does n't believe --- which does n't belong in this agency . "
McGovern referred to that CIA " advisedly " as the President 's " own personal gestapo " which acts without oversight by the Congressional committees once tasked to do so .
" And so if you 're asking why Obama and Panetta are going very very kid - glove - ish with the CIA , I think part of the reason , or the explanation is they 're afraid of these guys because these guys have a whole lot to lose if justice takes its course . "
" So , it 's pretty scary .
Yes , it is , " he concluded .

I hope you can apply your brilliant theory to Jeremiah Wright , and extrapolate why our president did n't budge for 20 years while Mr. Wright 's words enraged countless Chicago black to indiscriminately murder non-blacks .

Balderdash !
Jeremiah Wright rocks !
He 's a great American , and taking his fire out of context just lends itself to haters trying to make hate out of his love .
Obama 's a shithead for abandoning him .

I 'm not certain your allegations about Rev. Wright are accurate , Absurd , but Prof .
Zimbardo 's analysis of the process of dehumanization is not limited by the race , ethnicity or gender of those who engage in hate speech .
Zimbardo's The Lucifer Effect : Understanding How Good People Turn to Evil was based on his findings from the 1971 " Standford Prison Experiment " and 30 years of subsequent research .
Appearing on Democracy Now , Zimbardo explained that he 'd randomly assigned " 24 male college students ... the roles of prison guards and prisoners … ”
Although the experiment was to have lasted two weeks , Zimbardo was forced to cancel it after just six days as the “ guards had become dangerously sadistic and the prisoners were breaking down emotionally . ”
What we wanted to do was [ to ] create [ the ] essential psychology of imprisonment , and that ’s all about power .
Every prison is about power .
Guards have to assume more and more power and domination , and prisoners have to have their power stripped away .
And so that is the ultimate evil of prison .
It ’s about power , dominance , and mastery .
And that is the same thing we found at Abu Ghraib prison .
Note :
If you are going to make an accusation such as " Mr. Wright 's words enraged countless Chicago black to indiscriminately murder non-blacks , " you should provide specifics and a link to the material you claim support it .
From my own research , conducted during the period Rev. Wright was being demonized by the corporate media , it appeared that Wright 's remarks were taken out of context and completely distorted ; that his sermons , when viewed as a whole , were no more inflammatory than those provided by Dr. Martin Luther King .
I have to agree with Agent 99 .
Obama 's willingness to throw Wright under the bus was despicable .

Your last 4 words basically explain it all .
" Christian - fundamentalist world view " Every single hate group to my knowledge is religiously based and there are 100s of them .
As long we have religion on this planet we will be infested with ignorant zealots that hate everything and everybody that does n't conform to their insane world view .

Nietzsche , contrary to popular misconceptions about his philosophical perspective , understood this about people and warned the world , in his book " The Anti-Christ " , that the German character of his time , was susceptible to mass manipulation of the very kind spewed today by the likes of Glen Beck , among others .
Like a crying baby , phony indignation and resentment become tools of people , of mediocre standing , who are essentially cowards and bullies , that would probably commit suicide if not for their ability and position from which to fool people into doing their bidding .
America seems rife with these indignant bastards , but worst still are the huge numbers of listeners , that are willing to agree with them .

Maybe what we really need is a strident progressive voice for a change !
Progressive commentators are too few and too damn nice .
Let 's use the right wing 's techniques !
Would n't it be great to see someone come on television and yell : " Considering the last eight years of destroying America , maybe the Republicans should just shut the hell up !
In fact , throw them in jail as traitors when they open their mouths . "
" Hey , Rush !
Can you stop taking those pills for a second and stop kissing Hitler 's picture ? "
" Hey , Beck , take off that KKK hood for a second . "
If strident sells , let 's go for it !!!

Fox News viewers overwhelmingly misinformed about health care reform proposals .
Last night , NBC News and the Wall Street Journal released a poll showing that “ all the misinformation out there ” about health care reform proposals in Congress is taking root with many Americans .
For instance , 45 percent believe the false claim that legislation includes “ death panels ” while 55 percent believe the false claim that coverage will be extended to illegal immigrants .
MSNBC ’s First Read notes that self - identified viewers of Fox News are disproportionately misinformed .

Tunga is sure he speaks for justice Scalia ( who has no reservations about being passed up for the Chief justice title ) when he says the there is no prohibition within the US Constitution on hate speech .

I would prefer the Second American Revolution to the Second American Civil War , but , either way , that 's the only help for this stuff by now .
Nothing of substance will be fixed voluntarily by any of the perpetrators ... of hate speech ... of our broken government ... the wars of aggression ... the frank fascism being codified by all the breaches of the Constitution , the unconstitutionalizing of our Constitution ... not any of it will be fixed without use of force .
It might not have to be violence .
It could be that the threat of it from sheer numbers would be force enough , but , without being forced , nobody who can do anything about any of this stuff will be moved to actually do it .
That is just so abundantly clear by now .
Better the people come together against the rat bastards causing all this , but if we 're too stupid to fight them , we might as well just fight each other so this shit can be brought to an end .

You have chosen to INVADE TWO RELATIVELY HELPLESS COUNTRIES because your last moron of a president took away " freedom of speech " and caged it up in " free speak zones " .
How many people have died in the last 8 years because the American citizen could n't give a shit about their own " rights " let alone some strangers ' in a strange land .

Jim , that 's bullshit .
Also , Rev.
Wright is not only NOT an example of hate speech , he 's an example of how the media dehumanized someone !
The OPPOSITE of what some above have said !
Contrast the " liberal media " , Rev. Wright vs. Palin 's witchdoctor : we saw NOTHING in the MSM about Palin WITH VIDEO with her witchdoctor pastor , yet we were inundated 24×7 for weeks with Rev. Wright 's ONE SOUNDBITE CLIP " the chickens have come home to roost " .
I looked deep into Rev. Wright , and he's a very smart , intelligent man that YOU could learn something from .
You have actually proven the point of this post , by citing only what the corporate MSM has told you about Rev. Wright .
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP REV .
WRIGHT AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE CORPORATE MSM DEHUMANIZING SOMEONE !!!

Is n't it telling regarding Rev Wright that his honorable military service to this country is ignored .
That he once served on the medical team that operated on the then President of the United States Lyndon Baines Johnson .
Rev .
Wright is an unapologetic truth teller who has been marginalized and lied about because he dare speak his mind and sincerely reflect his observations of the country he served honorably .
Rev.
Wright put his ass on the line ... he earned the right to speak as he sees fit .
This country abandoned him because it did n't like what he said .
Hypocrites ... right wingers who have n't served a day or done anything that did n't directly benefit them personally have NO RIGHT to trot out and smear Rev. Wright ...

Why do n't you do a piece on how Israel has National Health Care and they LOVE IT !!!
On TV , we hear Israel this , Israel that , everything Israel ... EXCEPT THAT THEY HAVE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE !!!
Health care in Israel is both universal and compulsory , and is administered by a small number of organizations with funding from the government .
All Israeli citizens are entitled to the same Uniform Benefits Package , regardless of which organization they are a member of , and treatment under this package is funded for all citizens regardless of their financial means .

The comment by the individual who appropriately describes himself as " Absurd " typifies the objectification of the " other " once that other , in this case , Rev. Wright , has been vilified by means of a corporate media propaganda campaign .
Absurd wrote : " our president did n't budge for 20 years while Mr. Wright 's words enraged countless Chicago black to indiscriminately murder non-blacks . "
Unlike my article , which cited Glenn Beck 's precise words as an example of dehumanized hate speech , Absurd fails to list any of Wright 's actual remarks .
More importantly , where my article cited detailed studies linking the process of dehumanization to both the holocaust and atrocities committed against African Americans in the Jim Crow South , Absurd does not reference a single incident in which a white person was allegedly killed in Chicago as the result of Wright 's words .
As I noted in comment # 3 , the corporate media vilified Wright by taking his words out of context --- repeating them over - and - over again so as to drive home the false connotation .
For example , " Not God bless America , God damn America ! "
These were used to suggest that Wright was calling on God to damn America --- that Wright " hated " America .
When one listens to the entire sermon , however , it becomes readily apparent that Wright was saying no such thing .
Instead , what Wright did was to question why anyone would think that God would bless us when we commit atrocities in furtherance of imperial conquest ?
As I also pointed out , Wright 's assessment was not all that different from that of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. who said , in his Apr. 1 , 1967 " Beyond Vietnam " speech :
The war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American spirit ...
I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution , we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values .
We must rapidly begin ... the shift from a thing - oriented society to a person - oriented society .
When machines and computers , profit motives and property rights , are considered more important than people , the giant triplets of racism , extreme materialism , and militarism are incapable of being conquered ....
A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast between poverty and wealth .
With righteous indignation , it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia , Africa , and South America , only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries , and say , ' This is not just . '
It will look to our alliance with the landed gentry of South America and say , ' This is not just . '
The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just .

" History 's most blatant example , the “ final solution , ” was not the product of some inherent psychological deficiency in the German people .
To the contrary , Zimbardo informs us , it was the product of a deliberate campaign carried out in newspapers , on radio , in required texts of school children , and even in comic books , which “ sought to create the perception of Jews as a sub - human race that was a threat to the national state . ”
Dehumanization is by no means unique to Nazi Germany .
To the contrary , Zimbardo observes , citing Sam Keen ’s analysis of the “ hostile imagination ” in Faces of the Enemy , it “ is created by virtually every nation ’s propaganda on its path to war … . ” "
What Zimbardo says can actually be seen today in Israel were the once " dehumanized Jew " has become the the perpetrator of " dehumanizing " the Palestinians .
As he says " With public fear notched up and enemy threat imminent , reasonable people act irrationally , independent people act in mindless conformity , and peaceful people act as warriors . "

The guest minister was a Christian .
He comes from a country where he has to compete with animist religions .
Because of that , he knows fully well that witchcraft vis-a - vis witch doctors are prevalent in his nation .
That is the background he is coming from .
And that is why he prayed that Gov. Palin would be kept safe from any witchcraft .

I generally try to steer clear of the emotional component of a dialogue that at times has degenerated into name calling .
But I must say that the disgust Nunyabiz has expressed toward the Fox Propaganda Network is quite understandable .
If you have never seen it , Damail , I would highly recommend that you obtain and watch Outfoxed : Rupert Murdoch 's War on Journalism .
Fox served as a primary network for spreading the propaganda of the Bush / Cheney cabal .
There were no WMD .
There were no links between Saddam Hussein and either al Qaeda .
( Cheney had to order extensive water boarding to manufacture a link ) .
Iraq , devastated by Gulf War I and 13 years of UN sanctions that resulted in the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five , was not a threat to its neighbors , let alone the nation with the most powerful military arsenal ever assembled .
Yet , those whose primary source was Fox News believed otherwise .
The lies spread on Fox , often picked up and repeated on other corporate networks , facilitated an unprovoked imperial conquest that has cost much more than the $ 3 trillion estimated by Joseph Stiglitz , a nobel prize winning economist .
The invasion amounted to a death sentence for more than 4,000 working class Americans serving in the U.S. military .
For Iraqis , the cost has been much higher --- more than one million dead ; 2 million internally displaced and another million in exile .
The lies told on Fox , and on other networks , have had deadly consequences .
And , if we are truly a nation of laws , then those who deliberately spread them should be held accountable for the consequences of their mendacity .

Damail -- I see that yours is a closed mind --- either because you are personally dishonest , willfully ignorant or , in the words of David Brock , who had at one time thought as you do --- " blinded by the right . "
I tried to provide you a knowledge base , directing you , for example , to Outfoxed : Rupert Murdoch 's War on Journalism which reveals not just that Fox lies but precisely how Fox lies .
You obviously did n't bother to watch it .
Your statement " Fox News does not lie " has absolutely no meaning because you fail to cite so much as a single source to rebut the extensive documentation in which the anchors of Fox , in the DVD , were caught in one lie after another .
The DVD shows how Fox anchors are fed a daily talking point memo by Fox 's upper management and instructed to stay on message --- which is the essence of propaganda .
Do you really believe that simply by saying " Fox does n't lie " over - and - over again that will make it true ?
You fail to explain why a 2004 poll conducted by Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting revealed that 80 % of Fox viewers believed one of the Bush regime 's pre-Iraq war lies --- WMD ; links to al Qaeda ; links to 9/11 --- as compared to only 23 % on PBS .
That 's a 57 % point gap between the reality - based , better informed PBS audience and the uninformed , misled audience at Fox .
Either these dramatic poll differences are explained by " Fox lies " or the results reflect that Fox viewers are more gullible than PBS viewers .
Take your pick .
( Hmmm , perhaps a combination of the two . )
I could cite extensive research material , including statistical analysis , which demonstrate that both the 2000 and 2004 elections were stolen .
But , like the Fox News issue , I know you 'd never read them .
Yours is the certainty of the true believer --- impervious to a fact - based reality .
So , in your case , I will no longer try .

Thirty minute news on the television are limited to keeping your eyes on the screen .
Lets be honest , media is commercial media that requires income streams .
Perhaps the Internet could provide a more honest approach since the visitors who would come to read honest and fact - based news might also click on advertisements ...

With the former , at least we know without having to infiltrate and create " sides . "
Whether Beck is honest or simply making content , I do n't know .
However , I do know many people believe what they see and hear on television .
The problem is that what is being said and played on television is not always honest or fact - based .
We see " rubble " in Iraq and Palestine on television .
Would you be surprised to realize they have subdivisions like we do where there is little / no violence ?
Why not see that on television ?

You can't " sell " that content to the public .

Re-read that .
People like Beck or others who generalize say something about themselves and not anything about the Muslims or Islam .
People have called me " stupid , " but I have yet to be struck suddenly upon their speaking with an IQ under 50 ...
I bet you have n't either .
Teach people that people yelling on a soapbox have the right to so yell but that what is yelled must be analyzed critically rather than just accepted .
Whether such speech is legal or not will not stop the thought processes .
When legal , such speech can be traced and studied so that we can analyze how to provide information that might teach people tolerance and understanding .

Israeli newspapers this summer are filled with angry articles about the push for an international boycott of Israel .
Films have been withdrawn from Israeli film festivals , Leonard Cohen is under fire around the world for his decision to perform in Tel Aviv , and Oxfam has severed ties with a celebrity spokesperson , a British actress who also endorses cosmetics produced in the occupied territories .
Clearly , the campaign to use the kind of tactics that helped put an end to the practice of apartheid in South Africa is gaining many followers around the world .
Not surprisingly , many Israelis -- even peaceniks -- are n’t signing on .
A global boycott ca n’t help but contain echoes of anti-Semitism .
It also brings up questions of a double standard ( why not boycott China for its egregious violations of human rights ? ) and the seemingly contradictory position of approving a boycott of one ’s own nation .
It is indeed not a simple matter for me as an Israeli citizen to call on foreign governments , regional authorities , international social movements , faith - based organizations , unions and citizens to suspend cooperation with Israel .
But today , as I watch my two boys playing in the yard , I am convinced that it is the only way that Israel can be saved from itself .
I say this because Israel has reached a historic crossroads , and times of crisis call for dramatic measures .
I say this as a Jew who has chosen to raise his children in Israel , who has been a member of the Israeli peace camp for almost 30 years and who is deeply anxious about the country ’s future .

The most accurate way to describe Israel today is as an apartheid state .
For more than 42 years , Israel has controlled the land between the Jordan Valley and the Mediterranean Sea .
Within this region about 6 million Jews and close to 5 million Palestinians reside .
Out of this population , 3.5 million Palestinians and almost half a million Jews live in the areas Israel occupied in 1967 , and yet while these two groups live in the same area , they are subjected to totally different legal systems .
The Palestinians are stateless and lack many of the most basic human rights .
By sharp contrast , all Jews -- whether they live in the occupied territories or in Israel -- are citizens of the state of Israel .
The question that keeps me up at night , both as a parent and as a citizen , is how to ensure that my two children as well as the children of my Palestinian neighbors do not grow up in an apartheid regime .
There are only two moral ways of achieving this goal .
The first is the one - state solution : offering citizenship to all Palestinians and thus establishing a bi-national democracy within the entire area controlled by Israel .
Given the demographics , this would amount to the demise of Israel as a Jewish state ; for most Israeli Jews , it is anathema .

The second means of ending our apartheid is through the two - state solution , which entails Israel ’s withdrawal to the pre-1967 borders ( with possible one - for - one land swaps ) , the division of Jerusalem , and a recognition of the Palestinian right of return with the stipulation that only a limited number of the 4.5 million Palestinian refugees would be allowed to return to Israel , while the rest can return to the new Palestinian state .
Geographically , the one - state solution appears much more feasible because Jews and Palestinians are already totally enmeshed ; indeed , “ on the ground , ” the one - state solution ( in an apartheid manifestation ) is a reality .
Ideologically , the two - state solution is more realistic because fewer than 1 % of Jews and only a minority of Palestinians support binationalism .
For now , despite the concrete difficulties , it makes more sense to alter the geographic realities than the ideological ones .
If at some future date the two peoples decide to share a state , they can do so , but currently this is not something they want .

So if the two - state solution is the way to stop the apartheid state , then how does one achieve this goal ?
I am convinced that outside pressure is the only answer .
Over the last three decades , Jewish settlers in the occupied territories have dramatically increased their numbers .
The myth of the united Jerusalem has led to the creation of an apartheid city where Palestinians are n’t citizens and lack basic services .
The Israeli peace camp has gradually dwindled so that today it is almost nonexistent , and Israeli politics are moving more and more to the extreme right .
It is therefore clear to me that the only way to counter the apartheid trend in Israel is through massive international pressure .
The words and condemnations from the Obama administration and the European Union have yielded no results , not even a settlement freeze , let alone a decision to withdraw from the occupied territories .
I consequently have decided to support the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement that was launched by Palestinian activists in July 2005 and has since garnered widespread support around the globe .
The objective is to ensure that Israel respects its obligations under international law and that Palestinians are granted the right to self - determination .

In Bilbao , Spain , in 2008 , a coalition of organizations from all over the world formulated the 10 - point Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions campaign meant to pressure Israel in a “ gradual , sustainable manner that is sensitive to context and capacity . ”
For example , the effort begins with sanctions on and divestment from Israeli firms operating in the occupied territories , followed by actions against those that help sustain and reinforce the occupation in a visible manner .
Along similar lines , artists who come to Israel in order to draw attention to the occupation are welcome , while those who just want to perform are not .
Nothing else has worked .
Putting massive international pressure on Israel is the only way to guarantee that the next generation of Israelis and Palestinians -- my two boys included -- does not grow up in an apartheid regime .
BERLIN --
Teeth clenched , Usain Bolt grimaced as he churned toward the finish line , hoping to coax a fraction more out of his 6 - foot - 5 frame .
The big , yellow numbers flashing another world record time , told the Jamaican sprinter he had gotten what he wanted out of the 200 meters Thursday at the world championships .
Beyond the mark of 19.19 seconds , though , was something else -- the fact that he is altering his sport .
For the second straight race -- five , if his record - breaking runs at the Beijing Olympics are counted -- Bolt 's biggest competitor was the clock .
He bettered his old world record by a whopping .11 seconds , the same margin he shaved off the 100 four days earlier , when he finished in 9.58 .
Usain Bolt broke his own record in the 200 meters by 0.11 seconds on Thursday .

" I 'm on my way to being a legend , " Bolt said , without a trace of arrogance .
No debate there .
He is erasing chunks of time from records that normally take years to break .
He is beating the so - called competition by body lengths -- this time , Alonso Edward of Panama was 0.62 seconds behind -- in a sport often decided by photo finishes .
" He 's a gift to this earth , " said American sprinter Shawn Crawford , who finished fourth .
" He 's a blessing to the track game .
...
I 'm just waiting for the lights to flash ' game over , ' ' cause I felt like I was in a video game . "
Bolt can't be caught , even when he gives away tips .
Just before the start of the race , Bolt told good friend Wallace Spearmon to stay close to him on the curve and follow him home .
The American tried .
" Even if I run the best turn of my life , I 'm still going to be behind , " said Spearmon , who finished with the bronze .
" I knew what was in store for the race .
I expected it to be at least that fast . "
When he saw his record time , Bolt pointed at the display , then stuck out his tongue in his best Michael Jordan impersonation .
" Even us in the field , we think there is going to be something phenomenal from him , " Crawford said .
Bolt feeds off the energy from the crowd .
The louder they get , the more playful he becomes .
He showed up at the start wearing a T - shirt with a new take on President John F. Kennedy 's famous Cold War quote " Ich bin ein Berliner . "
This time , the slogan said , " Ich bin ein Berlino , " a reference to the bear mascot of the championships .
The audience ate it up , along with Bolt 's hand gestures and other assorted antics .
Then it was time to go to work in his yam - colored Pumas .
He jetted out of the blocks , turned the corner and it was over .
No one was going to catch him once he reached the straightaway .
" I was surprised with myself that I did so well , " Bolt said .
After that , came his favorite part -- the celebration .
He involved just about everyone as he made his way around the track , stopping to sign autographs for kids , mugging for pictures and posing with Berlino , who joined Bolt in the sprinter 's signature bow - and - arrow stance .
Midway around the track , Bolt took off his shoes and carried them .
" I was so tight , I could n't even really jog .
I was just tired , " said Bolt , who celebrates his 23rd birthday Friday .
So how low can Bolt go ?
Even he has no clue .
" I keep saying anything 's possible as long as you put your mind to it , " he said .
Former sprint star Michael Johnson , whose record of 19.32 stood for 12 years before Bolt broke it last year , believes the 19 - second barrier might be next .
" He could , " Johnson said .
" He 's very tall and has an extremely long stride .
He 's not the only person in the world that 's 6 - foot - 5 , he 's just the only one that 's 6 - 5 and that fast . "
Before the race , Johnson said he did n't think Bolt would break the mark .
Not today .
Not with his top rival , Tyson Gay , on the sideline with a groin injury .
But he also threw in a qualifier .
" Anytime Usain Bolt steps on the track , a world record is possible , " Johnson said .
In other finals :
• Trey Hardee won the decathlon , edging Leonel Suarez of Cuba .
He joins Americans Dan O'Brien , Tom Pappas and Bryan Clay as decathlon winners at world championships .
• Lashinda Demus of the U.S. captured the silver in the 400 hurdles .
• Americans Terrence Trammell and David Payne took advantage of Dayron Robles ' absence in the 110 hurdles finals to finish second and third , respectively .
Robles , the Olympic champion from Cuba , hurt his hamstring in the semifinal round .
• Blanka Vlasic of Croatia defended her title in the high jump .
But the stage belonged to Bolt , and that 's where he shines .
For a warmup act , he comically threw a roundhouse punch at Spearmon and hammed it up for the camera .
For the performance , he blistered the field .
For the finale , he broke another world record .
Not bad theater .
" Insane Bolt , " Spearmon said .
" That 's what we call him . "
Bolt overheard that remark .
" Yo , Spearmon , " Bolt yelled from across the room .
" Do n't call me insane , man .
I heard you called me insane .
What 's up with that ? "
As a way to describe how Bolt is tearing up the track , there may be no better word .
Bernard Madoff walks back to his apartment in New York in this December 17 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton / Files
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - California ’s attorney - general sued Los Angeles money manager Stanley Chais on Tuesday , accusing the celebrity fund manager of funneling money into Bernard Madoff ’s $ 65 billion Ponzi scheme .
California Attorney General Jerry Brown filed a securities fraud lawsuit against Beverly Hills investment adviser Chais , accusing him of channeling hundreds of millions of dollars over about three decades into Madoff ’s fraudulent funds .
The lawsuit comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had also filed suit against Chais , known for handling investments for Hollywood ’s elite -- including film director Steven Spielberg .
Chais and his lawyers were not available for comment on Tuesday .
His attorneys said in June that Chais too was a victim of Madoff ’s fraud .
But Brown ’s office accused Chais -- which it described as a middleman for Madoff -- of actively disguising his link with the disgraced asset manager .
Chais made more than $ 270 million in fees , charged 25 percent fees on profits and claimed to make 20 percent to 25 percent returns on investments , Brown ’s office said .
The lawsuit seeks at least $ 25 million in civil penalties and an injunction against Chais .
In May , the U.S. bankruptcy court trustee handling the liquidation of Madoff ’s investment firm also sued Chais and members of his family for the return of $ 1 billion of investors ’ funds .
Allegations include that white phosophorus was used " for fun "
A group of Israeli soldiers who took part in the Cast Lead operation in Gaza in January have published anonymous testimonies describing a range of abuses during the conflict .
The activist group which gathered them , Breaking the Silence , says they stemmed from Israeli policy and rules and engagement , not just mistakes or individual soldiers failing to follow orders .
The Israeli Defence Forces ( IDF ) says it is not able to respond to the allegations in the report , as the testimonies are anonymous , without detailed locations , units , times and dates .
It says it investigates alleged abuses wherever specific detail is given , and that " dozens " of investigations are currently under way , some involving military police .
It says it has concluded from five internal investigations already that troops did not break international law during the conflict .
International humanitarian law specifies that military action must distinguish between combatants and civilians ; that force used must be proportionate to the threat ; and that civilian property should not be targeted unless it is a military necessity .
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
Several testimonies describe rules of engagement which were either unclear , or encouraged soldiers to prioritise protecting their own lives over determining whether a person in the vicinity was a civilian .
DIFFERENT DEATH TOLLS
Palestinians killed during Israeli military offensive in Gaza , 27 Dec to 18 Jan - Palestinian claims followed by Israelis claims : Total dead : 1,434 / 1,166 Fighters : 235 / 710-870 Non-combatants : 906 / 295-460 Women : 121 / 49 Children under 16 : 288 / 89 Sources : Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and Israeli Defence Intelligence Research Dept Testimony 51 : " We were told soldiers were to be secured by fire - power .
The soldiers were made to understand that their lives were the most important , and that there was no way our soldiers would get killed for the sake of leaving civilians the benefit of the doubt People were not instructed to shoot at everyone they see but they were told that from a certain distance when they approach a house , no matter who it is - even an old woman - take them down . "
Israeli view :
The Israeli military has said repeatedly that it goes to great lengths , even risking the success of operations - for example by giving warnings prior to strikes or aborting air strikes at the last moment - to distinguish between civilians and combatants .
A spokeswoman said she knew of no military in the world that would reveal its rules of engagement , but said 75 % of those killed in the Gaza operation were Hamas .
Palestinian view : The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights says nearly two - thirds of the dead were non-combatants .
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT - ROOFS , CELLULAR TELEPHONES , NIGHT TIME
The heavy losses in Gaza included January included many civilians
Some accounts suggest soldiers were led to view anyone talking on a mobile phone , present on a roof , or moving at night , as a target .
Testimony 49 : " Among other things , he strictly forbade us to climb up to roofs .
He explained in fact that the air force has the ' go ahead ' to fire at anyone seen on a roof . "
Testimony 41 : " You can't identify too much at night and anything that moves you engage in order not to take risks .
It was not defined this way officially , but it was obvious .
Any movement on the ground at night was doomed . "
Testimonies 13 and 14 : These describe an incident where an old man carrying a torch at night , walking towards an Israeli - held building , approached from about 150 metres - and was allowed to approach to 25 metres with no deterrent fire , before he was shot dead .
Testimony 14 : " Everyone is shooting and shooting and the guy 's screaming .
The commander comes downstairs , glowing .
' Here 's an opener for tonight ' .
He was asked why he would n't confirm deterrent fire .
He said , " It 's night time and this is a terrorist . "
Israel 's position : See above .
HUMAN SHIELDS
Some testimonies described the use of Palestinian civilians as human shields , for example by making neighbours enter suspect houses ahead of troops .
The use of human shields is prohibited under article 51.7 of the Geneva Conventions .
Testimony 1 [ a soldier describing what he had heard from a commander ] : " To every house we close in on , we send the neighbour in , ' the Johnnie ' Sometimes the force would enter while placing rifle barrels on a civilian 's shoulder , advancing into a house and using him as a human shield .
Commanders said these were the instructions and we had to do it " Israeli position :
The military says it does not use human shields from the Palestinian population and will investigate any specific evidence of such incidents .
BUILDING DEMOLITIONS
Many of the testimonies say large swathes of buildings were demolished because of concerns that they may be booby trapped , contain weapons or conceal tunnels .
Some soldiers raise concerns about the scale of the destruction : Testimony 2 : " Part of the concept of razing was what the Israeli army calls ' the day after ' consideration .
Obviously this campaign would end at some point
The question was in what condition we 'd leave the area , whether more exposed , a state that would afford us better firing and observation conditions , and far greater control .
This was the principle behind all that razing - namely razing for our benefit .
Testimony 52 : " Most of the destruction that went on there was not necessary . "
Israeli position :
The military has said it only damaged buildings if they were being used by Hamas , or because there was a specific military need to do so .
AGGRESSIVE ATTITUDE
A number of the testimonies alleged that some soldiers were eager to kill , or even took pleasure in doing so .
Testimony 43 : " One guy said he just could n't finish this operation without killing someone [ describes the shooting of a man " apparently some sort of lookout " ]
I can definitely say he was not armed .
I can definitely say the soldier regarded this as some children 's game and was delighted and laughing after this .
I think that a normal person , even having killed an armed terrorist , would not be amused . "
Testimony 50 : " The atmosphere was not one of fear but rather people too eager to shoot other people . "
Israeli position :
The Israeli military says it has strict practices of conduct and soldiers are disciplined for abuses .
VANDALISM OF PALESTINIAN PROPERTY
Some Palestinians returned home to find offensive graffiti Several testimonies report the destruction of Palestinian property - often within homes that the Israeli soldiers had taken over .
Many photographs of offensive graffiti on Palestinian walls were published in the wake of the conflict .
Some soldiers said water tanks were targeted , despite the fact that many Palestinians were without running water .
Testimony 39 : " The guys would simply break stuff .
Some were out to destroy and trash the whole time .
They drew a disgusting drawing on the wall .
They threw out sofas .
They took down a picture from the wall just to shatter it . "
Testimony 52 :
Q : Was there boredom at any point during these two weeks ?
A : Much boredom .
Q : So what does one do to relieve this boredom ?
A : I told you , fire at water tanks , I do n't know , out of boredom .
When there 's nothing else to shoot at , you fire at water tanks . "
Israeli position :
The military says its troops are not permitted to vandalise Palestinian property and some such cases are among the current investigations .
There have also been accounts of Israeli troops exercising care in Palestinian homes - even being told to fold up blankets they had used as they left .
WHITE PHOSPHORUS
White phosphorus causes very severe burns .
Amnesty International says it is inherently indiscriminate and its use in urban areas was a war crime .
Testimony 8 :
Q : Why fire phosphorus ?
A : Because it 's fun .
Cool I do n't know what it 's used for I do n't understand what it 's even doing in our supplies if we 're not supposed to use such ammo .
It 's ridiculous .
Testimony 11 : " There was an area of about 200 - 300 square meters of glazed sand ....
We understood this resulted from white phosphorus , and it was upsetting in training you learn that white phosphorus is not used , and you 're taught that it 's not humane .
You watch films and see what it does to people who are hit , and you say , ' There , we 're doing it too . '
That 's not what I expected to see .
Until that moment I had thought I belonged to the most humane army in the world . "
Israeli position :
The Israeli military initially denied white phosphorous was used .
It later admitted it had been , but said it had not breached international law , saying the use of shells using the chemical as a smokescreen rather than an incendiary weapon was lawful .
RELIGIOUS RHETORIC
A number of soldiers said they were uncomfortable with the use of religious rhetoric by rabbis given access to troops during the operation .
Testimony 15 [ describing a talk by a military rabbi ] : " Lots of pathos , the kind of religious discourse I 'm a bit familiar with : war of choice , holy war - differing rules .
He spoke less in religious terminology and was much more into militant faith .
He aimed at inspiring the men with courage , cruelty , aggressiveness , expressions such as ' no pity , God protects you , everything you do is sanctified ' .
The gist of these statements was perhaps to bring things into agreement with religion , with God and whoever this man was supposed to represent , that everything or nearly everything is permissible .
" Israeli position :
An Israeli army spokeswoman said the military rabbinate unit exists to give religious Jewish soldiers advice on issues such as kosher food and Jewish holidays .
She said there were a " few isolated incidents " during the Cast Leader operation , during which rabbis from the unit distributed flyers [ these contained similar messages to those described ] .
" They do not represent the IDF spirit , " the spokeswoman said , adding that the rabbis in question were " disciplined " .

When it comes my personal finances , I like to stay informed , so imagine my dismay when PayPal quietly tacked on fees for a service I 'd previously enjoyed for free .
As a writer , a significant chunk of my earnings come through PayPal .
For all parties involved , it 's faster and more convenient than sending a check .
I hold a personal account , rather than a premium one , which means I previously did n't have to pay any fees as long as the money was transferred directly from another PayPal user 's account balance .
But when money started rolling in last month , I noticed that a fraction of it ( 2.9 percent , plus 30 cents ) was n't making the jump from my employers ' accounts to my own .
In June , PayPal had started charging for payments classified as " Goods " or " Services , " even if you have a personal account .
It 's possible to send money for free as a personal transfer , but this is only intended for friends and family .
As I explained to Charlotte Hill , PayPal 's PR manager , the fees themselves do n't really bother me .
PayPal can run its business as it pleases , and I have every right to take my business elsewhere .
What 's really infuriating is that there was no warning about the new fees , and no notification once they were instated .
Hill protested .
An e-mail did go out , she said , and there were news articles and a post on PayPal 's official blog .
Well , not really .
Coinciding with the new fees , PayPal started allowing people with premium accounts to make personal transfers for free .
That 's great for users who do a lot of business on eBay , for instance , because they no longer have to pay for transfers to friends and family .
Thing is , that 's all PayPal talked about when the changes took place .
The news articles Hill cites make no mention of new fees .
I did get an e-mail along the lines of what Hill showed me , but it says nothing about changes to the fee structure for the sale of goods and services .
If you want real confirmation that the fees changed in early June , you 'll have to look for grumblings on random Internet forums .
( Of course , this is nothing compared to some of the previous controversies PayPal has stirred up among customers . )
" We did n't want to make a huge formal communication out of this pricing change , because we were n't really adding any fees , and we were hoping it would be a more useful experience for people , " Hill said .
Maybe , but in any situation where you 're taking more money from customers - even if it's a small amount - a formal communication is what they deserve .
Otherwise , you 're just being underhanded .
This guy * who gave a presentation with Patrick Cauldwell yesterday revealed his desktop during the presentation .
Here 's what it looked like :
After the presentation , I ribbed him about his desktop .
You have a few square millimeters of desktop left uncovered , I said .
Clearly you have your work cut out for you .
He said he considers the desktop dead space if it does n't have something on it .
I think his exact words were " make the desktop work for you " .
That 's a unique perspective .
It 's more of a portal philosophy .
Fill the desktop to the brim with tons of stuff that 's relevant to you , so it 's always at your fingertips .
This made me stop and think a bit .
The desktop is usually dead space , that 's true .
And dead speace is never useful .
But it 's not a destination , either .
My goal is to never see the desktop .
I should always have the task I 'm working on front and center , not the desktop .
If I need something , I do n't want to be forced to press Windows - D to context switch and reveal some links or files sitting on my desktop .
That interrupts my task and my flow .
I 'd rather perform some kind of popup ad - hoc search -- or better yet , use a hotkey -- to get directly to what I want .
The last thing I want is for my desktop to look like the Yahoo home page .
That said , I realize there 's no right answer .
Some people strive for blank , zen - like desktops , and some people fill their desktop with as many icons , gadgets , and gewgaws as they can possibly jam in there .
It 's a religious debate , and people get cranky when someone puts peanut butter in their chocolate .
But I still maintain that it 's unhealthy to turn the desktop into an artificial destination .
It 's like the Las Vegas strip ; no matter how many zany attractions they add , eventually visitors have to come to terms with the fact that they 've arbitrarily chosen to build those attractions in the middle of a vast , inhospitable desert .
* I think his name was gretelman .. something ..
