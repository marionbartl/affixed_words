At least 200 students are thought to have crammed into a common room at Arundel House , close to Coventry University 's main campus , ignoring social distancing guidelines and the rule of six .
Some revellers could be heard screaming , while a group of male students clambered on top of a ping pong table as they sang along to the thumping music .
The accommodation block is just a two minute walk from campus and is also close to the town centre .
A spokesman said Coventry University was aware of the incident and said any students found to be in breach of the university 's code of conduct could face disciplinary proceedings .
An investigation is underway to find the organisers of the party , with police shutting down communal areas in the accommodation blocks and beefing up security in light of last night 's gathering .
The footage emerged despite coronavirus causing havoc at universities across the country .
Up to 4,000 students across Britain are now self - isolating for a fortnight after more than 500 cases of Covid - 19 were confirmed across at least 32 universities .
There have been 5 diagnosed cases of Covid - 19 at Coventry but the students have not been asked to self - isolate or go into a local lockdown at this stage .
Ende voriger Woche hat Palm begonnen , das Betriebssystem webOS 1.4.1 an die bisher von O2 verkauften Palm Pres auszuliefern .
Mit dieser Version startet der Verkauf kommerzieller Anwendungsprogramme über den App Catalog .
Dazu zählen etwa der Twitter - Client Tweed oder die Spiele Guitar Hero 5 und Real Football 2010 .
Aktuell sind nun insgesamt 641 Apps erhältlich .
Zugleich bietet webOS nun einen mobilen WLAN - Access - Point an , der über den App Catalog kostenlos installiert werden kann .
Mit Hilfe dieser Software lassen sich bis zu fünf Endgeräte wie Laptops oder iPods / iPads per WLAN mit dem Palm Pre verbinden , der die zu übertragenden Daten per UMTS übermittelt .
Laut O2 lassen sich die bereits bestehenden Datentarife weiterverwenden , und zwar ohne den von Konkurrenten verlangten Aufschlag für " Tethering " .
Wer sein Inklusiv - Volumen aufgebraucht hat , wird allerdings heruntergebremst .
Bild 1 von 4 Palm Pre als mobiler WLAN Access Point ( 4 Bilder ) Ab webOS 1.4.1 lässt sich die Anwendung " Palm mobile hotspot " aus dem App Catalog installieren .
( Bild : Volker Weber )
Die App , die den Access Point bereitstellt , firmiert unter dem Namen Palm mobile hotspot .
Die Installation ist denkbar einfach .
Der Nutzer wählt eine SSID für das WLAN , eine WPA / WPA2 Passphrase und startet das WLAN .
In diesem Augenblick schaltet der Pre von " WLAN - Client " auf " Access Point " um .
Nun können sich bis zu fünf Geräte mit dem Netz verbinden .
Aktuell angeschlossene Geräte werden dabei auf dem Pre angezeigt .
Für Nokia - Smartphones gibt es eine vergleichbare Software Joikuspot , die in der Premium - Version lediglich ein Ad- Hoc - Netzwerk mit der unsicheren WEP - Verschlüsselung anbietet .
Auf diesen Modus verzichtet Palm konsequenterweise .
Will man das WLAN für alle öffnen , dann kann man auf die WPA - Verschlüsselung verzichten .

The user interface on the JooJoo can best be described as a Monet – very attractive from afar , but up close it 's just a mess .
Performance , Flash video and battery life
Wrap-up
The future
The JooJoo is a beautifully crafted piece of hardware , and even if the iPad was n't out there for comparisons , its minimalistic design would remind us of an aesthetically pleasing Apple product .
The front of the device is nothing but LCD , and the slightly recessed power button on the left edge is the only physical button on the entire thing .
We happen to think the lack of hardware controls might be one of Fusion Garage 's biggest mistakes since there 's no easy way of getting back to the menu or home screen , but we 'll get to all that interface stuff soon enough .
The champagne - colored brushed aluminum backside of the tablet certainly gives everything a sophisticated look , and it also feels really nice in hand , if just a tad flimsy in the middle due to its expansiveness .
But a " handheld " the 12.8 x 7.8 - inch JooJoo is not -- at least not in comparison to the iPad or other e-readers , like the Kindle or Nook .
The larger and heavier form factor makes it more of a sit up / lap device , rather than something you can use lying down and holding it up .
Obviously the payoff is in the bigger screen , and we really should n't whine too much about a 2.4 - pound , 0.7 - inch thick device when it comes to portability , but one - handing this thing is pretty much out of the question .
A single USB port , a standard headphone jack , and a microphone jack live on the right edge .
You can use the USB port to charge the device , but that 's all it will do since the operating system is completely browser - based and does n't allow for side loading music , video , or pictures .
The camera on the top of the screen is apparently meant for video conferencing , but all our attempts to video chat through Meebo or Tokbox failed .
Obviously the JooJoo 's heart and soul is its 1366 x 768 , capacitive 12 - inch display .
We have no qualms about the responsiveness of the glass display – light taps and swipes were all we needed to make selections / scroll down pages as long as the software was keeping up ( we had to restart the device a couple times to get things working again touch - wise ) – but viewing angles are less than stellar .
Unlike Apple 's IPS display , colors fade quickly when the screen is tilted to a 120 - degree angle ( as demonstrated in our video walkthrough ) , and when we held it up while lying on our side it was hard to position it to get a great view of the entire screen .
The horizontal viewing angles are wide enough for sharing the screen with a friend or two , though .
Getting the screen to rotate from vertical to horizontal can at times be a bit of a crapshoot – sometimes the accelerometer decides it'd like to pitch in and adjust just perfectly and other times it needs a bit of a shake to rotate ( JooJoo thinks we might 've gotten a lemon in this regard , and the problem certainly was n't consistent ) .
We 're told the sensitivity will be tweaked in an upcoming software update , along with the speed of rotation .
Luckily the ambient light sensor is much more accountable , dimming the screen when not in use and raising the lights in dimly lit situations , but unfortunately it 's positioned right where you might be likely to rest a thumb when holding the tablet in a landscape orientation , causing plenty of unintentional dimming .
The two speakers on the back of the tablet sound like typical netbooks speakers – they 're loud enough for personal listening , but wo n't fill a room .
The user interface on the JooJoo can best be described as a Monet – very attractive from afar , but a total mess up close .
Very much like Dell 's version of Ubuntu , the Linux browser - based OS is centered around rectangular shortcuts like Twitter and Hulu which are divided into different categories , including News , Social , and Entertainment .
When selected they simply just launch the respective site in the browser .
The homepage shortcuts are certainly helpful if you are looking to go to one of the preloaded sites , but there 's no simple browser shortcut if you just want to put in your own URL .
Instead you 're stuck opening one of the shortcuts and changing the address .
Counterintuitive , to say the least .
And that 's all there really is to the entire OS – there are n't any onboard applications for viewing pictures or music -- the only other screen is just a settings section for adjusting the WiFi or brightness .
From anywhere on the device you can swipe down at the top of the screen to bring up a navigation bar , which includes browser controls , in addition to quick utility items like bookmark , volume , onscreen keyboard , and WiFi .
The web viewing experience on the device is what you 'd expect ; pages look very nice on the wide display and we surely did n't take for granted the ability to watch a video or play Farmville right in the browser ( more on that Flash experience later ) .
Our biggest problem with the basic viewing is the 16:9 screen ratio , which renders regular sites with extra room on each side in landscape , but crops in on the sides of sites when held vertically .
We appreciate that JooJoo is trying to provide a straight pixel - accurate representation of web sites , but they could 've picked a better screen ratio to do it .
A smaller foible is a mere fact of Linux : type is n't rendered as cleanly as on a Mac or Windows machine , and not all fonts are supported .
A purely web - based device needs to have excellent navigation features , and the JooJoo ... does n't have those .
As we were telling a friend , there 's so much wrong with it that it we 're just not sure where to begin .
It 's hard to put a finger on our biggest complaint , but the fact that the navigation bar atop the browser is n't locked in place seems to be our largest frustration .
Instead , every time you want to move backwards , forwards , or input a new URL you have to swipe a finger downward to bring it up .
We'd be okay with that little trick if it happened to be more responsive and the software did n't mistakenly think we were trying to make selections on the page when trying to swipe downwards to make it appear .
At times our swipes worked perfectly , but if the JooJoo is preoccupied or feeling grumpy , the gesture goes unheeded , or a mistaken tap or second tap takes us back or to the home screen , since so much is packed into such a small area .
Since it 's so core to just about everything you 'd want to do on the device , it 's a real shame that it does n't Just Work .
Speaking of swiping downwards , two - finger scrolling happens to be very smooth , but one finger scrolling is n't supported .
That happens to be annoying when holding the device with one hand since you can't just use a thumb , or with two hands ( for weaklings like us ) because you have to drop one hand to do scrolling , or use a janky dual thumb method .
Pinch to zoom is n't a feature either , so trying to enlarge text or small web buttons to make selections are a no go .
There are two onscreen keyboard options : one for inputting short text and another , wider one that appears when the screen is flipped horizontally for longer typing .
Both can be dragged to different places on the screen and are decently sized , but trying to type a long email or instant message is annoying , especially with the lack of predicative text or automatic capitalization .
Oh , and hopefully you are okay with not using an apostrophe – while it has the key when selected it ends up inputting an open quote ( another little item with a promised software update ) .
Even more inexplicable was the fact that sometimes the keyboard did n't register key presses at all , or only on the third or fourth try .
A hard reset got things humming again , but we 'd rather not live in fear of losing the ability to use the keyboard .
The truth is we could go on and on about software flaws .
Like how when in vertical mode the bookmark dialog does n't display correctly , or how when you log into sites like Facebook or Twitter it does n't keep you logged in when the browser closes .
Though you really do n't know irritation until you try closing web pages .
Similar to Palm 's webOS , all your windows are open in a sidescrolling " tabs " video , where you are supposed to be able to swipe upwards to close a page .
However , for some reason this only works when it wants to , another known bug that might have something to do with Flash , but made us want to throw the unit across the room .
We 'd like to say we were the only ones that became completely bothered by the software , but every person we handed the tablet over to became peeved within five minutes and began asking us how to do simple things like go back to the home screen .
Software issues aside , the JooJoo actually happens to be quite speedy thanks to its 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270 processor , 1GB of RAM and 4GB solid state drive .
It only takes about 7 seconds to boot and toggling between the menus is snappy .
WiFi speeds were also quite fast with it taking 11 seconds to load Engadget and 8 seconds to bring up NYTimes.com .
But what about Flash ?
This is supposed to be the big differentiator , right ?
The iPad killer !
In an interesting move , Fusion Garage coupled the Atom processor with NVIDIA 's Ion graphics to aid in playing full screen Flash video ( or for doing ... something ) .
Unfortunately , the software just is n't there yet .
Currently the device is running Flash 10.1 beta 1 , and wo n't have hardware - accelerated Flash video for a good while now ( the timing is partly reliant on Adobe support , and is labelled as a " work in progress " by JooJoo ) .
That means some regular - sized YouTube and Hulu works , as decoded by the CPU , but full screen Hulu is jittery , and a 720 p YouTube clip is like watching a slideshow .
In one of the biggest moves of irony , JooJoo has actually implemented a hack for YouTube where you can view a video in Flash or in " JooJoo " mode which is a straight playback of the MPEG video file every YouTube video harbors .
What does this remind us of ?
HTML 5 , albeit with a less elegant implementation .
This of course only works on YouTube right now , though JooJoo says it plans on supporting other sites in the future .
Watch the video below for yourselves to see all this Flash tragedy play out .
The worst part about the Atom / Ion combo is that it results in those original issues we had when we reviewed all those Ion netbooks .
First , it causes the entire tablet to get quite warm ( especially when playing Flash video ) and then it murders its battery life .
The JooJoo 's integrated three - cell battery repeatedly lasted 2.5 hours ( just as we predicted ! ) during our moderate use , which included surfing the Web and playing short videos .
JooJoo claims you can get 5 hours if you avoid Flash entirely , but that sort of defeats the purpose , right ?
In the end we do n't understand why they did n't just go with an ARM processor like NVIDIA 's Tegra or a more current Intel Atom N450 processor paired with Broadcom 's Crystal HD solution .
Both options would have enabled HD video playback and resulted in some more juice .
We will take this moment to non-tactfully remind you that the iPad lasts over 10 hours on a charge .
There are just so many things we wish Fusion Garage did differently with the JooJoo .
Even putting aside the fact that Apple's $ 499 iPad brings more to the table than just web browsing , the JooJoo is less portable , has a worse ( if larger ) screen , is unintuitive to use , and ships with half - baked software .
We commend the start - up on its nice piece of hardware design , but until the software is given some much - needed love and the price is seriously reevaluated we simply cannot recommend this tablet .
To add insult to injury , Apple 's entry level iPad provides a much more seamless and feature - packed experience , and there are plenty of $ 199 - ish ARM - based tablets just around the corner .
We told you it was terrible timing .
The one shining light we can see is that Fusion Garage has actually managed to finish and build this thing , which is a lot more than can be said for the dozens of ARM / Tegra / Fairy dust - powered , Android / Linux / CE - based tablet prototypes we 've seen in the wild .
Most reviews do n't warrant a post - mortem , but with JooJoo there is just one sliver of hope : we 're promised an aggressive near - weekly update schedule with the device .
Sure , it would be much better if the device had actually shipped with ready - to - go software ( we 'd peg it at about an alpha level currently ) , but we 'll be keeping an eye out for how Fusion Garage improves this over time .
For instance , the experience will be radically altered by hardware - accelerated Flash ( even many of the sluggish UI elements seem to be Flash - based ) if it ever arrives , and there are a lot of design decisions that would n't be so hard to tweak , like an expanded , permanent address bar .
But updates are a promise , not a feature , and it's a small comfort for the few early adopters out there .

In looking at various award review sites , I have seen people equating creative web design with good web design .
This is not simply in acknowledgement that creativity is one of the gifts of the human mind and an indispensable part of the great triumphs of human culture .
It goes further to take the perspective that “ good web design ” means design that impresses the viewer with its creativity .
This perspective , which is almost never questioned among awards reviewers , is one which is eminently worthy of question .
Good acting does not leave people impressed with how good the acting is .
The very best acting leads people to be so involved with the drama and tension that they forget they are watching actors at all .
Not all acting reaches that standard — which is a very high standard — but acting has the quality that , at its best , it is transparent : people see through the acting to the important thing , the story .
What are the basic responses to my A Dream of Light ?
In order from best to worst :
Best :
The reader is moved by the images and stimulated by the ideas , and leaves the reading a wiser person .
Perhaps this involves being impressed by the thoughts , but the reader who is impressed is impressed as a side effect of the literature ’s power .
The reader leaves the reading thinking about the writing ’s subject - matter .
Second best :
The reader ’s primary response is to think about how smart I am , or how eccentric , or something of that sort .
The writing has not completely succeeded .
The reader leaves the reading thinking about me .
Worst :
The reader reads it and walks away thinking about the page ’s design , even how clean and uncluttered it is .
The reader leaves the reading thinking about the web design .
If a reader walks away from that piece of literature thinking about my web design , the design is a failure .
The design is as bad as a photograph where the scene is blocked by the photographer ’s thumb .
It is sometimes easy for webmasters to forget that readers spend most of their time viewing other pages — not figuring out mine .
I intentionally employ a standard web design in nearly all of my pages : navigation bar to the left , and a body to the right with dark text on a light background , different colors for visited and unvisited links ( with visited links looking washed - out compared to unvisited links ) , no frames , judicious use of emphasized text , a header at the top , and navigation links at the bottom .
I do not use any technology just because it ’s there — one page uses Java , and has content that would be almost meaningless if the applet were not there .
The design on my home page is not creative , because it is intended not to be creative .
I copied best practices from other sites and from friends ’ suggestions , in order to make a design that gets out of the way so readers can see the content .
To adapt a classic proverb :
Do n’t bother to impress people with creative design when you can impress people with creative content .
My web design is not evidence of any great creativity , but many readers have found the content in what I ’ve written to show considerable creativity .
I employ a very standardized web design for the same reason that I use standard spellings and grammar when I write : I want people to be able to see through them to whatever it is I ’m writing about .
Yf spelynge caulze uttinshun too ihtselv , itt yss mahch herdyr too thynque abaut whutt iz beeynge sayde .
If , on the other hand , people employ standard spellings , readers can ignore the spelling and focus on the point the writer is trying to make .
The spelling is transparent .
Spelling is not where you want to demonstrate your creativity .
And neither , usually , is web design .
Now , does that mean there is no place for creativity in design ?
No !
In the “ I learned it all from Jesus ” poster , I had each sentence a different color from the one before , andnone of it black — which I regard as a legitimate artistic liberty .
The Quintessential Web Page is aiming at a quite different effect ( humorous rather than artistic ) , and it does other things that are not ordinarily appropriate .
In this page , I use the content to draw attention to the design — also not normally appropriate .
These things are not a special privilege for me ; I just mention my pages because they ’re the ones I know best .
There ’s some really beautiful Flash art on the web .
One human - computer interaction expert has created a usability resource that is one of the ugliest pages I have ever seen , and does almost every major no -no on the list .
This is as it should be — he is making a point by demonstrating features of bad web design .
In that regard , making a page that is singularly annoying makes the point far more forcefully than an exemplar of good web practices that says “ Be careful that you do n’t have text that ’s indistinguishable from your background . ”
It is perfectly acceptable to stray from general rules if you have strong and specific reason to violate them .
“ I learned it all from Jesus , ” in my opinion , is a unique and valuable addition to my web page — but if I made every page look like that , my PageRank would drop through the floor .
Picasso said , “ Good artists copy .
Great artists steal . ”
Great artists never believe they have to invent everything from scratch to make good art — instead , they draw on the best that has been done before , and use their own creativity to build on top of what others have already accomplished .
In web design , this means making a site that is usable to viewers who have learned how to use other sites .
A careful reader will notice one element of design on this site that is not standard , but should be .
Designers for major sites , who often have excellent vision , will put navigation links on the page , but make them as small as they can be and not be completely illegible .
This is a truly bad idea , and I do n’t understand why it is so common .
( Maybe web designers forget that some of us only have 20 / 20 vision ? )
The navigation links are some of the most important links on most web pages , and I wish to say , “ Yes !
I consider these links important for you to be able to read and use , and I will proudly let you read them at whatever your preferred text size is , not the smallest size I can read ! ”
I will consider this to be a successful design feature if you were n’t aware of it until I pointed it out .

‘ There is no shame in being the party of no , ” former Alaskan governor and future television documentarian Sarah Palin told an adoring audience at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans last Friday .
That , however , is a matter of debate .
Newt Gingrich , for example , says he would prefer to be a member of “ the party of yes . ” Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal thinks differently .
He wants to be part of the party of “ hell , no . ”
There is time for the Republican leadership to be having this debate because , well , they ’re not doing much else .
Obstructing their Democratic rivals ’ every move may yet prove to have been an ingenious gambit on the part of congressional Republicans , but there is no question that it carries a cost .
With Tax Day upon us , we got to thinking : Just how much money are taxpayers spending on the Republican Party ’s commitment to doing exactly nothing ?
How much would Americans have saved if the Party of Lincoln ’s emissaries to the 111th Congress had simply mailed a one - page note to Democrats on January 3 , 2009 , inscribed with a single word — “ no ” ?
Instead , Republicans continue to pull down their taxpayer - funded salaries , enjoy their taxpayer - sponsored benefits , and accept tax - free donations to think tanks .
What has all of their subsidized inactivity cost the nation ?
Many of the answers can be found in the congressional budget , but we decided to do the math for you .*
SALARIES : Members of Congress voted last year to suspend their automatic cost - of - living raises , but each one still makes $ 174,000 a year .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Kentucky ) and House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) get a little extra : $ 193,400 a year , plus $ 40,000 and $ 10,000 in expenses , respectively .
Republican share of total salaries paid since the start of the 111th Congress , in January 2009 : $ 47.9 million .
STAFF : Congressional entourages have exploded in recent years : Senator James Inhofe ( R - Oklahoma ) alone employed as many as 62 people in 2009 .
There are now about 10,000 staffers working for members of the House of Representatives .
Almost 2,000 of them are drawing six - figure salaries , and all full - timers enjoy federal benefits .
We made a conservative estimate of the Grand Old Party ’s costs in this arena , including its estimated share of member and committee staffs but excluding the cost of paying administrative officials , such as the Senate sergeant - at - arms or parliamentarian .
G.O.P. total : $ 231.3 million .
BENEFITS : Under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program , senators and representives can choose from a variety of health - insurance plans .
For an additional fee , they can gain access to an on - site doctor ’s office and pharmacy , too .
Members also get generous federal pensions : congressmen are eligible for a lifetime payment after serving five years and can receive up to 80 percent of their final annual salary .
Smaller but still - tasty perks include parking , meals at the House and Senate restaurants , and memberships to the House gym .
We simply looked at the annual federal contribution to health , retirement , and other benefit plans for legislative - branch employees .
G.O.P. total : $ 163.1 million .
EXPENSES : Apart from their staff budgets , members of Congress get substantial allowances to maintain their offices ( in their home states as well as in D.C. ) and to communicate with constituents .
You ’ve probably heard of the “ franking privilege , ” for example , which lets members mail official letters without paying postage .
Well , frankly , all those paper clips and water coolers really add up .
G.O.P. total : $ 533.1 million .
KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON :
It takes a lot of energy to keep voting no .
House and Senate buildings require light , heat , water , sewer service , maintenance , and police protection .
Each of these needs has its own budget line .
G.O.P. total : $ 281.4 million .
THINK TANKS : Did n’t think taxpayers were footing the bill for think tanks ?
Think again .
Because most “ policy institutes ” enjoy tax - exempt status under section 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) of the Internal Revenue Code , the federal government loses about 35 cents in taxes for every dollar given to conservative policy institutes .
Here we ’ve included revenues lost because of donations to five of the largest conservative think tanks — the Heritage Foundation , the Center for Strategic and International Studies , the American Enterprise Institute , the Cato Institute , and the Manhattan Institute .
Sure , they ’ve come up with some interesting ideas .
When Republicans enact any of them , you can take this item off our list .
G.O.P. total : $ 79.4 million .
GRAND OLD TOTAL OF THE DIRECT TAXPAYER COSTS OF “ NO ” : $ 1.34 billion .

During water cooler conversation with his co-workers , whenever Dennis mentioned that he was responsible for supporting the Month End Closing system , reaction varied from a wide - eyed , agape look to a snide chuckle .
The Month End Closing system had a reputation throughout the department of being an ancient and legacy application that management had refused to upgrade over the years .
Some of the comments put its true age at somewhere in the late 80 ’s early 90 ’s era which had earned it nicknames like “ Ol’ Bertha ” or “ Methuselah ” but most simply called it the “ Legacy Dung Heap ” .
Month - End Madness
Lady luck was not on Dennis 's side that one fateful morning of his first month - end .
" OHMIGOSH ! I JUST RAN MONTH END AND GOT AN ERROR CODE 40 " panted the frantic caller , " IT ... THE SYSTEM WON'T LET ME , OR ANYONE IN THE OFFICE , DO ANYTHING ... CAN YOU GET US AN UNLOCK KEY ??? "
Dennis reassured the user that everything would be fine and to hang on literally for a minute while he investigated .
While it was compeletely owned in - house , the Month End system harbored a funny quirk left over from when it was originally written by an outside software firm .
When the system hit certain conditions , usually catastrophic data problems , everything would be frozen until a support person could provide the " Hex Key of the Day . "
A secret value derived from the Error Code , Current Date , and software license key .
Dennis opened the web form to generate the daily Hex Key but was surprised at the result :
CANNOT GENERATE HEX KEY FOR ERROR CODE - PLEASE INFORM TIER 1 SUPPORT TO REFERENCE G-A24456
This bothered Dennis greatly as he was in the Tier 1 support group .
WTF is a G - A24456 ?
After re-assuring the customer that the solution was still only another minute away , Dennis knew that he would have to think fast .
Desperate , he simultaneously searched the source code repository , documentation portal , and the department 's shared network drive hoping that G - A24456 was unique enough to find a result and ended up hitting pay dirt .
In the source , G - A24456 was a function called from the section of the code responsible for handling month - end receipts and was shocked to find out what an Error 40 really stood for .
The error was a division by zero error .
Dennis quickly scoffed at the programmer who could n't add a quick logic check to see if the number being used as the divisor was in fact zero .
Then , Dennis looked at the source again .
There on the screen was a FORCED division by zero to stop program execution .
No message , no exiting of a loop , nothing that would allow the user to self corrects and retry :
x=1/0 ; ## ( DIVZEROHALT )
Unprocessed receipts exist , instruct ## user to run the receipt register .
Generate Hex Key ## using Error Code 99 ( MISC ) to unlock system .
## SNK 10/05/92
After picking his chin up off the floor , Dennis gave the hex key , instructed the user to process any outstanding receipts to get everything moving again , and immediately booked an appointment with his supervisor .
Leftover Secrets
In his meeting , Dennis relayed his findings – the forced division by zero , the developer note , and for good measure , a rant on the use of the Hex Key in general .
Why not just show a pop-up window saying “ You did n’t process the damned receipts – go do that and come back ” ?
he argued .
" Close the door , Dennis .
I have something to talk with you about . "
Dennis 's supervisor explained that whole idea of the hex keys were originally created long ago by the original developers with a dual purpose .
The first was to force the user to stop everything if the system had some major mess - up , and second , to provide a steady stream of income for their support desk in the form of long - term support contracts .
“ The way that our corporation works is that the number of hours we bill to our users for support directly impacts our funding for the next year , ” explained Dennis ’s supervisor ,
" Why do you think that we are able to attend various conferences , have free coffee service , or enjoy our delightfully ergonomic work stations ?
All this is a result of our department 's ability to bill for support . "
He continued , " Frankly , if we remove all of the DIVZEROHALT statements and the concept of hex keys in general , we 'll all probably have to be laid off ! "

The Digital Economy Bill stinks .
It stinks of corruption .
It stinks because it is an authoritarian top down approach to the internet .
It stinks because it fails to understand the modern economy .
It is rotten to its very core .
A Government at the end of its term can be easily bought .
The sleaze , panic , arrogance and corruption just oozes through .
You can see it , feel it even .
This is why of all the so called show piece legislation that was announced during the Queens ’s speech , I knew that the nasty pernicious “ Digital Economy Bill ” would be guaranteed a safe path by those lick spittle Labour MPs .
All the other bills , may pass , may not but they were just good intentions .
A balanced budget bill – yep Neo -Con Labour signed up for that and they passed it , a Constitutional Reform bill that re-introduces the right to protest outside of Parliament just as they are leaving office , the rest was just for show .
Promises of how much better the World would be if you would just please , finally gave shiny happy Gordon Brown some form of electoral mandate .
Mandleson never again needs to worry about elections .
When Labour MP ’s lose their seats , Mandleson will still be in Parliament and he will still be trying to stay in Government .
Lord Mandleson works for Peter Mandleson .
Peter Mandleson works for Lord Mandleson .
Those of us here in the UK browsing the net , minding our own business , will still however be facing the consequences of the little bill , the movie and music industry managed to foist on an unsuspecting public .
The Digital Economy Bill 2010 .
Those at the front end of the digital economy , you know the ISPs , the search engine people , the social networking people , the people who make the damned digital economy thing kind of work hate the bill .
Well it does not matter what they want or how much it costs them .
They do not count .
The people who have made the internet work the likes of google , yahoo , facebook and ebay do not count either .
The only digital economy being protected will be the music and film industry distributors .
Labour will not bail out manufacturing jobs , they helped give Rover away to a bunch of spivs who then killed the only British car manufacturing company around .
They will however help their billionaire banker friends and they will however protect with the full force of the law a dieing media distribution industry that has done nothing but suck and destroy real talent from the music industry .
It is not hyperbole to say that this bill will mean the end of open wireless , disconnections from service based flimsy evidence , with no proper recourse to appeal .
You can be disconnected from the internet based on the content industry saying you were illegally file sharing .
Under this bill a coffee shop , or a University will be counted as an ISP .
No exemptions .
The Digital Economy bill was so bought and paid for that it was first released on a music industry site and then on the Government site .
If there was ever a bill where this applied
it is this bill .
This bill must die , otherwise internet freedom in the UK literally dies .
So I am utterly disgusted with the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives who have made a bad bill worse .
If this is a tactic to ensure that the bill is batted between the Commons and Lords , fine .
It would be one way of killing it , but Labour is not playing that game .
The Digital Economy bill will be passed .
Lord Clement Jones and Howard pushed through an amendment allowing the courts to order the blocking of sites “ substantially infringing ” copyright .
Lord Clement Jones explains his position here .
The Digital Economy Bill , as currently drafted , only deals with a certain type of copyright infringement , namely peer - to - peer file sharing .
Around 35 % of all online copyright infringement takes place on non peer - to - peer sites and services .
Particular threats concern “ cyberlockers ” which are hosted abroad .
There are websites which consistently infringe copyright , many of them based outside the UK in countries such as Russia and beyond the jurisdiction of the UK courts .
Many of these websites refuse to stop supplying access to illegal content … .
… Amendment 120A makes an explicit reference to human rights implications being taken into consideration by the Courts whilst they consider the imposition of an injunction .
Such a safeguard is paramount to our concerns .
The intention is also for the injunction to only be possible for sites where there is a substantial proportion of infringing material that is either hosted by that particular site or is accessed through the particular site in question .
The injunction will only be granted where copyright owners had first requested ISP ’s to block access to the site and where they had also requested the site operator to stop providing access to the infringing material ( either by removing the material itself or removing the ability to access the material ) ….
… . Site blocking is not a new phenomenon , the most well - known being the recommended list of sites to block provided by the Internet Watch Foundation
When it is written in to law what is “ substantial ” ?
Youtube ?
Facebook ?
The IWF is far from perfect .
It blocked wikipedia for instance .
It was easy to get round .
Liberal Democrats have reacted strongly against this .
Including 25 Lid-Dem MP’s .
This will not simply be used against those who offer music or films .
This amemdment does nothing to stop bloggers getting caught up in this .
Image sharing is common with small bloggers .
With ever growing internet speeds and PC speeds the internet has in many homes replaced the television .
This bill serves to act as a Luddite piece of legislation in the face of that change .
Media Center
PCs can do film searches for period of a month in advance recording tv streamed content to be played back on demand at the time of the PC users choosing .
To many there is little difference between grabbing a torrent of an old film and downloading it , or downloading it through their PVR .
Sales of consumer devices such as the XBOX 360 and PS3 were boosted in the US by deals with Netflix , a low price all you can eat model of film subscription , with access to thousands of films , including recent blockbusters .
This is not available here due to licence restrictions – so a better bill would have been to look at the licence restrictions .
The Government accepts that they had no proper figures about the numbers of people who download content illegally and then buy it if they like it .
With music , services like spotify have had an impact on that , however the content distributors are now wanting to kill that as well .
They are tearing up their agreement and it is not difficult to imagine that this is because of this bill .
When this gets to the Commons MP ’s will have the choice of Labour ’s clause 17 , which would allow Mandleson ( and his successor ) to appoint anyone to decide what is or is n’t illegal , at will or a Lib / Con pact pushing an approach likely to produce straightforward threats , bans and withdrawals of sites with user generated content .
Great , really .
We know either power would not be abused .
After all the terrorism bills have n’t been abused have they ?
[ / endsnark ]
The strategy in the Lords and Commons needs to be simple .
Delay and delay this bill .
If this amendment does that all well and good .
In that way , it dies when the election is called .
If it has completed Committee stage , this bill passes as part of the Commons close down process .
“ Controversial ” amendments removed .
Digital delivery is here .
Mandleson needs to tell the content distributors – deal with it .
Look at why piracy is happening .
The UK is unable to have a service equivalent to Netflix because of licencing .
Change the law so that a company like Netflix can set up here .
No one wants discs that can get scratched anymore .
If a decent watch all you want service was available at the price Netflix charges , UK buyers would lap it up .
Labour ’s parting gift to the content industry must not be allowed to pass .
This is not a bill for the digital age , it is a bill for the dustbin .
[ Update ]
There is a motion going to the Liberal Democrat Spring Conference on this .
The Liberal Democrats have played their cards very badly on this awful Content Industry bill because they have managed to get their names muddied with this bill – a bill that would shame the US Congress for its lobbyist stench .
This motion helps to remove them from that stench .
The Tories could not make the poll tax better .
Labour can not make compulsory ID cards better – even if they came with a free fluffy pink teddy bear .
This awful lobbyist sponsored , digital economy destroying bill can not be made better either .
There is a clear way that the Liberal Democrats can gain from this .
Fight to either kill the bill before and make it clear that is what they are doing .
If it does pass – make it clear that they want it repealed .
In fact repeal of this bill and every other civil liberty robbing bill passed by Neo Con Labour over the last 13 years should be a condition of any post election alliance .
The Liberal Democrats should once again take the high ground on civil liberties , Liberal is after all in the Party name .
WASHINGTON — For 12 years , Sylvia Chavez has warned leaders of the Catholic Church in the United States and Mexico about the priest she alleges sexually abused her as a child in California .
She met with church officials in San Francisco to describe the assaults , enlisted American lawyers to search for the priest in Mexico , and wrote letters to two successive archbishops of Yucatan , pleading with them to keep the Rev. Teodoro Baquedano Pech away from children .
At one point , she even received written assurance from the Yucatan Archdiocese that “ we have taken all precautions . . . to restrict Father Baquedano ’s access to children and vulnerable adults . ’’
Yet Baquedano remains in the ministry , in a case that underscores the challenges that US victims of clergy abuse face when their alleged abusers move overseas .
A photo taken on Easter shows the priest , 70 , officiating at a baptism in one of several rural hamlets outside Yucatan ’s state capital , Merida , where he conducts services .
“ When I saw that picture on my computer screen , I wanted to pick up the monitor and throw it , ’’ said Chavez , a 54 - year - old preschool teacher who still lives in San Francisco and struggles with what she says happened to her between ages 11 and 16 .
Although Baquedano has denied abusing Chavez , the Archdiocese of San Francisco settled a lawsuit in 2006 , paying her $ 300,000 without admitting culpability .
Nevertheless , Chavez said , she “ cannot rest ’ ’ as long as Baquedano remains a priest with access to children .
“ It ’s not over at all , ’’ she said .
“ He ’s a criminal who uses his collar as a weapon .
If he hurt me , he ’s still capable of hurting others . ’’
In recent weeks , the Catholic Church has faced a barrage of allegations that it allowed clergy members accused of molesting children in the United States to continue working as priests overseas .
In some cases , the priests have remained in the ministry despite concerted efforts by US victims and church officials to hold them accountable .
Although news organizations in Yucatan have followed up on Baquedano ’s case , the articles about him have n’t generated much public outcry , according to Jesus Delgado Centeno , director of a network of online publications in the southeastern Mexican state .
Reached by phone in his church living quarters , Baquedano said repeatedly , “ I do n’t want to answer any questions .
Please call the archbishop about this . ’’
Armando Martinez , an attorney for the archbishop of Yucatan , Emilio Carlos Berlie Belaunzaran , said that after determining that there were no accusations against Baquedano by anyone in Yucatan , church officials saw no need for further action .
“ The archbishop has zero tolerance for abuse of minors .
. . .
But you need evidence .
We ca n’t remove someone simply because of a letter alerting us to an accusation [ in the United States ] .
He was n’t even convicted there . ’’
One political leader has taken notice .
“ We need to investigate exactly what duties this priest has and if he really is in contact with children , ’’ said Bertha Perez Medina , a member of Yucatan ’s state assembly .
“ Where was the moral responsibility of [ church officials ] if they knew of these accusations and continued to protect him and allow him to continue working with children ? ’’

In a sense , you and I have always played in " adventure playgrounds . "
We created a fort in the kitchen cabinets , jumped from couch to couch across oceans ; we snuck out through a hole in the fence to a new world .
We climbed trees and hid in bushes .
We played in the mud and the rain .
We chased each other , made secret worlds with our own language .
We created spaces with whatever we could find around us .
Some of us played in abandoned buildings , or barns , or vacant lots between buildings , used what we found and made up stories of our lives to be .
We looked everywhere to find our space .
We made a children 's world in the city and in the country .
Imagine , a place that provides all that , in the middle of a city .
Here you go , hammers , saws , nails , wood , tires , rope , cloth , whatever you can find .
Make it yours .
You can change this playground right here , right now .
You do n't have to make an appointment .
You can walk or ride your bike , and there are people here to help and encourage you .
What if you had that space ?
What if every child had that space ?
You ’d be hard pressed to guess that this bike started life as a 1987 Honda Hurricane , known less evocatively as the CBR 1000 F .
This amazing machine took Ian McElroy two years to build , and if you spot a little of the KTM RC8 in there , you ’re right — the Austrian superbike was one of the inspirations for McElroy ’s stealth - fighter angles and curves .
The fenders are hand - crafted from aluminum , and a new subframe reshaped the back end .
The bodywork is formed from sheets of aluminum meticulously welded together , and the original gauges have been replaced by a Veypor setup that can also record G - force , 0 - 60 , quarter mile time and lap time as well as speed and RPM .
With 130 bhp on tap , the DOHC , 998 cc , 16 valve four is not short of go — but K&N filters and a custom - made , less restrictive exhaust system have given the motor an extra kick .
And there ’s nothing stealth about the sound : McElroy ’s Honda reportedly sounds like a drag bike at the strip .

It ’s World Homeopathy Awareness Week .
Today ’s post is a deeper dive into the world of homeopathic “ evidence ” .
Looking at the science , we ’ll highlight the implications of regulators applying two sets of standard to health products :
One for medicine , and one for homeopathy .
Today ’s post is a collaboration with Kim Hebert , who blogs at Science - Based Therapy .
The kindest that can be said about most homeopathic products is that they wo n’t cause adverse effects .
After all , most common “ strengths ” or “ potencies ” used in homeopathy are so dilute there ’s no possibility of a single molecule of the original substance remaining in the remedy .
But what if , instead of diluting a product the typical 30 times , it ’s only diluted once or twice ?
Is it still homeopathy ?
There ’s a very good chance of some molecules of the original substance remaining .
That ’s the case with today ’s case study , Traumeel .
What is Traumeel , and what does it do ?
If you have n’t heard of Traumeel , this full - page ad that appeared in the Globe and Mail last month explains [ click to embiggen ] :
Traumeel is marketed to treat sports injuries , inflammation , and pain .
Conventional treatments , like anti-inflammatories , are effective but can have multiple serious side effects .
So any product that ’s “ safer than anti-inflammatories ” and gets “ to the source of the pain ” , yet is “ without side effects ” , would be a tremendous medical innovation .
The ointment , gel , tablets , injection , and drop versions of Traumeel all have same labelled use : “ For the temporary relief of muscular pain , joint pain , sports injuries and bruising . ” and Health Canada ( search Natural Health Products Database licenses 80005012 , 80005063 , 80005218 , 80007675 , and 80007958 ) has approved the following statement about Traumeel products :
“ Homeopathic preparation used to relieve pain , inflammation and bruising associated with injuries such as sprains , dislocations , contusions ; to relieve muscle and joint pain . ”
Are these statements backed up by good science ?
Let ’s start with looking at the ingredient list .
Ingredients and Evidence
When you buy a medicinal product , the active ingredients is disclosed , along with the amount .
For example , a 1 % ointment is 1 gram of a drug per 100 grams of ointment .
Compared to medicine , homeopathic product labels seem not to be designed with consumers in mind .
Here ’s the listing for Traumeel ointment :
Each 50 g contains : Aconitum napellus 3X ( Reduces pain after injury ) 0.50 g ; Arnica montana , radix 3X ( Reduces swelling and bruising ) 0.75 g ; Belladonna 3X ( Reduces swelling and pain ) 0.5 g ; Bellis perennis 1X ( Treats bruising ) 0.25 g ; Calendula officinalis 1X ( Stimulates healing process ) 0.75 g ; Chamomilla 1X ( Soothing pain relief ) 0.25 g ; Echinacea 1X ( Immune support ) 0.25 g ; Echinacea purpurea 1X ( Stimulates healing process ) 0.25 g ; Hamamelis virginiana 1X ( Relieves bruised soreness ) 0.75 g ; Hepar sulphuris calcareum 8X ( Stimulates injury healing ) 0.125 g ; Hypericum perforatum 6X ( Relieves pain ) 0.045 g ; Mercurius solubilis 8X ( Reduces swelling ) 0.06 g ; Millefolium 1X ( Treats minor bleeding ) 0.15 g ; Symphytum officinale 4X ( Relieves joint pain ) 0.05 g. Inactive Ingredients : Cetylstearyl alcohol , ethanol , paraffin , purified water , and white petrolatum .
It baffling , but sounds impressive and technical .
Let ’s look at one ingredient : Arnica montana .
Arnica montana is a plant with the more common name of leopard ’s or wolf ’s bane .
To make homeopathic Arnica montana , the plants are collected , ground up , mixed with alcohol , pressed and filtered .
The final liquid is called mother tincture .
The mother tincture is then diluted , mixing one unit with nine units of water .
The diluted tincture is then shaken or “ succussed ” .
The process is repeated three times in total ( i.e. , “ 3X ” ) .
So the final product is a 1/1000 dilution of the “ mother tincture ” .
Of that final dilution , 0.75 g of this is used in the ointment .
That means the ointment has 0.00075 g of the mother tincture , and the final ointment is 0.0015 % Arnica tincture .
Not a lot .
Working through the entire ingredient list , we can calculate there is is 4.68 g of diluted tinctures in the 50 g tube .
The remaining 45.32 g are the inactive ingredients : alcohol , paraffin , and petroleum jelly .
Given the tinctures have all been diluted one to eight times , it ’s clear there ’s not much “ active ” ingredient there .
Let ’s look at each ingredient more closely and see if there ’s any supporting scientific evidence , as either homeopathy or medicine ( all evaluations taken from the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database , an evidence - based compendium ) :
No supportive evidence : Calendula officinalis 1X ( garden marigold ) , Bellis perennis 1X ( wild daisy ) , Hepar sulphuris calcareum 8X ( calcium sulfide ) , Mercurius solubilis 8X ( mercury ) .
The purported effects , such as “ stimulates the healing process ” and “ immune support ” are too vague to evaluate .
Calendula officinalis 1X ( garden marigold ) , Bellis perennis 1X ( wild daisy ) , Hepar sulphuris calcareum 8X ( calcium sulfide ) , Mercurius solubilis 8X ( mercury ) .
The purported effects , such as “ stimulates the healing process ” and “ immune support ” are too vague to evaluate .
No supportive evidence at homeopathic doses : Hamamelis virginiana 1X ( witch hazel ) , Arnica montana radix 3X , Chamomilla 1X ( German chamomile ) , Millefolium 1X ( yarrow ) .
Though these ingredients have been researched as natural remedies , there is no evidence to support their use at homeopathic doses .
Hamamelis virginiana 1X ( witch hazel ) , Arnica montana radix 3X , Chamomilla 1X ( German chamomile ) , Millefolium 1X ( yarrow ) .
Though these ingredients have been researched as natural remedies , there is no evidence to support their use at homeopathic doses .
Potentially unsafe : Aconitum napellus 3X ( aconite ) , Belladonna 3X ( deadly nightshade ) , Symphytum officinale 4X ( comfrey ) .
These are considered unsafe when taken orally ( note : these ingredients are in the pill form of Traumeel ) ; Aconite is also considered unsafe to be used topically .

Inappropriate : Echinacea angustifolia 1X , Echinacea purpurea 1X ( echinacea ) , Hypericum perforatum 6X ( St. John ’s Wort ) .
Echinacea is generally used for coughs and colds and St. John ’s Wort is used for depression , so the inclusion of these ingredients is puzzling .
Echinacea angustifolia 1X , Echinacea purpurea 1X ( echinacea ) , Hypericum perforatum 6X ( St. John ’s Wort ) .
Echinacea is generally used for coughs and colds and St. John ’s Wort is used for depression , so the inclusion of these ingredients is puzzling .
Other ingredients : Purified water , Paraffin , White petrolatum , Ethanol , Cetylstearyl alcohol .
Traumeel ointment is 13.8 % alcohol .
Rubbing an alcohol - based ointment into the skin is likely to produce a cooling effect — exactly what you might be looking for if you ’ve got a bruise , injury or swelling .
The ingredient list tells us a a lot about the plausibility of Traumeel .
There ’s no scientific evidence to support the use of any of the key ingredients to treat pain or inflammation and , while there may be a molecule or two of each ingredient left , there wo n’t be enough to have any meaningful effects by either medicinal or homeopathic principles .
But implausible does n’t mean impossible , so let ’s see if there ’s any evidence .
Clinical Trials
Heel makes a number of claims ( pdf ) about Traumeel , but none are backed up by persuasive evidence .
Mostly they compare Traumeel to anti-inflammatory drugs like ASA and ibuprofen , claiming that Traumeel is faster , more effective , and has no side effects .
Unfortunately , there are no well - designed , double - blind , peer reviewed , head - to - head trials that have established this .
This is unfortunate , because there ’s no information to support the included dosages , nor to suggest that any of these ingredients would even be absorbed into the skin .
However , the relatively vague claims that Traumeel is “ well - tolerated ” and has “ almost no side effects ” are very plausible , given there is n’t enough of any ingredient to have any medicinal effects .
Is Traumeel even homeopathy ?
Traumeel has a listed range of dilutions between 1X ( 1/10 ) and 8X ( 1/100,000,000 ) .
Typical homeopathic remedies are diluted to something nearer to 30C , which is 1/1060 , a dilution of 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 .
Homeopaths believe 30C is a “ moderate ” potency .
But if Traumeel is considered homeopathy at such “ weak ” dilution , and it ’s effective , the major premise of homeopathy is invalidated .
Why are 30C dilutions even necessary when something is effective at 1X ?
It ’s probably more likely that neither dilution is meaningful .
The most likely way Arnica could be said to be equally effective at 1/1000 and 1/1060 would be to recognize that they ’re both providing placebo effects only .
That ’s a far more simple and probable explanation for Traumeel , as opposed to rejecting the physical laws of the universe .
Is Traumeel a safe placebo ?
Homeopathy is promoted as “ safe ” because the ingredients are so dilute that they cannot exert a biological effect .
Conveniently , dilution gives a substance potent healing properties with no risk of overdose or side - effects .
These concepts are antithetical .
A medicine cannot have both an extremely potent therapeutic effect and be completely risk - free .
It ’s a wonderful fantasy , but it ’s not chemically possible .
And Traumeel illustrates this point .
Alexa Ray Joel ( daughter of singer Billy Joel ) attempted to overdose on Traumeel tablets .
She was hospitalized , but luckily , no overdose was observed .
Heel commented on the reports only enough to reiterate that their product is safe and effective .
However , doctors say that the reason Traumeel was of little threat was that , contrary to homeopathic claims of potency , Traumeel is far too dilute to cause an overdose with any of its ingredients , even if taken in significant excess .
This tragic situation is persuasive evidence against claims of homeopathic potency .
Though this story had a happy ending , it illustrated the safety , ethical , and regulatory grey area that Traumeel occupies .
However , Traumeel does contain trace amounts of apparently ineffective , though in some cases potentially dangerous , ingredients .
Yet the product avoids having to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy by obtaining the label of homeopathy .
This recalls the product Zicam , which was labelled “ homeopathic ” but contained enough ingredient to cause people to lose their sense of smell .
Zicam contained Zincum Gluconicum 1X and Zincum Aceticum 2X — dilutions similar to those seen with Traumeel ingredients .
Could a similar situation occur with Traumeel , or another poorly regulated homeopathic product , if someone ingests enough of it ?
What ’s the bottom line with Traumeel ?
While it is possible the diluted ingredients in Traumeel could have drug - like effects , there ’s no evidence to suggest any component will have meaningful therapeutic effects , even at much higher amounts .
And that ’s probably a good thing , because you do n’t want to be rubbing mercury into your skin or ingesting nightshade , when all you want to do is treat a sports injury .
If there was real interest in evaluating Traumeel ’s efficacy , a clinical trial comparing it to placebo and relevant drugs would be straightforward .
Unfortunately , no such research exists .
And given it ’s already been approved by Health Canada with an impressive - sounding recommended use , why would we expect the manufacturer to bother ?
The homeopathic evidence standard was met , and the product can be sold .
The marketing of Traumeel neatly illustrates a consequence of the regulatory standards for homeopathic products :
It ’s possible to claim Traumeel has only desired effects and no side - effects .
As it ’s not immediately obvious that Traumeel is a homeopathic product , few will realize that a different evidence standard was applied .
Further , the labelling standard does not clearly communicate to consumers that there are essentially no active ingredients in the products .
Nor is the manufacturer required to indicate that homeopathy has not been demonstrated to have any meaningful therapeutic effects .
The net result is the veneer of scientific legitimacy .
If the Canadian regulatory system does n’t properly inform consumers about the content and evidence for homeopathic products like Traumeel , how effective is it ?
Consumers cannot be expected to make rational decisions about their own health when basic information like ingredients and effectiveness is unavailable .
That a product such as Traumeel , with such poor evidence to even justify its ingredients , let alone the claims of efficacy , can have the above statement of efficacy approved by Health Canada is a disgrace and consumers quite literally pay the price .

Does Arnica Cream Work for Pain ? by Paul Ingraham , at PainScience.com .
With the current and projected level of unsustainable spending and the determination to control the day - to - day activities of the American people , the Obama administration and the Democrats in Congress will do anything to expand revenue to the Treasury , the consequences ( unintended or otherwise ) be damned .
The United States under the current governing regime continues to move toward a powerful central government .
As a step in that direction , the Congress and the White House recently granted the Internal Revenue Service more police power to not only collect taxes , but within that process , to negate the legal rights of the people to petition the courts and to control the behavior of American and non-American taxpayers .
On March 18 , 2010 , President Obama signed yet another stimulus act ( $ 17.5 billion ) using the innocuous - sounding title of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act ( cynically abbreviated to H.I.R.E. ) .
This bill was touted as another step in helping job creation .
In reality , it does the opposite .
Hidden within the bowels ( page 27 ) of this so - called jobs legislation is an unreported ( in the once - mainstream media ) provision known as Foreign Account Tax Compliance .
Apparently , the congressional leadership did not want attention focused on this as a standalone bill , so it was hidden within a much more popular - sounding jobs bill .
The justification for passing this provision was ostensibly to crack down on so - called tax evaders .
In summary , this bill requires that foreign banks and financial institutions disclose the full details of American account - holders to the IRS -- and to withhold 30 % of all outgoing capital flows into those accounts if the IRS ( not the courts ) deems the account - holder " recalcitrant . "
These requirements would also apply to non-American citizens living in the United States or to foreigners having investments and paying taxes within the country .
If these stipulations are deemed illegal by a given foreign nation 's domestic laws , then the financial institution and the account - holder are required to close the account .
The end result of this action , if allowed to stand , will be to force banks and other foreign financial institutions to stop doing business within the United States , and further , make the country much less attractive to foreign investors , who will now come under the heavy hand of the IRS .
Per the Swiss Bankers Association , " These measures could have a boomerang effect and will make the US less attractive for foreign investors . "
And per the Swiss - American Chamber of Commerce , " A lot of banks simply will not be able to do business in the US and that would cause considerable damage to the US economy . "
Not only banks , but the activities of asset - managers and securities - dealers will be affected .
The administrative cost of tracking down all U.S. ( citizen and non-citizen ) clients and making efforts to make sure that they are tax - compliant will be enormous and impractical .
Therefore , foreign investors viewing the overall landscape of what was once the preeminent nation for investment will not subject themselves to the machinations of the IRS and other enforcement agencies , which have been given unlimited power to broadly interpret regulatory bills passed by this Congress and signed by President Obama .
The IRS , through its police power , can now involve itself in the ability of U.S. citizens to choose where and how they can invest their money or have bank accounts .
VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - A Vatican cardinal in charge of clergy around the world congratulated a French bishop in a 2001 letter for not denouncing a sexually abusive priest to the police , according to a French website on Thursday .

The letter posted by Golias , a critical lay Roman Catholic magazine based in Lyon , is the most explicit of a wave of recently published internal church documents in showing past Vatican encouragement to cover up sexual abuse by priests .
In the letter dated Sept 8 , 2001 , Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos backed French Bishop Pierre Pican ’s decision not to denounce a priest who was later sentenced to 18 years in jail for repeated rape of a boy and sexual assaults on 10 others .
Under fire in recent weeks for its secretive handling of abuse cases , the Vatican has insisted the fact that other published documents did not explicitly instruct bishops to inform police of abuse did not prove it told them to hide it .
Vatican spokesman Rev. Federico Lombardi did not dispute the letter ’s content but said it confirmed “ how opportune it was to centralize treatment of cases of sexual abuse of minors by clerics under the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith . ”
The then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , now Pope Benedict , instructed Catholic bishops around the world on May 18 , 2001 to report all case of clerical sexual abuse of minors to the Congregation , the top Vatican doctrinal office that he headed .
Pican , who received a suspended three - month jail sentence for not denouncing sexual abuse of minors , admitted in court he had kept Rev. Rene Bissey in parish work despite the fact the priest had privately admitted committing pedophile acts .
The case shocked France and prompted its bishops to declare that all abuse cases must be reported to civil authorities .
“ I congratulate you for not denouncing a priest to the civil administration , ” Castrillon Hoyos said .
“ You have acted well and I am pleased to have a colleague in the episcopate who , in the eyes of history and of all other bishops in the world , preferred prison to denouncing his son and priest . ”
BISHOPS NOT REQUIRED TO INFORM POLICE
In it , the cardinal said relations between bishops and priests were not simply professional but had “ very special links of spiritual paternity . ”
Bishops therefore had no obligation to testify against “ a direct relative , ” he stated .
The letter cited Vatican documents and an epistle of Saint Paul to bolster its argument about special bishop - priest links .
“ To encourage brothers in the episcopate in this delicate domain , this Congregation will send copies of this letter to all bishops ’ conferences , ” Castrillon Hoyos wrote .
A staunch conservative from Colombia , the cardinal headed the Vatican department for priests from 1996 to 2006 .
From 2000 to 2009 , he also ran a commission dealing with traditionalist rebels who broke from Rome in 1988 and were excommunicated .
He conducted the talks that led to the January 2009 decision to readmit the four banned bishops of the Society of Saint Pius X to the Church , which caused an uproar when it emerged that one of them , Richard Williamson , had denied the Holocaust .
The controversy was highly embarrassing to Pope Benedict , who said he did not know about Williamson ’s views , even though they could easily be found on the internet .
Two months after the incident , Benedict folded Castrillon Hoyos ’s commission into the Congregation and the cardinal retired .
On Thursday the pope said the church had to do penance for its sins , in a rare public reference to the pedophilia scandal .

Marines Go Home : Anti-Base Activism in Okinawa , Japan and Korea
Kageyama Asako
Compiled , edited and translated by Philip Seaton1
The US military ’s Kooni Firing Range in the South Korean village of Maehyang - ri was closed in 2005 , following a concerted effort by anti-base activists .
Maehyang - ri was one of three anti-base struggles featured in the documentary film Marines Go Home : Henoko , Maehyang - ri , Yausubetsu ( official website here , trailer here ) directed by Hokkaido - based independent filmmaker Fujimoto Yukihisa .
In this article , journalist and filmmaker Kageyama Asako ( narrator and co-producer of Marines Go Home ) discusses the lessons from Maehyang - ri in the context of the Futenma relocation debate that is at the heart of current US - Japan conflict .
This is part of a two - article series that considers the base relocation issue from perspectives beyond Okinawa .
The other is ‘ The Complete Withdrawal of the US Military from Ecuador : A Victory for Sovereignty and Peace in Latin America ’ by Fuse Yūjin .
The Futenma base relocation issue has been dominating the headlines in Japan ever since the formation of the Hatoyama administration in September 2009 .
Understandably the focus has been on Okinawa , long the center of anti-base activism .
But we should see the Futenma base relocation issue as part of a much broader problem .
In this article I want to consider the Futenma issue in the context of other activities within the international anti-bases movement .
I have been involved in the anti-bases movement for many years and serve on the Hokkaido Asia Africa Latin America Solidarity Committee ( HAALA ) .
HAALA is an organization that opposes neo-colonialism , respects the rights of people to self - determination and aims for the equality of all peoples .
Revocation of the US - Japan Security Treaty and the removal of all American bases from Japan are among its aims .
We have links with Vietnam , Nicaragua , Cuba and South Africa among others and are involved in various humanitarian projects there .
A representative of the Japan Africa Asia South America Solidarity Committee went to Ecuador to attend the anti-base activities described in Fuse Yūjin ’s article [ add link ] , and have also visited Venezuela and Bolivia .
The International Network for the Abolition of Foreign Military Bases ( INAFMB ) took off at the World Social Forum held in Mumbai in January 2004 and was launched officially as a result of its first international conference in Quito and Manta , Ecuador , in March 2007 .
I attended the Mumbai meeting as the representative of HAALA .
It was an unforgettable experience .
To have 130,000 people gathering from across the globe under the slogan ‘ Another world is possible ’ in a meeting of such diversity and vibrancy was enough to really make one believe it could happen .
In particular , the demonstrations by members of India ’s so - called ‘ untouchables ’ caste left a particularly strong impression .
Their cries of ‘ If another world is possible then it must include us ’ brought it home that only by raising one ’s voice is there any hope to change things .
World Social Forum 2004
Marines Go Home
In response to the calls to action in Mumbai , and also as part of the fortieth anniversary celebrations of HAALA , we started making a documentary film : Marines Go Home , Henoko , Maehyang - ri , Yausubetsu .
Marines Go Home ( 2005 , official website here , trailer here ) focuses on some of the individuals and activists dedicated to the removal of US bases from three towns and villages in Japan and South Korea .
In Yausubetsu ( in Eastern Hokkaido ) , the film depicts the ‘ live in protest ’ of Kawase Hanji , who for many years refused to leave his home in the middle of Yausubetsu Enshujo ( Yausubetsu Maneuver Area ) , a Japan Ground Self Defense Forces ( JGSDF ) firing range in Eastern Hokkaido .
2
Yausubetsu is the largest training area in Japan .
Each year since 1997 , US marines have been coming to Yausubetsu to conduct live - fire training , all paid for by the Japanese taxpayer .
3
The local struggle against the training exercises has continued for over 40 years .
For many years , the Yausubetsu Peace Bon Festival was held on Kawase ’s property .
This festival and the Yausubetsu issue have long been at the heart of HAALA ’s activities ( and as such , a number of members appear in Marines Go Home ) .
The fortieth festival was held in 2004 .
In September 2003 , HAALA arranged for a special guest to visit Yausubetsu to witness a US Marines Corps training exercise .
Chun Man - kyu was the leading figure in the struggle to close a firing range just off the coast of Maehyang - ri village in South Korea .
The American military started using the Kooni firing range there in 1951 .
Up until the closure of the firing range in 2005 , twelve local people had been killed , either in accidents or by unexploded ordinance from the range .
There was also an incident in 2000 when an A - 10 fighter dropped six missiles into the sea very close to a residential area and damaged 700 houses .
Finally , the film documents the protests against the surveying work being undertaken off the coast at Henoko in preparation for the transfer and upgrading of the Futenma air base to Camp Schwab in Henoko , part of Nago city , Okinawa .
The first plan in 1996 was to construct a floating heliport .
This was rejected in a plebiscite in 1997 .
In 2002 the plan was changed to a permanent base with a runway built on a massive landfill .
This plan was withdrawn after desperate protest in September 2005 , only to be replaced by a new and even bigger plan drawn up by the Japanese and American governments the following month ( October 2005 ) for a two - runway base in Henoko along the coast of Camp Schwab in Oura Bay .
The deep water in Oura Bay means nuclear aircraft carriers would be able to visit .
All these plans have been made in the face of stiff local opposition and would destroy a pristine marine habitat supporting among other species rare blue coral reefs and the internationally protected dugong .
4 Just before the Democratic Party of Japan defeated the Liberal Democratic Party in the 30 August 2009 general election , the outgoing and deeply unpopular Aso administration signed the so - called Guam Treaty , which the US interprets as binding the Hatoyama to an agreement to build the Henoko base .
5
Protestors try to prevent survey work on the proposed Henoko offshore runways site .
Marines Go Home was released in 2005 ( and an updated version was produced in 2008 , official site here ) .
A lot has happened since Marines Go Home was first released .
The anti-base movement in Hokkaido suffered two keenly - felt losses in 2009 when first Kawase Hanji and then former US marine Allen Nelson6 ( a staunch supporter of the ‘ Marines Go Home ’ message ) died .
With Kawase ’s death , a rethinking of the strategies used by anti-base activists in Yausubetsu became necessary .
The strategy could no longer be built around the theme ‘ preserve Kawase ’s way of life ’ .
Thankfully , a woman who used to lodge with Kawase continues to live in the firing range , although conditions are tough .
The people in and around Yausubetsu will continue the struggle , although as a vital site for the anti-bases protest movement this struggle needs as much local and international support as possible .
It would be too much to ask local people to assume the whole burden of organizing activities and maintaining homes , livelihoods and places to gather within the firing range .
Kageyama interprets for the late Allen Nelson during a talk at Hokkaido University in 2007 .
Anti-base activists in Henoko have also faced a mounting struggle .
As part of the planned redeployment of American forces agreed by the US and Japan in 2006 , there were plans to construct deep - water port facilities at Henoko .
This decision required another environmental survey , but in contrast to previous protests ( depicted in the 2005 film ) in which protesters canoed out to occupy the survey rigs and delay work , this time the Japan Coast Guard obstructed the protests .
The Coast Guard had previously stayed out of the standoff between contractors and protestors .
The level of violence used against the protestors reached life - threatening levels on occasions .
Furthermore a Marine Self Defense Forces frigate was sent to the area .
According to local media , the frigate had divers on board who set up survey equipment on the seabed under the cover of darkness .
It was also a clear warning to protestors that the Japanese government , without any legal basis , was prepared to deploy military forces .
Despite the risks , the protests have continued on land and at sea.7
The protestors also faced a split in the anti-base movement during the 2006 Nago mayoral elections .
8
That election was won by the LDP - Komeito - backed Shimabukuro Yoshikazu , who supported the construction of the base .
The anti-base movement vote was split between two anti-base candidates , both of whom were city councilors : Oshiro Yoshitami and Gakiya Munehiro .
Gakiya was supported by the Social Democratic Party , Communist Party , Okinawa Social Mass Party , Democratic Party and the unions , but had voted for the move from Futenma to Henoko in 1990 , so many opponents of the base felt unable to support him .
After the 2006 election , the number of people in the tented camp dwindled in the face of the confusion over the mayoral race and the violent tactics being used against protestors .
In the midst of all this , the leader of the Inochi wo Mamoru Kai ( Saving Life Society ) , Kinjo Yuji passed away .
It was a tough time , yet the movement survived .
The anti-base movement was brought together again with the January 2010 election of Inamine Susumu as mayor of Nago on an anti-base ticket .
9
Earlier there had been change on the prefectural level : at the 2008 Okinawa Prefectural Assembly elections , LDP - Komeito lost its majority , allowing the assembly to pass a resolution opposing construction of a new base on 18 July 2008.10
Then during the 2009 general election , the LDP - Komeito coalition lost all its parliamentary seats in Okinawa .
This was a backlash against the government on the bases issue , and also over the deeply unpopular healthcare reforms adversely affecting the elderly .
The new extent of unanimity in Okinawan opposition to the Henoko plan was demonstrated on 24 February 2010 when ‘ Okinawa assembly members voted unanimously to adopt a written request urging the central government to relocate the Futenma base outside the prefecture .
’11
With the exception of the governor , the entire Okinawan leadership was now in the hands of anti-base forces , and even the Governor has faced tremendous pressure to reject the Henoko plan .
Following the wave of optimism that accompanied the victory of the Democratic Party of Japan in the August 2009 elections on a specific pledge to move bases outside the prefecture , or outside of Japan , serious doubts have arisen about the base decision .
In the face of intense US pressure , the DPJ is actively exploring alternative base sites including Henoko and other Okinawan islands as well as on mainland Japan and in Guam .
Of course , even if the Hatoyama administration succeeds in honoring its election pledge to move Futenma out of the prefecture or out of Japan altogether , this would not be more than a slight dent in the US military presence in Japan : at present ( March 2010 ) comprising 85 facilities covering 77,000 acres of land , and numbering 36,000 on - shore personnel and 11,000 personnel afloat .
12 Nor would this halt the increased integration of US and Japanese military forces , a process which is accelerating .
The US military continues to conduct live - fire exercises in Yausubetsu .
Indeed , the majority of SDF facilities are used jointly by the Japanese and US militaries on a daily basis , as are a number of civilian facilities such as ports and airports .
Marines training with GSDF soldiers at Yausubetsu , March 2008 .
So while all attention is focused on Futenma , what is actually occurring is the ‘ Okinawaization ’ of Japan .
As former marine Allen Nelson has testified , during the Vietnam War Okinawa was used as a training location for soldiers en route to Vietnam .
13
This role seems to be being extended across Japan .
The political need to reduce the burden on Okinawa was the underlying reason for the relocation of US Marine Corps live fire drills from Okinawa to Yausubetsu in 1997 , and those ‘ skills ’ practiced in Hokkaido have been exported to conflicts in other parts of the globe .
As Saito Mitsumasa has demonstrated , the Misawa base in Aomori has long been a key part of the projection of US nuclear strike capability in Asia , which makes a mockery of Japan ’s three non-nuclear principles ( as does the much more public revelations of the ‘ secret pacts ’ during the Cold War to allow nuclear weapons into Japan , which was officially acknowledged by the DPJ government in March 2010 ) .
Furthermore , Misawa is currently being used as a forward staging area for bombing missions in Iraq and Afghanistan .
14
These developments illustrate that US forces are not in Japan for the protection of Japan or peace and stability in Asia , but for the projection of American power throughout Asia and the Pacific , even to the Middle East .
Learning from Maehyang-ri
In the context of the Futenma base clash there are many lessons to be learned from the successful campaigns in Maehyang - ri to shut the firing range .
Of course there are some important differences between Japan and South Korea , too .
But we can summarize the keys to success as follows .
A helicopter gunship blasts an island off the coast of Maehyang - ri .
The first is the political background , namely the democratization of South Korea in the 1980s , and particularly following the 1987 presidential election after years of military dictatorship .
Citizen ’s groups mushroomed , and the anti-base group in Maehyang - ri was founded in 1988 .
Previously , any opposition to the base risked repression as a ‘ North Korean spy ’ .
The Maehyang - ri struggle was an integral part of the democratization process .
Even so , and this is the second point , citizens showed great resilience in the struggle .
Despite democratization they still faced repression and intimidation .
In November 1988 , local residents demanded the removal of the base .
In protest they occupied the base and tried to prevent the live - fire exercises .
They occupied the base again in 1989 and risked their lives to stop the exercises .
In response the American military forbade entry to the base .
In retribution they dumped four trucks worth of sand on Chun Man - kyu ’s fields .
When irate local people tried to occupy the base , 50 people including Chun were arrested .
Then in 2000 after the incident in which an A - 10 plane dropped its payload causing damage to many homes , the US military continued training as if nothing had happened .
This triggered widespread protests across the country .
Around 40,000 police were deployed .
They arrested 100 protestors , including Chun , and 500 people were injured in clashes .
Despite all these trials , the protest movement persevered until it was eventually able to get the base closed in 2005 .
The role of direct action was vital , as was the resilience people showed in the face of the risks that direct action entailed .
Chun Man - kyu inspects the ordinance littering the beach of Maehyang - ri .
Third , international solidarity in the anti-base movement was also vital .
Chun ’s active development of links with groups in other countries ( Marines Go Home shows him on his September 2003 visit to the Yausubetsu firing range meeting Kawase Hanji ) raised the profile of Maehyang - ri .
It became a rallying call for the anti-bases movement , alongside the campaign to stop US navy live - fire exercises on Vieques , Puerto Rico .
In fact , the Maehyang - ri protestors learned one of their most effective strategies from Japan .
In Yokota , for many years Japanese citizens had been filing lawsuits against the US military and Japanese government on the basis of noise pollution caused by US jets using the base .
In 1998 , 15 residents of Maehyang - ri filed similar suits , which ended in victory in the courts in 2003 .
The base was breaking Korean law regarding the levels of noise pollution , so local people had “ a real case to present to the government ” .
15 The verdict pronounced for the first time that the noise pollution from the American base was unlawful .
Each plaintiff was awarded about 10,000 dollars in damages .
Following this , in 2001 a further 2,000 plaintiffs sued the Korean government .
The ruling in December 2004 ordered the government to pay total damages of 10 million dollars .
The legal victory over noise pollution at Maehyang - ri has a counterpart in the lawsuit filed in San Francisco that the construction of the Henoko base would violate the National Historic Preservation Act .
The court found in favor of the plaintiffs in January 2008.16
This should have provided the appropriate legal barrier to the Henoko base issue , although the US and Japanese governments forged ahead in signing the Guam Treaty in 2009 , which is an agreement to do something already declared illegal by the courts .
17
But , as in the Henoko case , we cannot decontextualize the Maehyang - ri campaigns from broader US military strategy .
The current US strategy in South Korea stresses the creation of ‘ hub bases ’ .
The Maehyang - ri firing range may have closed , but farmers have been evicted from their land around the Songtan Air Base ( also known as Osan Air Base ) and the army base Camp Humphries in Pyeongtaek to expand the bases there .
This occurred during the presidency of President Roh Moo-hyun , a lawyer and central figure in the democratization movement .
The Pyeongtak struggle was fierce .
In 2005 around 200 farming households were thrown off their land under a compulsory land acquisition order .
Having been removed from their land they also lost their livelihoods .
The farmers and their supporters continued to resist , but the Korean government deployed 10,000 police and 1,000 troops .
They cordoned off the villages and moved in heavy equipment to destroy the farmland and buildings .
The final villagers were forced to leave in April 2007.18
This is not to say that the Kooni firing range in Maehyang - ri was shut down because it was unnecessary : it had often been called the best firing range in Asia by the US military .
Ultimately , Maehyang - ri was breaking Korean law and untenable in the face of local opposition .
But when it was shut down , training was simply shifted to other South Korean facilities , Alaska , Okinawa or elsewhere .
Bases will not be returned because they are ‘ not needed ’ .
Neither is it a question of saying that a base can be closed when an alternative is found .
Anti-base forces are not interested in saying ‘ not in my back yard ’ .
We are saying ‘ not in anyone ’s back yard ’ to the over 1,000 overseas bases that the US military maintains throughout the world .
A Global Struggle
In 2005 I attended the fifth World Social Forum in Porto Alegre , Brazil .
I showed a 15 - minute segment of Marines Go Home ( at the time still under production ) .
It was not easy to screen the film outside in a tent , or to give the accompanying talk in English , but it was warmly received .
A Korean woman asked me to explain more about the Henoko struggle , Indian and American participants shook my hand , and a person from Iraq pointed out that ‘ Marines Go Home ’ is a slogan there , too .
I really felt as if the messages of Kawase Hanji , Chun Man-kyu and all the activists in Henoko were resonating elsewhere .
It is all too easy to see base struggles in isolation , but in reality there are similar issues in many places .
Japanese people are often surprised to learn that anti-base protests exist in the US , too .
In 2006 I spent a lot of time in the US collecting materials for our next film , America Banzai : crazy as usual ( official site here ) .
With colleagues in the Southwest Workers Union ( who I had met through WSF ) , I learned about the fight against the environmental damage and noise pollution caused by the Kelly Air Force Base ( since 2001 the Kelly Field Annex , part of the Lackland Air Force base in San Antonio , Texas ) .
The base had handled nuclear and chemical weapons .
Waste was just dumped into local creeks causing serious health problems from cancer to birth defects .
Local residents protested on numerous occasions to the air force and US government .
Only after Kelly Air Force base closed were the causes of the health problems partially disclosed , but the air force and government never admitted any responsibility or compensated residents .
Some of those activists appeared in America Banzai .
In 2009 , a number of people who had appeared in America Banzai visited Japan to take part in a speaking tour to similarly affected places in Japan : Kanagawa , Iwakuni and Okinawa .
The discussions of the damage caused by the Kelly Air Force base made quite an impression .
Many Japanese think that the base issue exemplifies an American double standard by which things that would not be permitted in the US are forced onto Japan .
This is not the case .
Both countries suffer from the same problems .
Whether in Japan , South Korea or the US , the fundamental problem is the government and military riding roughshod over local people .
One senses , however , a heavy element of racism and discrimination surrounding the bases issue .
In the case of Kelly Air Force Base , most local residents were poor Mexicans .
Laws , it seems , are adhered to more closely when the people harmed by the bases are not the poor , indigenous peoples , immigrants , Japanese , Koreans or others .
Given the complexity of the bases issue , there is little reason for confidence that President Obama and Prime Minister Hatoyama will bring much ‘ change ’ , despite the moods of public optimism following the launches of their respective administrations in 2009 .
However , Prime Minister Hatoyama ’s decision to delay a final verdict on the Futenma base has at least provided a chance to increase discussion of the bases issue in the Japanese media .
What has ensued is a major power struggle between popular local opposition to bases and the powerful vested interests promoting them .
One can only hope that come May , when Prime Minister Hatoyama announces his decision , he chooses the will of the Okinawan people over the demands of the US .
After all , would that not be fulfilling the ideals that America has so frequently used as an excuse to go to war : the spread of democracy , and the respect for the will of the people that democracy entails .

After five years of research and three months of testing off the islands of Hawaii , scientists say the first underwater robot explorers powered solely by the ocean are ready for use .
So far , all vehicles exploring the depths of the oceans have faced the possibility of running out of fuel , which made scientists wonder if there was any way that the ocean itself could power the vehicle .
The answer came in the form of the Sounding Oceanographic Langrangrian Observer Thermal RECharging vehicle ( or SOLO - TREC , for short ) - - a vehicle driven entirely by the natural temperature differences found in the ocean .
The vehicle , a joint project involving NASA , the U.S. Navy , the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , and the University of California at San Diego , completed its testing phase successfully , and scientists hope it can soon be deployed for research projects around the world .
Researchers say
this technology breakthrough could usher in a new generation of autonomous underwater vehicles capable of virtually indefinite ocean monitoring for climate and marine animal studies , exploration and surveillance [ PhysOrg ] .
NASA 's Jack Jones says the fact that the robot just keeps going and going , like an aquatic Energizer bunny , brings humanity a little closer to an impossible dream :
" People have long dreamed of a machine that produces more energy than it consumes and runs indefinitely ....
While not a true perpetual motion machine , since we actually consume some environmental energy , the prototype system demonstrated by [ NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ] and its partners can continuously monitor the ocean without a limit on its lifetime imposed by energy supply " [ CNET ] .
SOLO - TREC works by harvesting temperature changes within the oceans ’ waters as it moves vertically between warmer , shallower waters and the colder depths .
Ten tubes filled with waxy substances called phase - change materials are crucial to its operations .
When the water is warm , the substance melts and expands ; when it ’s colder , it solidifies and contracts .
The expansion of the wax pressurizes oil stored inside the float .
This oil periodically drives a hydraulic motor that generates electricity and recharges the vehicle 's batteries [ PhysOrg ] .
These batteries then power the float 's hydraulic system , which changes the robot 's buoyancy and allows the float to move vertically , and also power the explorer 's on - board systems like GPS and communication devices .
Since November , using only the energy generated by the ocean , SOLO - TREC has completed more than 300 dives , reaching depths of 1,640 feet .
The JPL / Scripps team now plans on using the robot explorer for a variety of projects , with Russ Davis , a Scripps oceanographer , saying : " With further engineering refinement , SOLO - TREC has the potential to augment ocean monitoring currently done by the 3,200 battery - powered Argo floats "
[ PhysOrg ] .
The international Argo array has been used to measure temperature , salinity , and velocity across the planet ’s oceans .
Here 's a map of SOLO - TREC 's journey off the waters off Hawaii :

Melting sea ice in the Arctic will kill thousands of bears in coming years , the US says , and continued commercial trade must not be allowed to make the situation worse
It is a familiar story in the climate change debate .
The US government is at odds with the rest of the world and , despite criticism , wants other countries to change their minds and fall in line behind Uncle Sam .
This time , the tale comes with an unexpected twist .
This weekend , the US will warn that the threat from climate change to the survival of the polar bear is so great that the world must grant it the highest possible protection .
At the meeting of the international body that regulates trade in animals , the US will push for a total ban on the sale and movement of polar bear products that are used for furs , rugs and taxidermy .
Melting sea ice in the Arctic will kill thousands of bears in coming years , the US says , and continued commercial trade must not be allowed to make the situation worse .
Other countries , including US neighbours and keen polar bear traders , Canada , disagree .
The US has put its proposal to the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species ( Cites ) , which meets every two - three years and tomorrow begins its 12 - day meeting in Doha , Qatar .
Governments from 175 countries will discuss dozens of such proposals , which could help determine the fate of , among others , elephants , tigers , rhinos and the world 's dwindling stocks of bluefin tuna .
" 2010 is a key year for biological diversity , " said Achim Steiner , head of the United Nations Environment Programme , which runs Cites .
" It is the year when the world was supposed to have reversed the rate of loss of our biodiversity .
This has not happened .
The international community must re-engage and renew its efforts to meet this goal .
Cites is an important part of this response . "
The US wants polar bears promoted to Cites appendix I , which brings an automatic ban on trade .
In its proposal it says : " Sea ice changes will likely negatively impact polar bears by increasing energetic demands of seeking prey .
As changes in habitat become more severe and seasonal rates of change more rapid , catastrophic mortality events that have yet to be realised on a large scale are expected to occur . "
It adds : " A precautionary approach , which includes polar bears in Cites appendix I , is necessary to ensure that primarily commercial trade does not compound the threats posed to the species by loss of habitat . "
Biologists reckon there are 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears in the Arctic , spread across 19 geographical sub-populations .
Last year the polar bear specialist group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature said that numbers in eight of these groups were declining , three are stable and one , a group of under 300 animals around Canada 's M'Clintock Channel , is increasing .
The state of the other seven groups is unclear .
The US plan is backed by Egypt and Rwanda , but other nations , including Europe , are expected to vote against .
Canada , which exports skins and products from about 300 polar bears legally shot each year , says the trade is insignificant compared to the threat of global warming .
There are also doubts about whether the polar bear meets the required criteria for appendix I listing .
In its official response to the US proposal , the Cites secretariat recommend it is rejected .
" The global population of polar bears does not appear to be small .
The area of distribution of this species extends over several million square kilometres and is clearly not restricted at present , " it says .
" There is insufficient evidence that the species has undergone a marked decline in population size in the wild large enough . "
The Cites meeting will also trigger a new round in a long - running debate about the sale of ivory harvested from African elephants .
Trade in ivory was banned in 1989 , though Cites has permitted one - off sales of government stocks from countries including Botswana , South Africa and Japan .
The $ 20 m raised from the sales were channelled towards elephant conservation , but critics say they encourage poaching and illegal trade .
Tanzania and Zambia will this year push to be allowed a similar sale of ivory stocks , though other African nations such as Ghana , Kenya and Mali have signalled they will vote against the plan .
All proposals need a two - thirds majority to pass .
Other Cites proposals include moves to control unregulated trade in corals and sharks , including the porbeagle , spiny dogfish and three species of hammerhead , as well as the proposed ban on bluefin tuna trade .
" The marine theme of this year 's Cites conference is particularly striking , " said Willem Wijnstekers , Cites secretary - general .
" Cites is increasingly seen as a valuable tool to achieve the target of restoring depleted fish stocks by 2015 to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield . "
Not all the proposals reflect shrinking biodiversity .
Mexico and Egypt want to relax
Cites controls on local species of crocodile they argue have recovered sufficiently in the wild .
Monaco has proposed adding the bluefin tuna to Cites appendix 1 , which brings an automatic ban in trade .
The giant fish can grow to 3 m and weigh more than half a tonne .
Much sought after as a delicacy and for sushi , a single fish reportedly sold earlier this year for $ 120,000 .
Populations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean have crashed in recent decades and there is no sign that efforts to introduce more sustainable fishing practices have slowed the decline .
Scientists say stocks are about 15 % of what they were before industrial fishing began .
The proposed change is backed by the US and Europe , which wants a 12 - month delay on any trade ban .
Japan has indicated it may opt out from Cites controls if it is passed .
It wants bluefin conservation to be managed by regional fishery bodies and blames the fish decline on European countries for setting unrealistic quotas and ignoring illegal fishing .
Not the biggest fanbase — that 's a totally different ballgame .
No , we 're talking about the most passionate , enthusiastic devoted fans : Doctor Who , Twilight , Firefly ?
Who wins ?

Last night , at New York City 's VIllage East Cinema , BBC America hosted a public screening of the Doctor Who season premiere , " The Eleventh Hour . "
And , while New Yorkers have seen lots of people lining up on the street for lots of things , the block - long queue for the Who event had more than one passerby asking — while not realizing the lameness of the pun — " Who knew ? "

And yet , inside the theater , those fans squeeed at the top of their lungs every time the new Doctor , Matt Smith , appeared on screen , or tousled his hair , or said something keen , or looked at his new Companion Amy Pond ( Karen Gillen ) .
They shred their vocal chords when Smith , Gillen , and head Who writer Steven Moffat came out for a Q&A session .
Now , we 've all seen the gathered masses of genre fans before — the Twihards at San Diego Comic Con , the wee wizards that came out for each Harry Potter novel 's release — but this show of hitherto unrecognized Whomania got us wondering , who 's got the most rabid fanbase ?

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Shadows in the Cloud Posted by Mikko @ 14:23 GMT
You might remember the Ghostnet white paper that was released a year ago ?
We blogged about it extensively .
The same researchers , with the help of Shadowserver Foundation , has now published a new whitepaper , called Shadows In The Cloud : Investigating Cyber Espionage 2.0 ( link to a PDF ) .
This investigation into targeted attacks ( � la " Operation Aurora " ) is very extensive and well worth a read .
It includes technical analysis of the espionage methods as well as overview of the operation methods of the attackers .
The report even goes on to name likely targets .
To quote the beginning of the paper :
Main Findings
Complex cyber espionage network
Documented evidence of a cyber espionage network that compromised government , business , and academic computer systems in India , the Office of the Dalai Lama , and the United Nations .
Numerous other institutions , including the Embassy of Pakistan in the United States , were also compromised .
Some of these institutions can be positively identified , while others cannot .
Theft of classified and sensitive documents
Recovery and analysis of exfiltrated data , including one document that appears to be encrypted diplomatic correspondence , two documents marked �SECRET� , six as �RESTRICTED� , and five as �CONFIDENTIAL � .
These documents are identified as belonging to the Indian government .
However , we do not have direct evidence that they were stolen from Indian government computers and they may have been compromised as a result of being copied onto personal computers .
The recovered documents also include 1,500 letters sent from the Dalai Lama�s office between January and November 2009 .
The profile of documents recovered suggests that the attackers targeted specific systems and profiles of users .
Evidence of collateral compromise
A portion of the recovered data included visa applications submitted to Indian diplomatic missions in Afghanistan .
This data was voluntarily provided to the Indian missions by nationals of 13 countries as part of the regular visa application process .
In a context like Afghanistan , this finding points to the complex nature of the information security challenge where risks to individuals ( or operational security ) can occur as a result of a data compromise on secure systems operated by trusted partners .
Command - and - control infrastructure that leverages cloud - based social media services
Documentation of a complex and tiered command and control infrastructure , designed to maintain persistence .
The infrastructure made use of freely available social media systems that include Twitter , Google Groups , Blogspot , Baidu Blogs , blog.com and Yahoo Mail .
This top layer directed compromised computers to accounts on free web hosting services , and as the free hosting servers were disabled , to a stable core of command and control servers located in the People 's Republic of China .
Links to Chinese hacking community
Evidence of links between the Shadow network and two individuals living in Chengdu to the underground hacking community in the People 's Republic of China .
The best books on social and economic collapse are from Tainter and Quigley .
They are the best since they both provide systemic models of collapse that can apply across all historical instances .
For example , Tainter sees civilization as problem solving system that collapses when it begins to succumb to diseconomies of complexity .
Quigley sees civilization as a patchwork of wealth / solution creation engines that fail when they become self - serving institutions ( organizations that perpetuate the problem they were built to solve ) that fight renewal .
Better yet , the models they propose are not mutually exclusive .
They compliment each other , Tainter 's model anticipates increasing turbulence ( the crisis of 2008 ) and Quigley 's anticipates systemic predation ( like the financial oligarchy ) .
However , as good as these theoretical models are , they miss one critical insight .
It occurred to me while reading these works in conjunction with Elinor Ostrom 's work on self - managed resource commons ( everything from fisheries to irrigation systems ) .
The common finding is that every system is unique at the local level .
No two irrigation systems are the same .
No two fisheries are the same , etc .
Further , the problems they represent are all rapidly changing , in that what 's required to effectively manage them is divergent .
This implies that complex societies , over time , develop a yawning mismatch between the local and the general .
More formally :
The need for evolutionary advances at the local level will always outstrip the pace of evolutionary change at the center .
When the mismatch grows too large , the entire system collapses .
I suspect this applies not only to governance ( politics , bureaucracy and legal systems ) but also to markets , in that the centralization of markets works against the development of local wealth ( scale requirements , predatory behavior , etc. ) .
Of course , this is also very similar to the problem I saw in John Boyd 's decision making models ( see " Open Decision Making " for more ) .
It also implies that a workable solution to this problem ( as well as the drivers of collapse outlined by Tainter and Quigley ) is to return sovereignty and autonomy to the local , to the extent possible , to enable massively parallel decision making .
The only way I can envision this working is through the establishment of resilient communities ( aka , a semi-autonomous polis ) that is economically self - sufficient , able to protect itself , and highly democratic .
NOTE : Wow , thinking deeply today .
Hope you enjoy .
Gambling on political races is illegal in California , but if you find yourself in Las Vegas and are looking for a surefire ( legal ) bet , consider putting some cash on California Senator Barbara Boxer winning re-election in November .
The odds could be quite good .
After all , the election year drumbeat that Boxer is in trouble has already begun , with even the March 2 New York Times declaring in a headline story that “ early polls ” show that Boxer is “ showing signs of vulnerability . ”
The article never identifies these polls , but they are probably the same ones that had Boxer on the ropes against Matt Fong in 1998 ( she won by 10 % ) and on life support against “ moderate ” Bill Jones in 2004 ( she won by 20 % ) .
A traditional media that reveres corporate - owned “ centrists ” like John McCain and Evan Bayh has trouble understanding why an outspoken progressive like Boxer keeps piling up big election wins — and will do so again this fall .
If it ’s early in a Barbara Boxer re-election year , then you can count on stories arguing that the popular incumbent is in “ trouble . ”
Those who argue that the United States is a “ center right country ” have difficulty accepting that Boxer is popular precisely because she has not betrayed her progressive principles .
Boxer Maintains Her Base
The Democrats likely to face troubles this fall are those that have generated little enthusiasm , if not outright hostility , from the Party ’s core base .
In contrast , Barbara Boxer retains the strong loyalty of environmentalists , labor unions , women , Latinos , and the other key Democratic constituencies .
While the New York Times states that the California G.O.P. “ Smells Democratic Blood , ” these same feelings were expressed in the 2000 , 2004 , and 2008 presidential races , and in virtually every recent statewide election that has seen California Republican candidates fail miserably .
Republican Governor Schwarzenegger ’s approval ratings are lower than that of former President George W. Bush , which shows that as unpopular as Democrats are in the state , Republicans are less so .
Boxer ’s base will be highly motivated to keep her in office , and she will wage the type of spirited campaigns that she has conducted since winning a seat on the Marin County Board of Supervisors in 1976 .
I met Boxer during her 1982 congressional primary campaign , and she was a bundle of energy then and remains so today .
As for Boxer ’s age , she is younger than Jerry Brown , who will top the California Democratic ticket in November .
And the two leading potential Republican opponents are both over 55 , so age will not be a factor .
Carly Fiorina and Tom Campbell
While Tea Party backer Chuck DeVore is also a candidate , the threats to Boxer ’s seat come from Carly Fiorina , an extremely unpopular failed Hewlett Packard executive , and Tom Campbell , the second coming of the last GOP challenger to Boxer , former Secretary of State Bill Jones .
Boxer will so badly out - campaign Fiorina that they may have to stop the campaign prior to November and declare a technical knockout .
I can just imagine all those independents rushing to back a candidate who got a huge buyout while laying off workers .
The media loves candidates like Campbell , who exhibited principles early in his career but to win higher political office has become a carbon - copy , anti-tax GOP corporate hack .
Campbell thinks he can cut into Boxer ’s support because he is pro-choice , but this means he will lose far more votes from Republican right - wingers who will sit out the race .
The media always promotes Republicans like Campbell or John McCain who are reactionary and corporate - owned on most issues but have a few stands that are common to Democrats .
This makes them “ mavericks , ” and allegedly shows they can appeal to Democrats .
This might work if Boxer were a Blanche Lincoln Democrat .
But she is a Democrat out of the Phil and John Burton school ( she was once a congressional aide to John ) , and her record and campaign style will create a sharp distinction between herself and either of her opponents .
I like Boxer by 8 % over Campbell , and double that over Fiorina .
And if there is a Tea Party candidate in the race as well , Boxer ’s victory margin could approach 2004 levels .

MIAMI — Tiger Woods has summoned someone even more significant than swing coach Hank Haney to help facilitate his wildly anticipated comeback .
Two sources in the golf community have told The Post that Ari Fleischer , the former presidential advisor to George W. Bush and the man who was brought in to help repair the steroid - shattered image of Mark McGwire , has been huddling with Woods , plotting a strategy for his return to golf — at the Arnold Palmer Invitational starting March 25 at Bay Hill in Orlando , Fla .
“ They were in his living room this week going over a strategy for how to handle Bay Hill in two weeks , ” one source told The Post .
TIGER GALS COMPETE ON HOWARD STERN SHOW ( PHOTOS )
MANY WOMEN OF TIGER WOODS
The other source told The Post , “ I would be shocked if he did n’t play the Arnold Palmer . ”
Palmer himself reportedly has told some close confidants that Woods is definitely playing Bay Hill .
Quietly , the people running the tournament are preparing for a larger - than - usual media crush .
Meanwhile , Mark O’Meara , Woods ’ longtime friend and neighbor , told Golf Channel yesterday that he “ would n’t be surprised ” to see Woods make his anticipated return at the Tavistock Cup , a made - for - TV inter - club event on March 22 - 23 at Isleworth , Woods ’ home course outside of Orlando .
O’Meara said the two - day exhibition matches might be a “ nice way ” for Woods to “ ease back into the whole situation . ”
“ It ’s been a rough road the last three or four months in Tiger ’s life and his family ’s life , ” O’Meara said .
“ It ’s a very difficult situation .
Golf is what Tiger does , and possibly part of the healing process is to get back at it . ”
In a fascinating subplot to the ongoing Woods saga it appears Fleischer is a big part of helping that healing process .
Knowing he eventually has to stand before everyone publicly and take questions — something he did n’t do in that bizarre orchestrated 131⁄2 - minute ramble on Feb. 19 — is why Woods sought out the advice of Fleischer , who in 2008 formed Ari Fleischer Sports Communications .
The firm , which focuses on crisis response and control , is a joint venture with IMG Sports & Entertainment .
Woods is represented by IMG .
Several calls to Fleischer went unreturned yesterday and messages left for Mark Steinberg , Woods ’ personal IMG advisor , also went unanswered .
Fleischer , who served as presidential press secretary from January 2001 to July 2003 before leaving for a career as a consultant , worked with McGwire after the disgraced slugger had gone into hiding following his embarrassing refusal to answer questions about his steroid use before a congressional committee in 2005 .
Before his recent public admission to using steroids , necessitated in part by his return to the Cardinals as a hitting instructor , McGwire was advised by Fleischer .
The NFL and Major League Baseball also are among Fleischer ’s high - profile clients .
He advised the Packers in 2008 on how to deal with the fallout from their breakup with Brett Favre and he ’s worked with college football ’s BCS on how to repair an image that has been ridiculed .

The one time we * do * wanna use ENDA to put FRC out of business
by Jeremy Hooper
Last week we showed you a preview for a rabidly fallacious new video that the Family Research Council has produced in conjunction with its new " Fight ENDA " website .
But now we can save you the $ 14.95 that FRC is charging for the unreasoned hit piece , as conservative videographer Derek Packard ( who seems to have shot / directed the video for FRC ) has gone ahead and posted the whole darn thing to his embeddable social networking accounts .
What you 'll see in the clips : " Expert " commentary from Peter " I 'd like to export / criminalize gays " Sprigg ; Continued misrepresentation of the Ocean Grove , NJ , tax situation ; use of our North American Northern neighbor as a fear - mongering tool , as if they 've adopted South Park " Blame Canada " song as a guiding hymn ; complete non-acknowledgement of the fact that ENDA has religious exemptions ; ham - fisted usage of background music to tell the viewer whether they should be uplifted or scared ; general fear all around .
Enjoy :
1 - ENDA Open - Final from Derek Packard on Vimeo .
REALITY : The main issue with Marcia Walden 's employment situation was in how she handled her Christian beliefs while working to provide counseling services to CDC employees .
When a lesbian CDC employee came to Ms. Walden for a session , rather than simply saying she could n't handle a certain counseling assignment for unspecified reasons , the counselor made it clear that her " personal values " in opposition to same - sex relationships prevented her from doing the job , and therefore forced her to refer the openly gay person to a colleague instead .
According to court documents , Ms. Walden 's bosses worked with her to see how they could better handle similar situations in the future , so that they could respect Ms. Walden 's beliefs , LGBT CDC employees ' rights , and the fragile work that comes with counseling someone whose emotional state ( especially in the first session ) is unknown .
But according to these same court documents , Ms. Walden was unwilling to budge , suggesting that she would be " lying " or " dishonest " to not come right out and tell LGBT people why she could n't counsel them .
Just last month , Ms. Walden ( repped by the rabidly homo - hostile ADF ) lost her case in North GA District Court [** Download pdf of ruling here ]
FICTION :
2 - ENDA Marcia 's Story - Final from Derek Packard on Vimeo .
REALITY : Canada is a lovely place .
LGBT rights support has only grown over the past decades .
Gays and not even close to the " controversy " they are in the US -- and that 's a good thing !
Lifesite " news " is a VERY over - the - top organization .
They have been known to go even beyond American outlets , citing discredited ( and professionally disassociated ) researchers like Paul Cameron as credible .
FICTION :
3 -ENDA - Just Look at Canada - Final from Derek Packard on Vimeo .
REALITY :
The church pavilion in question in the next video was receiving a special tax break under NJ's Green Acres tax - exemption , which requires compliance with state non-discrimination law in order to qualify .
So what they " lost " was a special break on a building that had been offered up as public accommodation , but that that they now wanted to restrict to only the heterosexual public .
FICTION :
4 - The Ocean Grove Story - final from Derek Packard on Vimeo .
REALITY : ENDA 's religious exemptions explicitly state that religious schools are not subject to ENDA .
FICTION :
5 -ENDA Impact on Education - Final from Derek Packard on Vimeo .
REALITY : The Employment NonDiscrimination
Act simply takes away employers ' ( with more than 15 employees ) right to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity , the same way similar protections prevent bias on the basis of skin color , race , sex , national origin , or yes -- RELIGION .
ENDA does not take away their ability to gauge qualifications in other areas .
And in terms of faith - based businesses that are not specifically covered under ENDA 's religious exemptions :
The owners will still retain every right to gauge their potential worker bee 's skill set , dress code , work ethic , attitude towards the business ' mission , competence , etc .
In short :
He or she will totally retain the right to say " do n't call us , we 'll call you " to any potential hire who does n't fit the business ' calling .
The only thing ENDA prevents is the idea that one 's sexual orientation or gender expression can and / or should be an immediate disqualification .
It does not create quotas .
It does n't eliminate any other employment considerations .
It does not eliminate the whole host of factors that go into an employer 's payrolling process .
It does n't force PETA to hire a gay hunter who comes to his interview with deer guts on his vest .
It simply curbs bias -- the same way that we have long worked to curb employment discrimination against religious people ( a quality that 's undeniably a choice , by the way ) !
FICTION :
6 - ENDA Economic Impact - final from Derek Packard on Vimeo .
REALITY : As far as we 're concerned , Peter Sprigg has completely eliminated his deservedness of a microphone by suggesting that gay people should be both exported and criminalized .
FICTION :
7 - ENDA Policy - Peter Sprigg - final from Derek Packard on Vimeo .
Oh , and as for that " syndemic " that Sprigg talks about around 5:13 ?
Well yes , that AIDS research , Ronald Stall , does suggest that childhood abuse , substance abuse , partner violence , and depression affect HIV rates , not only in gay men , but also in " ethnic minorities and the urban poor . "
Which is no surprise :
Anything that would make one feel less control of his or her life and / or worth ( and therefore in less control of his or her safety ) is surely something that deserves focus when talking about STD transmission .
There 's no " irony " in looking at this position compared to Peter Sprigg 's , as Sprigg suggests .
Because Stall 's assessment is meant to reasonably consider what might contribute to a disease -- Sprigg is out to contribute to the factors ( esp. depression and substance abuse ) that leave people vulnerable , and then stigmatize / condemn the person rather than the ailment !
Or forget " irony . "
More accurately :
There is no legitimate comparison between FRC and just about ANY person or group that traffics in credible information , because this supposed " values " organization has made a decided choice to obfuscate rather than inform .
The above seven videos are just more confirmation of that unfortunate ( and highly un- Christian ) fact .

My my my .
The boys in Stuttgart have been mighty busy .
It was n't enough that they built a super - sexy hybrid race car based on the 911 GT3 R .
No , they had to build a plug - in hybrid supercar that might just displace the Audi e-tron as the object of our green car lust .
Porsche lifted the sheet on the 918 Spyder on the eve of the Geneva Motor Show and made some huge claims .
A few things got our attention right off the bat – 718 horsepower , mid-engine V - 8 and two electric motors .
Oh ... and a claimed 78.4 mpg .
We swoon .
As we said , Porsche 's making some big big claims with the 918 Spyder , saying it will do zero to 62 mph in 3.2 seconds , top out at 198 mph and lap the famed Nurburgring in 7.5 minutes , beating even the incredible Carrera GT .
All that acceleration comes from the aforementioned 500 horsepower V - 8 and an electric motor at each end putting down a combined 218 horsepower .
That engine , by the way , was pulled from the RS Spyder race - car parts bin and reworked for the 918 .
Power from the engine and the rear motor hits the street through a seven - speed PDK gearbox .
The front motor turns the front wheels through a fixed ratio .
Juice for the motors is stored in a lithium - ion battery mounted behind the seats .
No specs on the pack .
Porsche gave the car four modes .
E - Drive is for tooling around under electricity alone , and you 've got a range of 16 miles .
Choose Hybrid Mode and you 're using gas and electricity as the circumstances dictate .
Sport Hybrid mode tips the gas - electric equation in favor of performance , sending most of the power to the rear wheels and using torque vectoring to keep things under control .
Flip the switch to Race Hybrid mode and everything is tuned to maximum performance .
If the battery 's carrying enough juice , the motors provide a push - to - pass burst of energy at the touch of a button .
Porsche has n't offered any details on how it arrived at the 78.4 mpg figure , or under what circumstances it might be achieved if this concept ever sees production .
All the gadgetry sits in a carbon - composite monocoque , and Porsche made extensive use of magnesium and aluminum to keep things as light as possible – 3,285 pounds , which is impressive for a car hauling two electric motors , a battery and the related electronics .
People will either love the styling or hate it .
We like the front three - quarter view , but the back end and wheels look better in the renderings than they do on the actual car .
Whatever .
Part of the point of a concept car is to get people talking , and this one definitely will .
A plug - in hybrid Porsche ?
A hybrid Ferrari ?
More electric Audis ?
An electric Mercedes AMG SLS ?
If this is the future of high - performance cars , we say bring it on .

Gaming on Linux ?
That 's not something we hear every day just yet , but it looks like the good folks at Valve might be considering a penguin revolution .
In one of the latest beta releases of Steam for Mac , Phoronix spotted a mention of the open - source platform in the launcher script , and we were also able to verify this code ourselves .
Furthermore , the eagle - eyed Linux blog has previously seen a handful of evidence hinting Linux compatibility for Valve 's Source gaming engine .
We 're probably still a ways off from any announcement ( if ever ) so for now , let 's just leave the guys alone -- we do n't want to distract them from bringing the Portal goodness to our Macs now , do we ?
Almost a year ago , in a Washington Examiner column on the Chrysler bailout , I reflected on the Obama administration 's decision to force bondholders to accept 33 cents on the dollar on secured debts while giving United Auto Worker retirees 50 cents on the dollar on unsecured debts .
This was a clear violation of the ordinary bankruptcy rule that secured creditors are fully paid off before unsecured creditors get anything .
The politically connected UAW folk got preference over politically unconnected bondholders .
" We have just seen an episode of Gangster Government , " I wrote .
" It is likely to be a continuing series . "

Fast forward to last Friday , when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against Goldman Sachs , alleging that the firm violated the law when it sold a collateralized debt obligation based on mortgage - backed securities without disclosing that the CDO was assembled with the help of hedge fund investor John Paulson .
On its face , the complaint seems flimsy .
Paulson has since become famous because his firm made billions by betting against mortgage - backed securities .
But he was n't a big name then , and the sophisticated firm buying the CDO must have assumed the seller believed its value would go down .
That 's not the only fishy thing about the complaint .
Yesterday came the news , undisclosed by the SEC Friday , that the commissioners approved the complaint by a 3 - 2 party - line vote .
Ordinarily , the SEC issues such complaints only when the commissioners unanimously approve .
Fishy thing No. 3 : Democrats immediately used the complaint to jam Sen. Christopher Dodd 's financial regulation through the Senate .
You may want to believe the denials that the Democratic commissioners timed the action in coordination with the administration or congressional leaders .
But then you may want to believe there was no political favoritism in the Chrysler deal , too .
The SEC complaint looks a lot like Gangster Government to me .
The Dodd bill , however , has it trumped .
Its provisions promise to give us one episode of Gangster Government after another .
At the top of the list is the $ 50 billion fund that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp could use to pay off creditors of firms identified as systemically risky -- i.e. , " too big to fail . "
" The Dodd bill , " writes Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman , " has unlimited executive bailout authority .
That 's something Wall Street desperately wants but does n't dare ask for . "
Politically connected creditors would have every reason to assume they 'd get favorable treatment .
The Dodd bill specifically authorizes the FDIC to treat " creditors similarly situated " differently .
Second , as former Bush administration economist Larry Lindsey points out , the Dodd bill gives the Treasury and the FDIC authority to grant an unlimited number of loan guarantees to " too big to fail " firms .
CEOs might want to have receipts for their contributions to Sen.
Charles Schumer and the Obama campaign in hand when they apply .
Lindsey ticks off other special favors .
" Labor gets ' proxy access ' to bring its agenda items before shareholders as well as annual ' say on pay ' for executives .
Consumer activists get a brand new agency funded directly out of the seniorage the Fed earns .
No oversight by the Federal Reserve Board or by Congress on how the money is spent . "
Then there are carve - out provisions provided for particular interests .
" Obtaining a carve - out is n't rocket science , " one Republican K Street lobbyist told the Huffington Post .
" Just give Chairman Dodd and Chuck Schumer a s--- load of money . "
The Obama Democrats portray the Dodd bill as a brave attempt to clamp tougher regulation on Wall Street .
They know that polls show voters strongly reject just about all their programs to expand the size and scope of government , with the conspicuous exception of financial regulation .
Republicans have been accurately attacking the Dodd bill for authorizing bailouts of big Wall Street firms and giving them unfair advantages over small competitors .
They might want to add that it authorizes Gangster Government -- the channeling of vast sums from the politically unprotected to the politically connected .
The elders at Ecclesia Church were expecting something tame from Jackson Potts II for their annual Stations of the Cross art display .
Instead , the 10 - year - old produced a photo of his kid brother being beaten by a police officer .
Jackson says it 's a modern - day interpretation of Roman soldiers beating Jesus .
It 's disturbing and could frighten children , argue church elders , who declined to display it in the church 's art gallery alongside the work of other artists depicting the remaining 14 stations ( the 15th depicts Christ 's resurrection ) .
Jackson and his father , also a photographer , are holding out hope the Midtown church will allow the photo to hang during the city 's FotoFest , a biannual photography celebration that runs until the end of April .
Church officials have offered to let Jackson display his piece for a few hours on March 12 as a compromise .
“ I just want them to display it , ” Jackson said as he sipped a strawberry shake recently .
Most everyone agrees Jackson is a gifted artist .
He 's done several impressive artistic pieces featuring his 7 - year - old brother Dietrich .
He 's also shot weddings and will photograph an upcoming culinary conference .
So it was natural that Ecclesia 's Xnihilo Gallery would invite the boy to participate in its special display , for which photographers create their interpretations of Jesus ' path to crucifixion .
Innocence depicted
Jackson , who was tasked with depicting Jesus ' falling for a second time under the weight of his cross , batted around ideas for weeks .
He settled on covering Dietrich with fake blood and posing him with an adult friend wearing a law officer 's uniform .
“ It 's the innocence of Jesus as a child , ” Jackson said .
“ And a police is like a Roman guard . ”
Early one morning last month he created the picture in a field .
Jackson positioned everyone just right as he shot his frames .
Later he picked out his favorite photo :
It shows the officer raising a club to beat a screaming Dietrich .
Though Ecclesia elders were impressed by Jackson 's work , it made them uneasy .
What if children did n't understand the photo 's symbolism ?
And what if it made them fearful of police or firefighters ?
“ It was a tough decision , but unfortunately it 's not appropriate for this stage , ” said Jeremy Wells , a church elder .
And the fact that the church has featured disturbing photos before , such as a picture of a bloodied Jesus last year ?
“ We talk about the crucifixion .
It 's one thing for a child to understand a story of great sacrifice such as that , ” Wells said .
“ It 's another thing for a child to understand symbolism of this sort .
Especially with child abuse , and it's not just child abuse , it 's police brutality . ”
Boy nixes compromises
Leaders considered compromises such as covering the piece with a drape .
But they finally decided there was no other option but to leave out Jackson 's photo .
They agreed to display it during a reception March 12 , put it on the gallery 's Web site and pay Jackson some monetary compensation .
They 're also inviting him to submit a more appropriate piece .
Neither Jackson nor his father deems that acceptable , although they understand the church 's reasoning .
“ I 'm not oblivious to the fact that a police officer beating a child might cause people concern , ” said Jack Potts , Jackson 's dad .
“ But the offensive image is appropriate for the stations of a cross . ”

After being rocked by a series of high - profile scandals , ACORN ( the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ) is disbanding as its funding has vanished and debts have climbed .
It is reportedly closing April 1 .
The group , which was one of the longest running and most active community organizations focused on poor and working class families , became the center of controversy last summer when conservative activists secretly recorded ACORN employees appearing to give advice on skirting tax laws .
Before that , however , ACORN was the center of scandal over an embezzlement coverup and charges of voter fraud .
ACORN said in a statement released Monday , according to Reuters , that it has been the target of a “ series of well - orchestrated , relentless , well - funded right wing attacks . ”
While no criminal charges followed the video sting on several ACORN offices , an independent inquiry said the episode was an example of ACORN falling short “ of living its principles ” and leaving itself “ vulnerable to public embarrassment . ”
Criminal investigations in many states did follow the voter registration forgeries , in which some ACORN employees allegedly filed phony registration forms , for instance , with names like " Mickey Mouse . "
While many conservative politicians , including Arizona Sen.
John McCain ( R ) during his presidential bid , attempted to portray the fraud as part of a broader political conspiracy , ACORN has said the incidents were merely the work of lazy voter registration workers .
The series of controversies led many Congressional lawmakers to back the Defund Acorn Act , which a US judge ruled unconstitutional earlier this month because the measure singled out a particular group for punishment .
Still , the damage was done by the videotape scandal and the other controversies swirling around ACORN , which many conservatives have long viewed as an organization intent on using federal dollars to spread a liberal agenda .
In recent months , ACORN chapters in New York and California have split from the group to continue similar work under a different name .
While ACORN 's national organization plans to disband , the group ’s housing wing is expected to remain intact , but under a different name .
The perseverance of ACORN Housing , which is now called the Affordable Housing Centers of America , leads many to suggest that while the organization is shedding its formal structure , it will return under a new name .
Matthew Vadum , of the conservative Washington Capital Research Center , said ACORN 's demise is being exaggerated .
While many questions remain about its future , he said , " one thing ’s for sure : ACORN will rise from the grave as soon as it thinks the coast is clear . "
Many programmers do n’t really understand recursion – it ’s a fact , I ’ve seen it time and time again .
Even when we understand how it works , we tend to only use it by rote , on problems that we expect to have recursive solutions .
For example , we know that a recursive function is the best way to traverse a tree in order – it ’s in every textbook and so that is how we do it .
There are other problems , that we can come up with , which have intuitively recursive solutions and we do n’t have too much trouble with those .
It ’s when a problem is not intuitively recursive , but has a recursive solution , that is where the difference between being able to use it and really understanding it comes out .
Incidentally , this also makes a very good case for the value of math skills in a programming context .
Let me demonstrate by looking at Towers of Hanoi as a programming exercise .
Solving Towers Of Hanoi Intuitively
The Towers of Hanoi problem is very well understood .
You have 3 pegs ( A , B , C ) and a number of discs ( usually 8 ) we want to move all the discs from the source peg ( peg A ) to a destination peg ( peg B ) , while always making sure that a bigger disc never ends up on top of a smaller one .
It is a pretty simple puzzle and you can quickly work out the correct sequence to move the discs and solve the problem .
But , what if you need to translate your solution into code ?
For those of you who are aware that this problem has a simple recursive solution , pretend to forget it for a second :) .
Being the good problem solvers that we are , we will approach this methodically .
To solve the Towers of Hanoi programmatically , we need to find a pattern that will easily lend itself to being expressed in code .
While it might seem like it should be obvious ( after all we can easily move the disks around to solve it ) it is actually very elusive .
Before reading any further , do try and come up with the most intuitive solution that you can for this problem ( and do n’t cheat by looking it up : ) ) .
Once you have it , try and code it to work out all the bugs , go ahead , I ’ll wait :) .
If it took you less than an hour , you ’re a much smarter developer than I am .
I came up with several possible intuitive solutions and got bogged down with every one of them before I got one that worked .
Here is the pattern that I noticed which produced a working solution .
We start with X number of discs , and assign a parity to each one depending on whether we have an odd or an even number of discs .
For example , if we start with 3 discs , the smallest disc ( disc 1 ) will be odd , the next one ( disc 2 ) will be even , and the last one ( disc 3 ) will be odd .
But if we start with 4 discs , disc 1 will be even , disc 2 will be odd and so forth .
Every disc with the same parity always moves through the same pattern when it comes to their turn to be shifted .
Lets assume our three pegs are A , B , and C with A being the source peg ( where all discs start ) and B being the destination peg ( where all discs end up ) , I call C the pivot peg .
If a disc has an odd parity , it always moves in the following pattern A -> B -> C ->
A etc .
If a disc has an even parity , it always moves like so A -> C -> B ->
A etc .
If we capture these rules , then the last thing we need to do is to work out which disk to move on every iteration .
This is simple , we always , move the smallest disk we can , that was n’t shifted in the previous iteration .
Feel free to walk through all of this yourself , but I will save you the trouble since I coded all of it up , so I know it works :) .
Here are the relevant code snippets :
```ruby class IterativeHanoi include HanoiHelpers EVEN_PARITY = “ even ” ODD_PARITY = “ odd ”
def initialize ( options={:discs => 8} ) @discs = options [ : discs ] @pegs = { : from => [ ] , : to => [ ] , : pivot => [ ] } @peg_array = [ @pegs [ : from ] , @pegs [ : to ] , @pegs [ : pivot ] ] @discs.downto(1 ) do |num| @pegs [ : from ] << num end @disc_parities = assign_parities @move_rules_by_parity = movement_rules_by_parity end end```
We initialize the class with the number of discs we want to use for our problem .
We create three arrays to represent out pegs ( source , destination and pivot ) and fill the source array with numbers to represent out discs .
In the case of 3 discs , the initial state of the problem will look like this .
------- 1 2 3 ------- A B C -------
We also assign the parities to our discs and set up all the movement rules according to the parities .
The actual code to solve the problem looks like so :
```ruby def solve puts “ SOLVING ITERATIVELY !!! ” print_special_state “ Initial State ” source_peg = nil destination = nil while @pegs [ : to ] . length != number_of( @discs ) source_peg = next_source_peg( destination ) destination = @move_rules_by_parity[parity_of(source_peg.last ) ][source_peg.object_id ] shift ( 1.disc , : from => source_peg , : to => destination ) raise unless state_valid print_state end print_special_state “ Final State ” end
def next_source_peg ( off_limits_peg ) source_peg = nil @peg_array .
each do |array| next if array == off_limits_peg next if array .
length == 0 source_peg = array if source_peg == nil || array.
last < source_peg.last end source_peg end```
This does exactly what I described above , picks the peg with the smallest disc that we ’re allowed to move and shifts the disc off that peg according to the movement rules , that we set up based on the parity of the disc .
It will also print out the state of the puzzle at every step , like so :
------- 2 3 1 ------- A B C -------
------- 3 1 2 ------- A B C ------- etc .
And it will raise an exception if it find that the puzzle has entered an invalid state ( a bigger disc is on top of a smaller one ) .
For the full implementation with all the helper methods , have a look on github ( I am trying to remember to put more of the code I play around with up there ) , more specifically here is the class http://github.com/skorks/hanoi/blob/master/lib/iterative_hanoi.rb.
This is actually a pretty decent iterative algorithm .
It takes the minimum number of steps to solve the problem and is reasonably simple to implement and understand .
And yet , it took quite a long time to figure out the pattern , implement , debug and this is the intuitive solution .
Can we do better ?
There are many different iterative algorithms for solving the Towers of Hanoi , the point is that all the iterative solutions are , if anything , more complex than the one above .
The Mathematical Approach
If we were inclined to think in a more mathematical fashion , we might approach this problem a little differently .
Lucky for us the math behind Towers of Hanoi is very well understood , but even if it was n’t the idea is the same .
Let ’s have a look .
Mathematically , we want to work out a formula for how many steps ( ( T_n ) ) it takes to transfer ( n ) discs from the source to the destination peg .
Looking at the smaller cases and counting the steps manually we see the following .
when ( n=1 ) , ( T_n=1 )
when ( n=2 ) , ( T_n=3 )
when ( n=3 ) , ( T_n=7 )
when ( n=4 ) , ( T_n=15 )
From this we can start to infer a pattern .
Every time we increase the number of discs by 1 , we need to double the number of steps and add 1 , which means we can express the number of steps ( T_n ) taken to transfer ( n ) discs based on the number of steps taken to transfer ( n - 1 ) discs :
\( T_n=2T_{n -1}+1\ ) where \( n> {0} \ )
What we have is a recurrence ( or it would be if we added the \ ( T_0=0 \ ) to it :) ) .
Now we can find the closed form of this recurrence relation and then prove that it always holds true using induction .
I am not going to do this here .
If you want a more in - depth look at the maths behind Tower of Hanoi ( includig the proof ) , I refer you to Concrete Mathematics .
For our purposes here , we can go with the gut - feel and assume that our recurrence always holds true .
How does this help ?
Well , because we can represent out problem as a recurrence , it means we should be able to code a recursive solution for it .
The Recursive Solution
This is where we need to be able to connect our theoretical math with a practical approach to solving the problem , which brings me back to the start of this post .
I believe that being able to apply the math behind a recursive function , in a practical fashion , is where the really deep understanding of recursion lies .
Let ’s break it down .
What if we can rewrite our recurrence in the following fashion :
( Tn=T{n-1}+1+T_{n-1} )
1 2 3 4 5 < p >
This tells us that to solve the tower for \ ( n\ ) disks ( < em > which will take \( T_n\ ) steps </em > ) we need to sove the tower for \ ( n - 1 \ ) disks , then solve the tower for \ ( 1\ ) disk and then solve the tower for \ ( n - 1 \ ) disks again .
You can probably already see where I am going with this , there is only a slight intuitive leap we need to make here , regarding where to transfer the disks each time .
We need to transfer \ ( n - 1 \ ) disks from the source peg to the pivot peg , then transfer \ ( 1\ ) disk from the source peg to the destination peg and then transfer \ ( n - 1 \ ) disks from the pivot to the destination and we 're done .
Here is the code : </p> ```ruby
class RecursiveHanoi include HanoiHelpers def initialize ( options={:discs => 8} ) @discs = options [ : discs ] @pegs = { : from => [ ] , : to => [ ] , : pivot => [ ] } @peg_array = [ @pegs [ : from ] , @pegs [ : to ] , @pegs [ : pivot ] ] @discs.downto(1 ) do |num| @pegs [ : from ] << num end end
def solve puts “ SOLVING RECURSIVELY !!! ” print_special_state “ Initial State ” move( @discs , @pegs ) print_special_state “ Final State ” end
def move(n , pegs = { } ) move (( n - 1) .discs , : from => pegs.start_peg , : to => pegs.pivot_peg , : pivot => pegs.end_peg ) if n > 1 shift ( 1.disc , : from => pegs.start_peg , : to => pegs.end_peg ) print_state raise unless state_valid move ( ( n - 1 ) , : from => pegs.pivot_peg , : to => pegs.end_peg , : pivot => pegs.start_peg ) if n > 1 end end```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 < p >
Once again we need to do similar setup to initialize the puzzle , but the < em > move </em> function is the interesting one here , it is recursive and it is all that is needed to solve the problem ( < em > aside from printing out the state in the middle < / em > ) .
As you can see the code is simple and there is no need to have any special handling for larger or smaller numbers of disks , the recursive nature of the function will work it out .
Notice how closely the function resembles our recurrence relation from above : </ p > < p style = " text - align : center ; " >
\( T_n=T_{n-1}+1+T_{n-1}\ ) < p >
Had we gone through the math instead of trying to find the ' < em> intuitive < / em > ' solution we would not only have been finished much faster ( < em > it took way longer to code the iterative solution than it did to do the recursive one < / em > ) , but the solution would have been a lot simpler and cleaner ( the above code is also on github , in < a href = " http://github.com/skorks/hanoi " target = " _blank " > the same place < / a> ) .
</ p> < blockquote > < p >
As an aside , did you notice how expressive the recursive solution looked when written in Ruby .
Things like < em>pegs.start_peg</em > and < em>shift ( 1.disc ) </em > etc .
I went to a tiny bit of effort to code things in a DSL - like fashion , < a href = " http://www.artima.com/rubycs/articles/ruby_as_dsl.html " target = " _blank " >
Ruby being really good for that </a> and it turned out pretty nice ( < em> considering the tiny amount of effort involved < / em > ) .
I opened up the < em > Integer </ em > and < em > Hash </em>classes to add the DSL - like features : </p> ```ruby
class
Integer def disc self end alias_method : discs , : disc end
class Hash def start_peg self [ : from ]
end
def end_peg self [ : to ]
end
def pivot_peg self [ : pivot ] end end```
* PVPV stands for Commission for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue
These past few weeks it seems like a day does n’t pass without a new muttawa blooper coming out .
I call them bloopers because the muttawas always have an excuse even if it ’s only an oops .
These bloopers are becoming more and more frequent .
It might be because of more press freedom or because average people are not putting up with it anymore .
Whatever it is , muttawa bloopers are definitely not a new concept .
An online Saudi newspaper recently published photos of 84 year old documents pertaining to citizens complaining about false arrests and harassment by PVPV members !
You do n’t need to go back in time to witness how bad the PVPV can behave .
One man in Madina has threatened that he will sue the PVPV for stopping him for two hours on a main street .
He had his wife and his mother - in - law in the car with him .
A few members of the PVPV were cruising around and apparently decided that the guy looked suspicious so they stopped him even though it is illegal for them to stop people without having an accompanying police officer .
The guy refused to neither open his door nor give them evidence as to how the two women are related to him until the police arrived .
And so he says that he will sue them for 2 million riyals for stopping him on baseless grounds for two hours and tainting his reputation .
Another man , Mohammed Sultan , also had his wife and mother - in - law in the car with him .
He had stopped at a restaurant to pick up some breakfast when a couple of PVPV members demanded that he provide them with his identification papers .
He says that he insisted that the police be present and when he started to call the police on his cell phone , they beat him up .
Half an hour later the police arrived after the PVPV members called them themselves .
They had made such a big deal in their call that five police cars arrived at the scene .
The poor guy was taken in and the PVPV pair claimed that they stopped him because he was wearing his pants low ( rapper style ) , even though witnesses at the scene say that Sultan acted and was dressed respectfully .
But the craziest and scariest bloopers are those that happen when a woman is unlucky enough to collide with the PVPV .
A couple of days ago , an unrelated young Saudi couple were caught during their rendezvous .
The PVPV member directed the police officer to take the young man into custody while he took the girl in his personal car !
He disappeared with her in his custudy for an hour and a half and when finally the PVPV member brought the girl in , she informed the officials he had taken her to an isolated area to lecture and advise her .
What ’s funny is that the PVPV member committed the exact same “ crime ” of khilwa ( spending time alone with an unrelated woman ) that he was accusing the couple of .
On a more serious note , last week a young woman was caught by PVPV members in Tabuk because she was trying to get to Jeddah without her guardian ’s approval .
They illegally took her to the PVPV center without reporting the issue to the police and then locked the doors to the building .
The young woman claims that they beat her and were insisting that she had something hidden in her clothes .
She also says that they were trying to tie her up when help came .
Luckily it was prayer time in a mosque nearby and men there heard her screams and called the police when they found the building locked .
The PVPV spokesperson , Mohammed al Zobaidi , gives a completely different account of the events .
He claims the woman ’s injuries were self - inflected because she probably thought that that was a way out and that it was the PVPV who called the police and not the people at the mosque .
I ’m not the only one noticing the increasing frequency of muttawa blooper coverage , at a recent PVPV conference which last few papers I attended , most of the speakers commented on this bad publicity .
Unfortunately they did not think of it as an opportunity to reflect on their practices but rather faulted the media .
Some even thought the ministry of information should punish editors who allow negative PVPV articles .
And this might be why an unidentified someone took it upon himself to shoot at the liberal Watan newspaper building in Abha .
Some people never change .
President Barack Obama is set to effectively scrap all US manned spaceflight plans beyond Earth orbit for the foreseeable future , according to a newspaper report .
The Orlando Sentinel - which has proven itself to have good sources in US space circles in the past - says that the White House budget proposal for the US space programme ( due to be released on Monday ) will formally scrap the Bush administration 's " vision for space exploration " .
The Bush vision called for NASA to mount a determined push to get astronauts out beyond low orbit , first returning to the Moon and then travelling to Mars within a generation .
NASA had planned to do this by retiring the Space Shuttle this year and then the International Space Station in 2015 .
In their place was to come the Constellation programme , which would have seen Ares I astronaut launchers and Ares V heavy - lift rocket stacks appear and Orion manned spacecraft to ride on them .
But Congress never supplied NASA with the funds to carry out these plans , a fact which had sunk in before President Obama even took power .
Since then , a panel of bigwigs led by Lockheed CEO Norm Augustine has mulled the options - stating that a big NASA budget increase would be required for any " viable " manned space programme .
Now it 's time for the President to present his plans to Congress , and he seems to have set his face against any such substantial space funding growth .
According to the Sentinel , " there will be no lunar landers , no moon bases , no Constellation program at all " .
The paper quotes an unnamed administration official as saying that " we certainly do n't need to go back to the moon " .
In place of voyages beyond orbit , the Obama team reportedly plans to extend the ISS until " at least 2020 " , and sink large funds into private - industry - developed launchers and modules for getting astronauts to and from it .
When the shuttle fleet retires this year , the only remaining means of access to the station will be Russian Soyuz craft .
There will also be increased money for " earth science " programmes , for instance satellites intended to monitor climate change .
There is mention of a " new technology research and development program that will one day make human exploration of asteroids and the inner solar system possible " , but it seems that the " one day " will be a long way off .
NASA will look into the matter of a new heavy lifter , the key item required for assembling long - range manned space missions , but there wo n't be any rush .
In effect , the Sentinel 's sources indicate that plans for manned exploration beyond Earth orbit have moved back by a decade at least : children born in the last few years no longer have any chance of growing up to walk on Mars .
All that said , the Constellation programme has strong support in Congress - not least because it is a jobs bonanza for certain US constituencies .
However , it seems that the White House - as in the case of the Raptor stealth fighter - is ready for a scrap .
The Sentinel quotes another nameless official as saying that " NASA can't design space programs to create jobs ... that 's the view of the president " . ®
Jenny McCarthy has had the worst two months of her life — her school and her man have vanished within 60 days !
Not only has Jenny McCarthy just split from her long - term lover Jim Carrey , HollywoodLife.com has learned exclusively she has closed her state - of - the art and much - lauded school for young autistic children , Teach2 Talk Academy , because of internal disagreements with her co-founder , Dr. Sarah Scheflen .
“ Jenny and her partner at the Academy , Sarah Scheflen , had different visions for the school and made a decision to go their separate ways .
Both intend to continue on in this important mission .
Sarah and Jenny really enjoyed their time working at the Academy and feel honored that they were able to provide such high quality early intervention services to so many children with autism and other developmental disabilities , ” Jenny ’s rep told HollywoodLife.com in an exclusive statement , today , April 8 .
The 37 - year - old actress started the school after her son Evan , now seven , was diagnosed with autism in 2005 , when he was two years - old .
Jenny put considerable time and resources into the school , and , as recently as last winter , told KidsLA magazine how pleased she was with it : “ I ’m proud to say [ Teach2 Talk Academy ] is an absolute success in terms of the amount of progress children with autism are making .
We do have a goal to open more schools around the country .
If I had Bill Gates ‘ money , I would have them in every state . ”
Located in a renovated house in Sherman Oaks , Calif. , Talk2 Teach Academy worked with children under the age of nine and was heralded for its unique one - to - one teacher - student ratio and integrated techniques .
As of today , the Teach2 Talk Web site was still selling its self - branded line of educational materials , including DVDs and nutritional supplements .
It was Jenny ’s pet project — but , according to a source who knew the couple well , the school ’s demise may even have been an additional strain that contributed to the end of her five - year relationship with 48 - year - old Jim Carrey .
“ I do n’t know who broke up with whom , but I know that for a little bit before the school fell apart Jim was going to possibly buy out Jenny ’s partner so the school would be all Jenny’s .
Then , next thing I heard , [ Jenny ] was moving out [ from Carrey ’s house ] , ” an insider told us about the couple ’s April 4 split .
“ Jenny McCarthy has had …the worst two months of her life .
Her school and her man all vanished in about 60 days . ”
Jim announced he and Jenny were splitting via Twitter April 6 : “ Jenny and I have just ended our 5 yr relationship .
I ’m grateful 4 the many blessings we ’ve shared and I wish her the very best !
S’okay ! ?;^ > ”

Helping raise awareness of Aboriginal history
Archaeology is about finding the missing pieces from moments in history that will help tell a clearer story now and into the future .
There are lots of rewarding discoveries in the job , however for Tyler Beebe , our Senior Archaeologist based out of our Newcastle office , working with the Aboriginal community and helping to raise awareness of their culture is the best part .
Jobs : " Competitors should create their own original technology " Apple has taken legal action against phone maker HTC , alleging it has infringed patented technology .
HTC has been accused of infringing 20 patents owned by Apple that are used in the iPhone .
Apple said the patent infringements covered technology used in the iPhone interface as well as its " underlying hardware and architecture . "
HTC makes phones for many firms including Google and was behind the Nexus One handset .
In a statement Apple boss Steve Jobs said : " We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions , or we can do something about it .
" We 've decided to do something about it , " he said .
" We think competition is healthy , but competitors should create their own original technology , not steal ours . "
In its legal filing , Apple is seeking a lasting injunction which would effectively bar HTC from selling phones that use the disputed technology in the US .
The legal action has been filed with the US International Trade Commission and a district court in Delaware .
In its response to the legal action , HTC said it had only just learned about Apple 's legal action and has not had the chance to investigate the filing .
" Until we have had this opportunity , we are unable to comment on the validity of the claims being made against HTC , " it said in a statement .
In addition to making the Nexus One , the first handset to be branded by Google , HTC has also made several handsets that use Google 's Android operating system .
At the same time Apple is locked in legal action with Nokia .
The Finnish phone giant sued Apple for patent infringement in October 2009 , alleging it had stolen patented technology .
In response , Apple countersued in December 2009 .
Nokia launched a second round of legal action in the closing days of 2009 .

Before we were influenced by Mies van der Rohe or Frank Lloyd Wright , before we had seen the visual delights of Ronchamp , Pompidou Center and the Bauhaus school in Weimar , we were driven by a greater force of design inspiration .
More primal and immediate than any of the previously mentioned examples , it was couch cushion architecture that established the basic building blocks of our design logic .
Unrepresented and ignored for too long in the architectural industry , today ’s post pays respect to the wonders of couch cushion architecture .
We ’ve rounded up a ( mostly ) admirable collection of projects , taken from a randomly conducted search on the internet .
Join us as we take a critical analysis of the architecture , methods and design philosophies of living room furniture re-appropriation .
[ Copyright Jennifer Larson ]
A clear derivative of the Miesian box , this handsome project is “ informalized ” with the use of colorful , freeform roof panels .
Taking further direction from the Archigram movement , the project explores architecture as body wrap and propels couch cushion architecture to new and exciting territory .
Grade : A
At first glance the composition appears unintentional and the construction shoddy .
But further investigation reveals a clear delineation between indoor / outdoor space with a design focus on protection through the use of barrier .
Planes are shifted off the orthogonal to accommodate function ; as a side effect it relieves inhabitants from a harsh Euclidian geometry .
Grade B
Benefiting from the life work of structural engineer Heinz Isler , this lightweight roof shell structure creates a graceful span while fully sheltering the interiors .
Massive counter - weights keep the structure taught while an entire façade remains open to the exterior .
Grade : B
Mayan in geometry but American barcalounger in function , this hybrid design allows for both formality and comfort .
To our disappointment , the plan design could have taken better advantage of the site opportunities and , ultimately , the fact that a roof structure was not included in the programming detracts from the overall project .
Grade : C +
The crisp , clean , white planes , drawing clear influences from Richard Meier , are balanced with a splash of color offered by the roof membrane .
The disciplined interiors offer relief to the eyes with a subtle yet intentional blue tone .
Grade B +
Good God gentlemen , you ’re a mess !
You need walls , you need a roof .
Get to work man !
Grade : F
The crisp , orthogonal structure is , in a way , camouflaged by the informality of the landscaping .
While a clear bifurcation exists between site and structure , we give high marks to the close coordination of architect and landscape architect in using similar materials to exaggerate the divergent design concepts .
Grade : B +
We greatly admire the use of coffee table as lateral moment - frame in this application .
The solution is both formal and fun , offering the users a sequence of experiences beginning with the entry to vaulted ceiling to raised deck .
Grade A-
While foundation as roof structure may not create the most efficient tectonic solution , we applaud the geometric inversion and fresh perspective on the “ form follows function ” relationship .
As a side note it ’s always disturbing to see the finish details carried out with such haste in the presence of true structural achievement .
Grade : B -
A brilliant synergy between the weighted foundation and the light tensile structure , this project impressed us with its attenuation of structure and bright interior spaces .
The courtyard and formal entry are also well thought - out and provide a clear means of way - finding .
Grade A +

Experimental Node.js Support
Listen to this article
UPDATE : Node .JS is now officially available on Heroku .
Today we ’re offering experimental support for node.js to a limited set of users .
We know there is a lot of demand , and will work with as many users as we can .
See below for details .
A natural complement to Ruby
Yesterday we posted about how we think about the platform and make roadmap decisions .
We are always looking for the next set of use cases to support , and lately we ’ve been thinking about realtime apps and event - driven architectures .
Today , most Ruby apps are synchronous .
By default , all I /O blocks .
If you ’re uploading a file , polling a service , or waiting on data , your app will be blocked .
While it ’s possible to fix this by meticulously eliminating all blocking I/ O from your code and dependencies , and using a library such as EventMachine , it ’s tedious and as Adam points out : “ Libraries like eventmachine will never be truly intuitive to use , because event - driven I/O is enough of a fundamental shift that it requires deep language integration .
JavaScript , it turns out , is a fundamentally event - driven language because of its origins in the browser ”
Node.js is evented I/O for JavaScript , built on top of the blazingly fast V8 engine .
It makes handling event - driven I/O incredibly simple , and aligns perfectly with our maniacal focus on simplicity and developer productivity .
The Ruby community has quickly adopted node , and with great reason .
Complimenting existing apps with node.js for components that require real - time event handling or massive concurrency is both easy and elegant – in part thanks to the availability of frameworks such as express .
Simple to use
Node fits well into our existing architecture .
It ’s just another runtime selectable as part of our stacks :
Open Questions
Supporting node opens many questions on the platform : how are we going to charge , what version will we support , how can I integrate it with my current apps ?
We ’re releasing this in experimental state now to collaborate with the Node.js and Ruby communities on this .
Over the next months we will work together to provide answers to all these questions and more .
How to Participate
If you want to participate and use node on an experimental basis , drop an email to nodejs@heroku.com with your email address , what you want to use Node for , and we ’ll work to include you in the program .

I ’ll admit it .
I love meetings .
I love the socializing , I love the energy of people working together toward a common goal .
I love the excitement generated when a group of people come up with an idea no one would have considered on their own .
I realize , however , these meeting joys are n’t a sure thing .
Some meetings go on and on forever , wasting everyone ’s time and generating nothing but mental lists of ways to end your suffering with office supplies .
There is a way to have more meeting joy and less meeting sorrow .
All you have to do is learn when to back away from the flipchart .
When Not to Meet
Meetings have a bad reputation because they are often used inappropriately .
If you attend meetings under the following circumstances , all the great planning in the world wo n’t take away that “ stab your eyes out feeling . ”
When you ( only ) want to deliver information
Meeting so you ( or anyone ) can “ hold court ” to pontificate about your latest ideas is an ego trip–and thus a terrible use of time .
If your meetings basically involve one person ( or worse–a series of people ! ) talking , and everyone else listening ( or pretending to listen ) you need to stop having meetings and start disseminating information in more appropriate ways .
Ideally , the alternative will be a written report .
Reports make the information available in an easy to access format that does n’t depend on the memory or mood of the listener .
It ’s also more concrete , so the presenter is likely to be much clearer than he might have been if he were giving the report off the cuff .
It does take a bit more time to prepare–but if you consider the total amount of time used by the speakers and the listeners –it ’s a big savings .
If a written report just is n’t going to happen , consider video reports or audio reports .
These reports can then be transcribed –providing most of the benefits of the written report in much less time .
When being in the same room adds nothing to the process
It is common for a team working on a project to assume regular meetings are required to “ keep everyone on the same page ” .
Thanks to the internet , many of these meetings are no longer necessary .
Hold one meeting at the beginning of the process to develop parameters , make sure the group has a shared understanding of the task ahead , and then do the rest of the collaboration using an online tool like Wiki Spaces , Google Docs or Google Wave . *
These tools allow for asynchronous communication and create instant documentation of the work that is done .
This means instead of holding a meeting and then going off to do the work– team members do the work as their schedules allow .
By using the collaboration tool , the team still gets the value of group input but they do n’t have to do the work at the same time , and they do n’t have to send the document back and forth as an attachment .
This means no more updating the wrong copy of the document .
The online tools also offer version control so it ’s easy to see who made what changes when , and to revert to old copies if necessary .
When you are finished , use the meeting time you saved to go out and to celebrate .
When the right people ca n’t attend
Meetings work when the right people come together to discuss the right things .
Having a meetings with only some of the players , or with people “ representing ” someone who ca n’t attend do n’t work .
If the key players ca n’t or wo n’t attend , all the meetings in the world wo n’t help you make progress .
When people are n’t prepared
If the agenda did n’t get out on time , or if participants have n’t come to a meeting prepared to work ( for whatever reason ) it ’s really best to cancel .
Your preparation time may feel wasted , but by holding the meeting will waste more time , and you will train participants that preparation is n’t required .
When you do n’t have something specific to discuss
Holding a meeting just because you ’ve got it set up as a re-occurring appointment on your calendar is not a good reason to get everyone together .
If there are difficult , complicated or controversial topics to discuss–by all means , have a meeting .
If not , skip it ( or get together for drinks instead ) .
Your Turn
What types of meetings do you wish to cancel forever ?
Under which circumstances do you enjoy a good meeting ?

Password - cracking tools optimised to work with SSDs have achieved speeds up to 100 times quicker than previously possible .
After optimising its rainbow tables of password hashes to make use of SSDs Swiss security firm Objectif Sécurité was able to crack 14 - digit WinXP passwords with special characters in just 5.3 seconds .
Objectif Sécurité's Philippe Oechslin told Heise Security that the result was 100 times faster than possible with their old 8 GB Rainbow Tables for XP hashes .
The exercise illustrated that the speed of hard discs rather than processor speeds was the main bottleneck in password cracking based on password hash lookups .
Objectif 's test rig featured an ageing Athlon 64 X2 4400 + with an SSD and optimised tables containing 80 GB of password hashes .
The system supports a brute force attack of 300 billion passwords per second , and is claimed to be 500 times faster than a password cracker from Russian firm Elcomsoft that takes advantages of the number crunching prowess of a graphics GPU from NVIDIA .

We asked some of the people organizing for the day of action to explain what they 're fighting for .
Read more statements at part one and part three of this feature .
March 4 will be a day of strikes and protests to defend public education for students , teachers , faculty , campus workers and members of the community in California .
The movement to save our schools is building at every level of the public education system .
David Patterson
Librarian , Cañada College , Redwood City
WHY PROTEST on March 4 ?
That 's easy .
At Cañada College , we 've been struggling to offer a decent education to our students for years , and so the March 4 protests are , for me , about the ongoing unwillingness of some in positions of power to offer a decent gateway to education .
It 's a sin that our college , which literally overlooks the riches of Silicon Valley and the affluence of Woodside , is unable to give our students , who are primarily from historically underserved segments of the population , a decent education .
As a librarian at Cañada , I see this firsthand .
We do n't have enough money for a proper library .
There are n't enough librarians , there are n't enough library support workers , and there is n't enough money for books .
The money we use to pay for subscriptions to databases has completely evaporated .
What will we do on March 4 ?
There 's a student committee planning the specifics .
A lot of our students have never attended a protest .
They have n't had the thrill of being part of a noisy , energized , angry crowd .
I 'm hoping that on March 4 , that will change .
Fresno State protesters demonstrating against budget cuts and furloughs last October ( Diane M. Blair )
Imagine students new to the world of protest feeling the power of a chant , of a great speech , of a march , of a civil rights song .
That 's what I 'm hoping for .
I 'm hoping that students on March 4th feel connected to Montgomery , to Selma , to the Salt March to the Dandi , to the sit-ins , to Freedom Riders , to the farmworkers ' struggle at Delano .
Now that 's an education :
To see your fight against oppression connected to a long line of others ' fights .
That 's a lesson you 'll remember .
I want the students to see that rights are fought for -- that they are gained through insisting , through protesting , through demanding .
I want our students to ask : Hey ?
Why is it that two exits down the freeway , the students at Stanford have a palatial library full of books , full of databases , full of librarians , full of resources , while our college barely has the basics ?
Why is it that rich students , who come to higher education with great K - 12 education under their belts , get all the advantages at private , well - funded universities and colleges ?
Why is it that we , who generally come from the underfunded schools of East Palo Alto and Redwood City ; we whose parents generally do n't have the education , the connections or the money that the rich students ' parents have ; we who have to work one or two jobs just to pay the rent and eat -- why do we go to a college where the library is run on a shoestring ?
Oppression against historically underserved students does n't only happen in the classroom .
In the library , oppression works beautifully - - students need help , but can't find a librarian to help them ; students need high quality sources of information , but find limited resources .
March 4th is a chance to demand a change for our students -- in the classrooms , in the library stacks and all across California campuses .
Katharina Neuseidler
Student , San Francisco State University
I 'M LOOKING at the struggle for public education from a global perspective .
I came to study at San Francisco State from Vienna , Austria , where students currently are fighting against what they call the " economization " of higher education .
University used to be free in my country , but since Austria joined the European Union , successive governments have financially starved public education , and then started charging tuition fees .
Now programs are being cut and modified in order to make them comparable to and competitive with programs of other countries , which in turn makes it easier for industries to compare candidates from an international pool of applicants .
The students in Vienna are addressing not only their government , but society as a whole , with the question :
What function is education supposed to have ?
Fulfilling the economic needs of a country , or enhancing the intellectual and spiritual development of the individual in particular , and humanity in general ?
It seems to me that Europe is trying to Americanize their public education system , and if students do n't put up a fierce fight right now as those changes are taking place , we will very soon see many people excluded from higher education , and inequality in society dramatically increasing .
To me , the state of public education in California , where the two main public university systems raised tuition by 32 percent last year , serves as a warning of what will happen in Europe if we do not fight back now .
Public education is under attack globally , and therefore , I will fight to keep or make it accessible for everyone -- no matter where in the world I am .
March 4th is the kickoff of this movement in California that will connect our fight to the global struggle for public education .
Kathleen Cecil
Teacher , Mission High School , San Francisco
TEACHING HAS never been a job where you can get comfortable .
Each year , the job changes .
Teachers adapt , spend more of their own money on basic supplies for their students , bring in food , boxes of tissues , take on larger class sizes , grade and plan on evenings and weekends and tutor students after school and through lunch .
But many teachers have the exact same line in the sand for when the job is no longer worth doing .
That line is the inability to teach in a meaningful way .
Large class sizes make it impossible to track student progress , to offer authentic feedback or to move students forward .
Lack of books , photocopying and space makes instruction impossible .
The perfect storm that over the years has eroded wages , housing , food and health care has washed up at the schoolhouse doors again to take what 's left .
The arguments about how to salvage the few services that remain in California do n't impress anyone here .
We have stretched to the breaking point , and our students can't afford to lose any more .
I will walk out on March 4 to join my students , to see them fight for a voice and some control over their lives .
California , one of the top 10 economies in the world , is dead last in per-pupil spending .
California has abandoned its children .
Omar Hussein
Teacher , Los Angeles Unified School District
FRANKLY , AS an educator , I 've had enough .
Traditional union activism has failed to stem the wave of cuts , layoffs and takeovers .
The privatizers and labor - bashers are winning , and if they continue to win , education in this country may end up looking like health care in this country , or worse .
We cannot stand idly by as our communities -- including students , parents and teachers -- are blamed for the underfunding of our so - called " failing " schools and the deliberate structural violence that has been inflicted on the people of color who work in and attend those schools .
Those of us active in planning March 4th are trying to build a grassroots social movement that will be able to challenge these racist policies from the bottom up .
We cannot wait for elected political parties or traditional union bureaucracies to lead the struggle .
We have to build the struggle ourselves .
Marcos Perez and Antonio Perez
Students , San Diego City College
INSPIRED BY the actions and picket lines that took place on September 24 across the 10 University of California campuses , active faculty at San Diego City College called for the formation of a coalition , " Education For All , " among students and faculty to respond to the implementation of the draconian budget cuts .
The San Diego Community College District ( SDCCD ) -- which includes three campuses , Miramar College , Mesa College and City College - - has seen an increase in student enrollment by over 6 percent since 2007 , while the district has cut 1,200 classes over the last two years .
Students have not been the only victims of the budget cuts .
SDCCD has defunded 217 full - time workers and has yet to rehire 214 part - time professors .
This has lead to 10,000 potential students being turned away because classes are too full , according to SDCCD spokesperson Richard Dittbenner .
At San Diego City College , the Education for All ( EFA ) coalition has stepped up to lead the student movement against the budget cuts .
EFA called for and organized a regional summit on January 27 , with the purpose of uniting all San Diego campuses fighting the budget cuts .
The regional summit drew out over 80 people , including representatives from all public education sectors , and also community - based activist groups .
The result was a democratic decision to have a centralized march to the governors ' office on March 4 in the late afternoon while each campus around the county plan specific actions in the mid-day .
Calls were made by faculty and student organizations at San Diego State University , University of California San Diego and San Diego City College to walk out and shut down business as usual .
After the walkouts , students , faculty , and workers will be engaging in speak - outs and teach - outs to address and agitate the many students that are radicalizing around this struggle and developing strategies on continuing the fightback efforts .
We are protesting on March 4th because we understand that what we have is a crisis of priorities .
The ruling class would rather make us , workers and students , pay for their crises while they bail out the banks and large corporations .
There is plenty of wealth to ensure everybody daily meals , a place to live , somewhere to work and absolutely free education for all .
We need to let our voices be heard .
Kevin Chojczak
Special Education paraprofessional , Lincoln High School , San Francisco
PARAPROFESSIONALS
PLAY an important role in the classroom .
Coordinating with teachers , paraprofessionals focus on students who need the extra support to be successful in the classroom .
With a massive budget shortfall of $ 113 million for the next two years , our district 's superintendent is proposing deep cuts .
We 're told that " there will be pain , " and to expect hundreds of teacher and para layoffs .
But as educators , we need to say , " No cuts , no layoffs and emergency funding for education . "
The issue is not that there is n't enough money .
There is plenty of money to fully fund public education .
We live in the richest country on the planet .
The Pentagon budget will increase to $ 708 billion for 2011 .
California is one of the top 10 economies in the world , and 47 billionaires reside in the Bay Area alone !
In the last 30 years , our state 's tax structure has shifted the burden of taxes onto working families and the poor , and has left top corporations and the rich off the hook .
In 1980 , 15 percent of the state budget came from taxes on California - based corporations .
Now , it 's less than 11 percent .
Due to Proposition 13 , billions of dollars are lost by corporations evading taxes on commercial real estate holdings .
We need a long - term vision for education that will turn this situation around .
We need a movement that will depend on us as educators at the rank - and - file level in our union to organize in our schools and communities .
March 4th is a major first step for building a grassroots movement to stop the cuts and layoffs , and ultimately put the kind of pressure that will make the politicians in Sacramento put in place a much - needed progressive tax structure to fully fund public education .

In New York , it will be 11 o’clock on Sunday morning when the clock for Coordinated Universal Time — which carries the neither - English - nor - French abbreviation U.T.C. ( it ’s formerly Greenwich Mean Time ) — reaches 15:00 hours .
So some people will be settled into church pews while others prepare to head out to the park , if not the beach .
Los Angeles will be a good deal quieter at such an early hour , except for some hard - partying types unwilling to concede that it ’s no longer Saturday night .
Lunch time will be at hand in Rio de Janeiro , dinner time in Cape Town .
Dusk will be bringing an end to another tough day in Afghanistan , while midnight will be an hour away in Beijing .
For Australians , it will already be first thing Monday morning .

The ash plume from Iceland has grounded planes for good reason – it wrecks jet engines , and it's at the right height to do so
Aircraft avoid any airspace that has volcanic ash in it for a simple reason : the ash can wreck the function of propeller or jet aircraft , because it is so fine that it will invade the spaces between rotating machinery and jam it – the silica melts at about 1,100C and fuses on to the turbine blades and nozzle guide vanes ( another part of the turbine assembly ) , which in modern aircraft operate at 1,400C .
That , in turn , can be catastrophic – as the crew of two aircraft , including a British Airways Boeing 747 , discovered in 1982 when they flew through an ash cloud from the Galunggung volcano in Indonesia .
On both planes , all four engines stopped ; they dived from 36,000 ft ( 11 km ) to 12,000 ft before they could restart them and make emergency landings .
That 's not the only problem .
Ash can pit the windscreens of the pilot 's cabin , damage the fuselage and light covers , and even coat the plane so much that it becomes tail - heavy .
At runways , ash creates an extra problem because takeoffs and landings will throw it into the air again – where the engines can suck it in and it will create horrific damage to moving parts that suddenly find themselves in contact .
The Icelandic plume has been thrown to between 6 km and 11 km into the atmosphere – exactly the height that aircraft would be flying .
Passengers on the BA flight that hit the cloud in 1982 said the engines looked unusually bright : soon after all four flamed out .
" I do n't believe it – all four engines have failed ! " said the flight engineer .
The crew were prepared to ditch , and the captain told the passengers : " Ladies and gentlemen , this is your captain speaking .
We have a small problem .
All four engines have stopped .
We are doing our damnedest to get them under control .
I trust you are not in too much distress . "
Luckily , three of the engines could be restarted .
The plane landed safely , and nobody was injured .
The problem with such ash is that it is extremely fine – less than 2 mm in diameter , and in the case of fine ash only 6 microns in diameter – which means that it is easily carried by the wind ; and because it is ejected by enormously hot air from a volcano it will often be thrown high into the jetstream at exactly the height that aircraft like to fly .
The ash particles ' light weight means that they will then remain there , dispersing so slowly it can take two to three years for them to vanish .
The measures taken today – clearing UK airspace from noon until at least 6 pm – are a precaution , but a sensible one .
Once ash has got into an engine , it is all but impossible to remove because it is so fine ; no amount of washing will get every piece out .
It pollutes filtration systems , electrical and avionic units – and the accompanying sulphuric acid aerosol can eat into rubber parts .
In all , more than 60 planes have been written off by ash damage .
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration put the benefit to aviation of better avoidance of volcanic ash at around $ 58 m annually .
For that reason , the world is split into nine regions , each with its own volcanic ash advisory centre ; the one covering Iceland and the UK is based in London .
The London one put out an advisory last night but its forecast for the progress of the cloud suggests that it will have spread widely over northern Europe by the early hours of Friday morning .
The Pentagon announced on Friday it has authorized the use Twitter , Facebook and other so - called Web 2.0 sites across the U.S. military , saying the benefits of social media outweighed security concerns .
The decision , which comes at a time of growing concern over cyber - security , applies only to the military 's non-classified network .
But it could mean big changes for large portions of the armed forces , including the Marines , which had selectively banned social media on work computers .
The Department of Defense also had bans in place since 2007 on accessing certain bandwidth - gobbling Web sites like YouTube on its network .
The purpose of the policy is to recognize that we need to take advantage of these Internet - based capabilities .
These Web 2.0 tools need to be part of what we use , David Wennergren , a deputy assistant secretary of defense , told Reuters .
And what we had were inconsistent approaches .
Some websites were blocked and some commands were blocking things .
Social media are increasingly important for the U.S. military .
Admiral Mike Mullen , who as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the top U.S. military officer , has a Twitter feed with more than 16,000 followers .
U.S. Southern Command offered operational updates via Twitter on relief activities in Haiti .
REACHING OUT TO YOUNG SOLDIERS
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , 66 , has said that he wants to use social networking to help the Pentagon interact with U.S. military members , many of whom are in their early 20s .
But opponents have cited the risks of information leaks , of opening gateways to hackers , along with a potential overload of precious bandwidth on the Defense Department 's network .
The new policy says commanders will still need to defend against cyber- attacks and block access to online pornography , gambling and sites promoting hate - crime related activities .
It also allows commanders to temporarily limit Internet access if the bandwidth is overwhelmed , a key caveat for U.S. forces fighting the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan , or stationed in remote , rugged places around the globe .
Wennergren said commanders still had authority to limit access to safeguard missions , perhaps banning use of social media ahead of a major offensive .
The Defense Department will also be monitoring use of its network .
There are two imperatives .
One is the ability to share information .
The other is about security -- we need to be good at both , he said .
Training people so they know what can and cannot be disclosed on the Internet is a more effective policy than simply banning use of social media on work computers , he said .
You can't just have the policy be that you 're going to block access to MySpace .
Because there are 10,000 ways people could still compromise a mission -- by making a phone call , or sending an email , Wennergren said .
So part of this is about having a trained workforce that is savvy in how you operate in the information age .

( CNN ) --
The post office gets a lot of criticism .
Always has , always will .
And with the renewed push to get rid of Saturday mail delivery , expect complaints to intensify .
But the United States Postal Service deserves a standing ovation for something that 's going to happen this month : Bill Mauldin is getting his own postage stamp .
Mauldin died at age 81 in the early days of 2003 .
The end of his life had been rugged .
He had been scalded in a bathtub , which led to terrible injuries and infections ;
Alzheimer 's disease was inflicting its cruelties .
Unable to care for himself after the scalding , he became a resident of a California nursing home , his health and spirits in rapid decline .
He was not forgotten , though .
Mauldin , and his work , meant so much to the millions of Americans who fought in World War II , and to those who had waited for them to come home .
He was a kid cartoonist for Stars and Stripes , the military newspaper ; Mauldin 's drawings of his muddy , exhausted , whisker - stubbled infantrymen Willie and Joe were the voice of truth about what it was like on the front lines .
Mauldin was an enlisted man just like the soldiers he drew for ; his gripes were their gripes , his laughs were their laughs , his heartaches were their heartaches .
He was one of them .
They loved him .
The cartoonist beloved by GIs and regular guys
He never held back .
Sometimes , when his cartoons cut too close for comfort , his superior officers tried to tone him down .
In one memorable incident , he enraged Gen. George S. Patton , and Patton informed Mauldin he wanted the pointed cartoons -- celebrating the fighting men , lampooning the high - ranking officers -- to stop .
Now .
The news passed from soldier to soldier .
How was Sgt. Bill Mauldin going to stand up to Gen. Patton ?
It seemed impossible .
Not quite .
Mauldin , it turned out , had an ardent fan : Five - star Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , supreme commander of the Allied forces in Europe .
Ike put out the word : Mauldin draws what Mauldin wants .
Mauldin won .
Patton lost .
If , in your line of work , you 've ever considered yourself a young hotshot , or if you 've ever known anyone who has felt that way about himself or herself , the story of Mauldin 's young manhood will humble you .
Here is what , by the time he was 23 years old , Mauldin had accomplished :
He won the Pulitzer Prize .
He was featured on the cover of Time magazine .
His book " Up Front " was the No. 1 best - seller in the United States .
All of that at 23 .
Yet when he returned to civilian life and he grew older , he never lost that boyish Mauldin grin , he never outgrew his excitement about doing his job , he never big - shotted or high - hatted the people with whom he worked every day .
I was lucky enough to be one of them ; Mauldin roamed the hallways of the Chicago Sun -Times in the late 1960s and early 1970s with no more officiousness or air of haughtiness than if he was a copyboy .
That impish look on his face remained .
He had achieved so much .
He had won a second Pulitzer Prize , and he should have won a third , for what may be the single greatest editorial cartoon in the history of the craft : his deadline rendering , on the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated , of the statue at the Lincoln Memorial slumped in grief , its head cradled in its hands .
But he never acted as if he was better than the people he met .
He was still Mauldin the enlisted man .
During the late summer of 2002 , as Mauldin lay in that California nursing home , some of the old World War II infantry guys caught wind of it .
They did n't want Mauldin to go out that way .
They thought he should know that he was still their hero .
Gordon Dillow , a columnist for the Orange County Register , put out the call in Southern California for people in the area to send their best wishes to Mauldin ; I joined Dillow in the effort , helping to spread the appeal nationally so that Bill would not feel so alone .
Soon more than 10,000 letters and cards had arrived at Mauldin 's bedside .
Even better than that , the old soldiers began to show up just to sit with Mauldin , to let him know that they were there for him , as he , long ago , had been there for them .
So many volunteered to visit Bill that there was a waiting list .
Here is how Todd DePastino , in the first paragraph of his wonderful biography of Mauldin , described it :
" Almost every day in the summer and fall of 2002 they came to Park Superior nursing home in Newport Beach , California , to honor Army Sergeant , Technician Third Grade , Bill Mauldin .
They came bearing relics of their youth : medals , insignia , photographs , and carefully folded newspaper clippings .
Some wore old garrison caps .
Others arrived resplendent in uniforms over a half century old .
Almost all of them wept as they filed down the corridor like pilgrims fulfilling some long - neglected obligation . "
One of the veterans explained to me why it was so important :
" You would have to be part of a combat infantry unit to appreciate what moments of relief Bill gave us .
You had to be reading a soaking wet Stars and Stripes in a water - filled foxhole and then see one of his cartoons . "
Mauldin is buried in Arlington National Cemetery .
This month , the kid cartoonist makes it onto a first - class postage stamp .
It 's an honor that most generals and admirals never receive .
What Mauldin would have loved most , I believe , is the sight of the two guys who are keeping him company on that stamp .
Take a look at it .
There 's Willie .
There 's Joe .
And there , to the side , drawing them and smiling that shy , quietly observant smile , is Mauldin himself .
With his buddies , right where he belongs .
Forever .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene .
Plot twists , continuity , predictability , likability of characters … these are some of the general elements that people use to judge a storyline within a video game .
But often times , this is the furthest people look when holding up a writer ’s craft to the light for inspection .
But character name etymology is sometimes just as important to a storyline as the events of the story itself .
It ’s a popular literary tool , and many great writers are conscientiously selective of their characters names when molding their stories .
To think that only authors of literature take etymology into account while penning their stories would be absurd .
Video game writers do it all the time .
Often , we the general audience , never take the time to look further into the meaning behind the names of video game characters .
For my first ( hopefully of many ) glances at the etymology of video game characters and their possible meaning within the storyline , I ’m going to put the Assassin ’s Creed series under the microscope .
Etymology Within the Assassin ’s Creed Series
While Ubisoft proudly touted the etymology of Altaïr , they never truly pointed out the importance of the names of the other characters within the Assassin ’s Creed universe .
Knowing the meanings to their names adds a little more value to the overall storyline .
Altaïr ibn La-Ahad :
The name of a star in the constellation Aquila , Altaïr means “ the flyer ” or “ the bird ” in Arabic .
The character Altaïr ’s appearance and movements in Assassin ’s Creed can easily be described as birdlike , especially when he perches on a narrow beam , or when he tackles his prey .
He uses “ Eagle vision ” to see through the crowds .
His love for the high ground is also a connection to his name , as Ubisoft could have easily designed Altaïr as an assassin with a predilection for the shadows .
Digging a little deeper , Aquila means “ the eagle . ” Aquila was also the name of Zeus ( Jupiter ) ’s personal pet .
He was his messenger , retriever , and deliverer of lightning bolts .
While the tie to the Greek god had little or no meaning to gamers while playing the original Assassin ’s Creed , those who have had the pleasure of completing Assassin ’s Creed II know this relationship is no accident .
Ezio Auditore :
The name “ Ezio ” is the Italian derivation of the Greek name αετο ς ( sometimes spelled Aetos ) , which means “ eagle . ”
Much like Ezio ’s ancestor Altaïr , Ezio ’s appearance and movements are described as birdlike .
His hood comes to a point like a beak right between his eyes .
When perched on narrow beams , Ezio ’s shoulder cape drapes to the side and gives the impression of a folded wing .
Again , Ezio ’s love of the rooftops and striking from above add more to the eagle analogy .
The similarities between Ezio and Altair do n’t end with their physical appearances .
Hold onto your hats .
Zeus ’s pet eagle Aquila is sometimes referred to as Aetos Dios .
Though Ubisoft has not yet released the names of any other assassins within the bloodline of Desmond Miles , do n’t be surprised if they ’re named Vega , Bezek , or even Tseen Foo .
Other likely names for Assassins within the bloodlines might be Anne , Andor , Antinanco , Ari , Arlette , Arnold , Arvid , or Haytham .
Personally , I think it ’d be interesting to set the next Assassin ’s Creed hero as a native of what is now Chile or Argentina fighting against the Conquistadors or possibly a native American fighting against corrupt settlers and name him Antinanco – eagle of the sun .
Warren Vidic :
Often times , simply referred to as “ Vidic , ” Warren Vidic ’s name has an interesting meaning .
Warren means “ animal enclosure . ” A cage .
In the case of Desmond Miles , Warren Vidic is his captor and more often than not , Vidic treats Desmond as though he is an inferior being .
He holds knowledge of ultimate truths over Desmond .
He ’s forceful , demeaning , and he treats Desmond as though he is an animal .
A lab rat .
Lucy Stillman :
Lucy is the shortened form of “ Lucia ” who is the Christian patron saint of the blind .
It ’s an interesting choice for a patron saint , as Lucy within the game of Assassin ’s Creed grants Desmond and Subject 17 vision in past lives .
In life , Saint Lucy refused to marry a pagan .
She gave her dowry to the poor .
And when her pagan husband - to - be had enough of her , he reported Saint Lucy to the local magistrate .
In turn , Lucy was to be burned at the stake .
When the guards came to take Lucy away , she began to speak out against her persecutor .
Subsequently , she was stabbed in the throat with a dagger .
To further her torture , the guards removed her eyes and miraculously she was still able to speak and see .
Rebecca Crane and Shaun Hastings :
Rebecca is the computer / Animus expert in Assassin ’s Creed II .
Though Rebecca is a very traditional Hebrew name , as she was the wife of Isaac in the Old Testament .
In the Bible , Rebeca is referred to as a maiden of beauty and kindness .
Oddly , the word “ Rebecca ” means “ to bind ” or “ to snare . ”
Out of the two , Rebecca treats Desmond with patience and understanding , while Shaun seems to have no social filters and treats Desmond with the same level of respect as Vidic .
Shaun is the historian for the Assassins .
He coordinates the Assassins in the field and fills Desmond in with additional information about places and events that can be seen within the Animus .
The name “ Shaun ” is a derivation of “ John ” which in turn is a derivation of the Hebrew name “ Yochanan ” which means “ Yahweh is gracious . ”
Though Shaun ’s name does n’t play a role in his personality , I find it odd that he , Lucy and Rebecca all seem to share very non -“ Assassin ” - oriented names .
Assumptions
Ubisoft has been amazing about keeping the Assassin ’s Creed storyline a secret .
But looking deeper into the character names might reveal a little more about the storyline .
Time can only tell .
Are those born of the Assassin bloodline the hand chosen of Jupiter / Zeus ?
Are Lucy , Rebecca and Shaun simply Templars in disguise giving Desmond the illusion of freedom ?
After all , Lucy ’s relationship with Subject 17 is shady at best .
Asking Desmond to ride in the trunk could have served two purposes .
Sure , it kept Desmond safe from the Templars , but it also kept Desmond from knowing where he was .
And I only grow more suspicious of Lucy since her patron saint took a knife to the neck .
Am I looking a little too closely at this ?
For any other game , I might say “ yes ” but the writers of the series have taken great care in choosing the names of their heroes .
There ’s no reason to believe they did n’t take the same level of care in naming the rest of their characters .

Hot water really can freeze faster than cold water , a new study finds .
Sometimes .
Under extremely specific conditions .
With carefully chosen samples of water .
New experiments provide support for a special case of the counterintuitive Mpemba effect , which holds that water at a higher temperature turns to ice faster than cooler water .
The Mpemba effect is named for a Tanzanian schoolboy , Erasto B. Mpemba , who noticed while making ice cream with his classmates that warm milk froze sooner than chilled milk .
Mpemba and physicist Denis Osborne published a report of the phenomenon in Physics Education in 1969 .
Mpemba joined a distinguished group of people who had also noticed the effect : Aristotle , Francis Bacon and René Descartes had all made the same claim .
On the surface , the notion seems to defy reason .
A container of hot water should take longer to turn into ice than a container of cold water , because the cold water has a head start in the race to zero degrees Celsius .
But under scientific scrutiny , the issue becomes murky .
The new study does n’t explain the phenomenon , but it does identify special conditions under which the Mpemba effect can be seen , if it truly exists .
“ All in all , the work is a nice beginning , but not systematic enough to do more than confirm it can happen , ” comments water expert David Auerbach , whose own experiments also suggest that the effect does occur .
Papers published over the last decade , including several by Auerbach , who performed his research while at the Max Planck Institute for Flow Research in Göttingen , Germany , have documented instances of hot water freezing faster than cold , but not reproducibly , says study author James Brownridge of State University of New York at Binghamton .
“ No one has been able to get reproducible results on command . ”
That ’s what Brownridge has done .
One of his experiments , presented online , repeatedly froze a sample of hot water faster than a similar sample of cool water .
Note the word similar .
In order for the experiment to work , the cool water had to be distilled , and the hot water had to come from the tap .
In the experiment , about two teaspoons of each sample were held in a copper device that completely surrounded the water , preventing evaporation and setting reasonably even temperatures .
Freezing was official when sensors picked up an electrical signal created by ice formation .
Brownridge heated the tap water to about 100° C , while the distilled water was cooled to 25° C or lower .
When both samples were put into the freezer , the hot water froze before the cold water .
Brownridge then thawed the samples and repeated the experiment 27 times .
Each time , the hot tap water froze first .
The experiment worked because the two types of water have different freezing points , Brownridge says .
Differences in the shape , location and composition of impurities can all cause water ’s freezing temperature — which in many cases is below zero degrees C — to vary widely .
With a higher freezing point , the tap water had an edge that outweighed the distilled water ’s lower temperature .
Because the experiment did n’t compare two identical samples of water , the mystery of the Mpemba effect is not really solved .
“ I ’m not arrogant enough to say I ’ve solved this , ” Brownridge says .
But he has set some guidelines about when the effect can be seen .
Physical chemist Christoph Salzmann of the University of Durham in England says he ’s not convinced the Mpemba effect really exists , because there are innumerable things that influence the timing of freezing , making it impossible to completely control .
Predicting how long it will take for a water sample to crystallize “ is a bit like trying to predict when the next earthquake or crash of the stock market will happen , ” he says .
“ I would not want to say that the Mpemba effect does not exist .
But I have still not been convinced of its existence . ”

Remembering the best of times for Miramax .
Today , the indie world and the film world at large lost a giant in the field , watching Disney close the doors and turn the lights off on Miramax .
As sad a day like today is , and as uncertain as the future is , we can still hold on to the memories .
Most of them are now on Blu-ray .
Or at least Laser Disc ( because we all own one ) .
Without further tears in our eyes , we ’d like to remember Miramax for their 15 Best Films .
If you ’re like me and Rob Hunter , your rental queue is already full .
15 . Kids ( 1995 )
The Pitch : Even if Rob Hunter does n’t think Larry Clark ’s harsh film about drug and sexual abandon amongst the youth in NYC is well acted , he ’s wrong , and the movie is brilliant and challenging .
The response was expectedly mixed with some critics and fans seeing it as a strong artistic endeavor and others calling it borderline child pornography .
Shockingly , Disney ’s name was left off of the financing .
-CA
14 . The Reflecting Skin ( 1990 )
The Pitch :
You probably have n’t seen this odd and creepy little flick , but if you have consider yourself one of the lucky few .
It ’s a dark and original coming - of - age tale set in 1950 ’s America and filled with beautiful cinematography , child murderers , a suspected vampire , and Viggo Mortensen .
And the rights holders have never released it on US or UK DVD .
Bastards .
-RH
13 . The Crying Game ( 1992 )
The Pitch :
This film is mostly known for its twist , which is a shame , because the entire film is a thing of beauty .
With knock out performances by Stephen Rea and Forrest Whitaker , it hit the Oscars hard with six nominations ( including Best Picture ) .
More than just a pop cultural reference , the entire film should be watched for its intensity and its racial and gender commentary .
-CA
12 . Exotica ( 1994 )
The Pitch : This is the movie that put director Atom Egoyan on the map .
( Sadly , it was just a map of Canada ) .
This intoxicating and slow - paced movie manages to be both mysterious and sexy in equal measures , and even though Cole Abaius scoffs at Egoyan ’s cinematic oeuvre this is still independent filmmaking at its best ( even if it is Canadian ) .
-RH
11 . Beautiful Girls ( 1996 )
The Pitch : It ’d be easy to say this movie ’s relevance comes from my appreciation for Natalie Portman ’s fresh but Lolita - esque turn as the cute neighbor girl .
But even if you do n’t enjoy the indiscretions of youth ( or intentionally misusing known phrases to avoid sounding like a pervert ) the movie also packs solid laughs , a strong ensemble cast , and the 748th film use of the song “ Beth ” by a repentant boyfriend .
-RH
10 . sex , lies and videotape ( 1989 )
The Pitch : Some of us can still remember when Steven Soderbergh was good at barely scripting his films and using minimalist camera work .
This fantastic flick won the Palme d’Or back in 1989 , and launched Soderbergh ’s career in earnest .
If you were looking for the film that really started the indie movement ’s commercial success – look no further than a film about James Spader ’s sexual dysfunction .
-CA
9. My Left Foot ( 1989 )
The Pitch : Only a few years ago , modern audiences were sort of re-introduced to the genius of Daniel Day - Lewis .
If you ’re looking for a way to delve deeper – check out his first Academy Award win in this stirring story of a young man who can only control his left foot .
Here ’s where I make a comment about Day - Lewis having more acting talent in his left foot than in most actor ’s entire bodies .
But I ’ll refrain .
-CA
8. Flirting With Disaster ( 1996 )
The Pitch : Ben Stiller leads a fantastic cast in a comedy about identity and the concept of nature vs nurture .
Director David O. Russell would go on to burn professional bridges with actors and studios alike while filming Three Kings and I Heart Huckabees , but for this one film he managed to keep his temper in check and the result is some stellar ensemble comedy .
-RH
7. Pulp Fiction ( 1994 )
The Pitch : Not only did it launch Quentin Tarantino even further into the cultural stage , it also relaunched John Travolta ’s career .
It also made a bunch of violent film fans finally memorize part of the bible .
Oddly enough , Harvey Weinstein wanted Daniel Day - Lewis ( who you ’ll remember from the last entry ) to play Vincent Vega instead of Travolta .
Then again , stranger things have happened – Sid Haig was originally offered the role of Marcellus Wallace .
-CA
6. Bob Roberts ( 1992 )
The Pitch : Who knew Tim Robbins could be so politically aware ?
The freakishly tall actor wrote and directed this satirical faux documentary about an election , and he shines a smart and funny eye on shenanigans from both sides of the aisle .
As true today as it was almost twenty years ago .
-RH
5. Chasing Amy ( 1997 )
The Pitch : Say what you will about Clerks , and Kevin Smith has said a lot to us , but Chasing Amy is really his best film to date .
It ’s personal and sweet underneath all that talk about fisting .
A few Indie Spirit Awards , a career launch for Ben Affleck , and a 4800 % return on the budget later , and you have a bona fide hit .
-CA
4. Heavenly Creatures ( 1994 )
The Pitch : Peter Jackson ’s most realistic and grounded film is still one of his best .
Two girls in 1950 ’s New Zealand live in a fantasy world where they plan a real - world murder .
It ’s made all the more affecting when you realize it ’s based on a true story and one of the girls grew up to become Anne Perry , a bestselling writer of mysteries and thrillers .
-RH
3. There Will Be Blood ( 2007 )
The Pitch : I do n’t have enough space to write all the awards this thing was nominated for or won , but if you have any doubt about the phenomenon , I ’ll point you in the direction of your nearest “ I Drink Your Milkshake ” t- shirt wearer .
Beyond becoming a catch - phrase for casual wear , this movie is one of the hardest movies that can actually be re-watched repeatedly .
As opposed to , say , Kids .
-CA
2. City of God ( 2002 )
The Pitch : This Brazilian gem is a small , gritty , and surprisingly human look at one of the nastiest cities on Earth .
Violence and dreams collide as young kids growing up in Rio de Janeiro ’s most dangerous slum make choices with profound effects .
It ’s currently # 16 on IMDB ’s Top 250 Movie list which is damn impressive stuff for a film with no known stars .
-RH
1. Trainspotting ( 1996 )
The Pitch : Topping the list is the film that ’s been voted the Best Scottish film of all time as well as in the Top Ten of British films .
One of Danny Boyle ’s first films , it takes a strange look at a group of heroine addicts .
It rocked Cannes in 1996 , and was picked up by Miramax for distribution in the states – giving us just a glimpse of Boyle ’s talents and the talents of Scottish filmmaking .
As brilliant as this film is , I ’m with Ewan MacGregor in hoping that a sequel does n’t get made .
-CA
Editor ’s Note :
This list was lovingly compiled by Rob Hunter and Scott Beggs .
That 's the conclusion of a very long essay on startups by Paul Graham , and it's an insightful quote .
The reason you feel most comfortable with a job ( unless , like me , you 're in the minority–a job would destroy my psyche ) is that you 've been brainwashed by many years of school , socialization and practice .
I pick the word brainwashed carefully , because it 's more than training or acclimation .
It 's something that 's been taught to you by people who needed you to believe it was the way things are supposed to be .

If you 're a boss , you need applicants , lots of them , to keep the wages you have to pay nice and low .
And so the more people who believe they need a job , the better it is for you .
I do n't believe that everyone should be an entrepreneur or a freelancer , that everyone should quit their job and go work for themselves .
I do believe this :
The less a project or task or opportunity at work feels like the sort of thing you would do if this is just a job , the more you should do it .

Living With a Computer
The Processor Technology SOL - 20 came into my life when Darlene went out .
It was a bleak , frigid day in January of 1979 , and I was finishing a long article for this magazine .
The final draft ran for 100 pages , double - spaced .
Interminable as it may have seemed to those who read it , it seemed far longer to me , for through the various stages of composition I had typed the whole thing nine or ten times .
My system of writing was to type my way through successive drafts until their ungainliness quotient declined .
This consumed much paper and time .
In the case of that article , it consumed so much time that , as the deadline day drew near , I knew I had no chance of retyping a legible copy to send to the home office .
I turned hopefully to the services sector of our economy .
I picked a temporary - secretary agency out of the phone book and was greeted the next morning by a gum- chewing young woman named Darlene .
I escorted her to my basement office and explained the challenge .
The manuscript had to leave my house by 6:30 the following evening .
No sweat , I thought , now that a professional is on hand .
But five hours after Darlene 's arrival , I glanced at the product of her efforts .
Stacked in a neat pile next to the typewriter were eight completed pages .
This worked out to a typing rate of about six and a half words per minute .
In fairness to Darlene , she had come to a near - total halt on first encountering the word " Brzezinski " and never fully regained her stride .
Still , at this pace Darlene and I would both be dead — first I 'd kill her , then I 'd kill myself — before she came close to finishing the piece .
Hustling her out the door at the end of the day , with $ 49 in wages in her pocket and eleven pages of finished manuscript left behind , I trudged downstairs to face the typewriter myself .
Twenty - four hours later , I handed the bulky parcel to the Federal Express man and said , " Never again . "
Over the next few weeks , my thoughts often drifted to the advertisements I had seen in airline magazines , in which trim and cheerful secretaries effortlessly produced documents by typing in front of computer screens .
Were these devices real ?
I checked with a salesman for a company called Lanier and discovered that while their word - processing system , called " No Problem , " was quite real , it cost some $ 15,000 .
If I had drawn a pie chart representing my annual income , No Problem would have been a very large piece of pie .
I called Wang , Digital Equipment , and some of the other big - name manufacturers and got roughly the same news .
If I called the same manufacturers today , I 'd hear much more encouraging news , but my options were to start writing shorter articles , go into hock , or take my chances again with Darlene .
The way out of my dilemma came from an unexpected quarter .
My father - in - law often dealt with inventors who put together computer systems to monitor various industrial processes , and he thought that one of them might have the answer .
On his advice , I followed a trail of leads and suggestions that eventually led me to a converted church in the farmlands of central Ohio .
There , Bill Cavage , Marv Monroe , and Bill Jones , three young engineers doing business as the Optek Corporation , tinkered with disk drives , photo - sensors , and other devices in hopes of making the big sale .
Optek 's specialty is making machines like the one they produce for drug companies , which counts pills as they pass by at a rate of 24,000 per minute and kicks out any bottles that receive the wrong number of pills .
For men who can do all this , I thought , turning a small computer into a word - processing system should be a cinch .
For a while , I was a little worried about what they would come up with , especially after my father - in - law called to ask how important it was that I be able to use both upper - and lower - case letters .
But finally , for a total of about $ 4,000 , Optek gave me the machinery I have used happily to this day .
The ingredients were the basic four of any word - processing system .
First was the computer itself , the Processor Technology SOL - 20 .
Its detailed specifications — its 48 K of random access memory , its Intel 8080 microprocessing chip — are now of antiquarian interest , since Processor Technology went out of business several months after I bought my computer .
The second element in my system was the monitor , a twelve - inch TV screen .
Some monitors are like black - and - white TVs ; mine — which , oddly enough , was produced by the same company , Ball Corporation , that makes home - canning supplies , displays light - green letters against a background of dark green and is supposed to be easier on the eyes .
Third was the external storage device — the equipment that saves the documents you 've written when the computer is turned off .
The equipment I chose , two small tape recorders , was such a complete disaster that I must discuss it separately later on .
Fourth was the printer , a ponderous machine , built like a battleship , which had been an IBM Selectric typewriter before it was converted to accept printing instructions from a computer .
These four machines , and the yards and yards of multi-strand cable that connected them , were the hardware of my system .
The software consisted of a program called The Electric Pencil , with a manual explaining the mysteries of " block move , " " home cursor , " and " global search and replace . "
I skip past the day during which I thought the computer did n't work at all ( missing fuse ) and the week or two it took me to understand all the moves The Electric Pencil could make .
From that point on , I knew there was a heaven .
HAT WAS so exciting ?
Merely the elimination of all drudgery , except for the fundamental drudgery of figuring out what to say , from the business of writing .
The process works this way .
When I sit down to write a letter or start the first draft of an article , I simply type on the keyboard and the words appear on the screen .
For six months , I found it awkward to compose first drafts on the computer .
Now I can hardly do it any other way .
It is faster to type this way than with a normal typewriter , because you do n't need to stop at the end of the line for a carriage return ( the computer automatically " wraps " the words onto the next line when you reach the right - hand margin ) , and you never come to the end of the page , because the material on the screen keeps sliding up to make room for each new line .
It is also more satisfying to the soul , because each maimed and misconceived passage can be made to vanish instantly , by the word or by the paragraph , leaving a pristine green field on which to make the next attempt .
My computer has a 48 K memory .
Since each K represents 1,024 bytes of information — each byte representing one character or digit — the machine can manipulate more than 49,000 items of information at a time .
In practice , after allowing for the space that The Electric Pencil 's programming instructions occupy in the computer 's memory , the machine can handle documents 6,500 to 7,500 words long , or a little longer than this article .
I break anything longer into chunks or chapters and work with them one at a time .
When I 've finished with such a chunk , I press another series of buttons and store what I have written on my disk drive .
This is a cigar - box - shaped unit that sits next to my computer , connected through a shocking - pink ribbon cable containing thirty - four separate strands .
Inside the drive is the floppy disk , which is essentially magnetic recording tape pressed into the shape of a small record and then enclosed in a square cardboard envelope , 5 1/4 inches on each side .
The system transfers data from the computer to the disk , or vice versa , at about 1,000 words per second , so it is no nuisance to pause after each fifteen or twenty minutes of writing to store what I 've just done .
Each of the disks in my system can hold about 100 K of information , or more than twice as much as a full load from the computer memory .
If one disk is full , I pull it out and snap another in .
When I finish what I 'm working on , I switch on my printer .
If I 'm sending a letter , I load the stationery into the printer and push the print button , and then fish each piece of paper out of the printer when it is done .
There are machines that automatically feed single sheets of paper into the printer , but that takes us back to big slices of the income pie .
If I am printing a draft of an article , I can hook up my tractor feed , push the print button , and go out for a beer .
The tractor pulls an endless sheet of paper through the printer — and the perforated paper can be separated into pages when the printing is done , so it looks like a normal manuscript .
The system prints about thirty characters per second , which means it takes less than a minute per double - spaced page .
When it has completed its work , I take the manuscript and start working it over with a pencil , just as I did in days of old .
The difference is that after I 've made my changes , I have only to type in the changes I have made and start the printer up again — rather than retype the whole mess .
None of this may sound impressive to those who have fleets of secretaries at their disposal , or to writers who can say precisely what they mean the first time through .
Isaac Asimov recently complained in Popular Computing that his word - processor did n't save him much time on revisions , since he composes at ninety words per minute and " 95 per cent of what I write in the first draft stays in the second [ and final ] draft . "
My first - draft survival ratio is closer to one percent , so for me the age of painless revisions is a marvel .
You wo n't catch me saying that my machine has made me a better writer , but I do n't think it has made me any worse .
Since I now spend less time and energy retyping , I have more left over for editing and rewriting , There is even an editing step possible only with the machines .
When I think I 'm finished with an article , I set the print speed to Slow .
This runs the printer at about 100 words per minute , or roughly the pace of reading aloud .
I stuff my ears with earplugs and then lean over the platen as the printing begins .
Watching the article printed at this speed is like hearing it read ; infelicities are more difficult to ignore than when you are scooting your eye over words on a page .
I have not yet stooped to the politician 's trick of programming the computer to write standard letters of reply .
I have , however , discovered a few other sneaky word - processing feats .
Suppose you are writing an article in which an unusual word appears frequently — let us choose " Brzezinski " once again .
When writing the draft , you simply type a certain character , say * or + , each time Brzezinski should appear , and then when you 're ready to print you signal the computer to insert " Brzezinski " in place of the character .
In addition to The Electric Pencil , I bought the software for a computer - programming language known as BASIC .
The B in BASIC stands for Beginners ( the full name is Beginners All - purpose Symbolic Instruction Code ) , but I have not yet found a mathematical project for which BASIC is inadequate .
When I want to know how many prime numbers there are between one million and two million , or how quickly my mortgage payments would bankrupt me if interest rates rose to 35 percent — that is , when I do n't want to do my work — I can kill ten minutes writing programs to tell me the answer .
Getting down to business , I use the computer to do my income tax .
My economic life is a mess of $ 2.75 parking - lot tickets and $ 13.89 lunch receipts , which used to pile up like fall leaves until I spent a week burrowing through them at income - tax time .
Now all I do is sit down at the machine for five minutes every few nights and type in all transactions of interest to the tax man — so much in from my employers , so much out to the credit - card company .
At the end of the year , I load the income - tax program into the computer , push the button marked " Run , " and watch as my tax return is prepared .
Since it took me only about six months to learn BASIC ( and the tax laws ) well enough to write the program , I figure this approach will save me time by 1993 .
O BE SURE , a computer does bring problems into the home .
For one , it creates yet another reason to feel vulnerable to the workings of fate .
Shortly after I got my machine , I was typing away in the basement as a summer thunderstorm moved into town .
Knowing what I now know , these days I immediately shut off the machine and unplug it from the wall whenever thunder is reported any nearer than West Virginia .
But I was not so wise then .
I had turned on the printer and gone upstairs when a bolt of lightning struck the house .
There was a huge boom , and a white flash outside windows on all sides of our house .
Several million volts coursed through our wiring and blew out nearly every electrical appliance that was plugged in .
The blast burned out a clothes iron , and if it had that effect on a big hunk of steel , you can imagine what went on in the computer 's delicate interior .
For a month I was machine - less , thrown back on my Smith - Corona , while computer repairmen replaced one silicon chip after another that had melted in its casing .
Computers cause another , more insidious problem , by forever distorting your sense of time .
When I first saw the system in the back room at Optek , I was so dazzled by the instantaneous deletion of sentences and movement of paragraphs that I thought I could never want anything more .
When the scientists at Optek warned me about certain bottlenecks , I had to stifle my laughter .
In particular , they warned me that I might grow impatient with tape recorders as a way to store data .
You have to understand , they told me , it can take five or ten minutes to load a long draft into the computer from tapes , whereas a disk drive ( which would add a thousand dollars to the cost ) could do the job in seconds .
Typical vulgarians of the machine age , I told myself .
How could they imagine that I would object to five or ten minutes , when I had been spared Darlene ?
Three weeks later , I was griping constantly about the tapes and scanning the pages of Byte magazine , looking for a good deal on a disk drive .
Ten minutes was intolerable when everything else happened in a flash .
Worse , the tapes had the fatal defect of unreliability ; even after waiting ten minutes , you were never quite sure that the information was safely stored .
The only way to tell was to try to feed the data back from the tapes into the computer , which took another ten minutes and often led to the infuriating message " Tape Error . "
After one article disappeared forever behind a thicket of Tape Errors , I scraped up $ 800 for a cut - rate disk drive .
Now my discontent is awakened only when I read stories about the new disks — larger ones that hold twice as much data as mine , and double - density models that hold twice as much as that .
CAN HARDLY BRING myself to mention the true disadvantage of computers , which is that I have become hopelessly addicted to them .
To the outside world , I present myself as a man with a business need for a word - processing machine .
Sure , I have a computer : I 'd have a drill press if I were in the machine - tool business .
This is the argument I make frequently to my wife .
The truth , which she has no doubt guessed , is that I love to see them work .
I nearly destroyed my health , to say nothing of my marriage , during the months when I switched off The Electric Pencil at ten or eleven at night - and then switched on BASIC and spent a few hours refining a tax - and - accounting system .
At first my goal was merely to design a program that would work , that would n't print " Syntax Error in Line 2140 " when I tried to run it .
Then I started playing around , seeing if I could work out a scheme for financial projections that would take care of estimated tax payments to the IRS .
Would it have been easier to mail in the $ 150 each quarter and then square accounts with the IRS at the end of the year ?
Of course — but that was not the point .
Eventually , I aspired even to elegant programming , designing the matrices and the nested loops in a way that added the beauty of simplicity to the scheme .
When I contemplate my future with computers , my emotions are mixed .
Because time and progress have passed my machine by , I simply can't buy any new programs for the SOL .
They do n't exist .
This is a source of unending frustration : how I 'd love to use a new word - processing program , one that could insert footnotes at the bottom of the proper page or automatically prepare an index for a book .
How I 'd love to get VisiCalc or SuperCalc or one of the other accounting systems that can turn a home computer into a miniature version of the National Bureau of Economic Research .
How deprived I feel as I read the fliers for CompuServe and The Source , the over - the - phone services that enable you to make airline reservations , call up old newspaper articles , and send computer mail , all from the privacy of your home .
How I wish my employers would install computers in their headquarters , so I could submit articles over the telephone , one computer to another , instead of fighting the crowds at the Express Mail window .
Yet even as I think these thoughts , I fear their fulfillment .
My computer already competes with wife and children for my affection : can our family stand anything more ?
The question will remain moot until the price of replacement computers comes down a little more — or until I succeed in convincing my wife that she , too , needs a computer , so I can give her mine and rush out to buy a new one for myself ( for business purposes , of course ) .
Y NOW YOU probably want to be like me .
Your first step is to avoid several of the major mistakes .
Since I made them , I know what they are .
1. Guessing wrong .
The chances are that you have already avoided this , my most costly mistake .
The microcomputer industry these days is like the auto business in 1910 , with a thousand little hustlers trying to claim a piece of the action .
The next time you feel depressed about the vigor of the American economy , pick up a copy of Byte — or Personal Computing , or Popular Computing , or Interface Age , or InfoWorld — and look at the columns upon columns of ads from small - time companies with new products to sell .
Still , some parts of the industry have calmed down , at least compared with the chaos of three or four years ago .
To extend the comparison with the auto industry , it was as if different models ran on slightly different kinds of fuel , and no one could be sure which would be the standard when the struggle for survival sorted itself out .
When I bought my computer , many programs were designed for one model of computer only , since the protocols and disk - operating systems varied from one brand to another .
If I had guessed right , my brand , the Processor Technology SOL , would have caught on , and today I 'd have the equivalent of a Mercedes - Benz instead of a Hupmobile .
I 'd be able to buy new programs at the computer store , and I 'd be able to plug in to all the over - the - phone services .
But I guessed wrong , and I 'm left with a specimen of an extinct breed .
When I need new programs , I try to write them myself , and when I have a breakdown , I call the neighborhood craftsman , Leland Mull , who lovingly tends the dwindling local population of SOL - 20s .
You wo n't have this problem , because the war of standardization for personal computers is just about over .
The crucial , bitterly contested territory was the disk - operating system , the coded instructions that enable computers to interface ( the word can not be escaped in this business ) with the disk drives .
My system uses the North Star Disk Operating System , abbreviated DOS and pronounced doss , but North Star did n't win .
The winner was a DOS called CP / M ( for Control Program for Microcomputers ) , which has become the industry standard and is earning millions for a formerly small company known as Digital Research .
Almost any kind of computer you buy these days will be compatible with CP/M , and almost any kind of software will come in CP / M versions .
To put it another way , you should be wary of any machine or any program that wo n't run CP/M .
There are a few exceptions to this rule .
For instance , the Tandy Corporation sells various models of its TRS - 80 computers , at Radio Shack stores .
These can be configured to accept CP / M , but they 're designed for the company 's own operating system , known as TRSDOS , pronounced trissdoss .
Radio
Shack offers so many TRSDOS programs and such an extensive repair - and - support network that you are hardly leaving the mainstream by buying one of their machines .
Another important exception is IBM , which has just burst onto the home market with its Personal Computer .
For those who are deep into the world of gigantic mainframe computers — engineers , for example , who want a home computer so that they can draw over the phone from the main data banks at the office — it offers obvious advantages , since it is compatible with other IBM products .
But it is also part of another war for DOS dominance .
The Personal Computer 's microprocessor — the chip that operates the computer 's logic — is a " 16 - bit " microprocessor , as opposed to the " 8 - bit " chips of most other small computers .
( A bit is a basic yes - or - no , 0 - or - 1 unit of computer information .
The IBM chip can handle twice as many bits at a time . )
The difference between 16 - and 8 - bit chips is of no practical significance at the moment for most home - computer systems , although the 16 - bit chips should support faster - operating and more powerful computer programs , when the software industry catches up with this advance in hardware .
The new machines will require different disk - operating systems , and may therefore inspire another DOS war .
Digital Research has produced a version called CP / M - 86 , which will work on the Personal Computer and other 16 - bit systems , such as the Victor 9000 , but many people suspect that IBM will wage a counteroffensive with a DOS of its own .
2. Scrimping on storage .
Computers are now reaching the " commodity " stage .
With a few glaring exceptions , to be mentioned in a moment , they 're all more or less the same .
Not so the storage devices — the disks or tapes on which you store information when the machine is turned off .
Tapes are obviously a terrible idea , but the wrong kind of disk can be almost as bad .
The practical limit on what a computer can do is not the memory built into the machine itself , although any serious computer should have at least 48 and preferably 64 K of random access memory , but rather how much information it can quickly draw from its disks .
Here again I speak from the perspective of the sadder - but - wiser man .
In moving up from tapes to a disk drive , I took the bargain route .
I bought one rather than two , used small disks ( 5 1/4 " diameter ) rather than large ( 8 " ) , and chose single - rather than double - density storage .
I saved a couple of hundred dollars but bought myself a source of frustration , since each disk fills up too quickly and I have to keep rotating different disks in and out of the drive .
( Again , this may not sound like much to you , but live with it for a year or two and you 'll see what I mean . )
I think you 're cheating yourself if you get anything less than two double - density 5 1/4 " drives , which together should be able to store 400 K or more of data .
The exact capacity varies quite a lot , depending on the configuration a manufacturer chooses .
A two - drive system of 5 1/4 " disks for the Apple III , for instance , can store as little as 280 K , while Heath - Zenith and Victor each offer two - drive 5 1/4 " systems that hold more than 1,000 K , or one megabyte .
In some cases , you may do better to get two 8 " drives , depending on the specific prices and configurations different manufacturers offer .
The top of the line among storage systems is the hard disk , most often available in the form called the Winchester .
( This is not a brand but a nickname , applied by wits in the computer world because the model number on one of the earliest drives was 3030 , reminiscent of a rifle . )
The other disks , known as floppies , get pulled in and out of their drives like tape cassettes , but a Winchester is permanently sealed in its case .
You do n't need to remove the hard disks because each one stores a prodigious amount of data , from two or three on up to several dozen megabytes .
With even a small Winchester , you can store some 2,000 pages of data at once — enough , for example , to contain all the notes for a book , along with drafts of all chapters , or a record of all your correspondence over a period of years .
Winchesters are expensive ; cheap models go for about $ 2,000 , and some of them cost at least twice that much .
But you should n't buy one right now anyway
They 're just entering the period of soaring volume and falling prices and will be cheaper in a year .
3. Scrimping on the printer .
The same misguided frugality that directed me toward tape recorders also tempted me to think that my converted Selectric printer was a great deal .
True , I could have made an even worse mistake .
I could have bought a dot matrix printer , which is fast and cheap but which leaves you with a manuscript resembling a grocery receipt .
If eyes other than your own are going to see the things you print , you 're foolish to get anything except a letter - quality printer .
This means either a converted Selectric , like my first printer , or one of the systems known as daisy wheels or thimbles .
These have small wheels or drums that spin across the page and print at a phenomenal rate .
They cost more than the Selectric to begin with , but they 're a bargain in the long run .
The real cost of the Selectric is the headaches of repair and breakdown .
In operation , it is a blur of rods and connectors , one of which is always about to go awry .
But daisy - wheel printers have only one main moving part .
A year ago , I gave in and bought a daisy wheel , the Anderson - Jacobson 830 model , which cost about $ 1,400 .
In a year of steady use , it has broken once , which is about one tenth as often as the Selectric .
You should get one from the start .
OW THAT YOU know what not to do , you 're ready for more positive advice .
If I were a shrewder man , I would refuse to give it .
One of the perils of dispensing specific advice is that it may be outdated by the time the magazine is in your hands .
The products that are available — and their relative values — are changing almost day by day .
Fortunately for the consumer , all the change seems to be in the direction of more value for less money .
This spring , Radio Shack knocked $ 400 off the price of its small business computer , the Model II — which sounded impressive until Digital Equipment Corporation knocked $ 3,500 off the price of its DECmate .
The Model II with 64 K of memory and one 8 " drive went from $ 3,899 to $ 3,499 , and it can be bought from mail - order firms for about $ 400 less .
The DECmate , with the same memory and two drives , went from $ 6,595 to $ 3,095 .
Meanwhile , several other companies brought small computers onto the market , and there is no end in sight .
Yet another hazard is that recommending the right computer is a little like recommending the " right " ' religion .
People tend to like the system they 've ended up with .
The most important point about computers , more so than about religions , is that the difference between a good one and a bad one is tiny compared with the difference between having one and not .
Finally , a computer will be more or less right depending on what you want to do with it .
If you are mainly interested in playing chess against a computer , you may be quite happy with some of the low - cost computers that Atari , Commodore , and Radio Shack have put out for under $ 400 .
( All three companies also offer good business systems . )
If video games are your exclusive interest , you 'd probably do better to buy a $ 150 TV adapter from Atari — although you'd then be shutting yourself off from all the wonders I have described .
If getting the feel of a computer is your goal , you could buy a Sinclair ZX81 for $ 149.95 or $ 99.95 as a kit .
But if you 're also interested in business uses for your computer , you might think of systems and programs like the ones mentioned below .
Hardware :
Once you move above the bargain - basement machines , to the tier where the computer memories are 48 K or larger and the price is $ 2,000 and up , almost any computer you find will do the job .
Over the past few months , in the interests of thorough research , I have tried computers by Apple and Zenith , Victor and Vector , Digital and Wang , Superbrain and Radio Shack , Atari and North Star , to name just a few .
Despite their differences in detail , the machines seemed to fall into two big general categories .
One is computers per se , which will cost between $ 1,500 and $ 4,000 for the machine itself , plus ( for some machines ) up to $ 1,500 for an adequate complement of disk drives .
Most good letter - quality printers will cost $ 1,500 or more , which means the cost of a complete word - processing system is between $ 5,000 and $ 6,000 .
These computers are not specially designed for word - processing , or for anything else .
They will run whatever program you feed into them .
In the other category are the dedicated word - processors , which are designed for one purpose only .
The IBM Displaywriter is one such machine , and the Wangwriter is another .
NBI and Exxon produce similar systems .
These cost a lot more than the all - purpose computers — the Displaywriter with a good printer was quoted at $ 11,350 by my local IBM dealer .
They 're also easier to use , since they have keys for such things as " delete para " which is n't feasible for more versatile machines .
( When I want to delete a paragraph with my machine , I must place a marker at the beginning of the paragraph , place another marker at the end , and then press both the control button and the U key , which is the signal to remove the material between the markers .
Easier than scissors and paste , but harder than the Displaywriter . )
These single - purpose machines are generally sold not to individuals but to organizations , which presumably would rather pay the price for easily understood machines than train typists in complicated computer routines .
Within each category , your choice of machine depends mainly on taste .
You 'll spend a lot of time with the keyboard : does it feel right ?
The Xerox 820 model and my own SOL - 20 are my favorites on this score ; I liked the Apple least .
Screens come in different colors , sizes , and angles - to - the - horizon .
Sometimes the monitor comes attached to the computer , sometimes you buy it separately ; you have to try them to know your own taste .
Of the ones I 've seen , a green - tinted monitor by NEC ( model JB 1201 M ) seemed the best bargain , at $ 210 ; but patriots should take note that NEC stands for Nippon Electric Company .
Many computers now offer a detachable keyboard , which you can hold on your lap while typing or lay next to a document while you are copying figures or text .
Those who have them say they are wonderful ; since my SOL does n't have one , I consider them silly .
Your choice should probably turn on the best deal you can make , in this blissful era of plummeting prices .
As of press time , some of the systems that struck me as being good for business uses , and also good values , were ( in no particular order ) the Xerox 820 ( $ 3,795 with a 64 K memory and two 8 " drives ) , the Heath - Zenith 89 ( $ 2,895 ) , and the North Star Advantage ( $ 3,125 ) .
The Atari 800 uses your home TV for its monitor , which makes it less desirable for business purposes , but at $ 1,700 for a 48 K system it 's a very good buy .
The Atari also offers more interesting graphics — for example , color - coded bar graphs for a family budget — than many other systems .
The DECmate — at $ 3,095 , as explained above — is a pleasure to use , with a variety of keys usually found only on dedicated word - processors .
Its disadvantages are that its software is overpriced — $ 500 for word - processing , , $ 800 for a mathematical package including BASIC and FORTRAN — and that , at least for now , it is not compatible with CP / M .
The TRS - 80 Model II from Radio Shack is more expensive than some others — about $ 4,100 with two 8 " drives — but it is the only machine that can operate the word - processing program I prefer above all others , Scripsit 2.0 .
Both IBM 's Personal Computer and the Victor 9000 use a 16 - bit microprocessor ; both are handsomer than usual ; but the Victor has a better screen , more internal memory , and larger external storage , so all in all it gives better value for money ( $ 4,995 for the Victor 9000 with a 128 K memory and 1.2 megabytes of storage ; IBM offers only a third as much storage for $ 4,000 ) .
The IBM might be the safer long - term choice , however , since manufacturers are already offering accessories designed specifically for it .
Both of these machines are , for the moment , caught in a software drought , because the established CP / M programs for 8 - bit machines have not been adapted to 16 - bit operation .
This situation will obviously correct itself , not least because IBM is expected to sell more than 100,000 Personal Computers this year .
The best - known small computer is probably the Apple .
Because there are so many Apples in circulation , and because the company has pushed software so aggressively , you can get a wider variety of programs and accessories for an Apple than for any other system .
The Apple II , which costs $ 1,350 with a 48 K memory , is good for games , simple graphics , and other home uses , and with about a thousand dollars ' worth of extra circuitboard it can make a good word - processor .
But for business purposes , you 'd probably do better to look instead at the Apple III .
It costs more than twice as much to begin with , but now that the initial bugs have been worked out , it is ready to do the job without extra attachments .
One of the most interesting new computers , both as a piece of machinery and as a specimen of capitalism in action , is the Osborne I .
Its creator is Adam Osborne , an author of computer books who decided to break the price on - computers .
The Osborne I is a very strange - looking piece of equipment .
When folded up , it resembles a bulky white briefcase ; it is advertised as the only computer that will fit underneath an airline seat .
When unfolded , it looks like an outdated military radio .
It comes with a full - sized keyboard , a 64 K memory , two disk drives , and software for word - processing and accounting that would cost more than $ 1,000 if bought separately .
Osborne offers the whole package for $ 1,795 , which makes it the best bargain on computer power in the business .
The catch is that the built - in screen is about the size of a postcard , although it is much easier to read than that would suggest .
For an extra $ 300 , you can buy a normal - sized monitor and attach it to the Osborne .
In a perfect world , everyone who had a home computer would also have an Osborne to travel with .
According to dealers , Osbornes are selling so fast that many people must have decided that it makes sense not just as their second computer but as their first .
The Otrona Corporation also makes a portable computer , called the Attache .
It is smaller and lighter than the Osborne ( less than twenty pounds , versus the Osborne 's twenty - three ) , it has dual - density disk drives , and its higher - resolution screen displays a full eighty - character line , instead of the Osborne 's fifty - two .
Its only drawback is that , at $ 3,995 , it costs more than twice as much as the Osborne .
One other tip on hardware :
If you live in a climate less humid than Panama's , you must invest $ 100 in an anti-static mat to place under your desk .
If you do n't , in wintertime you 'll get shocks of static electricity when you touch your machine .
There is always the possibility that this will erase what you 're working on at the time .
Software :
If you were a logical creature , you would start here rather than with hardware in making your decision , since certain programs run better on certain machines .
Unfortunately , you will find this hard to do .
It takes weeks or months of use to know a program well enough to judge it , and to get that much experience you usually have to own a machine .
But do n't worry : most people seem happy with whatever program they use .
I thought my version of The Electric Pencil was the greatest thing invented until I examined the newest word - processing programs and realized I was stuck with something outdated and crude .
The basic choice here is between simplicity and complication .
Any word - processing program will do the basic jobs — adding and deleting copy , moving material from one place to another , searching for a word or phrase and replacing it with another .
What you get with the fancier versions is mainly refinements in formatting — for example , the automatic placement of footnotes at the bottom of the appropriate pages .
There is a cost , however , which is a more cumbersome operation .
You have to punch more keys to get things done , and you have to sit longer and wait for the disks to stop whirring and the results to show on the screen .
My program , The Electric Pencil , is a stripped - down model .
It 's very fast and easy to operate , but there are a lot of things it just can't do — for example , automatically center a line , or stop the printer at the end of each page so you can feed in a new sheet .
Today 's most popular word - processing program is WordStar .
Its users swear by it .
It does perform a variety of complicated formatting chores , but to me , on the basis of several hours ' worth of demonstration , it seems to have the benefits of neither simplicity nor complexity .
It 's slow and clumsy to operate , at least in the version I saw on an Apple , without the flexibility of the most sophisticated programs .
If I were looking for a simple program , I 'd stick with The Electric Pencil — which I am forced to do in any case , since nothing new on the market will run in my poor obsolescent SOL .
Or I might choose Magic Wand , which is simpler to use than many of today 's complicated programs .
If you 're looking for sophistication , I 'd suggest you pass by WordStar to choose between two other programs .
One of them , Perfect Writer , is available by mail from Perfect Software , Inc. , 865 Conger Street , Eugene , Oregon 97402 .
( The other programs are available from computer stores for prices between $ 200 an ' d $ 400 . )
It is so sophisticated that one might as well be operating a nuclear reactor , but it does things I 've seen nowhere else .
For example , it allows you to divide the screen with a horizontal line , display one document in the top half and another in the bottom , and move material from one document to the other .
It also has a bigger variety of printing formats than most other programs .
The other choice would be Scripsit 2 . 0 , which is put out by Radio Shack and runs on its TRS - 80 Model II computer .
( Confusing nomenclature : the TRS - 80 Models I and III are the cut-rate versions , while the Model II is the serious business machine . )
I had snobbishly resisted Radio Shack because of the low - rent appearance of its products , but I was forced to the conclusion that , all in all , Scripsit is the best program on the market .
To give one example , it allows you to program up to twenty keys with your own commands .
If you press one key , it might print your return address in the upper corner of the page ; press another , and it can perform a search - and - replace routine you often use .
Like many other programs , Scripsit can also include a spelling - checker , which proofreads documents and is a godsend to the careless typist .
My Picks :
If money were no object , I 'd buy an IBM Displaywriter , which is the prettiest of all the models and has the simplest commands .
Money being an object , I would vacillate helplessly among the TRS - 80 Model II with an extra 8 " disk - drive and Scripsit 2.0 , the Xerox 820 with two 8 " drives and Perfect Writer , and the DECmate .
And yet , a year from now , when its software has caught up with it , I 'd expect to be choosing the IBM Personal Computer .
If I received a small bequest , I 'd also buy an Osborne I — if the bequest were large , an Otrona — to take on the road .
For any of these systems ( not including the Osborne ) , I 'd spend no more than $ 6 , 000 , or half as much as for the Displaywriter .
Godspeed as you follow this advice ; meanwhile , I 'll be spending nothing , sticking with SOL and The Electric Pencil , and hoping for a world in which my sons can grow up to have a better computer than their father had .

SCO Group wants a judge to overrule a jury that found it does n’t own Unix .
Or it wants a fresh trial .
Either , really , as long as SCO gets the result it wants .
The company ’s filed papers with a US court saying the jury hearing its case over whether SCO owned the Unix copyright , and that found for Novell last month , was either too stupid , too confused or too distracted to grasp the compelling power of its evidence .
According to the document here ( warning PDF ) : " We do not know whether the verdict resulted from misapprehension of the jury instructions , confusion about the meaning of prior judicial decisions that Novell read into the record for the ostensible purpose of challenging SCO 's damages theory , Novell 's persistent efforts to focus the jury on the old language of the Asset Purchase Agreement ( " APA " ) which was replaced by a binding amendment , or other factors . "
Yes , they were probably Facebooking on their iPhones , or something .
We hear that happens a lot now .
SCO claimed its evidence demonstrates it owns the Unix and UnixWare copyrights and that the APA proves the copyrights were transferred from Novell .
Sadly , it was SCO that had pleaded with US justices for a jury to hear its case after a summary judgment by Judge Kimball and a bench trial - also held by Kimball - both went against SCO and found the company does not own the copyright on Unix .
Now , SCO wants to revert back to having a judge rule on the case , or conduct a fresh trial - whatever , SCO 's really not bothered .
It 's just that those dumbasses on the jury " simply got it wrong " and the verdict " cannot be reconciled with the " overwhelming evidence " it presented .
Apparently .
Who owns Unix is at the heart of SCO 's argument that has dragged through the courts since the early 2000s that its copyrights have been violated by Linux . ®

Beware of the Beaster Bunny : World 's biggest rabbit is 4ft 3in and weighs more than boy of five
At 4ft 3in from nose to tail , Darius the Continental Giant has been crowned the world 's biggest rabbit .
And he 's still growing .
Darius , pictured with six - year - old Georgia Hadley , is only just over 12 months old and breeder Annette Edwards expects him to keep adding to his 3st 7lb bulk for at least another six months .
That 's good news for her greengrocer in Worcester because he already eats 12 carrots , six apples and two cabbages a day .
Big deal : Darius gets a hug from Georgia Hadley
Thanks to his huge appetite , he has stolen the title from Alice , who also weighs 3st 7 lb but at 3ft 3in is a foot shorter than her offspring .
And Darius may grow bigger still .
Former pet shop owner Annette Edwards , who bred both rabbits , said she expects him to keep developing for at least six months before reaching his full size .
She said : ' He is very gentle and I wonder if this has helped him grow bigger than the rest .
But he also runs around , so the combination of food and exercise has worked out for him .
' He really is a handsome beast and there 's always a glint in his eye when you go near him .
' The frightening thing is that Darius is still growing so he could be absolutely massive by the time he reaches full size . '
She added : ' I only measured him this weekend and that was when I realised he was much bigger than Alice , who is the current record holder .
' People ask me what my secret is , but there really is n't one other than treating them very well . '
Miss Edwards , 59 , has bred four of the world 's biggest rabbits , all Continental Giants , at her home in Worcester .
The first was 3st 7lb , 3ft 6in Roberto , who took the Guiness World Records crown in 2004 after dwarfing a German contender called Herman .
His 3st mate Amy , who had to swap her hutch for a dog kennel because she measured 4ft , overtook Roberto in 2008 but died of a heart attack last year after travelling to Italy for a TV show .
Two - year - old Alice , one of Amy and Roberto's 32 offspring , claimed the title in September .
World 's biggest : Darius dwarfs a more humble member of his species
Miss Edwards is now awaiting confirmation of Darius 's record .
Guinness World Records have stopped accepting entries for the world 's heaviest pets because of fears people were over - feeding them .
Instead Darius will be judged on his length .
A spokesman said last night : ' This is the biggest bunny in the world - Darius is bigger than all the previous record - holding rabbits .
It 's unbelievable that a rabbit could grow to over 4ft long . '
Miss Edwards added : ' It 's nice that the record is being kept in the family .
His grandma
Amy died last year and that was upsetting , but I think she would like to know her grandson had taken the record . '
Miss Edwards made headlines last year after her obsession with her pets prompted her to turn herself into a real - life Jessica Rabbit .
The great grandmother spent £ 10,000 on plastic surgery , including breast and chin implants , a brow lift and botox injections to impersonate the 1988 Who Killed Roger Rabbit film character while she does TV shows with her pets .
Last month she offered a £ 70,000 salary for a helper to carry Alice - who will now be replaced by Darius - during photo shoots because her risqué outfit , teetering heels and inflated chest mean she struggles to handle the animals when in character .
Everybody who has been involved in scientific research knows that it can be very difficult to publish negative results .
Knocking out a gene and finding a severely altered mouse ( and thereby confirming the gene 's importance ) can net you a paper in a high - profile journal ; knocking it out and seeing nothing can make it really difficult to publish anything .
Some researchers have now performed a geographic analysis of positive and negative results , and they found that the rate of positive results is highest in states with the most productive ( and hence the most competitive ) research environments .
The difficulty of publishing negative results , those that indicate a hypothesis that does n't hold water in light of relevant data , can cause significant problems for the scientific community .
If the information is n't out there , researchers might waste time chasing after experiments that are predicated on these hypotheses , or ignore alternative ideas .
So ensuring that negative data eventually reaches the scientific community is essential .
The authors of the new study proposed their own hypothesis on the publication of negative results : researchers in a competitive environment , who are most sensitive to the " publish or perish " mentality that prevails in the sciences , would be less likely to publish papers that describe negative results .
To test the idea , they obtained data from the National Science Foundation on the number of researchers per capita in each state , and then randomly selected research papers that contained the phrase " test * the hypothes * " .
Those papers were characterized as either confirming ( positive result ) or rejecting ( negative result ) the hypothesis .
To link the papers to the geographic data , the researchers used the address of the corresponding author , who is responsible for getting the paper to the journal and answering any further inquiries on it .
The end conclusion of the analysis is that " those based in US states where researchers publish more papers per capita were significantly more likely to report positive results , independently of their discipline . "
In other words , as local competition increases , the fraction of papers that confirmed a hypothesis went up .
The authors looked at a number of factors that could confound the effect — the total number of PhDs per capita , total publication output per state , and R&D expenditure per state — and found no correlation .
So , they feel that their hypothesis is well supported by the data that 's available .
Which makes it seem like the publish - or - perish mentality is seriously distorting the scientific record .
Caveats galore
But even the authors recognize a few factors that they can't control could be distorting their own results .
For example , they recognize that it 's possible that the most competitive research environments produce more perceptive scientists , who are better at choosing the correct hypothesis to test .
The authors also acknowledge that " We cannot exclude the possibility that authors in more productive states simply tend to write the sentence ' test the hypothesis " more often when they get positive results . "
That latter possibility is probably more significant than it sounds .
In many cases , it 's relatively easy to take a set of negative results from a hypothesis - driven experiment and present them as purely descriptive , an indication of how a given experimental system behaves .
If that 's done , the word " hypothesis " would n't appear at all , and the authors of this analysis would n't have ever seen the paper .
Another situation that may have a similar impact is when experiments are done to discriminate between two competing hypotheses .
The work is likely to confirm one of them — if it 's easier to get the work published by focusing on that and downplaying the negative alternative , who would n't take that approach ?
Based on these possibilities , we could propose an alternate hypothesis : researchers in competitive environments are better at presenting their results in a way that 's likely to get them published .
The data presented here is consistent with that hypothesis as well .
None of this is to say that negative results are n't a problem for the scientific community .
The authors noted that they 're such a widely recognized issue that scientists have developed terms for common ways of dealing with them .
( The " file - drawer effect , " for when researchers put the data aside and then forget about it , and " HARKing , " which is shorthand for " Hypothesizing After the Results are Known . " )
The publish - or - perish attitude comes with its own set of problems , as it tends to deemphasize science education skills , and creates the sort of high - pressure atmosphere that has led to scientific fraud .
But , even though both of these issues are problematic , it 's not clear whether the new data is sufficient to link them .
The authors themselves raise some significant questions about their interpretations without even going into some of the basic issues with the data — the corresponding author may not always reside at the site where much of the work was performed , and a US state is generally not a fine - grained measure of a research environment .
Fortunately , the authors are careful enough to say that the data supports their hypothesis , rather than confirm it .
And , in the process , they neatly avoid the possibility that their own paper would qualify for the selection criteria of any follow - up research they do .

Cotton reinforced with boron carbide is tough and hard but nonetheless elastic .
These properties indicate future promise , but this material is not yet bulletproof .
American and Chinese researchers , together with ETH Zurich Professor Brad Nelson , recently published a paper in the scientific journal Advanced Materials in which they presented a new method that uses an ordinary cotton T - shirt as the raw material to make a tough , hard but flexible cloth .
The University of South Carolina , which is heading this project led by Professor Xiaodong Li , suggests in a communiqué that more comfortable and more lightweight bulletproof vests for the police , for example , could be manufactured from this new material .
The media reported that this kind of vest would soon be available .
This is not inconceivable according to Nelson , Professor of Robotics and Intelligent Systems , who is involved in the research project together with his ETH Zurich team .
However , although a successful breakthrough has been achieved with the method of manufacture , much more development work is still needed before conventional bulletproof materials , such as Kevlar , can be replaced .
Bath in boron
To create their new material , the researchers dipped strips of cotton shirt into a boron solution enriched with nickel , after which the pieces of cloth were heated to 1160 °C in a furnace .
At such a high temperature and under an inflow of argon , a furry coat of boron carbide nanofibres forms on the cotton microfibres .
Boron carbide is the third - hardest known material at room temperature , and is in fact the hardest above 1100°C .
After the nanofibres have formed , the cotton microfibres turn into boron - reinforced carbon microfibres .
A droplet of catalyst material sits on the tip of each nanofibre .
Unlike solid boron carbide , these fibrils are extremely elastic and flexible .
This is shown by tests on individual nanofibres that Nelson carried out in his laboratory , which specialises in studies of this kind .
Nevertheless the boron carbide nanofibres display the strength and rigidity of solid boron carbide .
All in all the fabric itself remains light - weight and flexible like the cotton T - shirt , but at the same time it is also tougher and more rigid at the nanoscale .
Brad Nelson works in the field of micro- and nano - robotics .
For him the emphasis is quite clearly on the development of the raw material .
Although the T - shirt is important as a possible application , he believes the manufacturing process to be the key .
Nelson finds the idea of being able to use an everyday material like cotton simultaneously as a support substance and as a catalyst , thus completely changing its properties , very promising and revolutionary .
One could certainly imagine a large number of applications for such materials , from self - actuated loudspeaker membranes to light - weight aircraft materials to protective clothing for the fire brigade .
In addition , the boron carbide cloth almost completely blocks out a variety of ultraviolet rays .

Australia and the United States appear to be on a collision course on the issue of internet censorship .
In a wide - ranging speech last night , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accused countries that filter search engines of contravening the UN's Universal Declaration on Human Rights .
Taken literally , that is what the Australian Government has planned with the internet filtering regime it promised last month to introduce .
Critics of the filtering plan say the Federal Government should heed Ms Clinton 's words and scrap the filter .
" Countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century , " Senator Clinton said in the speech .
And she urged global condemnation of countries which build electronic barriers to parts of the internet or filter search engines .
She singled out Iran , Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
China was clearly in her sights as well ; internet giant Google has threatened to quit China over concerns about censorship and cyber attacks .
Censorship ' club '
The vice chairman of Electronic Frontiers Australia , Colin Jacobs , opposes the Federal Government 's internet censorship plan .
" China is not alone in censoring the internet - and that 's a club that Australia is unfortunately set to join if the Rudd Government get their way this year , " he said .
" [ Ms Clinton ] did say that censorship should not be in any way accepted by any company from anywhere and that governments should not prevent people from connecting to the internet or to websites or to each other .
And that 's exactly what the Rudd Government has in mind . "
The Government 's plan involves asking internet service providers to block content that the National Classification Board decides should be " Refused Classification " .
Such content includes child sex abuse content , bestiality and instructions in crime and drug use .
In a statement , the responsible Australian Government minister , Stephen Conroy , welcomed Ms Clinton 's speech .
He says the Government also agrees with her observations that all societies recognise that " freedom of expression has its limits " .
But Mr Jacobs says Senator Conroy is taking Senator Clinton 's words out of context .
" She goes on to say that we acknowledge that there are limits to free speech but the internet is so important that we can't jeopardise the advantages by introducing censorship , " he said .
" So the Government has sort of twisted the words to throw their own policy in a better light . "
' Badgering China '
Mr Jacobs is hoping the US will push a free - internet agenda in bilateral meetings with Australia .
But that is unlikely , according to Michael McKinley , a senior lecturer in international relations and strategy at the Australian National University .
" I do n't think Hillary Clinton 's comments were aimed at Australia , " he said .
" They were really aimed at harassing and badgering China for obvious reasons and for some quite good reasons . "
Dr McKinley does not think it will challenge Ms Clinton 's authority if she is waving a stick at China over internet freedom yet letting Australia plough its own course .
" If we expect consistency from United States Cabinet members , particularly a Secretary of State , I think we 've sorely misplaced our expectations , because this is a measure aimed primarily at China at this point in time , " he said .
Dr McKinley also argues the issue will not be contentious between the two countries , because he does not believe the proposed internet filter in Australia will actually work .
That is a view shared by the President of Australian Lawyers for Human Rights , Susan Harris - Rimmer .
" That depicts the fine regulation because it keeps being able to be hacked into [ and able to ] overcome all kinds of government control , " she said .
" So it 's the beauty and the danger of the net that governments are trying to deal with and they 're not doing a very good job of it yet . "
Dr Harris - Rimmer says the broader question that must be settled is which infringements on the rights of people to access information on the internet are legitimate in the interest of public safety , and which are not .
China condemns US
But China has come out condemning any criticism of Beijing 's controls on the internet , saying Washington 's push against online censorship could harm relations between the two big powers .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said the US criticisms could hurt ties between the two nations , which are both among the world 's biggest economies .
" The US has criticised China 's policies to administer the internet and insinuated that China restricts internet freedom , " Mr Ma said .
" This runs contrary to the facts and is harmful to China - US relations .
" We urge the United States to respect the facts and cease using so - called internet freedom to make groundless accusations against China . "
But the Chinese spokesman also indicated that his government did not want to see the dispute overwhelm cooperation with the Obama administration , which has sought Beijing 's backing on economic policy and diplomatic stand - offs , such as Iran and North Korea .

This article is from Winnipeg Sun ; Aaron Funk is talking about how he met John and how Speed Dealer Moms came to life .
If you ’re interested in reading more on Aaron Funk , have a look at this , too .
This article has some not - so - positive comments on people ’s interest in the newly - formed band , so be well prepared for it .
You might not know who Aaron Funk is , but if you ’re a music fan , you ’ve probably heard of his new bandmate : Guitarist John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
The L.A. rocker and the Winnipeg musician are the leaders of Speed Dealer Moms , an electronica outfit that grew out of their recently minted friendship .
“ He was a fan of my music , ” explains Funk .
“ He turned up at a couple of my gigs in Europe .
We started talking about music and we sort of became really good friends .
He ’s a cool dude .
We just share this huge love of making music .
We really clicked . ”
So much so that when the Chili Peppers went on indefinite hiatus last year , Frusciante came to Winnipeg for a couple of weeks in August to hang out — and naturally , the duo ended up recording together at Funk ’s home studio .
“ We just made music the whole time , ” he says .
“ We have this really good telepathic chemistry . ”
When he says “ the whole time , ” he means it .
The duo , often joined by fellow Winnipeg electronica artist Chris McDonald of The Alison Project , recorded more than 11 hours of material .
“ A lot of it is acid - electro - techno kind of stuff , ” says Funk .
“ It ’s pretty strange .
It does n’t sound like anything I ’ve ever heard before . ”
Based on what we ’ve heard , it certainly does n’t sound like the Chili Peppers .
Frusciante does n’t play guitar on any of the cuts , some of which last up to half an hour and range from soothing chillout music to chilling horrorscapes to chaotic grooves .
Funk has since travelled to Los Angeles to continue recording with the 38 - year - old guitarist , who has maintained an active and eclectic solo career during his tenure with the Peppers .
More sessions are planned — but at this stage , there are no plans to release any material .
“ We ’re just doing it for fun .
I think it ’s cool if we never release anything .
I ’m totally happy with that .
We ’re just doing it for us — not to be a product . ”
But there is one way you can hear Speed Dealer Moms :
At April ’s Bang Face Weekender music festival on the English coast , where the Moms are slated to make their live debut .
“ People seem to be making a huge deal out of it , ” says Funk , admitting he ’s not keen on the fuss .
“ I feel kind of weird about it .
I am kind of concerned about having to deal with people who just want to check us out because of John ’s brand name . ”
Then again , he ’s not too worried .
After all , “ any Red Hot Chili Peppers fans who come to one of my shows are in for a shock . ”

Remember when Mark Streit was the designated Babysitter - in - Chief for any new young pups thrown into an already inexperienced Islanders blueline ?
If a guy was getting his first NHL exposure in 10 minutes or less , chances are he'd get some protected shifts with Streit , a veteran babysitter whose mobility covers up a lot of oopsies .
But you do n't have that luxury when half your blueline is newbies , as has been the case for the past few months with Radek Martinek out , Brendan Witt demoted , Andy Sutton traded , and the suddenly " experienced " Jack Hillen and Andrew MacDonald doing month - long turns on IR .
Now sophomore Hillen -- who spent time carrying Joe Callahan and Thomas Pock last year -- becomes a babysitter ( for Dustin Kohn and Mark Flood ) , and Freddy Meyer does a turn in a thus - far successful pairing with deadline depth pickup Dylan Reese .
Kohn ( age 22 ) , Reese ( 25 ) and Flood ( 25 ) all made their NHL debuts in emergency situations with the Islanders this year ( as did Anton Klementyev , now 20 , in a double - emergency situation that got him a very protected 6:20 over eight shifts versus Columbus ) .
Overall at even strength , who 's been playing with whom ?
Pretty chart - like substance after the jump :
Note :
This info is from Dobber Hockey , a fun site for toying with all sorts of stats and line combos .
For instance , did you know that Jack Hillen 's most frequent even - strength partner -- 20.02 % of his shifts -- in 2008 - 09 was Thomas freaking Pock ?
Dobber Hockey pulls the data from NHL play - by - play sheets like this one from the Ottawa game .
The way to read this :
Player 's in the left column have spent X percent of their total even - strength ice time this season with the players listed across the top row .
So Flood has played 59.82 % of his time with Hillen , 17.48 % with Streit .
And top - downward , Hillen has been the partner for 42 % of Kohn 's NHL shifts , nearly 60 % of Flood 's , 7 % of Reese 's , etc .
I did not include every partner -- and I left out Witt and Martinek from early in the year .
Left to right , I included only the top two or three partners for each guy , with the exception of Freddy Meyer , who 's truly been the all - purpose partner as a theoretical 7th defenseman .
Even Strength with : Kohn Flood Reese MacDonald Hillen Meyer Streit Sutton Gervais Kohn ( 22 GP )
42.18 % 39.74 % Flood ( 5 GP )
59.82 % 17.48 % Reese ( 15 GP )
7.14 % 82.14 % 7.79 % MacDonald ( 42 GP )
54.32 % 22.63 % Hillen ( 65 GP )
9.84 % 11.65 % 8.90 % 45.89 % Meyer ( 60 GP )
11.16 % 18.61 % 14.03 % 11.82 % 12.36 % Streit ( 78 GP )
25.62 % 6.58 % 45.80 % Gervais ( 68 GP )
9.71 % 58.61 %
Now the next step would be to ask :
How are these babysitter arrangements going ?
Is it time to call in a nanny , or toss the babies out with the bathwater ?
( Wait ... what ? )
But I 'm not going to go there -- at least not via numbers that can be misleading in such brief samples .
But feel free to relay your own interpretation .
From observation alone though , I will opine this : Streit - MacDonald is a successful , complementary pairing ; Meyer - Reese has been surprisingly effective ( Reese : +6 in 15 games , Meyer : +4 in that time ) , in no small thanks to Meyer 's reign of Sutton - like bone - crushing along the boards ; and Jack Hillen has been a saint the past two years for making do with every Pock - come - lately partner under the Sun .
The unspoken word here is " Bruno Gervais , " out the past few games with a groin strain .
The inconsistent Bruno generally has had his best nights when partnered with Streit -- but again , Streit can make any defenseman look good , and I 'm not sure anyone would suggest that Streit - Gervais is preferable to Streit MacDonald .
( But if you would , speak up . )
Flood is likely the odd man out when Gervais returns ; how will that affect the pairings ?
What does this all mean for next year ?
We have months and months to chew it over .
Beer drinkers now have a good excuse to order another round - the brew may help keep bones strong , a study has found .
Researchers from the Department of Food Science and Technology at the University of California , have found beer is a rich source of silicon and may help prevent osteoporosis , as dietary silicon is a key ingredient for increasing bone mineral density .
Drinking beer could be good for bone density , study finds .
These were the findings after researchers tested 100 commercial beers for silicon content and categorised the data according to beer style and source .
Previous research has suggested beer contained silicon but little was known about how silicon levels varied with the different types of beer and malting processes .
Authorities , media launch witch - hunt against Sylvia Young
Who are the real criminals behind the Detroit house fires ?
By Tom Eley
8 March 2010
Detroit area media and city and state authorities have launched a witch - hunt against Sylvia Young , the mother of three young children who died in a March 2 house fire on Bangor Street on Detroit 's west side .
The basic facts of the case are not in dispute .
Energy giant DTE
Energy cut off unauthorized gas and electricity hook - ups to the house earlier in the day .
Electrical power was soon reactivated , evidently by order of the landlord , who left Young with a faulty and dangerous space heater .
As temperatures dropped toward freezing , Young went to purchase new space heaters .
While she was gone a fire consumed the house , killing her children Trávion Young , five , Fantasia Young , four and Selena Young , three .
Her 12 - year - old son Tywon was able to rescue three siblings , including an infant who he tossed from a window to neighbors below .
Overlooked is another indisputable fact : utility shutoffs inevitably lead to house fires , as desperate households do whatever they can to keep warm .
With DTE shutting off households ' utilities by the tens of thousands in southeast Michigan — 221,000 last year alone — deadly house fires are a common occurrence .
In January , three people — two of whom were wheelchair - bound — died in a fire triggered by a space heater after DTE had cut gas heat to their Dexter Avenue house .
Last winter , three young children and their aunt died in a house fire in nearby Highland Park .
The house was without gas or electricity , which had been cut by DTE .
Fires like the one that killed the three children on Bangor Street result from the subordination of the most basic human needs for water , light and warmth to the profit drive of large corporations .
But the media and state authorities have responded to the tragedy by blaming the victims .
In the immediate aftermath of the fire , local media , led by the Detroit Free Press and staff writer Amber Hunt , attempted to smear Sylvia Young .
In an article headlined “ Mom was at Store when Three Children Died in House Fire , ” Hunt included the following hearsay statement from Fire Chief Gary Lauer : “ I 'm just going by what was said at the scene , that she had gone to the party store . ”
The clear implication here was that Young was off buying alcohol .
Hunt did not attempt to check this second - hand statement by interviewing neighbors or Young herself .
In fact , Young had gone to a discount store to purchase two space heaters after her children complained that they were cold .
She left the small children with her 12 - year - old son , hardly unusual in the US , and was gone for about 15 minutes .
A later television report showed the tearful mother with the two space heaters she had purchased .
Hunt and the Free Press are aware that their initial story , with its insinuation that Young had gone to purchase alcohol , has been discredited .
But in several articles on the fire since then , they have not retracted it .
Instead Hunt has repeated in each article that Young “ was not home at the time ” — without once mentioning that Young had gone to purchase space heaters .
The media 's attack on Young has evidently set the stage for her prosecution , with state officials reportedly considering charges of negligence over her desperate actions to keep her children warm .
This could result in Young losing her four surviving children .
Young was doing what any parent would have done , given the situation .
Criminal negligence , “ recklessly acting without reasonable caution and putting another person at risk of injury or death , ” is a far better description of DTE 's action in shutting off electricity to a home with seven young children .
Yet while the Free Press has criminalized Sylvia Young , it has repeatedly used its “ news articles , ” penned by Hunt , as a propaganda platform for DTE executives to tout the “ many options ” available to those who cannot afford the utility giant 's high costs .
In one article , the newspaper quotes DTE spokesman Scott Simons as declaring , “ We ca n’t encourage customers enough to contact us if they ’re having problems paying their utility bills , but if we do n’t know about them , it ’s very tough . ”
In a different article Hunt quoted another DTE spokesman , John Austerberry , as claiming unauthorized hook - ups are not necessary because DTE “ offer [s ] protection for customers who are most vulnerable already . ”
These statements , presented uncritically as fact , are simply untrue .
Had the Free Press performed basic investigative journalism — attempting to verify assertions — they would have discovered that Young had sought help — pleading with DTE that very day not to cut off her utilities .
Young was also one of around 10,000 people who went to an event sponsored by DTE last summer at the State Fair Grounds seeking assistance but receiving none .
( See “ Thousands line up for utility bill assistance in Detroit ” )
The so - called “ help ” available to families is derisory .
State and charitable aid is difficult to access and inadequate when it is forthcoming .
A WSWS investigative report reveals that the much - touted THAW program is no longer taking applicants and has n't been for weeks .
( See “ THAW , United Way : No help for utility shutoffs ” . )
The absurdity of DTE 's claims of abundant help — echoed by state and local officials — are exposed by the company 's own statistics on utility shutoffs , which number nearly 400,000 in the area over the past two years .
But the Free Press and other local media were not interested in revealing the truth about the social crisis in Detroit and exposing who is really responsible .
Just the opposite .
Their coverage aims to obscure the basic reality and shift blame to the victims .
By all evidence and the testimony of her neighbors , Sylvia Young is a caring mother doing the best she can under difficult circumstances .
Like much of the working age population in Detroit she is unemployed , attempting to survive on woefully inadequate public assistance .
She told the World Socialist Web Site that she had tried to gain assistance for her debt to DTE , but could not .
The media has also maligned Young and , indeed , much of the population of Detroit for “ energy theft ” — tapping into the electrical grid without making payments to DTE .
Michael Lynch , chief security officer at DTE Energy , said the practice “ affects you and it affects me , because we all pay higher utility rates because of these thieves who are stealing electricity and getting it for free . ”
“ These are not individuals that cannot afford to pay their utility bills , ” Lt. Derek Hassan of the Detroit Police Copper Theft Task Force said .
“ These are individuals , many of whom have been stealing electricity for years in some cases . ”
In fact , the vast majority of people in this situation have already lost their utilties , and in some cases have been without them for years .
This desperate and dangerous act — in which several people hooking up wires to utility polls have been electrocuted and killed — arises from mass joblessness and dire poverty , which permeates Detroit .
Anyone would prefer safe and affordable access to “ legal ” electricity , but given the alternative — freezing to death — it is hardly suprising that people take whatever measures are necessary to survive .
The real crime is the sacrifice of the most essential human needs to the personal enrichment of the top executives and stockholders at corporations like DTE .
What kind of society is it that such elemental requirements as water , warmth and light are available to only those who can contribute to the vast personal fortunes of the likes of multi-millionaire Anthony F. Earley , CEO of DTE ?
This regime of distribution , overseen and enforced by state and local authorities , excuses no one , no matter how vulnerable — not young children , not the elderly , not the disabled .
Those who cannot pay tribute to these legal monopolies are counted as worthless , or worse — as criminals deserving of punishment .
The Socialist Equality Party demands an immediate end to all utility shutoffs in Detroit , Michigan , and the US .
It further demands the expropriation of the utilities from their wealthy private owners .
The utilities must be placed under the democratic control of the working class and made available to all , regardless of ability to pay .
It is first necessary to expose the reality of what capitalist ownership of the utilities means for cities like Detroit .
The SEP and the World Socialist Web Site encourage residents to attend and share their own stories at the March 20 citizen ’s inquiry into utility shutoffs .

Facebook has threatened to sue the Daily Mail for damages after the paper wrongly claimed in a piece published on Wednesday that 14 - year - old girls who create a profile on the social networking site could be approached " within seconds " by older men who " wanted to perform a sex act " in front of them .
The paper apologised in print today and online yesterday for the error , which the author of the piece , Mark Williams - Thomas , insisted had been introduced at the paper despite being told it was wrong .
Williams - Thomas , a former policeman who now works as a criminologist , subsequently explained : " At 19.48 hours on Tuesday 9th March I sent amended copy to the interviewing journalist at the Daily Mail in which I had made small but significant changes to the copy she had sent to me which I read at 19.21 , including removing the word Facebook and replacing it with ' well known social networking site ' .
I made it very clear to the journalist and her alone that the changes I had made were necessary before publication .
It is clear that the changes were not made ...
At no stage prior to publication did I have any communication with any editors at the Daily Mail . "
Williams - Thomas insists that he was not using Facebook but had been using another , unspecified social network .
But the giant social networking site , which has 23 million users in the UK alone , said that although the Mail has changed the headline of the article online – so that it now reads " I posed as a girl of 14 online .
What followed will sicken you " – it had not at first changed the page title of the article online , used by internet search engines to index content , nor the URL of the piece , which is also a factor in search - engine indexing .
At 10 am today the title still read " I posed as a girl of 14 on Facebook .
What followed will sicken you " while the URL contained the text " i-posed - girl-14-facebook -what - followed - sicken - you " .
The title and URL were , however , amended before noon .
A UK spokeswoman for Facebook said the company was still considering legal action and looking at the " brand damage that has been done " .
Charles Garside , assistant editor of the Daily Mail , said that the apology had been produced in consultation with Facebook , and that representatives of the paper and Facebook would be meeting today .
The changes to the URL and page title were " a technical matter " , he said , adding : " We are removing elements of that " .
The incorrect naming of Facebook is understood to be blamed on " a matter of miscommunication " .
Facebook staff claimed that attempts to add a comment to the piece , as readers are able to do , were repeatedly blocked by the Daily Mail .
The company is concerned that the article may have done permanent harm to its reputation in the UK .
" If you were a Middle England reader and your child was on Facebook , this sort of thing would have a very serious effect on what you thought of us , " said the Facebook spokeswoman .
Tensions over Facebook 's position in the UK as a popular site among people of all ages , allowing them to contact each other , have been magnified in the past week after Peter Chapman was convicted of murdering Ashleigh Hall , a 17 - year - old girl who thought that Chapman , 33 , was also a teenager .
Chapman had got in touch with Hall via Facebook , leading to criticisms from some senior police officers over the measures that the site takes to protect susceptible individuals .
But the Daily Mail piece , which carried Williams - Thomas 's byline , suggested that anyone who signed up as a 14 - year - old girl would be approached " within minutes of the profile going up " .
The piece also said that " messages from men poured in " and that " the first three who approached me were aged between 20 and 40 " .
However , Williams - Thomas and his agent , Sylvia Tidy - Harris , both insisted on their Twitter feeds that he had not used Facebook for the Mail article .
It " was on another well - known SNS [ social networking service ] , not Facebook " , said Tidy - Harris , echoing Williams - Thomas .
Tidy - Harris said that yesterday had " Been a hellishly tough day trying to juggle @mwilliamsthomas misquote in daily mail along with meetings and literally 100 ks of calls / emails " .
At Facebook , the anger at the misrepresentation was magnified because , they say , they were initially unable to get any response from the paper to their appeals for corrections .
" The people at Facebook in the US were reading this and knew at once that it could n't have been our platform , " said the Facebook UK spokeswoman .
" We have made Facebook much more favourable to the safety of minors – minors under 18 cannot receive messages from somebody over 18 . "
That means it would be impossible for the scenario described by Williams - Thomas to happen on Facebook .
Facebook 's representatives said that they tried to get a response from the Mail throughout Wednesday without success , and that attempts by people at its PR agency to post comments on the piece with clarifying text failed .
The Mail uses moderators who on that story approved comments before they could appear .
By this morning the article had 380 comments .
Williams - Thomas has not responded to requests to specify which social networking service he was using by the time of publication .
• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857 .
For all other inquiries please call the main Guardian switchboard on 020 3353 2000 .
• If you are writing a comment for publication , please mark clearly " for publication " .
• This article was amended on Friday 12 March to clarify that Mark Williams - Thomas says he had no contact with " editors at the Daily Mail " and to include his expanded clarification of the chain of events from his point of view .

If you look at the scorecard when today 's action is all said and done , you 'll see that Phil Mickelson parred the second hole .
That does n't really begin to tell the story .
Mickelson absolutely bombed his tee shot on the par 5 , sending it 376 yards and leaving himself just 199 yards to the pin .
Up and down for an eagle , certainly not out of the question .
He 'd put his approach in the sand , however , and his bunker shot was a competent - if - unspectacular save that gave him a short putt for birdie .
Then this happened :
That ?
That is as wretched as luck can get .
We 're not even particularly positive what that thing is , much less how it got into Mickelson 's line right as he started his backstroke .
The announcers ended up speculating that it was pine straw and that it might have been flicked by somebody in the gallery .
That seems completely implausible for any number of reasons , but watch that video again .
Plausible ai n't here .
So , conspiracy theories start here .
It could n't have come from a tree -- there are n't any around the hole for about 50 yards , and the angle at which it hit is way too sharp for such a windless day .
So what 's your idea for how this happened ?

Gary Bettman is not stupid .
He may be obstinate , and he may refuse to admit mistakes , but you do n't get to that position and keep it for so long without knowing a thing or two about how wheels turn , and a thing or five about how to give your bosses -- all 30 of them -- what they want .
Yet best I can tell , I 'm in a minority among NHL fans in that I do n't wake up each day stabbing my Bettman voodoo doll .
It 's not that I 'm thrilled with his decisions , it 's that I know he represents the head of a multi-party , multi-billionaire body .
If it were n't Bettman , it'd be some other circular talking suit trying to balance the competing interests of the NHL owners while also keeping them on the same page .
I 'm pretty sure I 'd be angry with the moves of any guy in this office .
If you think the owners would easily hire an upgrade , you did n't live through John Ziegler or " Hall of Famer " Gil Stein .
Psst .
It 's the owners , man .
NHL owners are pushers .
They are trying to get us addicted to their product and steadily charge more for it as they add new addicts demand .
This is why I really do n't mind that the NHL is n't as popular as the other " Big Four " U.S. sports ; that would only be bad for my wallet .
My ideal is an NHL that is popular enough to be accessible , but not so popular that it can be a bully like the NFL or blanket sports talk radio with idiots like every other sport does .
That said , I 've no love lost for the way the guy comes off .
Sometimes he can't help it -- he 's inherently in a PR role , which is to say a big part of his job is to use corporate double - speak to put lipstick on every pig in the room , be it a charming prize - winning pig or a pig headed to the slaughterhouse .
And sometimes his obfuscating answers are so surreal , they demand mocking , which is fun .
That 's why we have a translation machine for Gary Bettman - speak ...
But first , two more morsels for thought to remind you that in your alternate universe where Bettman never came around , the grass would not necessarily be much greener :
" Bettman " is Shorthand for " Things I Don't Like about the Game " " Bettman 's trying to eliminate fighting ... "
Ha , sorry kid .
The NHL has been trying to curb fighting since the early 1980s , and it reached a fever pitch before Bettman entered office .
Dig up any fighting article from the late ' 80s and hear former president John Ziegler and various GMs at wit 's end trying to curb the violence that did n't play so well on casual observers '
TV .
The role of the NHL head on this issue is always to act shocked , shocked by gruesome fights , while casually insisting it's an important part of the game .
The fear here has always been that rampant fighting limited the league 's audience .
Which brings us to ...
" Bettman is so determined to prove his SunBelt dream can work ... "
Oh it was Bettman 's dream , was it ?
Nope .
Sorry johnny - come- lately , but you 've missed out on NHL history .
Sure , GB was hired to execute a long - existing expansion vision -- but that 's a vision the NHL has desired since 1967 and has chased in every decade since .
The idea that Population Trends Move South and West = We Need to Be Where the People Will Be is as old as a franchise known as the Los Angeles Kings .
The desire for the NHL to have a national footprint attractive enough to draw U.S. TV audiences is as old as something called the Oakland ( California Golden ) Seals .
The irony is that actually seeing out this plan requires a multi-generational commitment to growing the game in those markets ( see Dallas , California ) -- and that 's a long - term view that few NHL owners have the longevity to see through .
" Bettman 's OT bonus point scheme is a joke ... "
Actually ... well , that 's 100 % true .
It 's asinine .
( Though I do n't know if even that was his baby . )
Are games worth two points or three ?
Is a game decided by goals or by a 1 - on - 1 trickshot drill with no defensemen and no backcheckers ?
What is a " loss ? "
What is " hockey " again ?
This PR Machine is Fully Operational , Mildly Translatable
So anyway , now that I 've made those nuanced points , we can get to the smug , talk - a- lot but - say - nothing style he uses , which irks so many .
What follows is a translation of his recent Q&A with the Los Angeles Times .
[ Note :
These are excerpts for satirical purposes ; the full interview is at latimes.com . ]
If you can put on your cynical PR observer 's hat for a moment , his lawyer - ese language is actually a stunning sight to behold :
Question : Having the Kings in the playoffs after a long absence , having the L.A. market involved , what are your thoughts ?
Bettman : " It 's always good for the fans of a team .
Any team .
It 's always good for any organization to overcome the long droughts when a team has n't been as successful as everyone would have hoped . "
Translation : " It is my job to be happy for any team 's success , like a parent who never chooses sides .
Something good happen somewhere ?
' It 's always good . '
But yes , I do get special satisfaction whenever a franchise who jingoists in the Canadian media rip to draw cheap clicks becomes vibrant again .
It makes me a happy penguin . "
Bettman : " It 's a coincidence .
It 's good to be here .
We 've been planning [ the 2010 draft ] , as have the Kings , for a while , but we know that this is a market that will support hockey .
We had a terrific All - Star Game here in 2002 , when things were not as exciting as they are today .
But you always have to look at these things for the long term . "
Translation : " It 's totally a coincidence the draft is in L.A .
Never mind that with all of last summer 's sideshow , we really really really wanted to prove a point to Balsillie by holding it in Phoenix .
But as that ownership quagmire lingered into the winter , it became too much of a reach for even us " this - pig- smells - like - a- rose " types in the NHL office to hold the draft in a city that might not have a team anymore .
" And yet , league movers and shakers still wanted to be able to play golf , so L.A. it is .
Did I mention the awards show will be in Vegas ?
Vegas , baby ! "
Q. I think that perception [ that Kings owner Phil Anschutz is cold and distant ] is fed by his choice to not be in the public .
Bettman : " But he 's like that in all of his endeavors .
It 's no different than any of the multitude of businesses that he owns .
This is the way that he chooses to conduct himself , but I think ultimately he should be judged by the fact that he has always stood behind this team .
And believe me , because over the years I 've seen firsthand how he feels .
He does not like losing . "
Q. Can you give an example of conversations that you might have had with him , issues important to him ?
Bettman : " It 's more that I know it pains him when the team is n't successful . "
Translation : " Crap , did I almost give you something worth knowing ?
Strike that from the record immediately .
" And to answer your question : No , I can not give you any examples of the claim I just made , other than to say Anschutz 's CPU is a neuronet processor , a learning computer .
Which is true .
I even saw him smile once .
" But elaboration on a claim ?
That 's not how we roll .
Generally , the drill goes like this : I declare , you repeat .
Next question . "
Q : If you can just update a little bit on where that [ Coyotes ] situation stands .
Bettman : " ... The process still has work that remains to be done .
We remain optimistic that everybody 's going to do what they need to do , and it 's nice to see that the team has had success because it 's demonstrating , among other things , that people in the Valley of the Sun , will support a team that has credibility on the ice .
And that people know how to get to Westgate .
" Hopefully it will all come together .
We 've put a lot of effort into stabilizing the team and doing what needed to be done last year .
And hopefully the things that will need to get done in order to finalize all the arrangements that are necessary for the team will hopefully get done in the not too distant future . "
Translation : " It 's nice to know Coyotes fans remember how to get to the arena we went through so many hoops to get Glendale to build .
But mostly the situation stands on hope .
As in : Do you know how much of my bosses ' money I gambled on this situation ?
I sure hope it works out . "
Q. Is there an ownership issue as well in Dallas , with Tom Hicks ?
Bettman : " I think first and foremost it 's been very public that Tom Hicks has been in a process to sell the [ Texas ] Rangers .
I think it 's just been announced that there 's a process to sell Liverpool .
And he 's made no secret that he 's looking at his options with respect to the Stars .
I believe there are a lot of people who , if the team is ultimately to be sold , would be interested in buying the Stars . "
Translation : " First and foremost , I think it 's very important that everyone understand I can take 75 words to say , ' Yes , Hicks is screwed , ' and I do n't mind doing it over and over until you move on to a new topic .
One way I like to do that is by using ' with respect to ' as its own relative pronoun .
It creates a lovely distance between anything I say and ... what was the topic again ? "
Q . They 're going through a down time competitively , but in terms of people supporting them , are they OK over the long term ?
Bettman : " I think the issues are less about the Stars than a more general issue with respect to Tom 's relationship to his banks .
The team is doing OK .
That team is not a concern . "
Translation : " With respect to that statement that you just made that ended in a question , I 'm not sure I , generally speaking , want to answer .
But if you 're worried about something , let me assure you that , with respect to the NHL , categorically it's not a concern , because the NHL is strong and getting stronger . "
Q. Looking at the playoffs so far , so many games have been so close and so competitive .
Home ice has not really been that huge an advantage .
Is this ultimately what you envisioned in terms of parity and competitiveness ?
Bettman : " First and foremost , blah blah blah ... words ... blah blah ... words ... officiating , rules , salary cap ... words . "
Translation : " Did you just serve me a softball to talk about how great our game is under the new CBA ?
Hang on , I have some talking points on this legal pad I 'm due to regurgitate ... "
Q . You got a pretty good bounce coming out of the Olympics in terms of TV and other measurable factors .
Is that accurate ?
Bettman : " In a difficult climate our business has been pretty strong this year .
I do n't know that you can quite yet measure the impact of the Olympics .
To me the Olympics is more about the kids who watched the gold medal game and decided they want to play hockey , not unlike what we saw from ' 80 and that 's a longer - term thing .
But the metrics surrounding our business have been strong this season but they 've been strong for the last four seasons as well . "
Translation : " Yeah , this is n't my first interview , cowboy .
I see how you just buttered me up with the softball and then tried to trap me into saying the Olympics are good for the NHL .
Since I 'm not going to do that without you forcing a few more Jager - bombs down my gullet , allow me to take this moment to tell you how every season since the lockout has been strong . "
Q . Do you envision revenues staying stable ?
Bettman : " We do n't have final accounting yet .
Last year , the first part of the recession , we were up about 5 % when we had , before the recession started , projected 7 % .
So we saw a little bit of an impact .
I think we 're either going to be flat or up or down a percent or two , which is basically flat .
In this environment this is pretty good , and relative to the other sports I understand that 's very good . "
Translation : " Anything I say can and will be used against me in a court of CBA negotiations or public opinion ... so my accountants will get back to you on that right about oh ... how does right about the time you 're focused on the draft sound ? "
Q. In terms of labor relations with the players ' association , everybody looks at what 's going on over on their side , and that 's their business but what kind of relationship do you have right now with the PA [ player 's association ] ?
Bettman : " There 's really nobody who 's dealing with us on a day - to - day basis .
They have some staff that are attending to things that need to be attended to , but in terms of the initiatives and major things that we might want to do , there 's really little structure for us to do it with , so we , like everybody else , are looking forward to a time where there will be a strong , stable union that can be a partner to work with us in growing the business . "
Translation : " First and foremost , Bob Goodenow molests collies .
I just like to say that , because I 'm here and he 's not .
" But with respect to your question : Did I mention we kicked their butt in the last CBA , yet revenues are still growing and players are still making gobs of money ?
I do n't know about you , but that tells me we do n't need a union .
I tell Shanahan that every day . "
Q. Getting the headshots rule put in was fairly significant and it has the potential to change .
Bettman : " I think it was important .
' Significant ' makes it sound like it was out of the blue .
I think it was more evolutionary .... words words blah blah words ... "
Translation : " We are always in full control , with absolute foresight and brilliant planning .
So I take issue with your use of the word ' significant , ' as that somehow implies that we are fallible .
...
Did I mention I 'm a lawyer ?
I could do this all day . "
Q . How long do you envision yourself remaining in this job ?
Bettman : " It 's not something I think about .
I do it because I love doing it .
I find it stimulating and challenging and I 've been doing it now for more than 17 years .
I 've never thought about it and I do n't .
I can't even tell you when my contract expires because it 's not something I focus on . "
Translation :
" MwaaaaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA .
I am never leaving . "
Q. You mentioned the referees .
We 've seen so many veteran referees forced , required , obligated to retire because of age .
Bettman : " It 's not because of age .
It 's because their ability to perform physically is not what it was . "
Translation : " It 's not because of age .
It 's because of all of the physical and mental conditions that we associate with getting old , which is in no way anything related to age . "
Q. You lost Kerry Fraser , Don Koharski , a lot of people with experience and authority .
Bettman : " Yes , but at some point your experience and authority does n't overcome some of the limitations that overcome you .
Nobody can perform on the ice forever .

We may take ours for granted , but atmospheres are responsible for creating some of the wonders of the Solar System .
The flimsy , thin blue line seen from space that surrounds Earth makes it a wonderfully diverse place .
There were few people who disputed the interpretation of a river channel .
There really was n't very much doubt
Dr Ralph Lorenz , Huygens scientist
Our atmosphere 's unique chemical formula supplies us with the air we breathe , the water that bathes us and provides a soothing blanket that keeps us protected from the violence of space .
And where there are other atmospheres , there are other wonders .
Travel away from Earth at the speed of light for half an hour and you would enter the frozen realm of the outer Solar System .
Out here are planets that are nothing but atmosphere - unimaginably vast balls of churning gas and ice .
These are alien , chaotic worlds with storms large enough to swallow Earth three times over and winds screaming across their surface at nearly the speed of sound .
Yet it is also out here amongst these alien planets that we have discovered a world that holds a striking resemblance to Earth .
A moon orbiting Saturn called Titan .
When Titan was first discovered , it was thought to be the largest moon in the Solar System , but then astronomers realised their mistake .
At first they had not understood that this moon was unique .
It had an atmosphere - a thick , dense orange haze , 10 times as deep as the Earth 's atmosphere .
This made Titan look far larger than it really was .
Just like home
When they analysed this mysterious atmosphere , astronomers found that the chemical make - up was the most Earth - like in the Solar System , with plenty of nitrogen and a smattering of methane .
But , if this atmosphere is so similar to ours , what about the world it obscures ?
Our view of Titan sharpened with the arrival of the Cassini spacecraft , which has been performing a measured dance around Saturn and its moons since June 2004 .
Ligeia Mare ( sea ) covers about 100,000 sq km in Titan 's high north On Christmas Day of that year , the European Space Agency probe Huygens detached itself from Cassini and began a slow descent to the surface of Titan .
" It was amazing because we just had no idea what to expect , " says Huygens scientist Dr Ralph Lorenz .
" We did n't know if it would be cratered like the moon , or a flat expanse of sand .
And then the first pictures came back and it was just astonishingly familiar . "
As it descended through the smog , Huygens captured images of a craggy , rocky - looking landscape .
The images of its landing site was even more startling - it appeared to have settled on a gravelly plain , dotted with smooth , rounded stones .
According to Dr Lorenz , it was clear what these pictures meant : " There were few people who disputed the interpretation of a river channel .
There really was n't very much doubt . "
Finding a river bed on a moon was an extraordinary discovery .
By peeking through Titan 's hydrocarbon shroud , we had revealed a world familiar to our eyes ; a landscape sculpted by flowing liquid , just as the rain , rivers , and seas sculpt the surface of our planet .
The Matanuska glacier region of Alaska shows how water sculpts a landscape
Yet Titan 's surface temperature is - 180C , far too cold for liquid water to exist .
Some other liquid was carving out the features on this moon .
To bring this story to life , the team from BBC Two 's Wonders of the Solar System series spent long days poring over images , staring at endless vistas .
Finally , they landed on the stunning Matanuska Glacier region of Alaska .
The series presenter Professor Brian Cox explains : " It 's an immensely beautiful landscape but the important thing about this region is you can see how water , whether liquid or solid has sculpted the landscape - we were surrounded by landscape completely dominated by water .
" And on Titan you would see a landscape that is exactly the same .
Yet it 's not carved by water .
It 's too cold . "
The reason sublime landscapes like the Matanuska Glacier exist is because of a delicate balance of temperature and pressure .
Our planet is at just the right temperature and atmospheric pressure to allow water to exist as ice , liquid water , and water vapour .
Titan seen as sunlight glistens in one of its methane pools Just as the conditions here allow water to exist in all three states , the conditions on Titan are perfectly balanced to allow methane to exist as a liquid , a solid and a gas .
On Titan , methane plays exactly the same role water plays here on Earth .
Where we have clouds of water vapour , Titan has clouds of methane with methane rain .
Where we have lakes and oceans of water , Titan has lakes of methane .
Titan is the only place beyond Earth where we 've found liquid pooling on the surface in enormous quantities , as big as the Caspian Sea .
This moon is bathed in fuel .
Alaska was a perfect place to envision this bizarre moon .
Craggy mountains covered in ice and snow , the brittle rugged surface of the glacier , rivers grinding away at pebbles and tranquil lakes .
All have their twin on Titan .
" The best locations in the series really transport you to the wonders we are talking about .
And Alaska was one of the best of them all , and one of the most beautiful places I have been , " says Professor Cox .
Titan is a true wonder of the Solar System .
It 's like staring back in time four billion years and seeing the Earth as it was before life began .
Wonders of the Solar System , presented by Professor Brian Cox , continues on BBC Two on Sunday ( 2100 GMT ) .

The Oklahoma House has overwhelmingly passed legislation to require women who are considering an abortion to first undergo an ultrasound .
The House voted 87 - 7 Tuesday for the bill and sent it to the Senate for consideration .
The measure is one of several anti-abortion requirements that are part of legislation passed two years ago but struck down by an Oklahoma County judge .
The judge said it violated a constitutional provision requiring laws to deal with only one subject .
The bill requires an ultrasound exam be performed at least one hour prior to the abortion .

Akbar Agha was a senior Taliban commander A Taliban commander who was jailed for kidnapping foreigners in Kabul was released early , the BBC has learnt .
Akbar Agha was sentenced to 16 years in prison for kidnapping three UN workers in the Afghan capital in 2004 .
He was released from prison late last year .
His friends told the BBC he had been pardoned by President Hamid Karzai .
But a spokesman said the president " could not recall the matter " .
The UN staff were the first foreigners to be kidnapped in Kabul .
One was a woman from Northern Ireland , the other two were men from Kosovo and the Philippines .
Akbar Agha , who had old links with Arab radical groups , used the kidnap to launch a Taliban splinter group , Jaish - ul - Muslimeen or the Army of Muslims .
He threatened to behead the three hostages , but joint Afghan - international efforts managed to find and free them after a month .
Akbar Agha was extradited from Pakistan , put on trial in Kabul and given a long jail sentence .
The BBC has now discovered that Agha was quietly freed late last year , possibly just before the festival of Eid al - Adha in mid-November .
The UN learnt about the release in August .
Eide ' irritated ' Friends said President Karzai had pardoned Agha , on condition that he stayed in Kabul .
The president did n't raise it with me and I did n't raise it with him
Former UN envoy Kai Eide
Afghanistan 's Army of Muslims A presidential spokesman told the BBC that he had looked into the records of pardons and had not been able to find any mention of this case .
The former head of the United Nations in Afghanistan , Kai Eide , said his office had been informed in August of Agha 's planned release by the head of the Supreme Court .
Mr Eide said he had been irritated that the issue was raised through what he called an " unacceptable channel " and admitted he had not taken up the issue with the president .
Staff at the UN told the BBC previous attempts to pardon Agha in 2007 had been met by high - level protests .
One of Agha 's friends , who had been to welcome him out of jail , also pointed to earlier UN pressure as the reason why he had only now been released .
" People from Kandahar had been demanding Akbar Agha 's release for a long time .
He is from a spiritual family - he 's a sayed , a descendant of the Prophet Mohammad , and that is why they wanted him released .
" He was pardoned on condition that he stays in Kabul .
The government 's paying the rent on his house - I think it 's about $ 1,000 a month . "
Threat to justice Michael Semple - who worked for the European Union in Kabul and was at the heart of the operation to free the hostages - told the BBC that it was extremely unlikely Akbar Agha had been released as part of the reconciliation process with the Taliban .
" He headed up a splinter group which tried to turn the jihad into business .
He acted outside the authority of Mullah Omar and the Taliban , " Mr Semple said .
" They did not condone kidnapping and did not approve of his actions and frankly I suspect they were rather happy to see him locked up .
That probably helped them discipline the insurgency and maintain control over the organisation . "
Afghan Human Rights Commissioner Nader Naderi said that he had been shocked - but not surprised by the pardon .
" So many are now being given , " he said .
" If it 's used without the public knowledge and not transparent , it can undermine justice ... most of those people who are powerful have access to the president and can buy their way out . "
Other controversial pardons which have come to light have been given to major drug traffickers and rapists .
Michael Semple says that far from being chastened , the news on the streets is that Agha is now looking for his money - the ransom he was never paid .
" I gather that Akbar Agha still feels miffed that , after all the effort and investment that he put into organising this kidnapping , he never actually received a ransom . "

So , you 've always had a passion for games .
Now you have a few CS or art classes under your belt and you 're serious about getting into the indie game development scene .
But what 's the next step ?
Allow me to recommend a game jam .
What 's a Game Jam ?
Every jam is a little different , but in general , it 's an opportunity for a diverse set of game developers to come together in one place and make game prototypes during a 24 - 48 hour time window .
Most jams cater to all skill levels .
In most cases , teams of 4 - 6 members are randomly chosen at the start of the jam in a way that insures that each team has at least one experienced programmer and one artist .
In most cases , you can choose the development environment you want to work with ( Flash , C# , Unity , C++ , Java , ... ) and game ideas are constrained by a theme that 's usually announced the day of the competition to prevent participants from planning too much in advance .
While some jams will give awards for the favorite games , you should n't think of a jam as a competition .
It 's an environment where everyone wants everyone else to succeed .
In short , if you want to participate , there 's no need to do any advance planning .
In fact , it 's discouraged .
Just show up with a computer and get ready to have some fun .
Can you really build a game in 24 - 48 hours ?
There are dozens of game jams every year , collectively producing thousands of prototypes .
If you get a motivated team , you'd be shocked at what you can do in such a short time .
Here are a couple example games I worked on during the 2009 and 2010 Global Game Jams .
M.O.N.K. ( Multiplicitous Observable Navigational Killerator ) is a 2 - person 1 - keyboard Flash game made at the 2010 Global Game Jam .
Coopetition is a fully 3D game with dynamic lighting and shadows built in C# and XNA for the 2009 Global Game Jam .
With such strict time constraints , there may be times when a game engine just does n't come together during the alloted time .
But of the ~ 20 teams that I 've seen in the past , everyone always at least had something to show at the end of the weekend .
And if you do fail , it can still be a valuable learning experience .
It 's far better to learn a harsh lesson about team dynamics or game engine construction during a 48 - hour jam than it is to learn the same tragic lesson after six months of development .
Where do I sign up ?
There are several game jams that are just around the corner .
If you know of others , drop me a line and I 'll add them to the list .
Hey there , time traveller !

Forks CEO Jim August stands on parking lot where development would be built .
THE Forks Renewal Corp. will unveil a wide - ranging blueprint for the future of Winnipeg 's most popular meeting place , including plans to build up to 350 condominiums and apartments , at an open house this weekend .
Artist renditions of the proposed development will be on display at The Forks ' centre court from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday .
For those who can't make it , they 'll be taken to Portage Place Shopping Centre from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on April 28 .
Staff members in charge of this and other projects at The Forks will also be on hand to answer questions from the public .
" To have a healthy urban environment , you need people living in the downtown .
This is an opportunity to do that .
The idea is to make this a site that works on a 24 - hour basis , " said Jim August , chief executive officer of TFRC .
Initial drawings for the residential component call for a 10 - storey tower , which could include both condos and apartments as well as townhouses on the lower levels , to be built on a 6.5 - acre site that is now a parking lot .
The " market - affordable " units will be largely targeted at young professionals with some geared towards people in the disabled community .
The approximately 1,000 - square - foot spaces will likely sell for about $ 240,000 , he said .
ARTIST’S CONCEPTION
Residential development would include up to 350 apartments and condos selling for an estimated $ 240,000 each .
" If we could do it for $ 180,000 , that would be great but we know it could be tough , " he said , noting a tiered parking structure will buffer the residences from the nearby railway line .
August was quick to note the plans for the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers are still a long way from being finalized and public feedback could result in some changes .
The ultimate design wo n't compromise the " green beltway " along the riverbanks , he said .
" Details on the economics and design will occur over the next three to four years .
There wo n't be any construction until then , " he said .
To maintain the perception that The Forks is a place for all Winnipeggers and their guests , Toby Chase , executive director of The Forks Foundation , said it 's important that the development plans include a well - manicured " European " walkway and shops and services .
Some ideas currently on the table include a fitness centre , a daycare , coffee shops , restaurants , a hostel and a bookstore .
" We want to encourage a pedestrian environment in the area .
You 're still moving people around the site , you 're not cutting them off to do something for a private use , " Chase said .
The proposed development cost of the residential units , parking structure , promenade and retail space is in excess of $ 100 million .
The plans will also be as green as possible , which could mean a maximum of one parking spot per condo or apartment or even shared parking spaces .
" We think people living here are working downtown and they could do that without having a vehicle , " August said .
There has been a " mixed bag " of reactions since the idea of people living at The Forks was first raised early last year .
To counter accusations that the development will come at the expense of green space , August points to a picture of the site from the mid-'80s , which depicts a largely barren area where the only trees are just off the riverbanks .
" It 's evolving into quite a magnificent site .
People who live in and around the downtown seem to be more supportive of it , younger people are generally more supportive of it while others are supportive of it depending how it 's done .
" Some people believe The Forks is for everyone and therefore people should n't live there , " he said .
" There was a lot of ( the latter attitude ) with the Inn at The Forks hotel , which has been pretty widely accepted . "

While much of this week 's attention has focused on the tragic underground explosion in a West Virginia coal mine , the EPA was focusing on explosions high above ground .
The agency announced strict new guidelines that would make it harder for coal companies to obtain permits for mountaintop coal mining .
The measure is meant to preserve Appalachian resources and mitigate environmental damage stretching from Ohio , Pennsylvania , West Virginia , Kentucky , Virginia , and Tennessee .
Mountaintop mining is the coal industry 's equivalent to Zabriskie Point ...
The process involves packing the summit of a mountain with explosives and blowing it skyward , uncovering the valuable coal seams underneath .
As you can imagine , when you blow 400 feet of mountaintop into smithereens , there is a palpable amount of debris to deal with .
That debris is pushed down the mountainside and dumped into the valleys below in a process called a valley fill or a hollow fill .
These fills have already choked off 2,000 miles of Appalachian headway streams with soot and coal , effectively destroying the surrounding ecosystems — not to mention the local fishing and swimming holes .
When that mine waste seeps into the water , salt levels are increased and aquatic life is put at risk .
The new EPA guidelines expect to protect about 95 % of the wildlife that inhabit the affected areas .
When the toxic materials reach the water supply , it not only destroys the wildlife , but also puts all of the surrounding communities at risk for pulmonary disease , lung cancer , and a myriad of other health ailments .
" The people of Appalachia should n't have to choose between a clean , healthy environment in which to raise their families and the jobs they need to support them , " EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said in a press release .
" Getting this right is important to Americans who rely on affordable coal to power homes and businesses , as well as coal communities that count on jobs and a livable environment , both during mining and after coal companies move to other sites . "
The EPA 's website trumpeted three main accomplishments in the bill :
Improved guidance and clarity : EPA is communicating comprehensive guidance to its regional offices with permitting responsibility in Appalachian states .
The guidance details EPA 's responsibilities and how the agency uses its Clean Water Act ( CWA ) authorities to ensure that future mining will not cause significant environmental , water quality and human health impacts .
Strong science : EPA is making publicly available two scientific reports prepared by its Office of Research and Development .
One summarizes the aquatic impacts of mountaintop mining and valley fills .
The second report establishes a scientific benchmark for unacceptable levels of conductivity ( a measure of water pollution from mining practices ) that threaten stream life in surface waters .
These reports are being published for public comment and submitted for peer review to the EPA Science Advisory Board .
Increased transparency : EPA is creating a permit tracking Web site so that the public can determine the status of mining permits subject to the EPA - U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Enhanced Coordination Procedure ( ECP ) .
The Obama administration hopes that these measures will reduce low - sulfur coal produced in the U.S. by 50 to 70 million tons within the next two years .
Measures like these — while unpopular with coal companies — will pay off in the long term by forcing the country to prioritize cleaner and more sustainable energy sources .
Coal is neither clean nor sustainable , despite what those " clean - coal " corporate responsibility ads would have you believe .
And one obvious benefit is that West Virginia will be able to preserve those famous Rocky Mountain highs ...
Be Well ,
Jimmy
Critics of government - mandated filtering schemes contend that such programs first focus on " child pornography " because it 's such an unobjectionable target for censorship — but once the program is in place , it 's much easier to extend it to more controversial areas , such as copyright protection .
At least the French have the decency to admit that this is what 's happening .
The French lower house , the National Assembly , has just passed a security bill known as LOPPSI2 , and it's expected that the Senate will follow suit in the next few weeks .
As we 've previously reported , LOPPSI2 is a grab bag of security items that includes state - sanctioned computer Trojans , a massive new database of citizen data ( dubbed " Pericles " ) , and a requirement that ISPs start censoring sites on a government blacklist .
The Internet censorship provision has received the most coverage to date , and LOPPI2 has been quite controversial in France ; it passed the National Assembly 312-214 .
The censorship is ostensibly designed to block child porn sites on the Internet , but French President Nicolas Sarkozy has already made it clear that he would like to see ISPs play a far greater role in clamping down on the Internet .
In a January speech ( French PDF ) in which Sarkozy styled himself a " patron " of the French arts , he praised the new " three strikes " law his administration championed ( and passed into law last year ) .
The HADOPI authority that oversees the system will , he said , need to keep searching for the most " modern " solutions to protecting works .
Simply searching out file - swappers and disconnecting or fining them is a reactive approach that does n't scale ; as Sarkozy put it , " The more we automatically ' depollute ' networks and servers from all sources of piracy , the less it will be necessary to resort to measures imposed on the ' Internautes ' [ French Internet users ] .
We must therefore try , without delay , filtering devices . "
Under Sarkozy , France is moving to a more proactive enforcement model that removes or blocks content at the source , rather than being content to go after lawbreakers .
As a consequence , however , France will now have one of the toughest censorship regimes of any robust democracy in the Western hemisphere — though Australia is giving France a good run for its money on the worldwide stage .
Journalists in neighboring countries have been quick to pounce .
Germany 's Der Spiegel wondered if France was becoming the " Big Brother of Europe " and notes that LOPPSI2 will give " the state unprecedented control over the Internet . "
The paper also suggests that the government is pushing the law because elections are coming up soon , and Sarkozy hopes that " fear of criminals will convince voters to come to the polling booths . "
In the UK , feisty tech publication The Register also plays the Orwell card , saying that France " leapfrogs past Australia in Big Brother stakes " and that it's " becoming the first western country to make even Australia look liberal when it comes to state powers of Internet censorship . "
( The UK has a non-mandatory child porn block list run by the Internet Watch Foundation . )
As for France , plenty of heated opposition can be found there as well .
Jérémie Zimmermann of Internet rights group La Quadrature du Net said last week , " Protection of childhood is shamelessly exploited by Nicolas Sarkozy to implement a measure that will lead to collateral censorship and very dangerous drifts .
After the HADOPI comes the LOPPSI : the securitarian machinery of the government is being deployed in an attempt to control the Internet at the expense of freedoms . "
Censorship ... it 's not just for authoritarian states anymore .
Such issues are increasingly part of the discourse in democracies , including Indonesia , the most populous Muslim - majority democracy .
The government there is working up Internet censorship rules to crack down on sites that offend " public decency , " including pornography ( child and otherwise ) .
In a sign that President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has rather peculiar views on freedom of speech , he complained at a recent press conference about a protestor who put his picture on a water buffalo and marched it through Jakarta .
Yudhoyono did n't like the implication that he was " big , slow and stupid like a buffalo , " and he asked reporters , " Do you think this is an expression of freedom ? "

NEW YORK CITY -- Point guard Josh Selby , the nation 's top unsigned prospect , announced he will attend Kansas during the first half of the Jordan Brand Classic at Madison Square Garden .
Selby , who played at Lake Clifton High School in Baltimore , picked the Jayhawks over a list of suitors that included Kentucky , UConn , Arizona and Tennessee .
" I think that 's the best place for me to mature and get to the next level , " Selby said .
" [ Coach Bill Self ] kind of reminds me of myself .
He 's very outgoing , a good coach and he 's going to get the job done . "
Shooting guard Doron Lamb , one of the top 30 prospects in the nation , announced his decision to attend Kentucky .
Lamb picked UK over a list of schools that included Arizona , West Virginia , Kansas , Oklahoma and UConn .
" I love the coaching staff , " Lamb said .
" I think next year we 're going to be a team to beat . "
The deciding factor for Selby was also coaching .
He said Self can get him pro-ready .
" They run an NBA - type offense with pick and roll and pick and pop , " Selby said .
" When I get to the next level I do n't want to be looking around [ thinking ] this [ system ] is different .
I 'll already know it . "
Exactly how long will he be in Lawrence ?
" God willing one year , " Selby said .
" But I have to get where I need to be . "
Selby , the No. 5 player in the ESPNU 100 , will join a Jayhawks team that has many holes to fill with the early departures of Cole Aldrich and Xavier Henry , in addition to the graduation of senior point guard Sherron Collins , whom Selby will likely be counted on to replace .
" Sherron did a lot there , " he said .
" Going in there for them to put the ball in my hands is big . "
Selby is the Jayhawks ' second commitment in the 2010 class , joining shooting guard Royce Woolridge .
Lamb 's decision to join the Wildcats comes days after they added point guard Brandon Knight to their 2010 class and secured a commitment from Mike Gilchrist -- the nation 's top-rated junior .
As was the case for Selby , Lamb 's decision was largely based on his professional future .
" [ Calipari ] gets guys in the league , and you know he 's good with the guards , " Lamb said .
" I am looking forward to next year , him helping me with my guard skills and hopefully I can make my dream come true . "
The Wildcats had five players -- including John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins -- leave for the NBA draft .
Brendan Murphy is a recruiting editor for ESPN.com .
The Way It ’s Meant To Be Played ?
As hardware enthusiasts , it ’s only natural to follow the news about upcoming launches .
Power users begin formulating their opinions as soon as the first specs get tossed around , regardless of whether they ’re official or not .
Some of the longest forum threads I 've ever read were rumor mill postings from very smart technologists trying to guess at the next generation 's capabilities .
But in the case of Nvidia ’s GeForce GTX 480 and 470 , the company did n’t leave much to our imaginations .
As far back as September of last year , the GPU giant was waxing poetically about its compute architecture .
“ Mmm , that sounds nice , ” we thought .
In January of 2010 , it described in graphic detail how GF100 ( the GPU centering on its Fermi design ) would cut through DirectX 11 titles heavy on geometry .
“ Sexy !
Ca n’t wait to try it out . ”
GeForce GTX 480 : Cooling around every corner
So , you could say that Nvidia figuratively shot itself in the foot by talking too early , since it ’s now late March — almost half a year after the Fermi disclosures were made — and the first desktop - class cards employing the design landed in our Southern California lab one week ago .
They ’re not for sale yet .
Nvidia says the initial round of cards , manufactured in - house , is shipping to the channel and should be available the week of April 12th ( in two and a half weeks ) .
Subsequent boards will come from the company ’s partners sometime next month .
What will availability look like ?
According to Nvidia , it ’s shipping tens of thousands of GF100 - based cards at launch , and by the middle of April , anyone willing to spend $ 500 on a GeForce GTX 480 or $ 350 on a GeForce GTX 470 should be able to buy one .
Rest assured we ’ll stay on top of pricing and availability in our Best Graphics Cards For The Money column .
Of course , AMD was similarly ambitious about availability of its Radeon HD 5800 - series cards at launch , and we saw how that one played out .
Even now , TSMC ’s 40nm struggles spell availability issues on all DirectX 11 - class cards .
History Is History
Regardless of the fact that Nvidia is entering the Windows 7 / DirectX 11 market six months after its competitor , the company is here now .
All of the delays have led up to this point , where we get two graphics cards to compete against the nine Radeon HD 5000 - series models AMD has launched since its mad rush began .
And , given the $ 500 and $ 350 price points , our comparison is further narrowed , since it ’s only really the Radeon HD 5850 , 5870 , and 5970 that populate AMD ’s enthusiast - class high - end segment .
So , those are the cards you ’ll see compared to these two in our benchmark suite .
Two thirds of ATI ’s DirectX 11 lineup is , as of now , still competition - less — providing DirectX 11 support is at the top of your buying criteria , of course .
We ’re also adding AMD ’s last - generation flagship , the Radeon HD 4870 X2 , Nvidia ’s , the GeForce GTX 295 , and the company ’s previously - quickest single - GPU card , the GeForce GTX 285 .
GeForce GTX 470 : More elegant , still fast , still hot
Of course , the gaming community ’s initial concern was that Nvidia conceptualized the Fermi architecture principally with compute performance in mind , leaving the GPU 's traditional role of speeding up the latest games a secondary objective .
There ’s no question that the architecture ( and by proxy , the GF100 GPU centering on it ) is designed to drive the company ’s Tesla family into increasingly - demanding supercomputing environments through the implementation of ECC memory and augmented double - precision performance .
Nvidia will succeed here .
The potential gains of parallelizing certain technical workloads are enormous , and Nvidia ’s investment in software development means it has a formidable head start over AMD and Intel in this growing market .
What remains to be seen is how the GF100 handles “ everything else . ”
Here ’s where we answer whether the GF100 GPU can hold its own in gaming .
The stage is set , the players are in their places , we have a handful of new tests to present , and the results are interesting , to say the least .
Let ’s meet Nvidia ’s new GeForce GTX 480 and 470 , and get this show on the road .
The Estefans ' support boosts the party ’s prospects in Florida .

MIAMI BEACH — President Barack Obama raked in millions for the Democratic National Committee during a stop here Thursday , but the real prize is an unprecedented endorsement from two of the most influential ambassadors to a critical Florida voting bloc .
Obama ’s appearance Thursday on the elite Star Island makes him the first politician — Democrat or Republican — to tap into this Miami money machine , as he headlined a fundraiser at the waterfront home of Cuban - born singer Gloria Estefan and her producer husband , Emilio .

The Estefans have had the ear of presidents for decades .
They ’ve talked U.S. - Cuba relations with both Republican and Democratic administrations .
But despite open invitations from both sides of the aisle , the couple has never before raised money for either political party .
Their decision to do so for Obama is a sign of how fluid the politics of South Florida ’s traditionally Republican Cuban - American voters has become .
“ Emilio and Gloria are among the most respected and successful members of the Cuban - American community , ” said Freddy Balsera , a Miami - based Democratic consultant who advised the Obama campaign and is close to the Estefans .
“ Having the president in their house sends a lot of important symbolic messages to the Cuban - American community and to the Hispanic community in general . ”
While Cuban - American voters have historically taken a hard line on U.S. - Cuba relations and supported the GOP for four decades , a younger generation and newer exiles have been leaning more Democratic .
Obama tried to capitalize on this trend during the campaign .
He promised to ease the U.S. embargo on Cuba , one of the last edifices of the Cold War that was hardened under President George W. Bush .
And as president , Obama has begun to enact softer Cuba policies , such as increasing travel and remittances to the island .
Fernand Amandi , executive vice president of the Miami - based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi , said the Estefans ’ decision reflects a continuing political shift in South Florida .
“ This underscores the idea that the Cuban - American community is no longer a monolithic voting bloc , ” Amandi said .
“ You can now have a Democratic president come into the home of the most influential , high - profile Cuban - American couple in Miami . ”
The result , Amandi suggested , is that other Cuban Americans might say if the Estefans can openly support Obama , they can as well .
They are by far the best - known Cuban - Americans to endorse a Democrat .
The Estefans , who came to fame as members of the 1980s group Miami Sound Machine and have since built a business empire that includes a string of Cuban - themed restaurants and a small share of the Miami Dolphins , are expected to use the event as an opportunity to press Obama on the Cuba issue .
The children of Cuban exiles , they have long been active in causes for the island nation .
More recently , they ’ve stepped up their involvement .
Gloria Estefan led a demonstration in Miami ’s Little Havana neighborhood in protest of the Cuban government ’s treatment of dissidents .
Obama also released a sharply worded statement on the issue about the same time .
Gloria Estefan spoke mostly about Cuba in her welcoming remarks at the fundraiser , according to a release from her spokesman , and she said her father , a Cuban exile who fled after Fidel Castro came to power , would have been proud she was hosting Obama .
Estefan also pointed out that the fundraiser comes just 21 days after Obama issued a statement saying : " Today , I join my voice with brave individuals across Cuba and a growing chorus around the world in calling for an end to the repression , for the immediate release of all political prisoners in Cuba and for respect for the basic rights of the Cuban people . "
“ The Estefans are at a point in their life where patriotism matters a lot to them , ” Balsera said .
The DNC , with the help of Balsera , asked the Estefans to host the $ 30,400 - per-couple event .
After thinking about it for a day or so , they agreed .
Their decision fueled the ongoing political debate in South Florida and opened the Estefans up to criticism , something they ’ve avoided over the years by refusing to support either party .
“ Historically , Emilio and Gloria have stayed away from partisan politics .
They have maintained a certain independence , ” said Jose Azel , a senior research associate at the Institute for Cuban and Cuban - American Studies at the University of Miami .
“ This is really unusual for them . ”
The Estefans have had relationships with President Bill Clinton , as well as President George W. Bush and his father , President George H.W. Bush .
Emilio Estefan has produced dozens of events at the White House under at least four presidents .
During the 2008 campaign , Gloria Estefan did n’t play much of a role in supporting Obama , and Emilio never technically endorsed him .
But he did offer advice to the campaign on reaching out to Hispanics , speaking with some key players almost daily .
He also attended the last presidential debate at Hofstra University and gave interviews afterward .
And if he felt Miami conservative radio hosts went too far in their criticism of Obama , he would call them and ask them to cut it out .
Since Obama took office , the couple has been at the White House for meetings and events .
Gloria Estefan interviewed the president for a televised Christmas special on Univision .
She was also a star performer at Obama ’s Fiesta Latina event last fall .
And Obama also named Emilio Estefan to a panel that will look into creating a National Museum of the American Latino .
The couple ’s decision to host Obama has won them some praise in Miami , but it has also stirred a fair share of controversy .
“ The Estefans may have broken more than a rule when they decided to host a cocktail reception for the president during his visit to South Florida on Thursday , ” a Miami Herald columnist wrote .
“ Estefan , along with husband Emilio , also broke a bond that had united them with Miami ’s Cuban community , whose members largely oppose the president ’s agenda . ”
Obama ’s job approval rating tends to be split among voters in Florida , much as it is nationally , but he consistently gets more positive ratings among Hispanic voters in the state , said David Beattie , a Florida political consultant .
When it comes to the administration ’s Cuba policy , Azel said , supporters and opponents agree that it has not been effective .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any division in the sense that they have not worked , ” he said .
“ There have been zero concessions .
...
The Obama administration moved a piece on the chess board ; the Cuban government has not . ”
The timing of the Estefans ’ endorsement of Obama and the Democratic Party could n’t be better for Florida Democrats .
Republicans are enjoying momentum in the state heading into the midterm elections .
The GOP is favored in the gubernatorial race and in the Senate contest .
Marco Rubio , a Cuban - American from Miami , is leading in the Republican Senate primary .
While he wo n’t have any public events in Miami , Obama ’s remarks at a larger fundraiser of about 800 people at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts , where ticket prices will range from $ 250 to $ 1,250 , will be open to the media .
The fundraiser at the Estefans is closed and expected to be smaller , about 100 people .
Overall , his visit is seen as important step in continuing to reach out to Hispanic voters in the state .
Democrats hope having the Estefans in their camp will help their party this November and Obama in 2012 .
“ It ’s incredibly meaningful for the Democratic Party and for the president , ” Balsera said .
“ He ’s going to continue to need strong Hispanic support in the state if he ’s going to win reelection . ”
Having reached the lowest point in his life , a self - destructive man on the brink of demise receives an unexpected call from his estranged sister to look after her young daughter for the night .
Could this be the beginning of a new reality ?
I think I doodled one once .
I seriously need to do some more .
Have n't made any more in ages ...
I at least need to do everyone from smash 4 and Kid Icarus Uprising and more of the other games I played recently like Bioshock , Mortal Kombat , Wonderful 101 , Splatoon and whatnot
WASHINGTON — President Obama offered Tuesday to address some of the concerns expressed by Republicans in the health care debate as the two parties maneuvered for advantage heading into the legislative end game .
In a letter to Congressional leaders of both parties , Mr. Obama said he was open to four specific ideas raised by Republicans at the daylong health care forum last week , including encouraging the use of tax - advantaged medical savings accounts and increasing payments to doctors who treat Medicaid patients .
By signaling that he is open to the opposition ’s ideas , Mr. Obama struck a bipartisan tone even as the White House prepared the ground for Democratic efforts to pass comprehensive legislation on a party - line vote .
Mr. Obama is scheduled to speak about his strategy for passing the bill in remarks at the White House on Wednesday .
Democrats are planning to use a parliamentary device known as reconciliation that would allow them to complete the process with a simple majority vote in the Senate rather than subjecting the bill to the 60 - vote requirement to overcome a filibuster .
Republicans have denounced the use of the device on the health bill as short - cutting the regular process .
“ You do n’t want your phone to be an open platform … ” and with that brief statement , Apple justified the closed iPhone and then quickly followed it with the monitored and controlled app store .
But Steve , the iPad is n’t a phone at all so why not open it up again ?
If people are concerned about the safety of their apps or need you to protect them from porn , you can do an “ app store approved ” program or something ca n’t you ?
And really , do we even need an app store to tell us which apps are good in an era of ubiquitous user feedback and preferential attachment ?
The thing is , Jobs ’ argument was always a bit disingenuous .
Closed follows from his brain architecture , not from an argument on behalf of his customers or their network providers .
Those are post facto justifications supporting an already - held point of view .
And the reason the iPad is going to stay closed is n’t because it is good for users , it ’s because it is good for Apple .
The bottom line is that the iPhone was a relatively open phone and we accepted it , but the iPad is a relatively closed computer , and that ’s a bummer .
Jobs probably believes that he is doing it for the users , finally giving them a post - crank - the - handle - to - start - it experience , but it does n’t take a genius to see how it benefits Apple .
Beliefs and self interest usually go hand in hand and here ’s what I think is really happening …
Microsoft in the 1980s was the perfect business .
The kind of business every MBA would like to invent .
It had network effects to drive adoption , products with near - zero marginal cost , and a distribution channel that was controlled and constrained enough in the days of the floppy disks in boxes to enforce direct monetization .
In short , it had leverage .
The kind of leverage that delivers a very steep - sloped relationship between enterprise valuation and market penetration .
Or , put the way an economist would put it , the kind of leverage that captures greater than economic rents .
We paid more than we had to for Windows and Office during all those years , but at least we can take some comfort in the fact that a big part of it turned out to be an involuntary tithe for Bill ’s charitable efforts .
The music industry worked the same way .
The constrained distribution channel of the vinyl record gave artists and the music companies that distributed their work tremendous leverage , and get them paid for it .
Even if a lot of that economic surplus ended up the noses of label executives …
The last decade has been tough on business models like these though .
Open Source software is eroding pricing leverage .
Digital has unconstrained content delivery and taken away the ability to monetize at the point of distribution .
Businesses that had leverage are returning to more linear business models .
Plus , companies like Google have figured how to move network effects into the cloud where they are ad supported instead of monetized directly , further eroding our expectation to pay for things .
Proprietary software vendors , music industry labels , movie studios , newspapers , etc. all find themselves suffering from their lost control over distribution and the fact that when they lost it they lost their toll booths .
Excess rent is hard to come by these days .
In this context the iPad is n’t a computing device at all .
Jobs is using his knack for design and user experience to build , not a better computer , but a better distribution channel .
One that is controlled , constrained , and can re-take distribution as the point of monetization .
You are n’t buying a computer when you buy an iPad , you are buying a 16GB Walmart store shelf that fits on your lap – complete with all the supplier beat downs , slotting fees , and exclusive deals that go with it – and Apple got you to pay for the building .
The iPad by itself would be just another physical product living in a nearly linear world .
Doubling revenue would require Apple to double the number manufactured ; and that would mean roughly doubling labor costs etc .
It could be profitable , and there are advantages to building at scale , but not in the greater - than - linear leveraged manner that software or content can deliver .
As Apple well knows , a business built on that model builds enterprise value linearly with unit sales .
But … the iPad as a distribution channel for fungible goods reasserts the non-linear leverage that Microsoft enjoyed back in the day .
One interesting twist is how the iPad combines network effects and constrained distribution .
The bright shiny object design of the iPad leads to network effects at the app store which in turn drives more consumers back to the device itself .
Then to the degree that those two forces hold consumers in thrall of the device , Apple can use the device as the point of sale for content worth more than the device itself .
The leverage is linked – the first leads to market presence , and then the market presence makes for stronger monetization opportunities in the device - hosted channel .
The other interesting thing is that so many of those “ apps ” are really just web pages without a URL .
Or books packaged as an app .
In short , this is content that is abandoning the web to become a monetizable app .
History is never completely new and we ’ve seen things like this happen before .
Prior to the 1980 ’s essentially all television was broadcast in the clear .
An unconstrained distribution channel like broadcast TV could only be monetized through ad sales , but along came cable with its point - to - point wave guides and surprised consumers were suddenly faced with paying for access .
HBO made the content “ interesting ” enough ( i.e. soft porn in your living room ) , so lots of people did .
Even more surprising , before long they were paying for the right to view ads too .
In this analogy the Internet and commodity PC are broadcast TV , and the iPad and its app store are HBO over cable .
What happened next in cable is going to happen in computing too though if these device - specific distribution channels accumulate enough power .
It was n’t long before HBO and Cinemax were signing exclusive content deals with the studios to lock up content on one network or the other .
That left consumers in the odd position of having to pick the network with the studio deal they liked , or pay for both so that they could see any first run movie they were likely to want to see .
iPad , Nook , Kindle , … picture the day when you are sending your kid to school with one of each so that they can get access to all of their MacMillan , Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , and Prentice Hall text books .
Who knows , if Apple ’s app store gets enough lock - in we may even see exclusive distribution deals on apps .
Imagine Pandora strong armed into being only available on iPad/iPhone .
That would be a new twist .
Ok , this is beginning to sound like a polemic and that ’s not really what I set out to do .
Let me reel in and focus a bit .
The Mac was a commodity platform .
Anyone could write applications for it and distribute them in any way they saw fit , from physical packaging in a store to digital distribution online .
Or you could just write something yourself and use it .
The iPhone seemed a lot like a computer but “ for the safety of the network ” introduced a constrained software and content distribution channel that imposed checks , and perhaps more importantly , contingencies on a developer ’s right to distribution ( i.e. they can be taken back ) .
The commodity PC had a good run but now we are finding ourselves in love with task - specific or content - oriented devices like the Kindle and iPad .
And while they are attractive for their intended tasks , they come with a cost .
They offer us a trade of task - specific design in exchange for important constraints on use and distribution of content .
The iPad is essentially a “ computer ” at the technical level , but one that is intentionally constrained to be a delivery channel for content and applications from or via one company , Apple .
You “ own ” the iPad , but ownership in this case means about as much as owning a television that can only be hooked up to the cable television network that sold it to you would mean .
It ’s a fetishist ’s Minitel with brushed aluminum and a touch screen .
So where does Google and Android fit in to all of this ?
Well , it ’s hard to say .
Android may yet win because it has an open platform and seeks leverage only in the old fashion way , the network effect connected to a profitable ad - delivering set of services .
If that happens I ’ll probably write another polemic , slightly tweaked .
At low levels of market penetration maybe none of this matters .
After all , we can still buy a laptop and stick Ubuntu on it .
But before you decide it does n’t matter at all , ask yourself why there is no Tor client for the iPhone or iPad .
Then ask yourself , even if there were one , how hard would it be for a pissed off government to use the many forms of leverage available to them to force Apple to remove it from any device deployed within their borders , or perhaps even within the borders of another country that annoys them .
Even that may be no big deal right now , there are still so many more open - platform personal computers out there .
But that is changing and the “ content creating ” laptop may go the way of the desktop PC , reduced to serving niche developers and content creators , while mobile and task - specific devices ( with all of their constraints and beholden to a few large companies with contingent power over anything deployed to them ) become the primary way people interact online .
But David Axelrod , a senior White House adviser , speaking on CNN ’s “ State of the Union , ” said the Republican Party had “ taken a position where they ’re going to try and slow and block progress on all fronts whether it ’s legislation and appointments . ”
He said 77 people nominated for high - level positions within the administration have not been voted on for months because Republicans have blocked any action in the Senate through such maneuvers as filibusters .
Presidents have the constitutional authority to fill vacancies without the advice and consent of the Senate when Congress is in recess — as they are now for a spring break .
Other presidents have used that authority , with George W. Bush making 15 recess appointment by this point in his presidency and a total of 171 by the end , according to Congressional Research Service .
Senator Lamar Alexander , a Tennessee Republican , also appearing on CNN ’s “ State of the Union , ” echoed Mr. Graham , saying that “ what the president has done here is throw fuel on the fire at a time when the debate about politics is a very angry debate to begin with . ”
“ What this is going to do is cause the election of a lot more Republican Scott Browns in November who are determined to come in and provide some checks and balances in Washington to stop the overreaching of the government , ” Mr. Alexander added , referring to the Republican who was elected to fill Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’s seat in Massachusetts and caused Democrats to lose their 60 - vote filibuster - proof majority .
In addition to the president ’s recess appointments , Senator Graham said the Obama administration ’s decision to pass health care without a single Republican vote would also make it harder to pass other tough legislation like an a immigration bill .

Advertisement Prime Minister Gordon Brown has apologised for the UK's role in sending more than 130,000 children to former colonies where many suffered abuse .
He expressed regret for the " misguided " Child Migrant Programme , telling the Commons he was " truly sorry " .
He also announced a £ 6 m fund to reunite families that were torn apart .
The scheme sent poor children for a " better life " to countries like Canada and Australia from the 1920s to 1960s , but many were abused and lied to .
' Deportation of innocents '
Mr Brown said : " To all those former child migrants and their families ... we are truly sorry .
They were let down .
" We are sorry they were allowed to be sent away at the time when they were most vulnerable .
We are sorry that instead of caring for them , this country turned its back .
HISTORY OF UK CHILD MIGRANTS UK is the only country with a sustained history of child migration - over four centuries
In 1618 , 100 sent from London to Richmond , Virginia
In total 130,000 sent from the UK to Canada , New Zealand , South Africa , Zimbabwe ( formerly Rhodesia ) and Australia Post - war , 7,000 shipped to Australia and 1,300 to New Zealand , Rhodesia and Canada Source : Child Migrants Trust
Australia ' sorry ' for child abuse Ordeal of Australia 's child migrants Migrant recalls ' stolen life '
" And we are sorry that the voices of these children were not always heard , their cries for help not always heeded .
And we are sorry that it has taken so long for this important day to come and for the full and unconditional apology that is justly deserved . "
He also said they were cruelly lied to and their childhoods " robbed " , and described the scheme as " shameful " and " a deportation of the innocents " .
More than 130,000 children , aged between three and 14 , were sent to Commonwealth countries .
As they were shipped out of Britain , many were wrongly told their parents were dead , while parents were given very little information about where their children were going .
The former child migrants have told how on arrival they were separated from their siblings , and put into foster homes , state - run orphanages and religious institutions .
Others were educated only for farm work .
' Moment in history '
Many were subjected to brutal physical and sexual abuse by those who were meant to be caring for them .
Tony Costa , who grew up in orphanages in the UK until he was sent to Australia aged 12 , said : " I would often cry myself to sleep , many a night .
And we were there until we were 16 years of age .
" To this day , in the early hours of the morning , it 's nothing uncommon for me to wake up in a sweat , thinking of my time whilst in these institutions . "
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme Conservative leader David Cameron said the programme had been operated by all political parties and Mr Brown 's apology was on behalf of " all of us " .
He said : " It is hard to believe that this went on for so long , that the last children sailed in 1967 after most of us in this House were born .
" Anyone who studies what happened , systematically and for so long , will be profoundly shocked at the splitting of families , the lies and abuse that took place , the official sanction which made it possible , and the heartache which it caused . "
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said the apology would never heal the " extraordinary " pain but hoped it would start to atone for the " shameful episode in our history " .
The Child Migrant Trust said the significance of the apology was " immense " .
Director Margaret Humphreys said : " It gives them [ the migrants ] the recognition they have sought for so long - and , sadly , that so many have not lived to witness . "
Many of the children were lied to about their parents being dead Last November , Mr Brown announced he was planning to apologise after Australia 's prime minister Kevin Rudd said sorry for his country 's part in the tragedy .
Until now , no British prime minister has ever delivered an official apology , despite repeated demands from victims ' groups .
Last week , Britain 's High Commissioner to Australia , Baroness Amos , said the apology would be an " important milestone " .
" We want not just to bear witness to the past but to look forward to a future where these terrible events will not be repeated , " she said .
Harold Haig , secretary of the International Association of Former Child Migrants and their Families , said it was a " momentous day " , for which migrants had waited a lifetime .
" This apology is a moment in history when there can be reconciliation between the government , the nation and the child migrants , " he said .
Australian MP
Steve Irons , who played a part in lobbying for Canberra 's 2009 apology , also welcomed the UK move .
He said the abuse would never be forgotten , but it was an important part of the healing process for victims to hear the government believed them and was sorry .
Mr Brown said the child migrants themselves were consulted about the form the apology took .
Sixty survivors were flown to London so they could listen to the statement in person .
Some 7,000 child migrants from Britain still live in Australia .

The digital economy bill will become law before Parliament is dissolved at the beginning of April ahead of a likely general election in May , senior media industry figures believe .
That will usher in controversial laws enabling rights owners to cut off or restrict internet access for users who download films and music illegally .
The bill contains measures designed to combat piracy .
If it becomes law it will compel internet service providers including Carphone Warehouse and Virgin Media to pass on information about persistent offenders to rights holders .
It is currently in the House of Lords and about to get its third reading , when peers get the chance to table final amendments to the legislation .
One of the most contentious parts of the controversial digital economy bill was voted down by the House of Lords – only to be replaced by a clause that campaigners say is even more draconian .
The Liberal Democrats forced through a surprise amendment to the bill 's notorious clause 17 .
Instead of new powers that threatened sweeping alterations to British copyright law , the Lib Dems added a clause that gives a high court judge the right to issue an injunction against a website accused of hosting a " substantial " amount of copyright - infringing material , potentially forcing the entire site offline .
After the Lords , the bill will then go the House of Commons in a fortnight 's time .
If it proceeds to its second reading by early April , when an election is widely expected to be called , it could enter the statute book before parliament rises .
After an election is called , the Commons and the Lords normally spend a few days passing legislation that has not finished its passage through parliament in a process known as the " wash up " .
At this stage the government can only get measures through with opposition support and bills , or clauses of bills , that are opposed by the Tories will almost certainly be dropped .
One senior industry source said : " The government deserves credit for pushing through a proposal that is not a votewinner .
They recognise that the creative industries are a huge asset for the country . "
The Conservatives have said they will torpedo the bill unless the government reverses a bid to push through " independently financed news consortia " , which will make regional news to be shown on ITV1 , and ministers are likely to have to drop these provisions from the bill if they want to get the rest of it on to the statute book .

Nolan Bushnell , founder of the original 1972 Atari ( and , as it turns out , Chuck E. Cheese ) , has returned to his old stomping grounds .
The modern Atari has announced the return of one of its founders within its new Board of Directors , which also includes the addition of Tom Virden , the creator of many high - class leisure websites ( like Boatbookings.com , the largest yachts charting - only site . )
“ It kind of is a homecoming .
I think Atari has made some really nice strides in the last few years , and I feel like it ’s the right time and right place , ” he said in an interview with Industry Gamers .
“ I ’ve known [ CEO ] Jeff Lapin and some of the guys [ for quite a while ] , and I bumped into them a few years ago at E3 and had some dialogue .
It just all of a sudden felt natural I think for both sides . ”
Bushnell went on to continue , “ I ’m kind of a storehouse of legacy knowledge that I think will be helpful , and I think there are a lot of things that I can help the company with some unique capabilities , ” he commented .
“ So I ’m a Board member , which is very different than a line officer , but I think it ’s the right thing for me at this stage in my life .
I ’ve been on several boards of other game companies , and I ’ve kept my oar in the water of the games space consistently , and so I believe my ‘ institutional knowledge ’ will be very helpful . ”
When asked about the future of the Atari brand , under this new directorship , Bushnell was very optimistic , “ There are so many fun tools that we could only dream about when I was running Atari before .
Right now there is such a broad and diverse creative palette available to game designers and all you need is a little bit of out - of - the - box thinking and a little different approach , and I believe the best days are yet to come .
I ’m ecstatic about the tools , graphics potential , etc … and other things like the iPhone accelerometer , the Wii-motes and some of the new controls like Microsoft ’s Natal .
All of these things give the designer a magic way to interface with the world , and I think it ’ll be great . ”
Virden , who will also serve on the company ’s Audit Committee , said , “ I look forward to providing strategic insight and guidance to the executive team as it further expands its business online and builds value around its world - renowned brand and properties . ”
“ We are very pleased to welcome Mr. Bushnell and Mr. Virden as new members of the Board of Directors of Atari . ” said Frank Dangeard , the Chairman of the Board for Atari , “ We are convinced that their deep industry , technology and online business knowledge will be a substantial addition to the strategic insight of our Board . ”

There 's a lot been made of AFL player Wayne ' King ' Carey 's return to television after a few happy years roaming the planet , occasionally forgetting not to take drugs or smash glasses into ladies ' faces .
It seems that the requisite amount of time for commercial television executives to stop referring to a sports star as ' disgraced ' or ' unwelcome ' and instead add them as a new high profile presenter is roughly eight years and one month , give or take a few weeks .
That is of course if you do n't count Carey 's first instance of colourful behaviour in 1996 when he requested that a passerby find herself ' a bigger set of tits ' and demonstrated the point by squeezing her bosoms so hard she bruised .
Back then Carey was still a regular on The Footy Show and revered as a bit of a knockabout lad , albeit one who may have been slightly overenthusiastic when it came to appraisal of tits .
It was only six years later , when he dared transgress the unwritten law by banging his teammate 's missus in a bathroom - not to mention the subsequent George Best - esque downward spiral of boozing and an alleged glassing - that producers began to publicly edge away from him .
Clearly Wayne just needed a bit of time out ; to sit and reflect upon his behaviour and perhaps write a book revealing that the only reason he behaved like GG Allin on a crack binge was because his dad was n't a very nice man .
Penance performed , the media offers began flooding in .
League star Matthew Johns suffered a similar career pause when it was revealed on Four Corners last year that he'd once lingered beerily in a hotel room as several of his pals sprayed semen over a 19 - year - old waitress .
While that particular all - in knees up was only unveiled to the world in 2009 , it actually took place way back in 2002 which means in a purely mathematic sense Johns has obviously suffered enough .
Case in point , The Matty Johns Show - a ' new , family - friendly , NRL / entertainment show ' debuted on March 25 to rapturous applause .
So they 're both back on our television screens now .
And it seems most sporting fans have forgiven and forgotten and are ready to move on simply for the sake of being entertained by chaps who were once - in a football sense - at the top of their game .
They relish it , a bit of forgiveness .
It draws a clear line between them ( compassionate , understanding of the fact that ' everybody makes mistakes ' ) and those politically correct victim 's groups who just bang on and on and wo n't let anybody have a jot of fun .
' I am sick and tired of the women 's groups out here that continually try to take over the country and force they 're views onto the public .
I do not condone what Wayne Carey has done for a second , but I also respect what he has done on the football field and I believe he has an outstanding football brain .
If he is so unliked by the public as you say he is , then Channel 10 will have no choice but to terminate his contract and not have him on again .
After all , the viewers vote with the figures ...' seethed one particularly searing social commentator on the Herald Sun website last week .
It 's a wonderful word , that - ' but ' .
' I 'm not racist , but ...'; ' I 'm not homophobic , but ...' ; ' I do not try and condone what Wane Carey has done for a second , but ...'
But what ?
But it 's time to give Wayne Carey a fair go , that 's what .
Because after a time everyone deserves to put their past behind them .
Sure AFL star Ben Cousins may be pushing his rehabilitated luck in the public 's eyes - being recently hospitalised with ' mysterious ' stomach complaints and all - but he 's still for the most part been accepted back from the brink of his shirtless , teeth - grinding adventures with open arms .
Shane Warne now attends musical theatre shows that openly - and fondly - mock the fact that he once repeatedly cheated on his wife .
Brendan Fevola , for his part , probably just needs to stop being such an arseclown for a bit , but give it time and he 'll soon be in an affectionate headlock and grinning adorably from our televisions again .
This notion of a ' fair go ' and ' forgiveness ' only goes so far , of course .
If you 've escaped your politically violent home country in desperate circumstances and are eventually discovered to have either once punched your wife or harboured a long - term drug- addiction , chances are you 'll be splashed across the front pages of the tabloid papers and packed off back to where you came from .
If you 're a young Asian man prone to firing up in nightclubs , you 're part of a ' culture of violence ' .
If you 're a young Lebanese Muslim man present during a gang rape , it 's your insufficient acclimatising to our way of life that is to blame ( is that how you treat women in your country , mate ? ) , and symptomatic of a wider problem between ' your people ' and ' ours ' .
These people can't expect us to stick up for them though , can they ?
Have they ever been named as centre half forward and captain of North Melbourne 's Team of the Century ?
Are they a New South Wales State of Origin representative five - eighth ?
Have they scored over 3,000 Test runs ?
Forgiveness only goes so far , you know .
And everyone has the right to a clean slate , especially if they 've been selected six times in the All - Australian Team and represented Australia in the International Rules Series .

The number three bus in Riga winds from the mouth of the river Daugava , past the lovely old centre of the city to the miles of Lego - brick , Soviet - era blocks in Plavnieki .
At the foot of one of them , Natalija is sitting at one table and Maksimam at another in the Tris Pelmeni cafe , eating herring with onions and drinking beer while ice melts down the windows and the radio relays a highly charged ice - hockey game between Dinamo Riga and Ska St Petersburg .
Old ladies pick through the snow with shopping , men rummage through rubbish bins and boys with shaven heads fly the Russian flag from cars screeching through the slush .
This weekend , there is also a widespread sense of anger .
In this ethnic Russian suburb of the Latvian capital , there is disbelief at the prospect of a commemoration to be held this Tuesday by veterans and supporters of the Latvian Legion of the wartime SS .
Natalija 's uncle " was killed by the fascists " , she says , yet " still the Latvians allow a parade of the SS of Adolf Hitler ! " .
Maksimam , younger , hunches the collar of his leather jacket , sips his drink and says he cares little what the old people get up to – but spits at the idea of an SS ceremony .
In a nod to ethnic allegiance , he is supporting St Petersburg in the ice - hockey contest against his home town .
Many of his fellow ethnic Russians , who form the majority in the capital but a minority nationwide , are doing the same .
A few miles away in the city centre , rows of young Latvians greet the end of the match , a sensational 3 - 1 away win for Riga , at the Folk Klubs Ala , with beers and cheers for a stab at the Russian foe on his own terrain .
Here the view of Tuesday 's controversial commemoration is very different .
A boy called Uldis thinks " it 's correct to allow those who fought for Latvia to honour the dead " .
The idea they were Nazis is " bullshit – they were defending our country " .
Battered by recession and emerging from the harshest winter in 30 years , Riga is bitterly divided over an annual commemoration that has also become an international controversy .
Ever since David Cameron pulled the Conservative party out of the centre - right coalition in the European parliament to align the Tories alongside rightwingers such as Latvia 's Fatherland and Freedom , which helps organise the SS event , an unexpected spotlight has shone on this corner of eastern Europe .
The foreign secretary , David Miliband , has called such links " sickening " .
The Tory chairman , Eric Pickles , has accused critics of recycling " old Soviet smears " about the Latvians .
And the annual SS veterans ' march has become for many a disturbing symbol of rightwing extremism within the European Union .
The ramifications of the row that electrified British politics and Brussels have now been felt in Riga .
Tuesday 's events have been banned by the courts – citing security reasons – at the behest of the pro-Russian Harmony party which controls Riga .
The party 's chairman , Janis Urbanovics , told the Observer that " although the legionnaires themselves decrease with time , the problem is increasing .
After independence , this country became so preoccupied with hating Russia that it is not coming to terms with what happened during German occupation .
We need that in order to draw a line under the past " .
Juris Dobelis , a parliamentary deputy for the Fatherland and Freedom party , will be there in defiance of the ban .
" A soldier is a soldier and all soldiers are equal , " says Dobelis .
The units that fought here " were young men of 19 mobilised to fight other young men 19 years old .
If politicians want to make speeches about that , it 's not our concern .
We have seen commemorations in London and Moscow – this is ours . "
The Latvian Legion fought , he insists , " for the liberation of Latvia from the Soviet Union " , and in support of the Wermacht " as liberators only for a moment " .
Therefore , " we will go as a party " , says Dobelis , a man with a manner of iron , " with veterans of 90 years old , to church at 10 am .
After church we go to the monument and by afternoon we shall be 70 km away at the Lestana cemetery " – where the SS dead are buried .
Janis Atis Krumins 's father was an SS legionnaire and he will be there , too .
Krumins is a member of Daugava Vanagi – Hawk of the Daugava – founded in 1945 by 12,000 legionnaires in a British POW camp at Zedelgem in Belgium " to support the veterans and families of the dead , scattered into exile during Soviet occupation " , says Krumins .
The commemoration provokes anger , Krumins says , " because whoever wins the war is considered to be in the right .
Justice belongs to the victor , and the Soviet victor 's history demands that legionnaires be considered war criminals , the Red Army as heroes .
For the Russians , whoever fights against communism is a fascist " .
Their gesture will be contested on the streets and at a conference – addressed today by the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre , Efraim Zuroff – run by Latvia 's Anti-Fascist Committee , LAK .
LAK was founded by a beekeeper named Josepf Koren , who describes himself as " not Russian but Jewish and born anti-communist " after his and his wife 's families were persecuted by the Soviets .
" We do n't say all veterans are war criminals , " says Koren , " but at least 25 % of the Latvian Legion were recruited from the Latvian police who were involved in the murder of Jews and other Latvians , and the SS Legion should not be permitted a celebration of itself in the centre of our city . "
This event has become a political football in contemporary Latvia – a young country bitterly and deeply divided between ethnic Latvian and Russian communities and political parties – on all sides , even among Tuesday 's mourners :
" The second world war is with us today , " says Mr Dobelis .
" We have many senior former officers of the KGB and Red Army living in Latvia . "
The country 's foremost public historian , Valters Nollendorfs , has problems with both sides of the argument , defending the Legion as distinct from the Third Reich but chastising Latvian politicians " for not coming to terms with the Holocaust " .
" The elite that runs this country knows that people who volunteered or were drafted by the Germans were among the murderers of the Jews . "
On the other hand , " you can not take away the context of a year of Soviet occupation .
When does resistance to the Soviets end and collaboration with the Nazis begin ? "
Successive occupations " dealt a terrible blow to Latvia 's sense of being , pitting brother against brother , literally " .
Arturis Punte's two grandfathers fought on opposite sides , one for the Legion , the other for the Red Army .
Arturis calls himself " a Russian Latvian in Europe " , and it is a relief to meet him in a bistro for which he is translating the menu into Russian .
Punte is a poet , but is best known in Latvia for his Orbita project , which became the first Russian arts group to win the Latvian literary medal .
" We try to translate between the cultures , literally and figuratively , " he says , " to forge an objective Latvian narrative we can all share .
Both sides manufacture folklores of fake heroism based on bad history , and the ceremony of 16 March just reflects the fact that the establishment can't say clearly what happened here – everyone is always looking for someone else to be the guilty ones in the traumas that this place has been through . "
In Riga , while the rest of Europe debates the danger of far - right extremism in the present , and the likes of Juris Dobelis commemorate a dubious past , the increasingly urgent priority is reconciliation .
( CNN ) – It 's a question science fiction writers asked long before man could fly :
Are we alone ?
And if we 're not , are we in trouble ?
The cosmologist Stephen Hawking is issuing a warning in a new documentary , saying that we are not alone , that there may be hostile life out there , they may be hungry , and we should be careful about going out looking for them .
NASA just announced it 's going ahead with a new plan to search for extraterrestrial life .

At 7:45 AM on Monday the 15th , I and a bunch of really nervous - looking new employees stood together in a lobby at the Googleplex , waiting to be led in .
Here are some random first - week notes while my eyes are still fresh .
This might turn into a series , because I recognize that my current employer is sort of a technology tourist attraction and people might want to read about it .
On the other hand , it has a culture of very cautious communication , so I ’ll have to be careful .
The John · But first I ’d like to step back almost 20 years , to an occasion in the early Nineties when I was on - site at Microsoft .
I noticed a pattern in the men ’s rooms , time after time , like this : I ’d be washing my hands or whatever , and some guy would come in , walking really fast with a look of urgency , headed straight for the fixtures .
This was a guy who ’d been so zoned in coding that he ’d ignored his growing need till he just absolutely could n’t any more .
Google ’s like that , these days .
The Formalities · I have n’t been through that many orientation programs , but this one is very impressive .
They pack in a lot of really important information while working hard ( successfully in my case ) to convince the people in the room that the company really cares about the incoming noobs .
Perks ·
Yep , the things everyone knows about , food and bikes and massage and so on ;
All true , and more .
It ’s a hell of a place to be .
Growth · Look at Google ’s age in years and current size and do some arithmetic ; insane growth is an everyday constant .
This reality becomes obvious the instant you get behind the locked doors .
Not many organizations have ever attempted to manage this much sustained growth for this time ; to me it ’s amazing that they manage to hold things together at all .
I now own part of the responsibility for dealing with this problem , which looks to me as big as any of the others I ’ve seen so far , on either the business or technology side .
Smart Security · Sadly , that combination is rare .
Enterprise veterans often come to associate “ Security ” and stupidity ; officious second - raters who pollute your workplace and tools with ass - covering irritants that get in your way to no plausible end .
Google presents arguably the Internet ’s largest attack surface .
Appropriately , nobody ’s talking about the volume and flavor of everyday attacks , but I bet the appropriate adjectives are “ huge ” and “ nasty ” , respectively .
And those are n’t the ones that make the daily news .
The people who are working on this stuff seem smart , the policies and tools appropriate , and to the ( very minor ) extent they ’ve gotten in my way , it seems a small price to pay .
I am so totally not going to discuss any details , but wow .
The Grand Experiment · That ’s what Google is .
I mean , why ca n’t everyone lavish these sort of perks , and this sort of environment , on their employees ?
Well , because we ’re at a weird time in the history of the growth of the Internet .
At this ( perhaps anomalous ) point , the business leverage resulting from the focused application of human intelligence is so high that all these benefits and all this freedom , considered through a pure cold profit - and - loss lens , are cheap at the price .
Can it be replicated ?
Can it be grown ?
Can it even be sustained ?
Nobody knows .
But I really hope somebody is studying it closely , because there are lessons here to be learned .

President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats are absolutely giddy today to be losing a procedural vote on Wall Street reform .
Why are they so happy ?
If the Senate Republicans stand together and vote no , Democrats are prepared to rake them over the coals on the issue , as 2/3 of all Americans support financial reform .
By being the Party of No , the GOP is painting themselves as the party of Pro Wall St .
According to LA Times ’ D.C. Now blog , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ’s spokesman Jim Manley laid out the frame , “ We remain eager to work with Republicans who are sincere about reforming Wall Street , and we are hopeful for bipartisan agreement on this important effort .
But there are no two ways about it : A vote against even opening debate on holding Wall Street accountable is a vote to protect Wall Street . ”
It does n’t take a rocket scientist to see what the Democrats are up to here .
If the Republicans continue to oppose Wall St. reform , they had best be prepared to be battered on the issue by Democrats all summer long .
This is a similar strategy to what the Republicans used last summer on health care reform , but the difference being that the Democrats have overwhelming public support on their side .
According to a new ABC News / Washington
Post poll , almost 66 % of Americans favor federal oversight of loans and industry paid fund that would cover the cost of dismantling failed firms .

Obama has strong support on this issue , as 52 % of those surveyed trust him most compared to 35 % who trust the Republicans in Congress on financial reform .
Independents also prefer Obama on this issue , 47% - 35 % .
Seventy five percent of Democrats , 57 % of Independents , and 44 % of Republicans favor federal reform .
It is no wonder that the Democrats are salivating at the prospect of the Republicans pulling out their Party of No shtick .
After spending days , lying about the bill and referring to it as another bailout , GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) just may be starting to understand that he and his merry choir of negativity are being set up for big blow .
McConnell ’s media talking point had been , “ In fact , if you look at it carefully , it will lead to endless taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street banks .
It actually guarantees future bailouts of Wall Street banks ” and that it sets up “ in perpetuity the potential for additional taxpayer bailouts of large institutions . ”
Polifact rated this claim as false , and yesterday on ABC Paul Krugman called it one of the most dishonest claims in political history .
McConnell should be aware that this issue is a minefield for the GOP , but the Republicans have revealed their expertise in the art of self destruction .
Obama and the Democrats have the GOP cornered , and have set up a masterful strategy where they will actually win by losing today ’s vote .
Financial reform will get passed because the issue is too popular with the public for the Republicans to allow Obama to have another victory .
In the end , I suspect that Democrats will make some small tweaks as concessions and the bill will pass with 60 - 70 votes , because if it does n’t Congressional Republicans and their candidates will be in for a long , long , summer .
Research suggests that almost 10 % of second level schools have been forced to drop Physics as a subject offered to students .
The findings indicate that the decision is as a direct result of education cutbacks .
The information - gathered from more than 300 schools – was carried out by Millward Browne Lansdowne on behalf of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland .
The research also found that Higher and Ordinary Science classes have been combined in 70 % of the schools surveyed .
ASTI General Secretary John
White expressed his concern at the outcome of the survey .
‘ Physics is the subject which schools are most likely to drop as a result of the cutbacks , ’ Mr White said .
‘ This is happening at a time when the Government , in its Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal , has stated that improving the mathematical and scientific literacy of second - level pupils is a key objective , ’ he added .
The survey also found that time lost due to lab preparation and clean up duties is a key concern for Junior Certificate teachers .
95 % of teachers said the availability of a lab technician would help them improve the standard of science teaching .

A shell fired from an Israeli Army tank explodes over a building in the outskirts of Gaza City , as seen from the Israeli - Gaza border
A high - ranking Israeli officer has acknowledged for the first time that the army went beyond its previous rules of engagement on the protection of civilian lives in order to minimise military casualties during last year 's Gaza war .
The officer , who served as a commander during Operation Cast Lead , made it clear that he did not regard the longstanding principle of military conduct known as " means and intentions " – whereby a targeted suspect must have a weapon and show signs of intending to use it before being fired upon – as being applicable before calling in fire from drones and helicopters in Gaza last winter .
A more junior officer who served at a brigade headquarters during the operation described the new policy – devised in part to avoid the heavy military casualties of the 2006 Lebanon war – as one of " literally zero risk to the soldiers " .
The officers ' revelations will pile more pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to set up an independent inquiry into the war , as demanded in the UN - commissioned Goldstone Report , which harshly criticised the conduct of both Israel and Hamas .
One of Israel 's most prominent human rights lawyers , Michael Sfard , said last night that the senior commander 's acknowledgement – if accurate – was " a smoking gun " .
Until now , the testimony has been kept out of the public domain .
The senior commander told a journalist compiling a lengthy report for Yedhiot Ahronot , Israel 's biggest daily newspaper , about the rules of engagement in the three - week military offensive in Gaza .
But although the article was completed and ready for publication five months ago , it has still not appeared .
The senior commander told Yedhiot : " Means and intentions is a definition that suits an arrest operation in the Judaea and Samaria [ West Bank ] area ...
We need to be very careful because the IDF [ Israel Defence Forces ] was already burnt in the second Lebanon war from the wrong terminology .
The concept of means and intentions is taken from different circumstances .
Here [ in Cast Lead ] we were not talking about another regular counter - terrorist operation .
There is a clear difference . "
His remarks reinforce testimonies from soldiers who served in the Gaza operation , made to the veterans ' group Breaking the Silence and reported exclusively by this newspaper last July .
They also appear to cut across the military doctrine – enunciated most recently in public by one of the authors of the IDF 's own code of ethics – that it is the duty of soldiers to run risks to themselves in order to preserve civilian lives .
Explaining what he saw as the dilemma for forces operating in areas that were supposedly cleared of civilians , the senior commander said : " Whoever is left in the neighbourhood and wants to action an IED [ improvised explosive device ] against the soldiers does n't have to walk with a Kalashnikov or a weapon .
A person like that can walk around like any other civilian ; he sees the IDF forces , calls someone who would operate the terrible death explosive and five of our soldiers explode in the air .
We could not wait until this IED is activated against us . "
Another soldier who worked in one of the brigade 's war - room headquarters told The Independent that conduct in Gaza – particularly by aerial forces and in areas where civilians had been urged to leave by leaflets – had " taken the targeted killing idea and turned it on its head " .
Instead of using intelligence to identify a terrorist , he said , " here you do the opposite : first you take him down , then you look into it . "
The Yedhiot newspaper also spoke to a series of soldiers who had served in Operation Cast Lead in sensitive positions .
While the soldiers rejected the main finding of the Goldstone Report – that the Israeli military had deliberately " targeted " the civilian population – most asserted that the rules were flexible enough to allow a policy under which , in the words of one soldier " any movement must entail gunfire .
No one 's supposed to be there . "
He added that at a meeting with his brigade commander and others it was made clear that " if you see any signs of movement at all you shoot .
This is essentially the rules of engagement . "
The other soldier in the war - room explained : " This does n't mean that you need to disrespect the lives of Palestinians but our first priority is the lives of our soldiers .
That 's not something you 're going to compromise on .
In all my years in the military , I never heard that . "
He added that the majority of casualties were caused in his brigade area by aerial firing , including from unmanned drones .
" Most of the guys taken down were taken down by order of headquarters .
The number of enemy killed by HQ - operated remote ... compared to enemy killed by soldiers on the ground had absolutely inverted , " he said .
Rules of engagement issued to soldiers serving in the West Bank as recently as July 2006 make it clear that shooting towards even an armed person will take place only if there is intelligence that he intends to act against Israeli forces or if he poses an immediate threat to soldiers or others .
In a recent article in New Republic , Moshe Halbertal , a philosophy professor at Hebrew and New York Universities , who was involved in drawing up the IDF 's ethical code in 2000 and who is critical of the Goldstone Report , said that efforts to spare civilian life " must include the expectation that soldiers assume some risk to their own lives in order to avoid causing the deaths of civilians " .
While the choices for commanders were often extremely difficult and while he did not think the expectation was demanded by international law , " it is demanded in Israel 's military code and this has always been its tradition " .
The Israeli military declined to comment on the latest revelations , and directed all enquiries to already - published material , including a July 2009 foreign ministry document The Operation in Gaza : Factual and Legal Aspects .
That document , which repeats that Israel acted in conformity with international law despite the " acute dilemmas " posed by Hamas 's operations within civilian areas , sets out the principles of Operation Cast Lead as follows : " Only military targets shall be attacked ;
Any attack against civilian objectives shall be prohibited .
A ' civilian objective ' is any objective which is not a military target . "
It adds : " In case of doubt , the forces are obliged to regard an object as civilian . "
Yedhiot has not commented on why its article has not been published .
Israel in Gaza :
The soldier 's tale
This experienced soldier , who cannot be named , served in the war room of a brigade during Operation Cast Lead .
Here , he recalls an incident he witnessed during last winter 's three - week offensive :
" Two [ Palestinian ] guys are walking down the street .
They pass a mosque and you see a gathering of women and children .
" You saw them exiting the house and [ they ] are not walking together but one behind the other .
So you begin to fantasise they are actually ducking close to the wall .
" One [ man ] began to run at some point , must have heard the chopper .
The GSS [ secret service ] argued that the mere fact that he heard it implicated him , because a normal civilian would not have realised that he was now being hunted .
" Finally he was shot .
He was not shot next to the mosque .
It 's obvious that shots are not taken at a gathering . "

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) -- Actor Randy Quaid and his wife , Evi , spent several hours in the Santa Barbara County , California , jail Monday after they showed up for a hearing on accusations that they defrauded an innkeeper and failed to pay a hotel bill .
A judge set bail at $ 100,000 each for the actor and his wife , who missed several previous hearing dates , Santa Barbara District Attorney Arnie Tolks said .
The Quaids were handcuffed , taken from court Monday morning and escorted by sheriff 's deputies for booking , Tolks said .
The judge did give them each $ 20,000 credit for a previous bond .
After about four hours in jail , they posted the remaining $ 80,000 each and were freed from jail until another hearing Wednesday , according to the sheriff .
The couple were originally arrested in Presidio County , Texas , last September , accused of skipping out on a $ 10,000 hotel bill in Santa Barbara .
Each faces felony charges of burglary , defrauding an innkeeper and conspiracy .
Quaid , 56 , is known for his roles in several films , including the " National Lampoon 's Vacation " movies , " Kingpin " and " Brokeback Mountain . "

Support to Conventional Agriculture May Not Translate into Help for Rural Economies
To the extent that federal farm programs support the structural changes that have occurred in agriculture , there is a persuasive argument that they have contributed to greater consolidation .
Indeed , as the production of program commodities by conventional agriculture has shifted to larger farms , commodity payments have shifted as well , supporting the trend .
In 2003 , farms with $ 500,000 or more in production received 32 % of all payments .
USDA , ERS , Economic Brief No. 6 ( Mar. 2006 ) .
" The largest 12.4 percent of farms in terms of gross receipts received 62.4 percent of all government payments in 2008 . "
USDA Economic Research Service , Farm and Commodity Policy : Government Payments and the Farm Sector Briefing Room .
Know Your Farmer , Know Your Food
It is also the start of a national conversation about the importance of understanding where your food comes from and how it gets to your plate .
Today , there is too much distance between the average American and their farmer and we are marshaling resources from across USDA to help create the link between local production and local consumption .
Know Your Farmer , Know Your Food
Farm consolidation has hurt many rural communities as the number of farmers declines and as regional urban centers better serve the needs of the large operations .
Given the political divide in Washington , and in particular in the Senate the letter from Senators Chambliss , McCain , and Roberts could be seen as a partisan attack .
Given the financial realities of USDA spending , it does not make much sense as objective analysis .
And , perhaps more damaging , it serves to raise the barriers that exist in our society - the divide between different types of farmers , between farmers and consumers , and between rural and urban . seeks to break down these barriers " by better connecting consumers with local producers . "
According to the program website I , for one , support that goal .
I look forward to the USDA 's report on its activities under the program .
P.S. Thanks to a comment posted , here 's Secretary Vilsack 's description of
Public fatigue and disillusionment , plus hostile opposition from Big Insurance and far - right ideologues are what President Obama has to overcome in order to rally enough “ yes ” votes in the House of Representatives for his health care reform plan .
( UPDATE March 9 , 2010 : March and rally in Washington , DC at Big Insurance meeting .
Follow AFL -CIO
Now blog coverage and Twitter . )
Many analysts say this vote could “ make or break ” the presidency .
In his weekly New York Times column , Frank Rich soberly places it as a “ do - or - die moment ” not just for health care , but for Obama ’s presidency , which could be “ toast ” if reform fails to pass .
While Big Insurance and the far - right argue the American people are against Obama ’s plan because it ’s a “ government takeover , ” polls show otherwise .
The recently cited McClatchy / Ipsos poll reports forty seven percent of those polled were opposed to the “ health care reform proposal being discussed . ”
Forty - one percent are in favor .
But as Barry Sussman of the Nieman Watchdog Project , a Harvard - based journalism group , points out in his article , “ McClatchy survey finds huge support – 2 to 1 – for health care reform , ” the pollsters asked a follow - up question , which turns the numbers on its head .
A stunning 2 - 1 supermajority is in favor of health care reform , Sussman writes , because 37 percent against the current proposal says it does n’t “ go far enough to reform health care . ”
But how to mobilize that fatigued supermajority to pressure their congress people is a challenge grassroots health care groups are trying to meet .
“ Talking Health Care ” Sung and shot on the West Side of Cleveland :
In November , the House had 220 votes in favor of the bill .
Since then some Democrats are out of the picture ( Rep. John Murtha died , Rep Eric Massa resigned ) .
House Speaker Pelosi needs 216 votes to pass the Senate version of the bill , and media reports claim the House has 212 “ yes ” votes as of March 5 .
Pelosi says she is going to have enough votes to win the vote later this month .
The president ’s appearance in Philadelphia today , March 8 , may be about swinging at least one previous “ no ” vote to a “ yes ” vote .
Pennsylvania Representative Jason Altmire , who was part of the 39 Democrats that voted for the Stupak Amendment has to decide whether the Senate anti-abortion language is “ strong enough ” versus having the status quo on health care .
He said recently , “ In the end , I have to make a decision between passing this bill .
This is the finish line - or doing nothing . ”
In Illinois , Campaign for Better Health Care has been rallying at reluctant congressional representatives ’ offices , Republican and Democrat , to “ Get It Done . ”
On March 11 , the group is rallying outside Democratic Rep .
Dan Lipinski office and leaving shoes representing the Illinoisans who have died prematurely from lack of health care or have been denied because of a pre-existing condition .
In Cleveland , Ohio , a Facebook - based campaign to get Rep. Dennis Kucinich to vote for the plan is underway .
The group called “ 100,000 Clevelanders Urge Dennis , Vote for Pres. Obama ’s Health Care bill ” is be made up of Kucinich supporters who disagree with the congressman ’s “ all or nothing ” approach to health care .
Kucinich was one of two progressives who voted against the House bill last November .
Kucinich said that bill did not go far enough , and supports a single - payer only approach .
The group says , “ Today , there are nearly 100,000 Cleveland area residents uninsured in U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich ’s 10th District .
We urge him to vote for President Obama ’s health care reform . ”
A call to his Washington office today confirmed that Kucinich is still planning to vote “ no . ”

ROME , Italy —
Italy ’s biggest party , Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi ’s “ People of Freedoms ” ( PdL ) , might be left out of Rome 's upcoming regional elections because of one fatal mistake .
It was 11.40 a.m. on Feb. 27 , the last day to formally enlist candidates for the regional elections at the end of this month .
PdL delegate Alfredo Milioni , a 50 - year - old low - ranking politician who has served 15 years under Berlusconi ’s party , had been entrusted with a thick red folder .
Inside were the names of 41 local candidates for Rome and 121 neighboring towns — a list that would have provided more than 4 million voters with a pro-Berlusconi choice .
Milioni entered the Rome 's courthouse only to walk out minutes later with the list still in his hands .
By the time he returned to finish his job , Rome ’s courthouse had closed for business and Milioni had missed the noon deadline to register the candidates .
The news hit Berlusconi and his party like a bucket of cold water .
Their highly financed candidate Renata Polverini was a shoe - in for victory as governor of Latium , the region Rome is a part of .
She now was a baffled politician left off the ballot .
The Milioni disaster set the tone for a new kind of political arena .
PdL organized press conferences , marches and rallies to protest the rules .
Politicians met with lawyers behind closed doors hoping to find a solution , including a suggestion to use government - mandated powers to edit election rules .
Berlusconi went on television to defend his party ’s right to compete .
In the meantime , the press attacked Milioni , who even earned a Facebook page mocking his misadventure .
But a mystery remains .
Why would someone like Milioni postpone his important task at the courthouse 20 minutes from the final deadline ?
Milioni told the newspaper Corriere della Sera that he had stepped out for a quick sandwich .
Later , he was quoted saying that he had gone to check on his sick daughter , who was waiting for him in his car .
In the end , he said he was reshuffling some documents .
According to the newspaper La Repubblica , Milioni left the courthouse to change some of the names in his list , a last - minute task passed down from high - ranking party members .
In the same article , Berlusconi called Milioni and his superiors a bunch of “ amateur politicians . ”
A furious Berlusconi was also reported saying : “ I had asked them to improve the list , not boycott it . ”
Last week , Berlusconi met with Italian President Giorgio Napolitano to ask him to approve a government decree that would change regional election rules .
Napolitano compromised by signing an “ interpretative decree . ”
It would give party delegates a 24 - hour extension beginning with the passage of the law to turn in their list , if they had entered the courthouse in time but were n’t able to accomplish the task — a perfect fit in Milioni ’s case .
But when the Italian President left the final decision to Rome judges , they rejected the decree as “ inapplicable . ”
With this last accident , the PdL ’s voter base has questioned the party ’s efficacy in bringing candidates to power .
The pro-Berlusconi newspaper Il Giornale blamed it on the incompatibility between two clashing perspectives inside PdL .
The party was created to unify Italy ’s two main conservative forces , Berlusconi ’s former “ Forza Italia ” ( Go Italy ) and Gianfranco Fini ’s “ Alleanza Nazionale ” ( National Alliance ) .
Through the partnership , Berlusconi and Fini granted themselves a permanent majority .
But it came with a price .
Since its founding in March 2009 , the party has confronted multiple shockwaves that have left deep rifts .
On one hand , the constant attempts by Milan judges to bring Berlusconi to trial for bribing and fiscal fraud ; on the other , the bold attacks on Berlusconi by his most strategic de facto ally — Gianfranco Fini himself , who is now President of the Italian Parliament .
If the PdL is n’t going to compete in Latium this year , Italians will be left wondering whether election rules blocked democracy — or the exact opposite .

The ad will be 2 inches by 4 inches and featured in the local newspaper .
We do n't have a logo or slogan .
The ad simply needs to say the name of the business , and our address and phone number :
124 South ******
Ave
(***)-***-****
It needs to be attention - grabbing and also include a graphic related to haircuts .
I do n't have any images so you will have to design them .
Please do n't have anything boring ( i.e. a graphic of scissors . )
Thank you so much for your help !
Lucy
From Me to Lucy *******:
Sounds good , Lucy .
I 'll get back to you within a day with the proposed ad for your review .
From Lucy ******* to Me :
Great .
Thank you Mike !

Please let me know what you think .

From Lucy ******* to Me :
Mike , I do n't completely understand the ad .
Could you please explain what you were going for with that graphic ?
From Me to Lucy *******:
Lucy ,
It is a man admiring his new haircut while a woman is crouching down to clean up the hair clippings on the floor below him .
Mike
From Lucy ******* to Me :
Oh .
That �s not what think when I look at it .
It looks very suggestive to me .
Why is " downtown " and " service " in quotes ?
From Me to Lucy *******:
How is that suggestive ?
The only thing it suggests to me is that I will be getting a very admirable haircut and quality service .
The fact that the woman is already cleaning up the hair clippings while the man is still in the chair suggests that your store is quick , efficient , and clean .
Downtown is in quotes because it is short for Downtown ******* , and I put " Service " in quotes to suggest that you will be getting much " more " than a haircut , such as helpful employees , great deals , and friendly smiles .
If you do not offer great deals or friendly smiles , then I apologize for the mistake and will remove the quotes from around " Service . "
Otherwise , I do n't understand what your problem is with the ad .
Mike
From Lucy ******* to Me :
Cut the BS , Mike .
You know exactly what you did .
Are you going to keep wasting my time or design the real ad ?
From Me to Lucy *******:
Lucy , can you please explain why you are unhappy with the ad ?
I can't make changes if you are being so vague about everything .
Would you like me to have the woman holding scissors and a hair comb ?
Mike
From Lucy ******* to Me :

Hey there , I am just starting my career as a graphic designer and have helped design several ads featured in various magazines .

IT REALLY WORKS : Jake Briggs watched via email as a man triggered the web cameras in his home .
" I was n't annoyed , I was more excited . "
When a man broke into a Lower Hutt home , he probably did n't expect his crime to be broadcast live on the internet .
Jake Briggs , 33 , set up remote , motion - triggered web - cameras in his Taita house about 18 months ago .
On Monday , the cameras proved their worth , capturing images as an alleged robber burgled his home .
CAUGHT IN ACTION :
The alleged burglar spotted a camera and peered into it , puzzled .
He escaped over the back fence of the Taita property before police arrived .
Mr Briggs , a software engineer , was at work in central Wellington about 1.45 pm when he received an email informing him the cameras had been triggered .
When he opened the email , he watched live as the man allegedly stole two laptops , clothing and alcohol .
He fled before police reached the scene .
" I was watching it happen ...
It just popped up and said new email and I looked at it , and I 'm like ' holy shit , there 's a guy in my house ' , " he said .
It appeared the man had spotted a camera , and peered into it , looking perplexed .
He then turned to face the wall – giving a clearer view of himself – before grabbing the gear and escaping over the back fence , Mr Briggs said .
" I was n't annoyed , I was more excited .
Honestly , when I set it up I never even dreamed that this would happen .
The challenge of setting it up was enough to make me set it up . "
He called 111 and explained what was happening to a bemused operator .
Police reached the scene within 10 minutes but the alleged robber had left .
Mr Briggs has now turned to social networking to solve the crime .
He posted the images , which clearly show a man wearing a baseball cap , on Twitter with a caption asking for information on his identity .
Colleague John Weaver , 27 , watched Mr Briggs ' reaction as the emails arrived .
" It was almost that of disbelief .
He sort of turned to me and said , ` What number should I call if ... somebody 's in my house . " '
" I ran around to his desk and ... he was scrolling through these emails and we were watching this guy go through his lounge . "
Mr Weaver has also posted the images on his Twitter account .
Constable Daniel Turner of Lower Hutt was impressed with Mr Briggs ' ingenuity and the security setup .
" I reckon it's a bloody good idea , " he said , adding that the quality was better than more expensive CCTV systems .
Police are wanting to speak to the man seen in the footage about the burglary .
Anyone with information should contact Lower Hutt police on 04 560 2600 .
JAKE BRIGG'S SECURITY SYSTEM
A standard laptop and webcams .
The web cameras are programmed to turn off and on at set times – after Jake Briggs and his partner leave the house and before they return .
The software , Motion , prompts the cameras to shoot a continuous series of images .
When a certain amount of motion was detected between photo frames , an email alert was sent to his inbox with an accompanying photograph .
Emails containing still images were continuously sent and Mr Briggs was able to watch the footage live over the internet .
Legendary entertainer James Brown is now “ The Gone - father of Soul . ”
One of Brown ’s daughters reportedly claims that the singer ’s body has gone missing from its crypt — part of an elaborate plot to prevent her from carrying out an autopsy that will determine whether he was really killed .
“ My daddy ’s body has disappeared .
I have no clue where it was taken , but I need to know where , ” said LaRhonda Pettit , 48 .
“ I ’m convinced his death was suspicious and I want the people responsible brought to justice . ”
The R&B great — famous for his feverish dance moves and songs like “ Papa ’s Got A Brand New Bag ” and “ It ’s A Man ’s Man ’s Man ’s World ” — died on Dec. 25 , 2006 at age 73 .
Pettit said the official cause of her father ’s death — determined by doctors to be a heart attack brought on by a bout with pneumonia — is not the real reason behind the passing of “ The Godfather of Soul . ”
“ The only way to do that is to exhume his body and have an autopsy , ” Pettit said in an interview with The Globe newspaper .
“ I can not understand why one was never conducted . ”
Brown ’s body was sealed in a crypt at the South Carolina home of his daughter Deanna Brown - Thomas while arrangements are made for a permanent grave .
Pettit underwent a DNA test three years ago to prove she was Brown ’s daughter .
She is believed to be one of 12 people to come forward since Brown ’s death claiming to be one of his illegitimate kids .
Pettit speculated that Brown may have been killed by those who gave him illegal drugs .
“ It was common knowledge that my daddy took illegal drugs , ” she said .
“ He was also hooked on various prescription painkillers .
At the very least there were enablers who helped cause his death . ”
Brown ’s family disputes Pettit ’s claims .
A lawyer for the family told TMZ.com today that Brown ’s body has never been moved .
Brown , who had a 50 - year career , is arguably one of this country ’s greatest singers .
During the civil - rights movement , Brown recorded such hits as “ Say it Loud ( I ’m Black and I ’m Proud ) ” and “ I Do n’t Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing ( Open Up the Door and I ’ll Get it Myself ) . ”
In 1969 , Look Magazine called Brown “ the most important black man in America . ”
Brown was among the first group of musicians inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 , along with such greats as Elvis Presley , Chuck Berry , Buddy Holly and Ray Charles .
While his 53 Top 10 hits punctuated the radio from the late 1950s well into the 1980s , his live performances were a thing of legend .
Brown , who was often wrapped in a cape , would frequently work himself into such a frenzy that he would dramatically collapse on stage — only to theatrically toss the cape off and rush back to continue singing .
His “ Live at the Apollo ” show from 1962 in Harlem is widely considered one of the greatest live albums ever .
DURHAM , NC — NCAA officials announced Wednesday that seven losses would be stricken from Duke 's 2008 - 2009 season record , claiming they were forced to act after discovering evidence of dramatically meritorious behavior both on and off the court .
" This will forever polish the legacy of the Blue Devils , as all their losses from the season will be removed from the record books , " said Paul T. Dee , the chairman of the Plauditory Committee , who expressed strong commendations for the men's basketball team .
" Their overall AP ranking for last year will also be impacted , as we will have to drop them up from sixth to second .
And we find it only fair that Duke be stripped of its 1994 second - place tournament finish , which will go to Arkansas in exchange for their national title trophy . "
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski has decided not to appeal the NCAA 's decision to permanently place the Blue Devils on approbation .

Update :
This open letter from the EFF to Google makes some of the same points , particularly how Google is probably the one company able to establish an open video standard for the web .
Update 2 ( 19/5/2010 ) : Steps 1 and 2 in my prediction appears to have happened .
Google is open - sourcing VP8 in the hope of making it ( in the form of WebM ) the standard for internet video .
They will transcode all YouTube video to WebM .
And Firefox and IE9 ( in a half - assed way ) have already committed to supporting it .
Update 3 ( 8/6/2010 ) : Some of the best writing on this topic can be found on Diary Of An x264 Developer by Jason Garrett - Glaser ( aka Dark Shikari ) , especially this and this .
In short : he also anticipates the YouTube gambit ( “ Blitzkrieg ” ) , and would welcome a truly open , patent - free video format for the web to oust Flash , but points out many existing and potential problems with WebM / VP8 that may be its undoing , and does not see H.264 going away .
Wait and see , basically .
Update 4 ( 30/6/2010 ) : YouTube speaks : “ While HTML5 ’s video support enables us to bring most of the content and features of YouTube to computers and other devices that do n’t support Flash Player , it does not yet meet all of our needs .
Today , Adobe Flash provides the best platform for YouTube ’s video distribution requirements , which is why our primary video player is built with it . ”
So , not soon , anyway .
I ’d like to make a prediction .
I ’m probably not the first to make it , and I may be utterly wrong , but just in case I prove to be right , I ’d like to have it on record .

I believe Google is planning to kill off Internet Explorer , within the next two years , and I think they can succeed .
By “ kill off ” I mean turn it from the majority browser into a niche browser ( < 20 % for all versions combined . )
I believe the strategy relies on Chrome Frame , YouTube , and HTML5 video using the VP8 format .
The game plan
Step 1 .
It is rumoured Google will soon open - source the VP8 video compression format by On2 Technologies , whom they bought earlier this year .
They ’ll do so in the hope that it would become the default video format on the web , over Theora ( open but technically inferior ) and H.264 ( superior but patent - encumbered ) .
If they did so , Mozilla , Webkit and Opera browsers , with their fierce competition and fast update cycles , will likely hedge their bets and quickly add support for VP8 , in addition to the formats they already support .
Step 2 .
Google will transcode all videos on YouTube to VP8 format , and serve this as the default to capable browsers .
Converting such a vast amount of video is a monumental task , but Google has the resources to do it .
Step 3 .
Once the release versions of all the major non-IE browsers are capable of displaying VP8 HTML5 video without a hitch2 , Google will make its final move .
Notices will appear on YouTube that they will soon turn off support for Flash , and serve all video as VP8 only .
If you use Firefox , Safari or Chrome , you wo n’t notice a difference .
But if you ’re using Internet Explorer , not to worry : all you need to do is install a simple plugin : Chrome Frame .
Chrome Frame effectively turns Internet Explorer into Chrome .
It still looks like you ’re running IE , but the rendering engine has been replaced by Google ’s .
( Only on request , though : web authors have to explicitly ask for Chrome Frame to be used if available .
The rest of the time IE remains unchanged . )
YouTube is Special
YouTube is unique on the web in that pretty much everyone uses it : it is the third most visited site after Google and Yahoo .
I would wager that , within a month , some 80 % of web users will have visited YouTube , and the vast majority of Internet Explorer users will have installed the plugin they need to continue getting their funny cat fix .
Where else would they go ?
Sure , there are other video sites out there , but none truly compete with YouTube , in terms of volume of content , or audience size .
At the same time , very few people would be able to lambast Google for breaking something that harms their business or access to vital information .
Very few people need YouTube , and very few of those will be unable to install the plugin or switch to a different browser .
In a matter of months , the vast majority of IE users will either have switched to a different browser , or installed Chrome Frame , effectively turning it ( on demand ) into Chrome .
IE ’s market share ( if you look at the actual rendering engine ) will collapse from 55 % today3 to under 20 % ( and hopefully much lower ) .
This will reveal Google ’s acquisitions of YouTube , On2 , and their development of their own Chrome browser , merely as components in a masterpiece of long - game strategy .
Without every one of these components , each monumental and expensive in themselves , the strategy could n’t succeed .
Nobody but Google could ’ve done it .
The result
And what a future this will win for the web .
Look at this demonstration of the capabilities of HTML5 and CSS3 , and imagine a world in which every new website can use every part of it .
This could be seen as a massive upgrade for the internet .
Imagine not needing to support outdated versions of IE anymore .
Only if you had to support a significant customer base locked in by IT policy , a rapidly - dwindling segment , would you still need to support IE .
How will this affect other players ?
It will be a mortal blow against Adobe , with Flash rapidly losing its hold over internet video over the ensuing months .
This would suit Apple fine , who are already doing their best to keep Flash off Apple hardware .
( They ’re currently putting their weight behind H.264 , but that ’s simply the best option at the moment . )
The Flash plugin will likely remain ubiquitous for a while still , but will be increasingly marginalised , and find its place usurped by JavaScript , Canvas and SVG as support for these open technologies become near - universal .
Microsoft can only respond by getting IE users to upgrade to the latest versions as quickly as possible , and add support for VP8 video .
This will suit Google and the web just fine , since IE9 promises to be on par with the competition in its support for modern web technologies .
But they will no longer be able to act with the hubris of majority market share , and will be forced into a position of playing catch - up to faster - evolving browsers .
For Google , of course , this is essential for its vision of the browser as operating system4 .

MONTREAL–Bill Gates 's charitable foundation has snuffed out a $ 5.2 million grant to a Canadian initiative to curb smoking in Africa , citing troubling federal links to the tobacco industry .
It nixed the federal project after learning a key player , Mulroney - era cabinet minister Barbara McDougall , had been on the board of directors at Imperial Tobacco Canada .
McDougall has been chair of the federal International Development Research Centre since 2007 , and until a few weeks ago , was also on the board at Imperial .
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said in a news release it 's disappointed by what it calls an unacceptable conflict of interest .
The African Tobacco Control Alliance , a key Canadian partner in the two - year Research for International Tobacco Control project , joined the U.S. billionaire 's organization in cutting ties with the project .
The alliance has pulled out of a pan-African conference it was to co-host with IDRC at the end of the month in Dakar , Senegal .
McDougall 's position at Imperial Tobacco raised fears of industry influence in Africa , a region seen as a growing market for tobacco firms , the head of the alliance said .
" This is a clear conflict of interest , " said the alliance 's chair , Rachel Kitnyo .
Physicians for a Smoke - Free Canada condemned McDougall 's continued ties , even if only informal , to the tobacco industry .

THE US navy approved designs last week for a shipboard laser that it hopes will focus a 100 - kilowatt beam through the ocean mist .
The system will be based on the free - electron laser , invented in the 1970s by John Madey , which generates light from a powerful beam of electrons .
A big attraction of the free - electron laser is the ability to adjust its output wavelength to improve transmission through the thick , moist air at sea , says Mike Rinn of Boeing , which produced the initial designs .
Other laser weapons emit at fixed wavelengths .
Also , the laser is electrically powered , so it can …

William Cohan explains how the banks have been making such extraordinary money after the crash :
The benefits for Wall Street started with the extensive de-leveraging that continues the world over in the wake of the financial crisis ( it caused ) by helping companies raise new equity and refinance existing debt .
The Wall Street firms that survived the crisis reap billions of dollars in fees for this sort of work .
Mostly , though , Wall Street is making money by taking advantage of its rock - bottom cost of capital , provided courtesy of the Federal Reserve — now that the big Wall Street firms are all bank holding companies — and then turning around and lending it at much higher rates .
The easiest and most profitable risk - adjusted trade available for the banks is to borrow billions from the Fed — at a cost of around half a percentage point — and then to lend the money back to the U.S.
Treasury at yields of around 3 percent , or higher , a moment later .
The imbedded profit — of some 2.5 percentage points — is an outright and ongoing gift from American taxpayers to Wall Street .
You ’re welcome .

THE NATIONAL
Museum is to investigate what might be the discovery of an ancient dug - out canoe by the same man who found a similar boat less than a kilometre away more than 40 years ago .
Arklow mayor Peter Dempsey said he could n't believe his eyes when he spotted what appeared to be the remnants of a dug - out canoe embedded in the bank of the Avoca river in Arklow town .
He made a similar find as a teenager in 1966 when he and a friend found what looked like a hand - made punt fashioned out of a tree near the famous 19 Arches Bridge in the Co Wicklow town .
They hoisted the boat out of the river and transported it on a bicycle back home .
They then contacted the National Museum which confirmed it was an ancient dug - out canoe dating back to somewhere between the Neolithic and Medieval period .
The canoe was photographed and archived but there was no way to preserve it then so it was left to rot in a spare room at his friend 's house .
But after he spotted what looked like the same type of boat while out feeding the ducks along the riverbank , Mr Dempsey said he was n't going to take any chances this time around .
He has kept it wet under a tarpaulin to preserve it while he awaits a visit from a museum archeologist next week .
He believes the boat was dislodged from its watery grave where it has rested for hundreds , if not thousands . of years .
" Two local historians have seen it and are convinced it 's the bee 's knees , " he told the Irish Independent yesterday .

Eight eyes are typically placed in two rows , on the front of the carapace .
The AME or direct eyes , differ markedly in structure from the other indirect eyes ( ALE , PLE , PME ) .
The direct eyes appear dark , whereas the indirect eyes usually have a layer of light reflecting crystals , the tapetum , behind the light sensitive retina , giving these eyes a silvery appearance .
The tapetum increases visual sensitivity because light entering the light sensitive retinal cells is immediately reflected back through them , so intensifying the image .
These indirect eyes are adapted for seeing at low light intensities and their lenses are often enlarged in spiders with good vision .
Spider eye lenses are better than photographic lenses in terms of their image brightness ( very low F - numbers ) .
However , because most spider eye retinas have relatively coarse - grained mosaics of receptor cells , their resolution of these images is much poorer than in the human eye .
Reflector eyes
Most wolf spiders ( Lycosidae ) hunt in the dimmer light of dusk and moonlight .
Their four large posterior eyes have well - developed tapeta which help them spot prey movement in such low light conditions .
At night , wolf spiders can be easily spotted because the tapeta in their large eyes shine brightly in torchlight .
Search - light eyes
Net - casting spiders ( Deinopidae ) have eight eyes , but in one genus , Deinopis , two of the rear eyes ( PME ) are enormously enlarged .
Their great , curved lenses face forward like twin search - lights , giving the spiders a rather menacing appearance ( the ' ogre - faced spiders ' ) .
The two biggest eyes are specialised for providing outstanding low - light night vision .
They have enormous lenses that give a wide field of view and gather available light very efficiently .
The lenses have an F number of 0.58 which means they can concentrate available light more efficiently than a cat ( F 0.9 ) or an owl ( F 1.1 ) .
Each night a large area of light sensitive membrane is manufactured within these eyes ( and rapidly destroyed again at dawn ) .
This remarkable combination of large , powerful lenses and the nightly production of new light - sensitive membrane , enables net - casting spiders to accurately track and ' net ' their prey at night .
Interestingly , they do this without the help of a tapetum , the reflecting layer present in other spiders with highly sensitive indirect eyes .
White faecal spots on a leaf below the net are aiming points placed there by the spider .
j Query is not always as it appears .
There 's a lot of cool stuff going on under the surface , and there are many methods just waiting to be discovered , and many potential usages of jQuery 's API that you may not have considered before .
In this article I 'll be taking you through a few of the not - so - obvious things I 've discovered about jQuery .
1. Understand jQuery !
When you call ' j Query ' what happens ?
The jQuery function itself is very simple :
Under its skin , the jQuery function ( commonly referred to as the " wrapper " function ) simply returns an instantiated jQuery object -- i.e. an instance of the ' jQuery.fn.init ' constructor .
This is useful to know ; with this information we know that each time we call ' j Query ' we 're actually creating a totally unique object with a set of properties .
jQuery is clever in that it gives you an object that can be treated as an array .
Each of your elements ( all together , commonly known as the " collection " ) is referenced within the object under a numerical index , just like within an array .
And jQuery also gives this object a ' length ' property , just as you would expect from an array .
This opens up a world of possibilities .
For one , it means that we can borrow some functionality from ' Array.prototype ' .
j Query 's ' slice ' method is a good example of this -- modified from the source :
The native ' slice ' method does n't care that ' this ' is not a real array -- it 'll be fine with anything that 's got a ' length ' property and [ 0 ] , [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] etc .
There are some other interesting properties within this jQuery object -- '. selector ' and '.context ' will , most of the time , reflect the arguments that you pass into ' j Query ( ... ) '.
One thing that 's important to note is that jQuery will sometimes give you new jQuery objects to work with .
If you run a method that changes the collection in some way , such as '.parents ( ) ' , then jQuery wo n't modify the current object ; it 'll simply pass you a brand new one :
All methods that appear to mutate the collection in some way return a brand new jQuery object -- you can still access the old object though , via '.end ( ) ' , or more verbosely , via '.prevObject ' .
2. Bread - and - butter Element Creation
Central to jQuery 's DOM capabilities , is its element creation syntax .
1.4 brought with it an entirely new way to create your elements quickly and succinctly .
E.g .
As of 1.4 you can pass a second argument to the jQuery function when you 're creating an element -- the object you pass will , for the most part , act as if you were passing it to '.attr ( ... ) '.
However , jQuery will map some of the properties to its own methods , for example , the ' click ' property maps to jQuery 's ' click ' method ( which binds an event handler for the ' click ' event ) and ' css ' maps to jQuery 's ' css ' method etc .
To check out what properties map to jQuery 's methods , open your console and type ' jQuery.attrFn ' .
3. Serialize your Inputs
j Query provides a method that you can use to serialize all of the inputs within one or more forms .
This is useful when submitting data via XHR ( " Ajax " ) .
It 's been in jQuery for a long time but it's not often talked about and so many developers do n't realise it 's there .
Submitting an entire form via Ajax , using jQuery , could n't be simpler :
j Query also provides the ' serializeArray ' method , which is designed to be used with multiple forms , and the ' param ' helper function ( under the jQuery namespace ) which takes a regular object and returns a query string , e.g .
4. Animate Anything
j Query 's ' animate ' method is probably the most flexible of jQuery 's methods .
It can be used to animate pretty much anything , not just CSS properties , and not just DOM elements .
This is how you would normally use ' animate ' :
When you specify a property to animate ( e.g. ' top ' ) jQuery checks to see if you 're animating something with a style property ( ' element.style ' ) , and it checks if the specified property ( ' top ' ) is defined under ' style ' -- if it 's not then jQuery simply updates ' top ' on the element itself .
Here 's an example :
' top ' is a valid CSS property , so jQuery will update ' element.style.top ' , but ' foo ' is not a valid CSS property , so jQuery will simply update ' element.foo ' .
We can use this to our advantage .
Let 's say , for example , that you want to animate a square on a canvas .
First let 's define a simple constructor and a ' draw ' method that 'll be called on every step of the animation :
We 've created our ' Square ' constructor , and one of its methods .
Creating a canvas and then animating it could n't be simpler :
This is a very simple effect , but it does clearly demonstrate the possibilities .
You can see it in action here : http://jsbin.com/ocida
( this will only work in browsers that support the HTML5 canvas )
5. jQuery.ajax Returns the XHR Object
jQuery 's Ajax utility functions ( ' jQuery.ajax ' , ' jQuery.get ' , ' jQuery.post ' ) all return an ' XMLHttpRequest ' object which you can use to perform subsequent operations on any request .
For example :
Here we 're making a request whenever the ' makeRequest ' button is clicked -- and we 're cancelling the active request if the user clicks the ' cancelRequest ' button .
Another potential usage is for synchronous requests :
Read more about the ' XMLHttpRequest ' object and also be sure to check out jQuery 's Ajax utilities .
6. Custom Queues
j Query has a built - in queuing mechanism that 's used by all of its animation methods ( all of which use ' animate ( ) ' really ) .
This queuing can be illustrated easily with a simple animation :
Quickly hovering over a bunch of anchors and then hovering over them again will cause the animations to queue up and occur one at a time -- I 'm sure many of you have witnessed this queuing effect before .
If not , check it out here : http://jsbin.com/aqaku
The ' queue ' method is similar to the well - known ' each ' method in how it 's called .
You pass a function , which will eventually be called for each of the elements in the collection :
Passing just a function to ' queue ' will cause that function to be added to the default ' fx ' queue , i.e. the queue used by all animations done by jQuery .
Therefore , this function will not be called until all current animations occurring on each element in the collection ( in this case , all anchors ) have completed .
Notice that we 're adding a class of ' all - done ' in the function above .
As outlined , this class will only be added when all current animations are complete .
We 're also calling the ' dequeue ' method .
This is very important , as it will allow jQuery to continue with the queue ( i.e. it lets jQuery know that you 're finished with whatever you 're doing ) .
j Query 1.4 provides another way of continuing the queue ; instead of calling ' dequeue ' , simply call the first argument passed to your function :
This does exactly the same , although it 's slightly more useful in that it can be called anywhere within your function , even within a mess of closures ( that typically destroy the ' this ' keyword ) .
Of course , pre-jQuery - 1.4 you could just save a reference to ' this ' , but that would get a bit tiresome .
To add a function to a custom queue , simply pass your custom queue 's name as the first argument and the function as the second :
Notice that , since we 're not using the default ' fx ' queue , we also have to pass our queue 's name to the ' dequeue ' method , in order to allow jQuery to continue with our custom queue .
Read more about ' queue ' , ' dequeue ' and ' jQuery.queue ' .
7. Event Namespacing
j Query provides a way for you to namespace events , which can be very useful when authoring plugins and third - party components .
If needed , the user of your plugin can effectively disable your plugin by unbinding all event handlers that it 's registered .
To add a namespace when registering an event handler , simply suffix the event name with a period and then your unique namespace ( e.g. '. fooPlugin ' ) :
Passing just the namespace to ' unbind ' will unbind all event handlers with that namespace .
Conclusion
So which ones did I miss ?
Any helpful features that you feel jQuery does n't document well enough ?
Let 's discuss in the comments !
They 're missing 2 key points . :
1 , they 're directly comparing a single song sale / download to an album sale / download .
It takes an artist and producer roughly 12 x longer to produce an entire album .
So of course they have to sell more singles to make the same amount of money as the album , but on the other hand , the single is more profitable when you factor in the amount of work that went into ONE song as opposed to 12 songs .
2 , You can't compare music SALES to streaming music .
I buy a CD or MP3 once ... that is , if you 're lucky enough for me to happen to see it , search it , or pick it up PLUS wanting to make the purchase .
Streaming music is profit per listen .
If I buy an MP3 once and listen to it 500 times , you make 99 c .
If I stream it 500 times , you get paid 500 times , that works out to $ 1.10 on Rhapsody .
In addition , most music streaming is random , like the radio .
I listen to NEW music every day , I listen to MORE music every day , stuff I would 've never heard before , stuff I would 've never even thought to purchase , and here 's the kicker , if I like it enough , I 'm just likely enough to STILL make a purchase , because Streaming is n't always available on my MP3 player .
Imagine this scenario :
Your 15 - year old daughter is running through the park when she 's overpowered , yanked into the bushes and forcibly raped at knifepoint .
She escapes with cuts , bruises , and a nasty case of PTSD , but being a good parent , you have the rape kit done , police report filed , and then take her home and set up the appointments to deal with the aftermath .
A few weeks later , she misses her period and has a positive pregnancy test .
There 's no doubt in her mind or yours that an abortion is the only option that makes sense .
You schedule the appointment , and take her in for the procedure .
She changes into the thin paper gown , the doctor comes in for a moment , and tells her to relax , it 'll just be a moment for the ultrasound tech to come in for the required transvaginal ultrasound .
Say what ?
It 's a D&C , not a well mother checkup .
What the hell is going on here ?
Oh , wait .
I forgot to add this part :
You live in Oklahoma , and in Oklahoma , some of the most misogynistic , mean - spirited , man - birthed abortion laws have just been passed by the Oklahoma State Senate .
The Oklahoma Senate approved several bills Monday that opponents say would make it more difficult or uncomfortable for women to get abortions , including one that would require women seeking the procedures early in their pregnancies to undergo an invasive form of ultrasound .
The five bills , some of which will go to Gov. Brad Henry for consideration and others which will return to the House , were overwhelmingly approved by the Republican - controlled Senate .
If given final approval , the bills would give Oklahoma some of the most restrictive laws of any state , an abortion rights group says .
One of the laws headed to the governor would require doctors to use a vaginal probe in cases where it would provide a clearer picture of the fetus than a regular ultrasound .
Doctors have said this is usually the case early in pregnancies , when most abortions are done .
We just had a 15 - month debate about health care reform .
Part of that debate was all about letting doctors be doctors because we all know that a government takeover of health care is a BAD BAD THING .
In fact , it was US Senator Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) who argued longest and hardest about how terrible it would be to have government " get between you and your doctor " , right ?
In the land of tea and whine - fests where conservatives live , it 's only a bad thing when Democrats think of it .
When Republicans decide that a more - expensive , invasive vaginal probe is something that will " provide as much information as possible " before they have the procedure , costs be damned .
I wo n't even address the sinister psychology of their stupid law .
They 'd spend a zillion dollars to marginalize women and prevent one abortion even if the kid starved in the street afterward , because Lord knows they hate entitlements of all kinds , especially in Oklahoma , where 20 % of kids live in poverty .
But wait , there 's more :
The other abortion measures would require women to complete a lengthy questionnaire before receiving an abortion , mandate certain signs be posted in an abortion clinics and prevent so - called " wrongful - life " lawsuits in cases where a parent might argue that a child with birth defects or other problems would have been better off aborted .
Another bill would prohibit state insurance exchanges , created under the new federal health care law , from covering abortions .
And still more :
Another bill would require a woman seeking an abortion and her doctor to complete a 38 - question form that asks , among other things , the woman 's age , race , education , number of previous pregnancies and reason for seeking an abortion .
So , in Oklahoma , an old geezer with 18 kids and three wives can roll into the doctor 's office and get a Viagra prescription , but a woman who has been raped or abused , or who has just exercised her Constitutional right to choice under the laws of this nation cannot receive medical treatment without a 38 - question form invading her privacy , humiliation and judgment in the form of " mandatory signs " , and an expensive vaginal probe ?
Alrighty then .
Got it .
My advice would be to get the hell out of Oklahoma and do n't look back if it were my daughter .
That , and start making contributions to organizations like NARAL who will stand and fight in court to turn these idiotic , hateful laws back for good .
Oklahoma , Utah , Kansas , and other states contemplating laws that clearly discriminate against women know they discriminate .
They want them to be challenged and they want a chance to re-litigate Roe v.
Wade in the hopes of overturning it altogether with a Supreme Court more ... conservative .
I hope President Obama chooses his Supreme Court nominee with these battles in mind .
It 's clear they 're throwing whatever they can at the wall to see what sticks .
Let 's hope none of it does .
A breathless warning about endangered Christian missionaries and churches in India has been circulating on the Internet since late February 2010 :
Urgent prayer request !
Please pray for all the churches in India .
Buddhist extremists in India burned down 20 churches last night .
Tonight they plan to destroy 200 churches in the province of Olisabang .
They plan to kill 200 missionaries within 24 hours .
Right now all Christians are hiding in small villages .
Please pray for them and send this mail to Christians you know worldwide .
Please ask God to have mercy on our brothers and sisters in India .
Please pray for them and commit this matter to our Almighty and Victorious Lord .
Those of the faithful concerned for their overseas brethren should breathe a bit more easily : this particular tale is a hoax .
It ’s several years old now , and even at the time it was current there were no reports out of India of Buddhist extremists on the rampage with twenty Christian churches left burning in their wake .
Christians living in India who were asked about this rumor were non-plussed , as they certainly had n’t taken to hiding in small villages out of fear of marauding Buddhists .
Rev. Samuel Stephens of the India Gospel League ( IGL ) attested that this message was false , writing that :
If this were true , I would have been one among the first few to receive such information because of the presence of our extensive network of pastors and church planters spread over a good part of the country .
I am led to believe that this message is a deliberate , planned and mischievous attempt by Hindu extremists to damage the good relationship between Buddhists and Christians .
It is intentionally sent out to create animosity between these two groups .
As for the rest of this tale , as far as we can tell no place on Earth ( let alone just India ) is named Olisabang , as a city , province , territory , or anything else .
Also , the Republic of India is composed of 28 states and 7 union territories — it does n’t have provinces .
Buddhist extremist groups are prevalent in Sri Lanka , but not India .
There are few Buddhists in India , almost too few to count , which should immediately make any tale about Buddhists on the warpath in India suspect .
Approximately 80.5 % of India ’s population is Hindu , 13.4 % Muslim , 2.3 % Christian , and 1.9 % Sikh .
Violent attacks on Christians occurred in India around the time of this warning , but they were carried out by Hindu extremists in 2008 in the Indian state of Orissa .
Many Christian families in that area were forced to abandon their faith in exchange for their safety .
Churches and houses were burned , and at least thirty Christians lost their lives .
The 2008 wave of violence was touched off by the killing of a charismatic Hindu preacher known as Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati .
Although police blamed Maoist guerrillas for the swami ’s killing , Hindu radicals held Christians responsible for his death .
Are social networking sites such as Facebook , handheld devices including iPhones & Blackberries , online shopping , and blogs changes for the better ?
According to Pew , answers depend on age and education .
For example , they report :
The age gap in attitudes toward these devices is particularly wide : 72 % of those under age 30 consider handheld wireless devices to be a positive change , compared with just 33 % of those ages 65 and older .
They summarize their results about these quetions in the following table :

" I did n't really have the time to establish any rapport with the dog , " Mr St Georges told reporters after being released from County USC medical centre .
" He 's cold , he 's wet , he 's scared , and then here 's this stranger jumping on his back for all intents and purposes , and he did what dogs do . "
The sentiment from the Lightning faithful regarding Martin St. Louis ( our pick for team MVP , and echoed by the St. Pete Times this morning ) is that he is more important to the team than Vincent Lecavalier .
He 's the heart and the soul of the club .
With one year left on his contract , he needs to be re-signed and the forgone conclusion is that it 'll happen .
... but what if Marty does n't like what he sees after this off - season ?
The Lightning went into the tank three years ago .
The team has been gutted , rebuilt , mixed up , retooled ...
And the losing has remained the same , the constant , the status - quo .
Martin St. Louis , like many fans , has grown tired of this .
Though I would not be surprised if a " clarification " comes out about what he really meant by this , it 's hard to ignore the understandable impatience expressed to reporters :
" I want to be on a winning team , " he said .
" It 's three years of this and ( we 're going ) back to square one , so I want to be on a winning team .
That 's the biggest thing .
I 'm not getting any younger .
We 'll see how it all shakes out this summer . "
As his 35th birthday looms on the horizon , the reality that his playing career will not go on forever is impossible to ignore .
Hockey has a long history of storied players being dealt from the franchise they made a name / career with , for a last shot at the glory of hoisting Lord Stanley 's cup .
Marty may not be at his complete end ( a la Ray Bourque , traded from the Bruins to the Colorado Avalanche for the final 2 seasons of his career ) , but as 2009 - 10 marked his 12th professional season ...
It 's not hard to realize the end of St. Louis ' career is much closer than the beginning .
And what looms for the Lightning is as big a change as the franchise has ever had in a single off - season .
To reconstruct the brain - trust and the direction of the club -- off ice and in the locker room -- before camp opens in September .
Deposed Lightning GM Brian Lawton gave a memorable quote in October 2009 regarding Marty 's future ( emphasis added by me ) :
" I think he 's easily got another four good seasons in him .
I get calls about him more than any other player we 've got .
People think we 've got ( Steven ) Stamkos and maybe we 're looking to go younger , but as far as I 'm concerned , Marty will finish his career in Tampa Bay .
He will be here as long as I 'm here .
Heck , he 'll probably be here after I 'm gone . "
How the Bolts retool this off - season - the GM , the coach , and on the roster - will decide if Marty proves Lawton correct in suggesting that St. Louis would finish his career in Tampa .
The Bolts rebooting , again , for the third straight off - season is frustrating .
For the dynamo that makes this team go , another long - term rebuilding process likely will not cut it .
Bill Hader reprised his role as James Carville on Saturday Night Live‘s “ Weekend Update ” segment Saturday .
SNL ’s crazy Carville poked fun at Tea Partiers who are upset at President Barack Obama for saying they should be thankful for lowered taxes .
“ The whole thing just goes to show ya , crazy people do n’t like to be teased , ” Carville said .
“ They got no sense of humor .
You ’re never gonna see a Comedy Central roast of Charlie Manson , you know , he would n’t get it .
I know I look like a cajun Gollum and I know I scare babies , but I can laugh about it , you know . ”

Carville dismissed reports that Tea Party people are serious , relevant political players .
“ The point is , Tea Party people , you ca n’t dress how you dress and not expect jokes , ” he said .
“ Tell me something , which founding father wore a tri-corner hat with an Orlando Magic jersey ? ”
He also mocked the notion that Tea Party activists are highly educated .
“ Do they just get on the phone and say we ’re having a rally in 90 seconds , bring a sign !
I do n’t believe these people are the cream of the crop .
They ’re more like the water on top of the yogurt .
You know , when you open a yogurt and there ’s a foggy water there and you ’re like come on !
Yogurt , be cool . ”

Just days after Alex Knepper 's date rape column , an Indiana University senior has caused a similar stir with his system for " rating girls " from " knockout " down to " turns off even the drunkest of males . "
Yale Reardon's " Rating Girls " ran yesterday in the Indiana University Odyssey , a newspaper devoted to Greek life on campus .
Unlike Knepper 's column , which the American University Eagle left up on its website even as physical copies of the newspaper were removed from their stands by protesters , Reardon 's effort has been taken off the Odyssey 's site .
Luckily , there 's a cached version , from which we 'll quote liberally .
Reardon begins :
Men have been using the trusty 1 - 10 rating system to rate girls for what seems like centuries .
Obviously a 10 is a knockout , and a 1 is something that should show up on the Discovery Channel .
It 's as universal as the 4.0 GPA scale or the dewy decimal system .
One of my favorite things to do with my friends is to argue about what number a girl is .
Advertisement
Clearly Reardon needs to repeat Library Science ( that 's Dewey Decimal System ) , and perhaps Human Decency 101 .
Observe his numerical scale in action :
1 . This is as bad as it gets .
Lucky enough these girls hardly ever go out in public or would n't dare come to a state school like Indiana .
They usually have 2 - 3 horrible features .
This could be extreme obesity , a face that looks like it was hit with a frying pan , or a missing limb .
They will likely remain widows or work in jobs where they can be hidden in the back .
Advertisement
Reardon also does n't seem to understand what the word " widow " means , unless there 's some weirdly high percentage of bereavement at IU that I do n't know about .
Here 's what he has to say on " twos " and " threes " :
2 . A two is not much better than a one .
She is god awful ugly as well .
No matter how many drinks you have , she wo n't look hotter or thinner .
All of her friends are busted as well .
Thankfully a two does not have any confidence either so spotting them out is rare .
3 . A three is the first girl that might get a little action from time to time .
Granted the guy who falls for her will be wasted beyond belief .
There is a chance she might have a good sense of humor but that will be as good as it gets .
She is a prime candidate for extreme plastic surgery .
Usually a three has just one feature ( giant nose , freakishly tall , big belly , or no butt ) that turns off even the drunkest of males .
Who am I kidding they are ugly as hell to .
Advertisement
The sin of a " four " is " She will chase guys so far out of her league its not even funny . "
But it 's when Reardon gets to five that he reveals his true rationale for hooking up with women in the first place : impressing bros .
He writes ,
5 . This is the first girl on the list that can be acceptable to bring around your friends from time to time .
If you bring any of the previous four girls back , good look not getting ripped on for at least a month . [...]
This is the kind of girl that after a guy gets with , he will describe her as " honestly she was n't that bad " .
Shut up bro , she was ugly and you can't lie to yourself anymore .
Advertisement
And on " sevens " :
A seven is usually the coolest of the girls , but there is just something not right with her .
It 's hard to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with a seven , but you know it 's there .
If your boys never give you props for being with her , but never diss you for being with her , you got yourself a seven .
Advertisement
And here 's how you spot a " ten " :
If a girl walks into a room and you immediately tell all your friends to check her out , you are lucky .
You are in presence of one of the rarest sights on earth .
A perfect 10 .

I 'd actually like to thank Mr. Reardon for helping me put my finger on what 's so upsetting about the whole practice of numerically rating women — which , it 's true , long preceded his tenure as an IU provocateur .
" Rating girls " is a group activity , something men ( or , perhaps , boys ) " argue about with their friends . "
As such , it 's not about actual attraction , which is profoundly individual and idiosyncratic .
Instead , it 's about whether a girl would increase a guy 's status — whether she conforms to whatever standards are necessary to generate props from the bros .
And the thought of one 's sex appeal being measured by the clumsy high - fives of dudes still a little drunk from the night before is both depressing and profoundly un -hot .
Of course " depressing and profoundly un - hot " pretty much describes Reardon 's view of the IU dating / hookup scene , as set forth in the columns that remain on the Odyssey site .
His " preparation " for a night on the town sounds super - romantic :
Before you head out you need to send a ton of texts .
If you are smart you should have at least two to three girls lined up before you make it out .
Make sure to text these girls something along the lines of " Cya at Sports tonight " or " Save a dance for me " .
Girls eat these lines up and will not be able to stop thinking about you after they get one of these texts .
If you are in a relationship , dump your girlfriend now .

And who could resist him after his description of " The Ten People You See at the Btown Bars ? "
Example :
The fat dude :
He never ever leaves the bar .
His friends love him and they love bragging how much he can drink .
He rips on girls all night and loves talking shit .
Probably by the end of the night he will try to creep on a girl , get rejected , and get tossed from the bar .
He will then call Avers Pizza for a Big10 .
Sure he got shot down , but he 's got a delicious pizza and he can drink more than you .

We 're still waiting for word on the IU response to Reardon 's rating system , and the reasons for his column 's deletion from the Odyssey site .
For now , I 'd like to echo Anna Holmes 's reaction : " I 'm so glad I 'm not in college anymore . "

Something is profoundly wrong with the way we live today .
For thirty years we have made a virtue out of the pursuit of material self - interest : indeed , this very pursuit now constitutes whatever remains of our sense of collective purpose .
We know what things cost but have no idea what they are worth .
We no longer ask of a judicial ruling or a legislative act :
Is it good ?
Is it fair ?
Is it just ?
Is it right ?
Will it help bring about a better society or a better world ?
Those used to be the political questions , even if they invited no easy answers .
We must learn once again to pose them .
The materialistic and selfish quality of contemporary life is not inherent in the human condition .
Much of what appears “ natural ” today dates from the 1980s : the obsession with wealth creation , the cult of privatization and the private sector , the growing disparities of rich and poor .
And above all , the rhetoric that accompanies these : uncritical admiration for unfettered markets , disdain for the public sector , the delusion of endless growth .
We can not go on living like this .
The little crash of 2008 was a reminder that unregulated capitalism is its own worst enemy : sooner or later it must fall prey to its own excesses and turn again to the state for rescue .
But if we do no more than pick up the pieces and carry on as before , we can look forward to greater upheavals in years to come .
And yet we seem unable to conceive of alternatives .
This too is something new .
Until quite recently , public life in liberal societies was conducted in the shadow of a debate between defenders of “ capitalism ” and its critics : usually identified with one or another form of “ socialism . ”
By the 1970s this debate had lost much of its meaning for both sides ; all the same , the “ left–right ” distinction served a useful purpose .
It provided a peg on which to hang critical commentary about contemporary affairs .
On the left , Marxism was attractive to generations of young people if only because it offered a way to take one ’s distance from the status quo .
Much the same was true of classical conservatism : a well - grounded distaste for over - hasty change gave a home to those reluctant to abandon long - established routines .
Today , neither left nor right can find their footing .
For thirty years students have been complaining to me that “ it was easy for you ” : your generation had ideals and ideas , you believed in something , you were able to change things .
“ We ” ( the children of the Eighties , the Nineties , the “ Aughts ” ) have nothing .
In many respects my students are right .
It was easy for …

Hundreds of angry residents took to the streets against the killing of five civilians in a predawn US - led coalition operation in the central province of Logar on Friday .
But the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) called the dead militants , who were shot dead in a fierce gunbattle with the combined force .
Also , two US service members died of wounds suffered in the firefight .
Around 500 dwellers , chanting death to the US , blocked the Logar - Gardez highway to denounce the killings in the Kolengar neighbourhood on the outskirts of the provincial capital , Pul - i - Alam .

The protestors , shouting slogans against the Karzai government for failing to protect ordinary Afghans , torched a container carrying supplies for the coalition forces .
The driver , however , managed to escape .
The busy highway was blocked for an hour .
Before being dispersed as a result of fire in the air by security forces , the demonstrators asked journalists to convey their outrage to the government and the international community .
Student Din Muhammad , who participated in the protest , accused the American soldiers of killing innocents .
He warned the residents would rise against the foreign troops if the did not stop killing the defenceless masses .
Earlier in the day , the provincial police chief told Pajhwok Afghan News five men were killed and three others wounded , as the houses of Mullah Abdul Wali and Juma Khan were raided in the Qala - i- Ahangaran area of Kolengar .
Brig .
Gen. Ghulam Mustafa Mohseni said Wali and Khan were killed along with their three guests .
US forces told him after the operation the men , having links to the Taliban , had been involved in disruptive activities , including the placement of landmines .
The firefight was triggered by an Afghan - ISAF raid on a rebel compound in the Qala - i- Syedan area of Pul - i - Alam , the provincial capital , NATO said , adding intelligence indicated insurgent activity at the site .
" Two US service members subsequently died of their wounds suffered in this firefight .
No civilians were reported harmed in the operation , " the 44 - nation force said in a press statement .
But Col. Muhammad Jan Abid , crime branch chief at the police headquarters , said the soldiers conducted the crackdown without any coordination with them .
He added the American military suspected Wali alone of having ties to guerrillas .
A Taliban suicide attack commander , with ties to the Haqqani network , the third largest militant group in Afghanistan , was among the dead , the ISAF statement added .
A search of the compound led to the recovery of multiple automatic rifles , armour - piercing rounds , explosive materials and blasting caps .
A relative of the victims , Shah Wali , denied the foreign troops were fired on from the houses .
The 40 - year - old said two of the dead had shops in a local market .
Tribal elder Syed Bilal said the soldiers ringed the town throughout the night and blasted their way into the houses at the break of dawn .
A Taliban spokesman , meanwhile , told Pajhwok over the telephone the victims had no links to the rebel movement .
They were residents of the village , Zabihullah Mujahid said , contradicting the US claim .

ADRIAN WYLD / THE CANADIAN PRESS NDP MP Judy Wasylycia - Leis gestures as she speaks with media outside the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa , Tuesday April 27 , 2010 .
Wasylycia - Leis announced today that she is leaving federal politics and will be resigning the seat she has held for Winnipeg North since 1997 .
OTTAWA - Winnipeg North MP Judy Wasylycia - Leis delivered her farewell speech to the House of Commons this afternoon .
Wasylycia - Leis , 58 , will resign her seat Saturday , ending a nearly 13 - year career in Parliament as an MP .
She is widely expected to announce next week she is running for mayor in Winnipeg though she has not confirmed that and says she has to consult with her family and friends before making a final decision .
" This is not an easy day , " she said opening the seven - minute speech .
The speech was a mixture of self - deprecation , gratitude and humour , including a note that her parents always called her the perfect child until she learned how to talk , and that she was leaving Parliament just when her party might be in a " three - way race " .
A recent poll had the NDP at 20 , to the Liberals 27 and Conservatives 29 .
It was the tightest three - way showing of the three parties most can remember .
MPs from all party ’s paid tribute to Wasylycia - Leis including Conservative Merv Tweed who pointed out Wasylycia - Leis was the first and only graduate of the Parliamentary internship program who was elected as an MP and noted her " contagious laugh " and " generosity . "
Liberal Anita Neville called Wasylycia - Leis " strong and feisty " and a " vigorous defender " of Canada ’s public health care system .
NDP Leader Jack Layton said Wasylycia - Leis was instrumental in bringing more women into the NDP fold including as candidates and elected MPs .
" There is no question we are going to miss her in so many ways , " he said .
Just a morning 's boat ride from the tip of Florida is a place where medical costs are low and doctors plentiful .
It 's Cuba , and Stanford University physician Paul Drain says it 's time for the United States to pay attention to our neighbor 's shoestring success .
Despite a 50 - year trade embargo by the United States and a post - Soviet collapse in international support , the impoverished nation has developed a world - class health care system .
Average life expectancy is 77.5 years , compared to 78.1 years in the United States , and infant and child mortality rates match or beat our own .
There 's one doctor for every 170 people , more than twice the per-capita U.S. average .
Not everything is perfect in Cuba .
There are shortages of medicines , and the best care is reserved for elites .
But it 's still a powerful feat .
" In Cuba , a little over $ 300 per person is spent on health care each year .
In the U.S. , we 're spending over $ 7,000 per person , " said Drain , co-author of Caring for the World and an essay published April 29 in Science .
" They 're able to achieve great health outcomes on a modest budget . "
With Fidel Castro's reign as Cuba 's leader ending two years ago , relations with the United States have thawed .
President Obama eased restrictions on travel to Cuba last year , and the oft - introduced Free Trade With Cuba Act finally has a chance of passing Congress .
Drain would like the Institutes of Medicine to conduct a full study of the island nation 's success .
" There are so many lessons we might be able to learn from Cuba 's health care and medical education system , but we do n't know too much about it , " said Drain .
Wired.com : How does Cuba keep health care costs so low ?
Paul Drain : Partly by keeping physicians ' salaries low .
Obviously , given the government they have , they can do that .
But they also emphasize primary care and preventive care , addressing diseases and problems before they become major .
It 's a very different approach to health care .
In the United States , we essentially do the opposite .
We treat diseases when they occur .
We 're not very good at the preventive component , which causes the costs of our health system to be much higher .
Wired.com :
What are the origins of Cuba 's approach ?
Drain : Starting in 1964 , they encouraged all medical school graduates to do at least two years of service in a rural area .
That program became so popular that by the mid-1970s , almost all new physicians were doing rural service .
From there , almost all medical graduates were channeled into a three - year family medicine residency .
That 's where they do clinical training , making the transition to full doctor from medical student .
Almost all their residents do family medicine .
They focus on primary care for all ages .
Once everybody learns primary care , about 35 percent go on and specialize .
It 's quite the opposite of what we have here .
Wired.com : How so ?
Drain :
Our medical students choose what they want to do .
Only about 7 or 8 percent go into family medicine , which is our primary care system .
In Cuba , everyone becomes a primary care doctor .
They learn to prevent diseases .
Cuba also provides very good access .
In the mid-1980s , they created a system of neighborhood doctors ' clinics .
One doctor is responsible for a catchment area of a couple of city blocks .
They get to know their patients well .
If somebody has a problem , they can see the doctor in the clinic that day .
Wired.com : Could the U.S. government ever mandate a system like that ?
Drain :
It would be a big leap , but there are smaller steps that could be taken .
We 're the only developed country without universal access to a nationalized health care system .
Other countries have seen health care as a basic right and insured everybody .
Everyone gets primary care .
That would be a first step .
I saw someone in my clinic yesterday who had n't seen a doctor in 10 years .
Her blood pressure was through the roof , and it 's probably been like that for a decade .
She 's at tremendous risk for having a stroke or heart problems .
If she 'd seen somebody back when this started , it could have been controlled .
But because of her high blood pressure , who knows what her future medical bills will be like .
If she were in the Cuban system , she would have had a visit scheduled yearly for the last 10 years .
If she had n't shown up , someone would have gone to her home to see if she was OK .
Blood pressure is an easy thing to check .
It would have been controlled .
Wired.com :
One problem in the United States is the shortage of doctors .
How does Cuba train physicians ?
Drain : Education is paid by the government , so students do n't have debt .
In the United States , medical students come out $ 200,000 or $ 300,000 in the hole , which deters them from going into primary care .
Cuban doctors are making a fraction of what we make in the U.S. , but most Cubans are n't going into medicine to earn money .
They 're going into it to treat people in their communities .
In 1999 , Cuba created a school of medicine for Latin America .
They bring students in , train them for six years , give them room and board and a stipend .
Afterward the students are required to go home and practice in poorer communities .
It 's a remarkable program , with 10,000 students now from 33 countries , and an interesting model for developing health care workers .
Wired.com : Do President Obama 's health reforms move the United States toward what 's seen in Cuba ?
Drain :
What we 're passing is starting to move us in a better direction .
I 'm an advocate for universal health care , and there 's still a long way to go .
But I think we 'll eventually catch up to our western counterparts , and realize that we 're the only country not providing full equity in terms of accessing health care , and that 's reflected in health outcomes .
When you compare us against most developed countries , we 're near the bottom in most health indicators .
Our life expectancy is n't as good , our infant mortality rates are higher , and we 're spending twice as much money .

The most harsh rules in the US target workers without papers , which , opponents say , will lead to harassment
Pro-immigration groups across the US expressed despair today after Arizona passed the toughest bills in the country which they say are aimed at forcing out hundreds of thousands of Latinos living illegally in the state .
Arizona has long been a flashpoint in the debate over immigration , with tensions heightened by the murder last month of a popular rancher , Robert Krentz , in a remote spot used by groups smuggling people from Mexico to the US .
" The Mexico - Arizona border is out of control , " said the Arizona Cattlemen 's Association in a statement accompanying a report yesterday that claimed the impact of illegal immigration was so great the state could qualify for disaster relief .
The new bill , passed by the Arizona house of representatives last night , greatly expands the powers of the police in dealing with illegal immigration , including for the first time giving them the right to stop anyone on " reasonable suspicion " they may be an illegal immigrant and arrest them if they are not carrying identity papers .
All 35 Republicans in the Arizona house voted for the bill , while 21 Democrats voted against .
Pro-immigration groups said the laws are unconstitutional and promised to challenge them in court .
Their passage was accompanied by noisy demonstrations , for and against , outside the legislature .
Chris Newman , legal director of the National Day Labourer Organising Network , a union - backed organisation , said : " I think it is going to be a disaster .
It is the toughest immigration law the country has seen in a generation . "
He said he was troubled by the fact that a state was making decisions about a federal issue – especially a state with a poor record on civil rights .
" It is the Balkanisation of US immigration policy , " he said .
Immigration divides opinion in America , which has an estimated 12 - 20 million illegal immigrants , mostly Latinos .
Arizona has one of the biggest illegal immigrant populations , estimated at half a million .
The US economy is dependent on illegal immigrants to work in low - paid jobs , and law enforcement agencies in many parts of the country turn a blind eye to them .
The fear among law firms supporting illegal immigrants is that the new bill will lead to racial profiling , with its powers used to harass anyone who looks or sounds Latino .
At present , police are not allowed to ask anyone if they are an illegal immigrant , and can only raise this if investigating another crime .
Under the new laws , anyone the police suspects of being in the country illegally can be asked to produce an alien registration document , such as a green card , that allows non-citizens a right to work , and could face a $ 500 ( £ 320 ) fine if they fail to produce one .
This will be accompanied by a crackdown on employers who take on day labourers , who often stand at specific street corners in the hope of being offered work .
The new legislation makes it a crime to pick up someone if the driver " knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the alien is here illegally " .
Newman said that part of the legislation was the most obviously unconstitutional , denying a person freedom to seek work .
President Barack Obama , who on the campaign trail said it was not realistic to deport millions of illegal immigrants back to their own countries , has promised to introduce legislation to provide illegal immigrants with a route towards citizenship – though the timetable is slipping .
Now Arizona 's legislature has opted to take matters into its own hands .
The bill has a number of measures aimed at making life so difficult that Republican legislators hope it will deter illegal immigrants from either making the crossing across the Mexican border or , if they do , lead them to choose another state .
The bill still has to go back to the Arizona senate , but this is a formality .
It will then go to the Republican governor , Jan Brewer , to be signed into law .
The legislation is a problem for Arizona senator John McCain , who is fending off challenges from rightwingers as he seeks re-election in November .
McCain joined forces with the late Democratic senator Edward Kennedy to try to push through legislation to reform immigration laws .
The move , which eventually failed , was opposed by many Republicans .
Well I am always open to a conspiracy debate when one arises and today while discussing two topics , one did arise .
As many know there is a thread ( link below ) on ATS concerning the Wiki -Leaks video of the governments shooting of a journalist and it being covered up .
Wiki Leaks has announced that on April 5th they will reveal the video in question and TPTB have been harassing them since this announcement .
So with April 5th closing quickly what could come up to deflect the anticipation of this video ?
WELL , Friday NASA announces that one of their final Space Shuttle launches will be set for April 5th and they are OPENLY discussing seal / leak issues and other possibilities that could bring disaster to the shuttle .
A friend of mine who loves space , NASA , and all things skyward said its weird that NASA would so openly talk about the possibility of the shuttle being " in danger " .
Some articles have stated that NASA personnel have decided it is safe to launch on the 5th of April .
Here is where the " conspiracy " started creeping in .
Is NASA ( the government ) going to launch on the same day as a leaked video hoping to turn people 's attention away ?
Is the government willing to openly talk about another shuttle disaster and " plan one " to pull ALL attention away from this leaked video ?
We all know if the shuttle were to blow up again , EVERY major network would cover that tragedy for 2 - 3 - 4 days and focus on NOTHING else .... basically not giving Wiki - Leaks the exposure their hoping for .
So in the land of conspiracy , ATS , I am curious what you all think .
Could this truly be SOMETHING ... or simply just a coincidence and has no meret at all ???
No matter the outcome it made for a good conversation while BBQing the burgers and dogs ... EDIT TO ADD :
Here are the two related threads ... Wiki Leaks going to reveal secret video : NASA chooses April 5th as launch day and discusses launch problems : [ edit on 3/27/2010 by rcwj1975 ]

The Ecological Revolution : Making Peace with the Planet .
New York : Monthly Review Press , 2009 .
288 pp. $ 17.95 ( pb ) .
ISBN 9781583671795 .
This book is a major achievement .
It combines enormous breadth of scholarship with consummate theoretical integration to produce a powerful political argument .
It should be required reading for anyone who cares about the future of humanity and the planet — that is , everyone !
I do have some disagreements , but these take the form of an agenda for future dialogue rather than substantive criticisms .
The book consists largely of papers that have been published before , but revised substantially to make a coherent overall argument .
It is divided into three parts .
The first includes a series of chapters that draw on a range of sources , each pointing to the depth of our global ecological crisis , and the ( necessary ) failure of attempts to render the existing framework of globalizing capitalism sustainable .
Part two is ostensibly concerned with reviewing and demonstrating the explanatory power of Marx ’s historical materialism and his critical theory of capitalist production .
Central to this is the concept of socio-natural ‘ metabolism ’ , and the ‘ metabolic rift ’ engendered by capitalism ’s relentless drive to accumulate at the expense of the earth ’s life support systems .
The notion has its classic source in Marx ’s later concern with the consequences of capitalist agriculture and the urban / rural division for soil fertility .
However , as Foster and his associates , notably Paul Burkett , have shown us , the ecological concerns of Marx , Engels and their correspondents were much more diverse than this suggests .
The thesis here is that Marx and Engels had an ecological vision at the core of their analysis , and had already developed the concept of sustainable development as key to their conception of the socialist future .
One difficulty for this is that the historically dominant readings of Marx and Engels ( by sympathisers and opponents alike ) have been ‘ Promethean ’ , in the sense that they have been held to premise future human liberation on the ever - advancing human mastery of the forces of nature .
The environmental record of the state - centralist regimes that legitimated themselves by reference to the Marxian heritage was dire , but the European socialist and social democratic parties that originally grounded their political projects in Marxism also fought centrally for higher material living standards for organised labour on the basis of state support for economic growth — often at great environmental cost .
In much of the organised left until that last couple of decades talk of ecological issues was derided as a ‘ middle class diversion ’ .
Foster does not seek to deny this .
Instead he effectively re-writes the history of Marxian and socialist thought since Marx and Engels by bringing to prominence a subaltern tradition of ecologically radical socialist thought and action : early Russian pioneers of ecology and the attempts prior to the ascendancy of Stalin to put Soviet development on an ecological footing , the work of thinkers such a William Morris and Raymond Williams in Britain , and so on .
I think this is a very valuable exercise and essential to a renewal of green left politics .
However , the historical dominance of the ‘ Promethean ’ legacy does need to be addressed .
Partly this is because it stands as a deep obstacle to productive dialogue between greens and socialists , but partly , also , because it is a reasonable interpretation of much that Marx and Engels actually wrote .
Foster , for example , devotes some space to contesting my ‘ Promethean ’ reading of Engels ’s remark in Anti-Dühring that in the future society ‘ man for the first time becomes the real conscious master of Nature ’ .
Although , as Foster admits , Engels used this phrase , apparently his ‘ intent ’ was something different .
In Foster ’s view ( 217 ) Engels was merely arguing that a social revolution is necessary ‘ to allow humans to avoid being simply prey to natural forces ’ .
My own reading is that Engels certainly thought a social revolution was necessary to transform human / natural relations , but his repetition of the expression ‘ mastery of nature ’ is quite unequivocal , and means something quite different from merely avoiding being at the mercy of natural forces .
Building flood defences , for example , is something different from attempting to control the ocean currents and tides .
The third part of the book takes us to the clear political implication of the formidable accumulation of evidence and argument presented in parts one and two .
If we are set on a course to socio- ecological catastrophe on a global scale , and if the principal dynamic taking us there is a capitalist juggernaut incapable of effective reform , then the only possibility of avoiding destruction of human civilization and much of life on earth is a revolutionary overthrow of the prevailing world - system .
Foster is clear at the outset of the book that it is grounded in the ‘ principle of hope ’ : on the face of it , this is not a very hopeful conclusion !
It has been said , with some justification , that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism .
The two , indeed , may be very closely linked .
However , Foster takes some grounds for hope in the radicalisation of much of Latin America and the Caribbean — most especially Chavez ’s ‘ Bolivarian ’ revolution and the astounding achievements of the Cubans .
Elsewhere in the ‘ periphery ’ , too , populations most gravely damaged by the depredations of ecological and economic imperialism are resisting and also developing prefigurative alternatives .
Foster ’s book was written before the full force of the current global financial crisis and ensuing economic recession was felt — but this , too , adds to the sense that capitalism is more vulnerable than many had assumed .
Notwithstanding the coherence and power of Foster ’s book , it is open to question in some respects .
In particular , it seems to me it suffers from a certain ‘ sectarianism ’ .
By this I mean that in places the emphasis is on making differences into divisions in ways that cut off possibilities of constructive dialogue and mutual learning .
I have in mind two such ‘ divisions ’ :
First , Foster ’s commitment to demonstrating the ecological credentials of Marx and Engels has its benefits : he , Burkett and others have brought to our attention an important and hitherto relatively neglected dimension of that legacy .
However , others who also situate themselves within the Marxian materialist tradition have seen that legacy as indispensable , but at the same time incomplete and to some extent contradictory .
They have seen a need to re-work key ideas to provide an adequate framework for today ’s green left .
Thinkers as important as James O’Connor and Joel Kovel come into this category .
Unfortunately Foster ’s concern to defend an unreconstructed Marx seems to require him to engage in a critique of their conceptual innovations that is rather one - sided and un-generous .
Despite the personal tribute to O’Connor , the treatment of his valuable concept of the second contradiction of capitalism has this character .
A second site of what seems to me sectarian is the treatment of deep ecological or ‘ ecocentric ’ traditions of green thought and politics .
This tradition is virtually ignored , in favour of some powerful critical arguments against ‘ mainstream environmentalism ’ .
In view of the reactionary turn of some of the bearers of the ecocentric tradition in the USA , this is quite understandable , but thinkers such as Arne Naess , Val Plumwood and Robyn Eckersley represent currents of thought that have much to offer .
Foster ’s only explicit encounter with ecocentric thought is in his critique of the work of pioneering US environmental sociologist Riley Dunlap , but in this it seems to me that Foster conflates normative and analytical issues .
There is general agreement among ecological Marxists and serious environmental sociologists that the focus of analysis should be the complex dynamic interactions between human social practices and their conditions in nature .
What is left out of account , though , are questions to do with normative and value - relations between humans and the rest of nature .
Arguably what has been most significant in the thinking of ecocentric theorists is their insistence on the ‘ intrinsic ’ value of non-human beings and our relationships to them .
At no point in the book does Foster explicitly address this value - frame , but the final chapters suggest that his own thinking has been little influenced by this tendency in green thought and feeling .
In chapters 13 and 14 Foster gives a clear , if still abstract , account of socialism as constituted by freely associated labour , but adds that central to it must be a ‘ rational regulation ’ of our metabolism with nature .
Drawing on Morrison ’s work , he argues that a future sustainable socialism must put provision of basic human needs — clean air , safe food , sanitation etc. — ‘ ahead of all other needs and wants ’ .
This is the sort of position that Eckersley characterises as ‘ human welfare ecology ’ : that is , the central purpose of rational management of our relation to nature is the enhancement of human well - being .
This is , to my mind , an entirely defensible strand of ecological socialism .
However , I think it can be both broadened and deepened by dialogue with more radical traditions of green thought that strive for a qualitative transformation in our subjective relation to nature — psychologically , emotionally , aesthetically , cognitively , culturally and , in Marx ’s sense , ‘ spiritually ’ .
In his later work Marcuse wrote of the revolutionary implications of the way aesthetic sensibilities can give rise to new needs that cannot be met within the existing order .
Without such deep - level shifts at the subjective and cultural level , it is hard to see from where will come the forms of popular mobilisation that will be needed if we are to get the ecological revolution Foster correctly argues for .
It may be that there are hints at this in Foster ’s references to Arendt ’s notion of ‘ world alienation ’ , and in the inclusion , in the penultimate sentence of the book , of the needs of ‘ life as a whole ’ as an object of socialist management of the earth .
I think these latter points are worth further dialogue and development , but this does not detract in any way from the excellence and indispensability of this book .

Update , 1:10 p.m .
Several videos of the scene during the melee have surfaced on YouTube .
Check out one of them here ( warning : strong language ) .
Update , 1:23 a.m .
Campus and county police arrested several people early Thursday morning as police tried to disperse crowds on campus and on Route 1 , said Paul Dillon , a spokesman for the University of Maryland Department of Public Safety .
Charges were not known .
He said that authorities had to extinguish two fires around 1 a.m .
In one , a tree was ignited outside of Montgomery Hall .
Some trash cans were set ablaze outside McKeldin Mall .
Dillon said that Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Police were on horseback and Prince George 's County officers on foot were used to disperse crowds along Route 1 .
D.C. Sports
Bog posted a video highlighting students storming the court and photos of the street scene in College Park .
Earlier :
First , University of Maryland Terrapin fans watched their men ’s basketball team dispatch rival Duke 79 - 72 at home Wednesday night .
Then , they took to Route 1 .
Washington Post photographer Sarah L. Voisin reported from the scene that hundreds of students screamed in celebration and took over Route 1 , effectively shutting down the main artery through campus at the intersection of Knox Road .
Just after midnight , police on horses and on foot wearing helmets and using shields moved to disperse crowds gathered in the street around that intersection .
No further details on the methods used to disperse the crowd were available .
There were no reports of any injuries .

The US Coast Guard has set fire to part of a big oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico , in an attempt to save environmentally fragile wetlands .
The " test burn " is taking place in an area about 30 miles ( 50 km ) east of the Mississippi river delta , officials say .
About 1,000 barrels ( 42,000 gallons ) of oil a day have been leaking into the sea from a well since an explosion on a drilling rig off Louisiana last week .
Officials fear the leak could cause one of the worst oil spills in US history .
An investigation has been ordered into the incident , which is believed to have left 11 of the rig 's workers dead .
They are still missing .
Changing winds Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry , who is in charge of the government clean - up effort , warned on Tuesday that work on sealing the leaking well using several robotic submersibles could take months .
With the spill moving towards Louisiana 's coastline , which contains some 40 % of the nation 's wetlands and spawning grounds for countless fish and birds , she said a " controlled burn " of petroleum contained by special booms could limit the impact .
How the oil has spread
Approximate oil locations 22 April - 15 May Controlled burns had been done and tested before , and had been shown to be " effective in burning 50 to 95 % of oil collected in a fire boom " , she said .
Environmental experts say animals nearby might be affected by toxic fumes , but perhaps not as much as if they were coated in oil .
On Wednesday , two vessels dispatched by the Coast Guard and the British oil company BP - which had hired the sunken rig - swept the thickest concentrations of oil on the surface into a 500 ft ( 150 m ) fire - resistant boom .
They then towed it to a five - mile " burn zone " set up inside the slick , where it was set alight shortly before nightfall .
It will be allowed to burn for an hour .

If the test is deemed successful , BP is expected to continue the controlled burns as long as the weather conditions are favourable .
The decision to start the test burn came after the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) warned that winds in the area were about to shift and possibly push the oil onto the coast by Friday night .
The oil slick currently has a circumference of about 600 miles ( 970 km ) and covers about 28,600 sq miles ( 74,100 sq km ) .
The leaks causing it - about 5,000 ft ( 1,525 m ) under the surface - were found on Saturday , four days after the Deepwater Horizon platform , to which the pipe was attached , exploded and sank .
Possible solutions Workers on a nearby oil platform were evacuated by the US authorities on Monday after the oil slick came dangerously close .
British oil company BP has not been able to activate a device known as a blow - out preventer , designed to stop oil flow in an emergency .
OIL SPILL DISASTERS 1991 : 520 m gallons were deliberately released from Iraqi oil tankers during the first Gulf War to impede the US invasion 1979 : 140 m gallons were spilt over nine months after a well blow - out in the Bay of Campeche off Mexico 's coast 1979 : 90 m gallons leaked from a Greek oil tanker after it collided with another ship off the coast of Trinidad 1983 : 80 m gallons leaked into the Gulf over several months after a tanker collided with a drilling platform 1989 : 11 m gallons were spilt into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in the Exxon Valdez disaster
Richard Black 's blog
In pictures : Efforts to contain leak Doug Suttles , the chief operating officer for exploration and production at BP , said it had not yet given up on engaging the valve , but was considering other possible solutions .
These include placing a dome directly over the leaks to catch the oil and send it up to the surface , where it could be collected by ships .
This has only been done in shallow water before and is still two to four weeks from being operational .
BP will also begin drilling a " relief well " intersecting the original well , but it is also experimental and could take two to three months to stop the flow .
Forty - nine vessels - oil skimmers , tugboats barges and special recovery boats that separate oil from water - were working to round up oil , BP said .
An investigation has been ordered into the cause of the leak by the interior and homeland security departments .
It will have the power to compel witnesses to testify , and will look into possible violations by the operators of the rig , Transocean .

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and its allies have launched a last - minute TV attack claiming that " Washington wants 600 billion in new borrowing for their health care bill , " despite the fact that the Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will reduce the federal deficit over the next 10 years , and for the 10 years after that , as well .
The ad was announced Thursday , March 18 by Employers for a Healthy Economy , a coalition of business groups opposed to the legislation .
The group said the spot is airing on national cable television and in nine states .
While the words " Debt Crisis " appear on screen accompanied by ominous chords of music , an earnest female announcer says that " Washington is n’t listenting " and that it " wants 600 billion in new borrowing for their health care bill . "
That ’s reinforced by the words " Borrow an additional $ 600 billion , " which appear on screen .
But wait a minute .
The nonpartisan CBO said — also on March 18 — that the Senate bill combined with the House modifications " would produce a net reduction in federal deficits of $ 138 billion over the 2010 – 2019 period as result of changes in direct spending and revenue . "
CBO said the deficit reductions are likely to continue into the next decade as well — by one - quarter to one - half of a percent of the value of the nation ’s economy as measured by gross domestic product , or GDP .
So how can a bill that is officially projected to reduce the deficit by $ 138 billion result in $ 600 billion in " new borrowing " ?
The ad ’s sponsors do n’t say , except to cite Fortune magazine briefly on screen .
That refers to a March 12 article by Fortune Senior Editor at Large Shawn Tully , who ’s been a relentless critic of Democratic health care legislation .
Tully argues , for one thing , that the $ 371 billion cost of staving off a scheduled 21 percent cut in physicians ’ fees under Medicare should be charged to the health care bill , even though it was handled separately and is not actually part of the current legislation .
He even adds interest expense to the " borrowing " that he claims will result .
That accounts for roughly half the difference between CBO ’s accounting and Tully ’s .
He makes other arguments as well , which we wo n’t attempt to summarize here .
The Chamber ’s TV ad , however , might have been more accurate had it attributed its claim to " the opinions of one business magazine columnist . "
Footnote : A tip of the hat to The Atlantic ’s Marc Ambinder for noting the family resemblance between this ad and the 2004 " Wolves " ad run by the Bush - Cheney reelection campaign .
That attack , produced by the same Republican media firm responsible for this one , was also misleading .
People are usually surprised to hear I do n't vote .
I think many have an initial reaction of curiosity and disapproval .
People who vote are often self - righteous .
I have heard instructors say they give their students extra points if they vote in the election .
On voting day , those who say they voted are often congratulated and praised , as if they had donated blood or something .
That seems silly to me .
Voting is a privilege , not a duty or an obligation .
Getting more people to vote does not produce any obvious improvement in the of the outcome .
The presidential elections of 2000 and 2004 set all - time records for voting , but those were hardly the best decisions ever made in the history of our republic .
But I digress .
My reasons for not voting differ from those of the typical nonvoter , whose inaction may be motivated by apathy , laziness , or preoccupation .
I do care about having good government .
I refrain from voting in order to do my work better .
I am a social scientist , specifically a social psychologist .
I also want to understand the big picture , how all the specific facts we study and research fit together .
Political allegiances make it harder to be open - minded in seeking the truth .
When growing up , I was exposed to very intelligent , morally sensitive people at both ends of the political spectrum .
I realized during college that many of the political views I had been taught were wrong , but some were right ( so I could n't just reject everything ) .
Early in my college studies I encountered facts that challenged many of my most important beliefs and values .
I started looking for them .
I decided then that what I wanted most was to know the truth , whatever it might turn out to be .
This has often meant parting with cherished beliefs .
It still does .
I had to take the view that none of my beliefs or opinions was sacred .
Everything was in play .
Over the years , I came to lose my to my opinions .
So many have bitten the dust in the face of facts that it hardly seems worth getting attached to them any more .
I like knowing the facts .
I just want to know what the current best evidence favors .
Toward that end , it 's best not to get sentimentally attached to particular views .
Having feelings that favor some political opinion makes you reluctant to give it up when the facts go against it .
Most people I know , including very smart people , look mainly for facts that fit their preferred political views .
As a result , they can give a very persuasive , fact - based , well - reasoned argument in favor of their position .
But most have n't really tried to make the best case for the opposite view .
It 's hard to do that , when you care about the issues .
It 's fine for them to care .
But I just want to know , so I 'd prefer not to care .
Many of my colleagues fight for their ideas and their ideals .
When someone brings up contrary arguments , they pull out their best ammunition to defend what they believe .
I do n't .
At least I try not to .
I prefer to listen to their side and see what their facts are .
I do n't want to be a sucker who changes to agree with whoever is talking to me .
But I want to consider both sides , both sympathetically and critically ( these are usually separate steps ) , and then try to choose as might one who had no stake or interest in the matter .
A referee , an alien from outer space , a robot .
Voting , and everything that goes with it , requires you to want one side to be better .
Wanting introduces .
My goal is to see the truth without bias , and toward that end , it is best not to want .
It is helpful not to take sides .
I want to know the truth more than I want to change the world .
At bottom I am not out to change the world - I am just intensely curious .
The way I look at it , life is too short for me to waste any time clinging to opinions once they are shown to be wrong .
My goal would be to do research without any preference at all for how the data will turn out .
It is best not to want a winner .
But you can't vote in an election without wanting one side to win .
At least I can't .
I can foresee that some of my colleagues could be angry at my saying that voting introduces bias into our work .
They want to vote and not be suspected of bias .
Among social scientists , saying that someone has bias is a dirty word , a strong insult .
Let me say straight out , therefore , that I am not saying that others should do as I do .
My reasons for not voting and for not wanting to take sides on political issues , would not apply to a great many researchers .
Many people study highly specific questions and problems , and political issues are often not relevant .
For others , their work may have some political implications , but again focused on one narrow issue .
Unlike most social psychologists , I am a generalist .
I want to understand the big picture .
I want to see how everything fits together .
Hence political concerns interfere over and over , in many ways .
My curiosity is another reason I loathe political correctness , even though I respect many of the ideals , values , and positive sentiments that motivate it .
Political correctness designates many ideas , theories , hypotheses , perspectives as off - limits - not allowed to be considered .
To me , political correctness means I probably can't find out what is the truth there .
The battle of ideas and evidence is not a fair fight if there are political pressures .
Maybe the politically correct conclusions are right , and maybe they are n't .
We 'll never know .
John Maynard Keynes , the influential economist , was once reproached for changing his view on something .
He responded , " When the facts change , I change my opinions .
What do you do , sir ? "
This is more than a clever retort or justification .
As I see it , that expresses a way of life , an attitude .
It 's a useful stance for a generalist in the social sciences .
The symbolism surrounding Lady Gaga is so blatant that one might wonder if it ’s all a sick joke .
Illuminati symbolism is becoming so clear that analyzes like this one become a simple exercise of pointing out the obvious .
Her whole persona ( whether its an act or not ) is a tribute to mind control , where being vacuous , incoherent and absent minded becomes a fashionable thing .
Essential Background Information
What do you mean by “ mind control ” ?
I suggest you research “ project MK Ultra ” to get a little background information on the subject .
Here ’s a quick overview taken from the surprisingly accurate Wikipedia :
Project MK - ULTRA , or MKULTRA , was the code name for a covert CIA mind - control and chemical interrogation research program , run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence .
The program began in the early 1950s , continuing at least through the late 1960s , and it used United States citizens as its test subjects .
The published evidence indicates that Project MK - ULTRA involved the surreptitious use of many types of drugs , as well as other methods , to manipulate individual mental states and to alter brain function .
Project MK - ULTRA was first brought to wide public attention in 1975 by the U.S. Congress , through investigations by the Church Committee , and by a presidential commission known as the Rockefeller Commission .
Investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MK - ULTRA files destroyed in 1973 ; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms ’ destruction order .
Although the CIA insists that MK - ULTRA - type experiments have been abandoned , 14 - year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has stated in various interviews that the CIA routinely conducts disinformation campaigns and that CIA mind control research continued .
In a 1977 interview , Marchetti specifically called the CIA claim that MK - ULTRA was abandoned a “ cover story . ”
An outgrowth of that project is unofficially referred to as “ Project Monarch ” .
It is a mind control technique which exposes the subject to a trauma so violent that his / her mind creates a dissociation .
The victim ’s brain becomes compartmentalized and a new personality , which is then molded and educated by the manipulators , emerges .
“ When a person is undergoing trauma induced by electroshock , a feeling of light - headedness is evidenced ; as if one is floating or fluttering like a butterfly .
There is also a symbolic representation pertaining to the transformation or metamorphosis of this beautiful insect : from a caterpillar to a cocoon ( dormancy , inactivity ) , to a butterfly ( new creation ) which will return to its point of origin .
Such is the migratory pattern that makes this species unique . ”
During their re-education , subjects are said to be exposed to numerous symbols such as trees , spider webs , masks , mazes , butterflies , etc .
They are also shown movies which contain specific symbols ( or “ triggers ” ) such as The Wizard of Oz and many Disney Movies .
The same way those subjects are brainwashed and reeducated , mass media conducts a large scale mind control project , which starts at birth with Disney movies and continues with Hollywood flicks and music videos .

OMG !
What does this crazy stuff has to do with Lady Gaga ?
I luv her !!
What we must retain here is the symbolism Monarch project engendered and its use in mass media .
Monarch is a type of butterfly and became the ultimate “ insider ’s ” symbol of mind control .
The symbolism surrounding Lady Gaga , in her pictures and videos , mixes those symbols with occultism of secret societies .
Her vacuous , robotic and slightly degenerate persona embodies all the “ symptoms ” of a mind control victim .
Let ’s look at what Lady Gaga represents , starting with the basics : her name .
Her Name
Gaga is a term that immediately refers to absent - mindedness .
Here are some synonyms taken from a thesaurus :
Given to lighthearted silliness : empty - headed , featherbrained , flighty , frivolous , frothy , giddy , harebrained , lighthearted , scatterbrained , silly .
Slang birdbrained , dizzy .
Afflicted with or exhibiting irrationality and mental unsoundness : brainsick , crazy , daft , demented , disordered , distraught , dotty , insane , lunatic , mad , maniac , maniacal , mentally ill , moonstruck , off , touched , unbalanced , unsound , wrong .
“ Gaga ” is probably the easiest word to say in the English language , as it is often the first sound emitted by babies trying to imitate speech .
So her name basically says : I ’m a lady and I ’m empty - headed .
This empty head can be filled with any crap you want .
Imitate me , young people .
This state of mind is achieved through successful mind control .
Her name is also said to be inspired by Queen ’s song “ Radio Gaga ” .
The video of this song contains many scenes of the 1927 movie Metropolis .
As seen in my article about Beyonce / Sasha Fierce , the motion picture tells the story of a woman from the working class that was chosen by the elite to give life to a robot , through a mix of science and Black magic .
This robot becomes a sexy and alluring performer and is given the goal to corrupt the working class .
References to this movie abound in music videos as if it was very significant for the occult elite .
Madonna , Beyonce , Kylie Minogue and many others have taken the likeness of this female robot and , as you ’ll see in the “ Paparazzi ” video , Lady Gaga also continues this “ tradition ” .
Her Logo
Her logo is pretty revealing and particularly fitting .
It ’s a headless female body with a bolt of lightning going through her and exiting her genitalia .
There is once again a focus on the lack of conscious thought by the singer .
The body looks like the weird headless mannequins you find at clothing stores .
The bolt of lightning implies that her thoughtless body has been “ charged ” with a force that gives it life ( interesting note : trauma - based mind control is often induced using electro - shock treatments ) .
All - Seeing Eye Symbolism
You only need to look at a couple of Lady Gaga pictures or videos to notice that she is constantly hiding one of her eyes .
Most people will simply interpret this as “ a cool thing to do ” or a “ fashion statement ” .
Those who have passed the 101 of Illuminati symbolism know that the All - Seeing Eye is probably its most recognizable symbol .
The gesture of hiding one eye , usually the left one , goes way back in occult orders .
Here ’s an explanation of the origin of the Eye of Horus .
Horus , the sun of Osiris and Isis was called ‘ Horus who rules with two eyes ’ .
His right eye was white and represented the sun : his left eye was black and represented the moon .
According to the myth , Horus lost his left eye to his evil brother , Seth , who he fought to avenge Seth ’s murder of Osiris .
Seth tore out of the eye but lost the fight .
The eye was reassembled by magic , by Thoth , the god of writing , the moon and magic .
Horus presented his eye to Osiris , who experienced rebirth in the underworld .
- Dictionary of the Occult
One thing is for sure : Lady is Gaga for the All - Seeing Eye .
This last picture is very significant .
It confirms the fact that the closed eye is used in the context of esoteric symbolism .
Her left eye is in her hand , referring to the Hand of Fatima ( evil eye ) .
Also , one ca n’t ignore the resemblance with good ol ’ Baphomet .
( For more information on Baphomet , read the article entitled Who is Baphomet ? )
Almost all of Lady Gaga ’s videos contain occult symbolism and not - so - subtle hints referring to mind control .
We ’ll first look at a short video used as an intro during her tour .
Paparazzi Video
This video is loaded with symbolism but we ’ll focus on the main story .
It basically describes the fall and rise to the top of Lady Gaga , who , during the process , went through a huge metamorphosis .
Lady is in a bedroom with her boyfriend and they ’re “ getting it on ” .
Notice the Masonic checkerboard pattern on the wall and a ram ’s head , representing Baphomet .
He takes her outside on the balcony ( which also features a checkerboard pattern ) .
After noticing cameras taking pictures , the guy starts acting strangely and things get violent .
He finally pushes Lady off the balcony .
While falling down , the background becomes a swirling pattern , typically associated with hypnotism .
Lady Gaga falls down rather stylishly , hinting the fact that this descent is not physical .
It represents the “ trauma ” victims of mind control have to go through in order to be “ rebuilt from scratch ” .
Lady Gaga then enters a mansion in a wheelchair and gradually takes off her clothes .
She slowly starts walking , with the help of crutches , representing her re-education by the occult elite ( she is inside a mansion ) .
She is dressed like a robot , hinting Maria from the movie Metropolis , as seen above .
Another scene shows her dancing in a half white / half black wedding dress .
This signifies her ( forced ) association with the “ Dark Brotherhood ” .
Her transformation is then complete .
We then see her next to the boyfriend that pushed her off the balcony .
She is wearing Mickey Mouse clothes , hinting once again Monarch programming .
She is behaving in a very robotic way as if her thoughts and actions were controlled by someone else .
Gaga then proceeds to poison the guy and smiles very weirdly about it .
The fact that she murdered her boyfriend refers to the level “ Delta ” of the Monarch project , which is also known as the “ killer ” programming .
Here ’s a description of it
DELTA .
This is known as “ killer ” programming , originally developed for training special agents or elite soldiers ( i.e. Delta Force , First Earth Battalion , Mossad , etc. ) in covert operations .
Optimal adrenal output and controlled aggression is evident .
Subjects are devoid of fear ; very systematic in carrying out their assignment .
Self - destruct or suicide instructions are layered in at this level .
- Dr. Corydon Hammond , Project Monarch Programming Definitions
After carrying out her murderous mission , Lady Gaga is more popular than ever and reaps the rewards of being an Illuminati slave .
If you are still doubtful of the occult themes of this videos , check out this snapshot from the Behind the Scenes video of Paparazzi .
The director of the Paparazzi is wearing a Venom shirt , bearing the face of Baphomet and the Sigil of the Church of Satan .
So , there is a chance that the director is slightly aware of those kinds of things .
In Conclusion
Lady Gaga infuses into her videos , photos and shows symbolism that refers to the Illuminati and mind control .
Her symbolism is deep , esoteric and even spiritual yet she makes song like “ Just Dance ” which is about being totally numb .
This paradoxical aspect of Lady Gaga is something that deserves to be analyzed and understood .
While masses of young people imitate Gaga ’s gestures , her act is part of a bigger system that incorporates many other stars with the same symbolism .
She is creative and a gifted song writer .
But at the end of the day , the “ Lady Gaga ” persona is a Fame Monster , doing everything required to be an international superstar , including incorporating in her act the symbolism of the elite , making her an Illuminati puppet .
What ’s your opinion on the subject , Lady Gaga ?
That ’s what I thought .
This WISE mosaic is of the Soul Nebula ( a.k.a. the Embryo Nebula , IC 1848 , or W5 ) .
It is an open cluster of stars surrounded by a cloud of dust and gas over 150 light - years across and located about 6,500 light - years from Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia , near the Heart Nebula ( partially seen in the WISE image of Maffei 1 & 2 ) .
The cluster of stars , IC 1848 , formed about a million years ago from the material of the nebula .
Winds and ultraviolet light from these young stars are excavating a cavity in the cloud .
Parts of the cloud that are more dense than their surroundings are being eroded more slowly and form giant towers , or pillars of dust and gas , which all point toward the central star cluster .
It 's reminiscent of the landscape of Badlands National Park in South Dakota .
Material at the interior edges of the cavity is also being compressed by the winds and radiation from the star cluster .
This triggers new star formation in those areas .
The pillars inside the Soul Nebula are each about 10 light - years tall and have stars forming at their tips .
All four infrared detectors aboard WISE were used to make this image .
Color is representational : blue and cyan represent infrared light at wavelengths of 3.4 and 4.6 microns , which is primarily light from stars .
Green and red represent light at 12 and 22 microns , which is primarily emission from warm dust .
A note about astronomical names :
Many objects in the sky have common names that astronomers will use to reference them .
However , many , many more objects in the sky do not have common names and only their entry name in an astronomical catalogue is used .
One of the most prominent astronomical catalogues is the New General Catalogue ( NGC ) of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars .
It was published in the 1880s .
So an object with a name like NGC 7380 means that it is the 7,380th entry in the NGC .
Two additional catalogues were published as addendums to the NGC called the Index Catalogues ( IC ) between 1896 and 1905 .
The designation of IC 1848 for the Soul Nebula means that it is the 1,848th entry in the Index Catalogues of the NGC .
There are many catalogues of astronomical objects , each with their own purpose , and objects can be listed in more than one catalogue .
For example , Dutch Astronomer Gart Westerhout made a catalogue of radio sources in the sky .
Entry number five in the catalogue , W5 , corresponds to IC 1848 , i.e. , the Soul Nebula ( sometimes called the Embryo Nebula ) .

I do not believe in any sort of gods , and this makes me an atheist .
By itself , being an atheist does not compel any sort of action on my part .
My atheism tells you something about what I do not believe but virtually nothing about what I believe or how I live my life .
When my atheism is combined with my beliefs in the importance of civil rights and awareness of public attitudes toward atheists , it makes sense that I am motivated to promote atheism as a civil rights issue .
Similarly , when my atheism is combined with my conviction that theistic belief ( i.e. , that some sort of god or gods exist ) is harmful to society , it makes sense that I am motivated to speak out against religion , work to reduce its influence , etc .
And yet , I would welcome no longer having to think of such matters .
Life after atheism sounds pretty good .
Life after atheism would be possible in a post - theistic society .
There would no longer be any need to discuss atheism because it would be the norm .
Atheist civil rights would be taken for granted in much the same way that the civil rights of White men are today .
Anti-theism would make about as much sense as " anti-unicornism " in that there would be no need for it at all .
Children would learn about Christianity and other religions in history books in the same way they learn about other institutions that are no longer with us ( e.g. , slavery ) .
" Why did it take people so long to realize that none of that stuff was true , " they would ask their parents in reference to religious belief .
Atheists who are now occupied with promoting atheist civil rights and opposing religious extremism could involve themselves in other matters .
Plenty of problems would remain , and effort would be required to address them .
Atheists would be freed from the burden of having to fight for the bigotry and discrimination we face and better able to work on solving other problems .
I do n't expect to experience life after atheism during my lifetime .
I wish I could be more optimistic about that , but the disease of religious belief has proven to be surprisingly resilient .
Those who are invested in maintaining it really know what they are doing .
I can only hope that future generations will get to live without religion .
And of course , I can keep working in the present to make progress in that direction .
Skywatcher Dr. Dale Ireland took this photo of the space shuttle Atlantisduring its STS - 79 mission as it re-entered the Earth 's atmosphere on Sept. 26 , 1996 from Silverdale , Washington .
NASA 's space shuttle Discovery will attempt areturn to Florida 's Kennedy Space Center Monday morning by taking a path acrossthe contiguous United States , giving early - bird skywatchers a chance to see ?
and hear ?
the spacecraft as it streaks across the sky on the way tolanding .
The spaceshuttle might be visible to keen eyes along the flight path , which runsfrom the northwest toward the southeast .
And many people are likely to hear itssonic boom .
It is only the second time since NASA 's tragic2003 loss of the shuttle Columbia than returning shuttle will fly over thecontinental United States , and is also expected to be the last time , accordingto entry flight director Bryan Lunney .
NASA 's three remaining shuttle missions afterDiscovery 's are in the summer , when NASA tends to avoid this specific landingprofile ?
called a " descending node " ?
in order prevent a shuttlefrom flying through high - altitude noctilucent clouds , which are common in thesummer months , he said .
The shuttles usually approach Florida from thesouthwest , flying over Central America on the way .
The shuttle Discovery ?
which undocked fromthe International Space Station on Saturday morning -- is aiming for atouchdown at NASA ' sprime landing site in Florida .
There will be two possibilities for aFlorida landing , on orbits 222 and , if necessary , orbit 223 .
If all goes according to plan , Discovery willfire its twin braking rockets at 7:43:20 a.m. EDT over the Indian Ocean , just to the south of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands ( a group ofvolcanic islands southeast of Africa ) , for 3 minutes and 11 seconds , slowing the shuttle down for its de-orbiting and a gradual slide back to Earth .
At 8:16:59 a.m. EDT , the orbiter will arriveat that point where it will begin to encounter the first effects of the Earth ' satmosphere at an altitude of 399,800 feet .
Where to look
On Orbit 222 , Discovery will cross thewestern coast of North America at 8:25 a.m. EDT ( 5:25 a.m. PDT ) , south ofthe Queen Charlotte Islands of western Canada .
[ Graphic : Discovery 's landing paths across the U.S. ]
From Vancouver , British Columbia prospectiveshuttle watchers will see Discovery reach a maximum altitude of 18 - degreesabove the northern horizon at 5:25:31 a.m. PDT .
As a reference , yourclenched fist held at arm 's length measures roughly 10 - degrees in width , so asseen from Vancouver , the Shuttle will appear to reach nearly " twofists " above the northern horizon .
Traveling on a southeast trajectory , theorbiter will then pass over northeast Montana .
From Glendrive , viewers will seethe shuttle reaching a maximum altitude of 50 - degrees above the northeasthorizon at 6:28:51 a.m. MDT .
Just over a minute later at 7:30:08 a.m. CDT , Discovery will be passing almost directly over Pierre , South Dakota .
From there , the shuttle will reach a maximumaltitude of 82 - degrees up in the northeast .
After about another three moreminutes , it will be racing over the heart of Missouri , between Kansas City and St. Louis .
From Kansas City Discovery will be 25 - degrees high above thenorth - northeast horizon at 7:32:11 a.m. CDT , while from St. Louis it willpassing 21 - degrees above the southwest horizon at 7:33:12 a.m. CDT .
About a minute later it will be over the Arkansas - Tennessee border to the east of Memphis , where Discovery will reach analtitude of 33 - degrees above the north - northeast horizon at 7:34:13 a.m. CDT .
At 8:44:55 a.m. EDT , the shuttle willdecelerate to two and a half times the speed of sound ( mach 2.5 ) , droppingto an altitude of 82,200 - feet just to the northwest of Cape Canaveral .
Touchdown is scheduled for 8:51:22 a.m. EDT .
Should Discovery be waved off on this firstattempt , a second attempt will be made on orbit 223 .
On this track , the shuttle would reach the Washington coast south of the Seattle - Tacoma area shortly after 7:00 a.m. PDT .
From Seattle , viewers should look 44 - degreesabove the southwest horizon at 7:00:44 a.m. PDT .
Discovery will then passover Southwest Wyoming , reaching an altitude of 48 - degrees up in thenorth - northeast at 8:03:48 a.m. MDT as seen from Rock Springs .
It will thenpass to the north of Denver , Colorado at 8:04:49 a.m. MDT , at an altitude of 45 - degrees and four minutes later it will be over Arkansas , making a flyoveralmost directly above Little Rock at 9:08:40 a.m. CDT , 87 - degrees above thewestern horizon .
For Montgomery , Alabama it would appearhighest ( 66 - degrees ) above the east - northeast horizon at 9:11:13 a.m.CDT .
Slowing to mach 2.5 at 10:20 a.m. EDT , Discovery would be scheduledto land at KSC at 10:26:26 a.m. EDT .
If you would like to calculatespecific viewing circumstances for your location , NASA recommends that you usetheir Skywatch 2.0 applet that you can access at the space agency 's spacesightings website .
When selecting a satellite , scroll to either KSC 222 ( ENTRY ) or KSC 223 ( ENTRY ) for the options for Monday , April 19 .
If there is one - day delay in the landing because of weather concerns , there arealso options for Tuesday , April 20 for a landing at either the Kennedy SpaceCenter : KSC 237 or 238 or for Edwards Air Force Base in California : EDW 238 or239 .
Can you see it ?
If youlive very near or directly under the re-entry track , you might want to try andview Discovery as it comes down through the atmosphere on itsnorthwest - to - southeast path .
A reentering shuttle usually appears as avery bright " star " leaving a long contrail in its wake .
In adark or twilight sky , the view of this reentry fireball can be a spectacularsight .
John A. Dormer , a Texas observer , describes the golden plasma trailtrailing behind the shuttle as " ... stunningagainst a rapidly - bluing sky ; it looks like liquid gold . "
If Discovery reenters on the first attempt ( Orbit 222 ) it willcome just minutes before sunrise for British Columbia and Washington , meaningre - entry comes in a bright twilight sky , but still sufficiently dark so that itstill should be a spectacular sight .
Discovery will then cross into daylight north of Idaho , where theremainder of the reentry over the U.S. occurs during the daytime .
Is it stillpossible that the shuttle will be seen ?
" Yes , " said veteran satelliteobserver , Dan Laszlo , a skywatcher based in Fort Collins , Colo .
" I havealso seen shuttles on entry in daylight , appearing about as bright as Venus ataround magnitude minus 4 , so it 's possible , though not the spectacle of a nightentry . "
Another assiduous skywatcher , Dale Ireland ofSeattle , Wash . , agrees with Laszlo .
" It would be hard to spot in daylight , but not impossible , " Ireland said .
Certainly , the clearer your sky with few orno clouds and little or no haze will improve your chances of making a sighting .
Can you hear it ?
If you can't see the shuttle , perhaps you 'llhear it .
As it races toward Earth , a re-entering shuttle produces adouble sonic boom .
Sonicbooms are created by air pressure .
Much like a boat pushes up a bow wave asit travels through the water a vehicle pushes air molecules aside in such a waythey are compressed to the point where shock waves are formed .
The reason fortwo booms is that the shock waves form two cones , at the nose as well as at thetail of the vehicle .
The shock waves move outward and rearward inall directions and usually extend to the ground .
Those who live near and around the KennedySpace Center are accustomed to hearing the double booms of a returning shuttle , but those located under and close to the Shuttle path , perhaps all the way backto the Pacific coast , may also hear the booms as well .
From a location in the nation 's midsection orover the northwest United States , where the altitude of the shuttle will be inthe range of 100,000 to 200,000 - feet , it will take time for the shockwave to propagate down to the ground .
Sound travels at roughly 1,100 - feet per second , so depending on where you live relative to the track , itcould be anywhere from 90 to 180 seconds after the shuttle has passed onby before you hear anything .
" You will definitely be able to hear thesonic boom a few minutes after it passes directly overhead if that is where youwill be watching from , " writes Texas amateur , Jeff Umbarger .
" AndI once heard three booms in short succession .
I can explain two ofthem ( the over and then under pressure wave ) but not three ( probably a bounceoff some thermal layer way up ) . "
" In 1999 , one of the shuttles came injust after sunset , on a ground track between Waco and Austin IIRC , " addedDormer . " I figured it'd be about 12 minutes before the boom hit Kyle , Texas , which is south of Austin by 20 or so miles .
I heard a" Whump - wuh - whump " within about thirty seconds of when I thought itwould happen .
There were uncertainties in my understanding of the atmosphere , but I knew my prediction would be early . "

Religious belief may seem to be a unique psychological experience , but a growing body of research shows that thinking about religion is no different from thinking about secular things­ — at least from the standpoint of the brain .
In the first imaging study to compare religious and nonreligious thoughts , evaluating the truth of either type of statement was found to involve the same regions of the brain .
Researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles , used functional MRI to evaluate brain activity in 15 devout Christians and 15 nonbelievers as the volunteers assessed the truth or falsity of a series of statements , some of which were religious ( “ angels exist ” ) and others nonreligious ( “ Alexander the Great was a very famous military ruler ” ) .
They found that when a subject believed a statement — whether it was religious or not — activity appeared in an area called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex , which is an area associated with emotions , rewards and self - representation .
And although the nonbelievers rejected about half of the statements the believers accepted , the brain scans of both groups were indistin­guishable , providing further proof that evaluating truth or falsity is independent of the content of the statement in question .
“ The fact that we found the same brain processing between believers and nonbelievers , despite the two groups ’ completely different answers to the questions [ about religion ] , is pretty surprising , ” says Jonas Kaplan , a research psy­chologist at U.C.L.A. and co-author of the study .
The finding adds to the mounting evidence against the notion , popular in the scientific community as well as among the general public , that religious faith is somehow different from other types of belief , explains co-author Sam Harris , also of U.C.L.A .
In contrast to this assumption , he says , “ Believing the sun is a star is rather the same as believing Jesus was born of a virgin . ”

The Japanese scenario haunts the U.S. economy .
The idea that all the government spending the U.S. has used to bring the country back from recession may not prevent the economy from crumbling under the weight of its own debts lives in markets today .
There have been signs that the U.S. may differ from Japan 's balance sheet recession .
The Federal Reserve 's quick response , the size of that response , and the current growth experience suggests that the U.S. may avoid the worst of Japan 's balance sheet recession .
But a lot of the data explaining Japan 's experience matches up with U.S. economic data , and when you look at those charts side - by - side , its fearfully revealing .
Further revelations of the Vatican ’s inaction to address pedophilia may tarnish not only Pope Benedict ’s reputation , but that of Pope Paul VI .
According to a newly released letter , Pope Paul VI and the Vatican knew about clergy abuse of children almost 50 years ago .
The 1963 letter is from the head of a Roman Catholic order dedicated to the treatment of priests who had committed pedophilia .
In it , he tells Pope Paul that he recommends removing the priests from active ministry .
ADVERTISEMENT
The letter was released in Los Angeles by attorneys for California clergy abuse victims who obtained the document during litigation .
It summarizes the Rev. Gerald M.C. Fitzgerald ’s thoughts on problem priests and appears to have been requested by Pope Paul after Fitzgerald ’s 1963 visit to the Vatican .
Tod Tamberg , a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles , came to the Vatican ’s defense , saying it was unlikely Pope Paul ever saw the letter .
“ The fact of the matter is , the prevailing ideas at the time about how to deal with abusive behavior were not adequate , ” Tamberg said .
“ Clearly , society and the church have evolved new understandings of what causes sexually abusive behavior and how to deal with it . ”
Tony DeMarco , an attorney for clergy abuse victims in Los Angeles , disagreed .
He thinks the letter shows clearly that the Vatican knew about priest abuses decades ago and did n’t do anything about it .
ADVERTISEMENT
He points out that the priest even suggests removing the pedophile priests from ministry entirely instead of shuffling them from parish to parish , which the Vatican has been criticized for since the reports of clergy abuse began .
“ It shows without a shadow of a doubt that … how pervasive the problem was was communicated to the pope .
He was able to share with him their knowledge of how pervasive this problems was , how destructive this problem was , ” DeMarco said .
On Wednesday , Pope Benedict XVI said he believed the scandal was a “ test for him and the church . ”
Several days earlier , he said he would not be “ intimidated ” by all the outrage over the clergy abuse , dismissing the claims as “ petty gossip . ”

Bishops across Europe have begun taking action on their own .
Swiss bishops encouraged victims to file criminal complaints .
German bishops have opened a hot line for victims .
Danish bishops launched an inquiry into decades - old claims .
Austria ’s senior cleric , Cardinal Christophe Schoenborn , admitted church guilt as he presided over a service for victims billed as a sign of repentance .

“ Thank you for breaking your silence , ” Schoenborn told the victims .
“ A lot has been broken open .
There is less looking away .
But there is still a lot to do . ”

The man banned , Tom Riall , is CEO of Serco , supplier of traffic cameras to the British government
Satellites do many awesome things : they allow us to communicate with friends and family , they help us find our way home when we 're lost , and of course , they bring us television -- delicious television .
But there are a few downsides to those hunks of metal and circuitry floating above the surface of the earth , and for drivers in Britain , one of those downsides is now speed traps .
( Those of you who think traffic cams are the worst thing since Crystal Pepsi might want to jump to the next article . )
In London and Cornwall , a pilot program has just been launched that combines all the fun of terrestrial speed cameras with the creepy omniscience of GPS .
In a nutshell , the program -- called " SpeedSpike " -- uses positioning satellites to track motorists as they travel between traffic cameras .
By calculating the time it takes a driver to move from one point to the other , SpeedSpike can determine whether or not the motorist has been speeding .
When the car reaches the second camera , calculations are made , and if they 're out of line -- blammo ! -- a photo is taken of the license plate , and a ticket is mailed to the owner .
Obviously , this is terrible news for leadfooters .
Garden - variety traffic cameras are confined to a particular area : if you 're not driving by one , it can't give you a ticket .
But SpeedSpike allows the camera system to expand exponentially , with far less on - the - ground hardware .
As long as you drive past two cameras , your speed can be measured and you can potentially receive a citation .
Taken to its logical extreme , the British government could roll out enough camera checkpoints to cover the entire nation .
And just because this is happening in Britain does n't mean that those of us in North America can relax : the company behind SpeedSpike , PIPS Technology , is based in Knoxville , Tennessee .
Not to get all survivalist or anything , but : yikes .
Of course , the real problem with SpeedSpike goes beyond overbearing traffic enforcement : SpeedSpike opens the door to serious breaches of individual privacy .
It 's hard to argue that anything as illegal and dangerous as speeding is a-okay , so SpeedSpike itself is , in theory , justifiable .
But the jump from traffic enforcement to more insidious applications is a short and easy one .
Unfortunately , just like cell phones , in - car internet , and Lunchables , the genie is out of the bottle on this brand of technology .
PIPS 's pilot program might fail for any number of reasons -- political , logistical , or otherwise -- but the idea is there , and the technology is there , so our guess is that the service itself will eventually be there in some form or other .
As drivers ( and voters ) , we need to make sure it rolls out in a way that ensures safety while also respecting the privacy of individuals .

The Army - McCarthy Hearings
On June 9 , 1954 , in what was known as the Army - McCarthy Hearings , Senator Joseph McCarthy was dramatically taken down by Joseph Welch , a Hale & Dorr lawyer representing the Army , after McCarthy ’s attack on a young associate of Welch for associating with an alleged communist front , famously saying :
" Let us not assassinate this lad further , Senator .
You ’ve done enough .
Have you no sense of decency , sir , at long last ?
Have you left no sense of decency ? "
( Do not miss the video here ) .
It did n’t take long for that several minute interaction to become an iconic moment — the downfall of a demagogue , and the inflection point in a nation ’s shift from shrill commie - phobia to a lower - temperature Cold War .
The Watergate Hearings
Cut to the summer of 1973 .
Tennessee ’s Senator Howard Baker captured the iconic moment of the Watergate Hearings when he first said “ The question is — what did the President know , and when did he know it ? ”
That phrase encapsulated the disbelief and revulsion that a nation felt as it ’s head of state was deeply implicated in an ongoing illegal coverup of a sleazy burglary .
To me , the Senate Iran - Contra Hearings did n’t measure up to the previous two .
The only statement I remember is , “ What am I , a potted plant ? ” voiced by Ollie North ’s lawyer .
And now we have the Goldman Hearings .
Will they measure up ?
Will they stand the test of iconic history ?
Do the Goldman Hearings Measure Up ?
To become a top - ranked iconic Senate Hearing , two things must happen at the same time : there has to be a major shift going on in society , and someone must utter a clever turn of words that encapsulates the shift .
Only history will tell if the Goldman Hearings end up in the top ranks : but if they do , which moment will turn out to have been the clincher ?
The awards in this category are called The Ikes , for Iconic Moment .
There are three nominees for the Ike in this hearing .
Log in below to vote for your favorite .
Vote for :
Candidate Moment A : Caveat Emptor vs. Fiduciary Responsibility
Senator Susan Collins : Could you give me a yes or no to whether or not you considered yourself to have a duty to act in the best interests of your clients ?
Daniel Sparks : I believe we have a duty to serve our clients well .
If this moment takes the Ike , it will be because we have evolved away from the deification of market forces as self - correcting to a view that businesses have some social responsibilities , particularly to customers .
As a corporate business model , the trader ’s ethos of pure competition and markets will have been judged in adequate to run serious economy - critical business organizations .
Candidate Moment B : The Legal vs. the Ethical
Senator Carl Levin :
If your employees think that it ’s crap — that it ’s a shitty deal — do you think that Goldman Sachs ought to be selling that to customers … when you heard [ your employees saying ] what a shitty deal , god what a piece of crap — when you read about those emails , do you feel anything ?
Goldman CFO
Viniar : I think that ’s very unfortunate to have on email .
If this moment wins the Ike , it will be because the nation is fed up with hair - splitting legal defenses in response to unethical behavior .
Viniar ’s instinctive response belied a selfish and self - oriented view of navigating the legal thickets , unimpaired by ethical concerns .
Candidate Moment C : Ego and Hubris Gone Wild
This is actually an email preceding the hearing , from “ Fabulous Fab ” Goldman VP Fabrice Tourre :
The whole building is about to collapse any time now .
Only potential survivor , the fabulous Fab . ”
If this becomes the Iconic Moment Winner , it will be because “ Fab ” personifies the abstract : this is what the “ best and brightest ” have figured out to do ?
And this guy is what they turned into ?
So , what ’s your vote ?
What moment will take home the “ Ike ” Award for Iconic Moment of the Goldman Hearings ?

An unnamed , two - headed bobtail lizard , a type of skink , is seen at its new reptile park home at Henley Brook on April 22 , 2010 in Perth , Australia .
The two - headed reptile was rescued from Coogee by the Park and appears to be doing well , despite the life expectancy of such mutated births to be short .
It eats from both heads but the larger head has also tried to attack the smaller one , and its movement is difficult as both heads control its back legs .
It also has a healthy sibling without any mutation .
Bobtails give birth to live offspring , rather than laying eggs .
Govt internet filter going live is sad day for NZ
Govt internet filter going live is sad day for NZ Internet
The Department of Internal Affairs has admitted that the internet filter is now operational and is already being used by ISPs Maxnet and Watchdog .
It appears that Maxnet have not told their customers that they are diverting some of their internet traffic to the government system to be filtered .
Thomas Beagle , spokesperson for Tech Liberty , “ We ’re very disappointed that the filter is now running , it ’s a sad day for the New Zealand internet . ”
The DIA refuses to say which other ISPs will be joining the filter , claiming the right to negotiate in secret .
Tech Liberty understands that Telstra Clear , Telecom and Vodafone have said they will implement the filter , with Orcon , Slingshot and Natcom saying that they wo n’t .
David Zanetti , technical spokesperson for Tech Liberty , “ We fear that the filter will reduce the stability of the internet in New Zealand .
It is a single point of failure , introduces a new and very tempting target for hackers , and by diverting traffic will cause issues with modern internet applications . ”
Tech Liberty is concerned about the expansion of government powers represented by the filter .
It establishes the principle that the government can choose to arbitrarily set up a new censorship scheme and choose which material to block , with no reference to existing law .
Even worse , the list of what is filtered is kept secret , in direct contrast to the rest of New Zealand ’s censorship regime where the Chief Censor must publish decisions banning offensive material .
The US government has recently spoken out against government filtering of the internet , with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton saying that “ Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society , or any other , pose a threat to our economy , our government and our civil society . ”
She then said that the US is committed to helping people to circumvent government internet filtering .

It 's " Policy "
MiB takes " photographs " of their victims before " killing " them .
When Eko first saw him , MiB took a " photograph " or " memorized him " ( or however you want to say it ) by pointing a light beam at Eko .
Eko saw his past on that light .
On the second encounter , MiB killed Eko .
It is the way MiB does his job .
He claimed the Smoke Monster for himself
The Smoke Monster was originally a tool security system and biographical viewing device used by the island 's Protector ( " Mother " , and probably others before her ) to judge the island 's visitors and protect the island itself .
Jacob could n't kill the Man in Black because of the rules , however his unique communion with death and the island itself allowed him to " cheat death " by stealing control of the smoke device as his soul left his mortal body .
He was , however , unable to leave the island because the Protector retained the ability to control who comes and goes .
With Jacob ( the Protector ) dead it became necessary to expose the island 's raw electromagnetic ( " soul " power ) in order to decommission the island , and by extension its security and judgment system .
The result was the MiB being left mortal as he was before he appropriated the monster .
He Turned Into the Smoke Monster because of the Rules
MiB 's transformation into the Smoke Monster is the result of a paradox of sorts .
Consider three facts : 1 . No one ( except Desmond ) can survive the amount of electromagnetic energy in the heart of the island .
2 . Jacob threw his brother into the heart of the island .
3 . Jacob is not allowed to kill his brother .
He should have been killed but the rules would n't allow it .
This contradiction fueled by the power of The Source resulted in MiB becoming the monster .
He turned into The Monster because Jacob thought so
Since Jacob was the new protector of the Island , he could put rules however way he wanted so this is the only reason why MIB transformed into Black Smoke .
Remember that Jacob 's only idea about The Source was " whoever enters there becomes worse than death " , so it was his intention while he was throwing MIB into the source ; to make him something worse than death .
Or to say better ; he threw MIB there to make him something worse than death because that was everything he knew about the source .
If his mother had told him " whoever goes into the source becomes ( put something else here ) " Jacob would have been thinking about it and MIB would be that ( something else ) .
So he was putting rules about the source , altough not intentionally .
This is why nothing unusual happened to Jack , because only thing at that time the protector ( Hurley ) had been thinking was Jack getting out of there ; and that 's what happened .
The symbiont , its hosts and its end
Mother is the " older " smoke monster .
In the smoke monster form she destroyed the Roman village .
The smoke monster is some kind of symbiont that lived before mother , that lived on after mother had died .
The symbiont 's source of energy is the Heart of the Island , its character depends more or less on the memories of its ( un - dead ) hosts .
In the form of the dark brother the smoke monster was confronted with his memories of hate and it changed massively ( like No- Face in Spirited Away ) .
The symbiont ceased to exist - leaving his " human " form - when the heart of the island was temporarily off .
Its misbeliefs led to its own death .
Maybe that was what was left of John Locke : his misbeliefs .
So John Locke had a part in destroying the MIB .
Method of Appearing in Other Forms
Both Jacob and his enemy do appear as others .
It 's hypothesized that the enemy is constrained to the Island whereas Jacob is depicted as meeting with several off the island .
Again , notice that he physically touches everyone he meets ( with the exception of Ilana who he had apparently met before - notice he also wears gloves and is dressed in black in that scene , including Locke .
In the case of Hurley who has had many apparitions both on and off the Island , his first being Dave when he was in the Santa Rosa Mental Health Institute before he'd been to the Island , Jacob says of these visions " What if you were n't cursed ?
What if you were blessed ? "
Jacob 's enemy is the smoke monster and when it scans people , eg. Mr Eko , Juliet , John etc .
he is scanning them to see if he can find the " loophole " .
In season 1 , after it scanned Locke , it tries dragging him into a hole but is stopped by Jack and Kate , when they throw dynamite down the hole .
The monster can take the form of dead bodies if they are not buried , Yemi , Christian , Locke .
Also ,
Amy insisted they buried the bodies of the hostiles in 1974 .
In 2004 , at Colleen Pickett 's Funeral , her body is burned by the others and sent out to sea , because the others did n't want the monster to take her form .
The Fake Locke / Monster tells Richard to tell the real Locke when he is injured , after being shot by Ethan , that he has to die .
After Locke 's body is brought back to the island on Ajira 316 , the smoke monster becomes Locke , so he has found his loophole to kill Jacob .
Rebuttal : Amy insisted this because of the truce between the others and the DI , not necessarily because of the monster .
Another Rebuttal : If Ben / The Others knew of this ability of the Monster to inhabit unburied bodies ,
They would not have left all the DI victims in an open pit .
Another rebuttal : Richard said he buried Alex after Miles walked over her grave , and Alex appeared to Ben in the temple .
Alex was buried by Richard , but even though MIB could take her form .
He can read thoughts .
In The 23rd Psalm in the jungle the Smoke Monster stares into Eko 's eyes and after that Eko starts seeing Yemi ( he learned about Yemi from Eko 's thoughts . )
The same thing happened to Locke and the Smoke Monster .
When a dead character 's body is missing or not present on the island , it is in service to the Island , not the Man in Black or Jacob .
Bodies missing or not present on the island include Christian , Ben 's mother , and Yemi ( now ) .
Walt is also not present on the island .
This is different from the Man in Black acting in the guise of Locke .
Similarly , tangible apparitions such as Kate 's horse and Hugo 's imaginary friend Dave are a product of the Island .
The apparition is not the smoke monster itself , though the smoke monster can project your memories .
In " Dead is Dead " the smoke monster disappears before Alex appears .
In The Cost of Living , Yemi disappears before the monster appears after saying , " you speak to me as if I were your brother " .
There would be no reason for the monster to not change shape right before your eyes if the monster and the apparition were the same .
Instead , Alex and Yemi appear , disappear in the same way Christian , Ben 's mother , Dave and Kate 's horse appear and disappear , as products of the Island , which has its own properties such as appearing and disappearing and healing .
Rebuttal : Fake Locke does the exact same thing ; he never shape - shifts into monster form on - screen , with the exception of the scene we see from his viewpoint .
Other visions of dead people , especially those viewed by Hurley , are from the Island / Jacob .
These visions are not mimics .
The MIB can read peoples memories , this is shown several times .
He can use these memories to assume their likeness to various degrees .
When Ben 's mother appeared to him as a kid , Ben 's mom had never been to the island , so the image of his mom was taken from Ben 's memories of pictures Ben had seen of his mom and of Ben 's conceptions of his mom .
This is way she seems more like a haunting apparition , rather than a more solid manifestation .
At other times the MIB can imprint a person 's entire memory and personality , but this is possible only after their dead .
It 's like a copy made of the psyche .
However , the cost of a complete imprinting is that the new form becomes " locked in " and a new form can't be taken , which is why Ilana said he can't change since she recognized it as a complete imprinting .
Maybe very specific conditions have to be meet for a complete imprinting can be taken place , such as a loophole existing or a specific chain of events have to take place .
Some of the manifestations of dead people that people see when they are awake and on the island could possibly be the MIB trying to manipulate them to further his cause , while dead people appearing in dreams or off the island are manifestations of Jacob or the Island itself , with Hurley being the exception as he can converse with dead people while awake , both on and off the Island .
Other Manifestations
Yemi
Would provide possible hints to the person and character of the Man in Black .
Before Eko 's death , " Yemi " tries to elicit a moral change in him .
Eko refuses , however , saying , " I did not ask for the life that I was given .
But it was given , nonetheless .
And with it ... I did my best . "
If Eko had repented , he would likely not have died ; we can therefore conclude that the Man in Black has no problem killing those who disagree with him .
John Locke ceased to push the buttons in the Swan Station , Eko felt the necessity to continue doing so .
If the electromagnetic forces of the Island helped to keep the Man in Black prisoner , Eko was doing / attempting what was not in the Man in Black 's interests .
Eko was killed for being an obstacle , very much like Bram and the Others trying to shoot the Man in Black , though it had no effect .
Perhaps its that MIB has no problem with killing people who he knows he cannot manipulate .
He spared both Ben and Richard when they were being judged because he saw them as people he could deceive into murdering Jacob .
Eko had let go of his guilt over killing Yemi , and so the MIB would not have been able to use him .
Likewise , during their conversation " Yemi " chastises Eko for speaking " to me as if I were your brother . "
Note that his irritation in this case is n't seen at any other time : he is n't upset with Jack for treating " Christian " like his father , nor Ben for treating " Alex " like his ( adopted ) daughter , etc .
His reaction , then , may indicate that he and Jacob are brothers .
This irritated tone could also be due to frustration .
We do n't know how long he 's been searching for a loophole , nor how many times he 's failed , but if it were many , he would be quite frustrated with it all by now .
Would add thematic depth to the short - lived Locke / Eko rivalry : Eko was killed for embracing his own free will and a firm morality whereas Locke survived in virtue of his belief in destiny and corresponding moral weakness ( " Boone was a sacrifice the island demanded , " etc. ) .
Yemi's post - death appearance was the Man in Black trying to find his loophole to kill Jacob but because Eko was unwilling to change he would n't have been accepted by The Others as a leader , so the smoke monster killed him .
Eko 's final words to John Locke was " you 're next " meaning that the Man in Black was going to try John Locke for his loophole .
Ben explains that he needs to be " judged " by the smoke monster ( as Alex ) and , unlike Eko 's experience with the smoke monster ( as Yemi ) , Ben is willing to change .
Christian
Locke encounters Christian in the FDW chamber at the bottom of the well during a time period which must be sometime prior to 1867 due to the presence of the Tawaret statue .
This appearance is presumably the Man in Black , given that he speaks to Locke about the conversation they had in the cabin regarding the moving of the island .
We can be relatively sure the appearance of Christian in the cabin was MIB given that Claire was there with Christian and we know Claire allied with MIB .
However , if the appearance of Christian in the well was MIB , that raises some questions :
How is the MIB able to use Christian 's form more than a century before Christian 's body came to the island , or for that matter before he was even born ?
How would the MIB know who Locke is , know about their conversation in 2004 , and know that he has friends that he needs to return to the Island a century or more in the future ?
The possibilities I see to explain this are :
It is n't MIB , but the actual " ghost " of Christian .
Since there is no time in the " place " where Christian is at , it would make sense that he ( and other such ghosts ) could appear anywhere on the timeline .
But if this appearance is the " real " Christian then that would imply that the encounter with Locke in the cabin was also the " real " Christian , and that does not appear to be the case .
MIB travelled through time with the Losties .
We heard throughout season 6 that if you allow MIB to speak you 've already been claimed by him and / or the sickness .
Locke spoke to him in the cabin , and so perhaps part of MIB 's power or spirit went into Locke and travelled back in time with him .
MIB exists outside normal space - time , allowing him to know about 2004 events a century beforehand .
The problem with this is that it causes the entire storyline to fall apart given that MIB would then be able to see his own demise .
Moreover , we 've seen MIB be surprised , such as by the appearance of Desmond on the island .
So it seems highly unlikely that MIB can see all times .
The " appearance " of MIB is drawn out of the observer 's mind .
MIB can scan the memories of the observer and choose an appearance based on that .
Therefore , he might have known Locke was expecting him to appear as Christian and either took that form or projected that form .
Method of Control / Persuasion / Manipulation of others
MIB is able to " trap " his followers by offering them the thing they want most , and is able to manipulate them by hanging it in front of them ( like a carrot on a stick ) .
This could have something to do with the ' sickness ' .
MIB offers Claire the chance to reunite with Aaron again ( yet his claim that Aaron is held by the Others is a lie , both as Claire 's " friend " and as the apparition of Christian Shephard ) .
MIB offers
Sawyer the explanation why he is on the Island ( yet his explanation is a lie , as obviously it is n't about guarding the Island but MiB as its prisoner ) .
MIB being both trapped on the Island and its guardian are not mutually exclusive attributes .
MIB offers Sayid the chance to reunite him with Nadia .
MIB promised both Jin and Sun that he could reunite them and they could be with Ji Yeon .
It has been suggested that Dogen was brought into Jacob 's service by striking a similar Faustian bargain , but at this point it remains speculation whether it has truly been Jacob or instead the Man in Black or one of his followers pretending to be Jacob ( Jacob 's ghost does n't really seem to care too much about Dogen and his people ) .
Jacob gives people what they want , as long as they are willing to make a sacrifice , because he had to make a sacrifice and he believes it is for the " greater good " .
The MiB has no faith and acts only in his own self - interest , and there is nothing to indicate that he could make do on a promise and his word is clearly not binding .
The Compass
Unlike Jacob , MiB is stuck on the Island and has no means to " touch " and influence people off the island .
To touch or claim a person off the island he therefore must smuggle a physical object in his possession off the Island ( the " loophole " ? ) .
Using the confusion of the 2007 time shift appearance of the injured John Locke at the Beechcraft site , the ( fake ) Locke ( aka MiB ) switches his ( ' new ' ) compass with the ( ' old ' ) one Richard Alpert has been carrying for years .
Richard passes the compass ( MiB's ) on to John Locke .
John Locke soon travels back to 1954 and gives Richard the compass .
John tells him that Richard will eventually pass it back to him in the future during an encounter when John 's leg is wounded ( i.e. 2007 ) .
Richard visits Locke in 1961 and performs the " Dalai Lama " test during which John Locke ( as a 5 - year - old and for the first time in his life ) picks / touches the compass but eventually settles for the knife ( though Richard notices young John 's premonition painting of the smoke monster , he is disappointed that John does n't go for the compass , yet unaware that the compass never belonged to John Locke in the first place ! ) .
Rather than let young John Locke keep any of the items , Richard takes them back .
The compass remains in Richard 's possession until 2007 when ( fake ) Locke asks him , if he still has the compass ' he ' gave him ( in 1954 ) .
What disappoints Richard if the fact that John chose the knife instead of " The Book of Laws " .
You are all wrong about what young John chooses .
He chooses the container of sand , THE COMPASS , and then as the comment above me states , he chooses the knife instead of " The Book of Laws " .
Read up on the episode called " Cabin Fever " .
The compass does not necessarily constitute a " predestination paradox " ( temporal causality loop ) , as long as MiB switched the compasses ( offscreen ) in 2007 : Richard gives the ' new ' one to John Locke ( starting point of the compass journey ) who travels back in time to 1954 where compass posession changes to Richard .
From 1954 to 2007 the compass passes forward in normal time with Richard until MiB recollects it ( switch ) in 2007 .
( In contrast , Admiral Kirk 's reading glasses in the second and fourth Star Trek movie constitute such a time paradox : as from the moment in the future he receives the glasses there will be additional wear and tear which will travel back in time together with the glasses but can't be there once they arrive back in the future because they have n't occurred yet ) .
If a switch did not occur it would constitute a " temporal causality loop " because neither origin , ownership or starting point ( causality ) of the compass could be established .
( Fake ) Locke tells Benjamin Linus it 's Richard 's compass which is either a deception or merely an indication that Richard possessed the compass the longest since 1954 .
Evil or Good ?
The MiB inherently is neither evil nor good , he has his own personal motives which have placed him on the dark side at odds with Jacob .
The MiB is however very deceptive , when explaining the choices Sawyer had at the cave , he considered the island ' just a damn island ' , yet when he was sitting on the beach with Jacob , he seemed concerned that people were coming to the Island and stated pessimistic views about humans , suggesting the Island is actually important to him .
The Man in Black is not the evil that Jacob was referring to when he used the metaphor of the wine bottle ; in fact both Jacob and the Man in Black constitute the cork .
In the episode " Dead Is Dead " , the murals underneath the Barracks show the smoke monster as an entity that judges people , and indeed what Ben says in that episode indicates that the monster decides if a person has turned from good to evil , and in the latter case he is allowed to kill them .
Jacob brings people to the Island and gives them a clean slate .
If they remain good , he is proven right ; if they turn bad , the smoke monster can kill them ( we 've seen this happen to Eko ) .
Good and evil exist beyond Jacob and the Man in Black ; they merely act as judges .
The Man in Black is not evil , he simply wants to leave the Island .
However , with him and Jacob gone and no replacement for either of them found , the cork is removed , and the true evil force is no longer held on the Island either .
Man In Black is NOT The Monster
His body was found by Jacob after he passed through The Source .
It 's not that he became The Monster , rather The Monster was created after a man passed through it , which was not supposed to happen and so Malevolence was released from it .
Jacob 's brother is dead .
He died when his head hit the rock , the Monster simply has his memories much in the same way that it has Locke's .
MiB became the smoke monster because he went into the light AND he was special , he did n't die , his unique ( but evil ) spirit was removed , his fake mom did stuff to him and Jacob as children / infants , Claire and Sayid had a similar experience but they were not really special , so instead went crazy / numb .
MIB saw his dead mother as a child .
The monster already existed before Jacob and his brother ever went to the island .
Either that , or there is another entity in the Island that takes the form of the dead ( like with young Ben ) .
As seen in " The End " , when Smokey takes on someone 's identity long enough , it begins to believe that it is that person .
It began talking to Jack under the belief that he / it really was Locke when they were lowering Desmond towards the Light .
It is quite likely that MiB was Smokey 's first transformation and became convinced that he / it really was MiB .
This resulted in him believing in " the rules " and having a desire to " Go Home " .
Jacob had limited information concerning the Smoke Monster , so he ended up believing that it was in fact his brother 's spirit when this was not the case .
Initially I rejected the idea the MiB as Jacob 's brother was dead in Across The Sea and the SM was just released and posed as him .
But the evidence strongly points in this direction .
The cork and its chamber are obviously not natural , and I believe the cork has some Egyptian hieroglyphs on it .
If so , the Egyptians on the island predate Jacob and MiB .
In earlier seasons there are Egyptian carvings of what seem to depict Anubis summoning the SM .
I think the SM begins to take on the personality of whoever he imitates , as theorized above .
You see him yell , " Do n't tell me what I can't do ! " to young / ghost ( ? )
Jacob and in " The End " he tries talking with Jack like they were old buddies .
That 's after just a short period of time .
He was MiB for TWO THOUSAND YEARS .
Going stir crazy .
Trapped on an island .
With the one man keeping him there who also killed his " host " .
And also he apologizes to Ben for " having to see me like that . "
He also objects to being called a what , insisting he 's a ' who ' , not a ' what ' .
He despises his Smoke form and tries to convince himself he 's whoever he 's posing as .
And on top of that , Jacob and MiB COULD hurt each other , as seen by Jacob pummeling BiB , Mother just tried to convince them they could n't .
The SM only could n't kill Jacob because he was the Island 's protector , and technically the SM ( by my theory ) would be a servant to the island / it 's protector .
The Man in Black never was the Smoke Monster .
The Smoke Monster however could take on the form of Jacob 's nameless brother and also access ( i.e. " Xerox " ) all the memories he had , the same way as he could " become " FLocke .
Both Fake Man in Black and Fake Locke were not identical to the real persons , just copies made out of corporeal manifestations of electromagnetic energy .
Similar to the way the " ghosts " on the Island could become real .
In conclusion , with this now written by a different user , the Man In Black was not the Smoke Monster .
The monster was an entity that existed on the Island long , long before the MIB arrived , trapped in the Light without a host 's body to inhabit and allow it to leave , perhaps by Mother .
When the Monster rushed out past Jacob after his brother 's death , it was finally free .
From that moment on , the Man In Black was not his brother - it was merely a corpse , a vessel , to allow the Monster to exist in human form .
There was nothing left of Jacob 's brother in there except superficial looks .
Its reason for not being able to harm Jacob was not because Mother had made it so because they were brothers , but because the Monster was simply unable to hurt the Protector of the Island .
When he said , " you have no idea how much I want to kill you " , he was n't speaking as his sibling , but as a resentful Monster who thought it was finally free and found itself once again bound in chains by the Protector , able to roam the Island freely but never able to leave .
Before he was lost to the Light , the Man In Black was bitter and psychologically lost , but he was n't sadistic or violent .
There 's a notable shift in acting styles - the Man In Black when he was human , when he was Jacob 's brother , when he was sad , and broken , and confused , when he did n't know who he was or where he belonged , and the Man In Black when he was just a puppet of the Monster 's , homicidal and arrogant and cold .
They were two completely different characters , with the Monster being entirely independent of the Man In Black , who died two thousand years ago , and having its own distinct personality , traits , and motivations .
Rejection
A major theme in Lost has been the feeling of worthlessness and rejection .
When the MiB entered the Source , the Source saw that his heart was not good and rejected him .
This is why the Smoke Monster comes out of the cave so angry , and why the Light must still be protected from him .
The Man in Black
( moved from The_End / Theories )
The Man in Black was Right
He told Jack that the light / Island does n't need protecting .
Maybe
The Island is magical , but it does n't have global consequences .
Once the light is extinguished , Smokey is no more .
So , the Man in Black going elsewhere would just be a regular guy in society .
And with the Island sunk , nothing would change anywhere .
So , Jacob brought a bunch of people to the Island , made crazy drama in their lives , and there was no grander purpose .
It would be like someone inviting you to their home where a bunch of the other guests try to kill you , but you do n't leave because you think one of them will burn the house down , and if the house is burned down the entire world will be set ablaze .
Jacob was only able to bring people to the island because the island allowed him to .
" Mother " made him " special " when she offered him the cup .
Otherwise , he was an average human .
He mentions that Kate can still take his position if she 's willing .
He is not ultimately in charge of the island .
Ben tells
Hurley that he can run things differently than Jacob did .
This means that the island 's protector can make up rules .
Anyway , Jack needed to restore the light in the heart of the island in order to " let go . "
It may not have affected anything else in the world , since Jack killed the smoke monster in Locke 's body .
Maybe there is no more evil force on the island unless somebody comes to corrupt it .
However , as mentioned by Jacob and his brother , it only ends once .
It is possible that this was the end to the conflict between good and evil on the island .
To validate Jacob 's ability to create rules for the Island , Boy in Black tells young Jacob while playing the board game that he can create his own game and make the rules up as he wishes .
The Island is his " game " and his rules
If MIB was right , that would mean that he was the ultimate victim of the island -- all he wanted to do was get off the Island because of he was ( non-consensually ) forced to stay on it .
If the Island is a living entity , presumably because it has a " heart " , then it 's logical that it would be " dead " in the afterlife , which is physically seen as being underwater .
However since the afterlife is taking place in a metaphysical environment the MIB was only right about everyone , including the island , passing on to the afterlife at some point in time .
FSW was a manifestation of what the characters wanted , not something that was actually taking place .
The characters wanted to be happy independent of the Island , so it did n't " exist " in their " limbo . "
It was underwater .
If the electromagnetic powers of the Island caused the crash of Oceanic 815 , it would be the characters assumption that if the plane did n't crash the island was no more .
The FST was a manifestation of an alternate reality where the plane did not crash .
It 's safe to assume in the alternate reality the Island either did n't exist or did n't exist to the characters which is the same thing .
I think showing the island underwater was a tactic of misdirection on the writers part to mislead the viewers into thinking that after Jughead detonated , reality split .
It 's suggested in Across the Sea that extinguishing the heart of the island would mean the end of life .
If this is true it would seem the MIB is wrong .
He was wrong in saying that the Losties died for nothing .
Christian Shephard tells
Jack that they time that they spent on the Island was the most important thing that they all have done .
It is possible that this story was not meant to have real world consequences , or have as grand a scale as some people are prescribing to it ; this is a story centering on very few characters , and on a relatively small location , not the entire world .
The said story also happens to be very symbolical ; ' push the button , or the world will end ' - not the the whole world , just the world these people know , or the Island 's world .
It 's a wagnerian conflict on a miniature scale ; there 's a proverbial god and devil , but are they even close to what people would normally percieve to be the actual god or devil ?
No , of course not , both can , and are killed , both play by rules , and both are ( albeit , somewhat ) bound by human emotions and motivations .
Hence , the story 's logic should be taken in context of the narrative ; perhaps it does n't matter if the MiB escapes in the wide scope of things , but if he does , evil would have triumphed in that story , so the resolution is negative , regardless of what happens to the rest of the world .
The Smoke Monster Is Back
Jack restarted the light , which means that Smokey can come back too .
He 's either still the Man in Black , or awaiting a new host to be thrown into the heart .
The smoke monster does not necessarily exist independently of a human " host . "
It could be the case that Smokey is simply the perversion of the person who falls into the Source ( not an entity in itself ) .
Jack is the new Smokey .
Jack was dressed in dark ( not quite black ) clothes that became darker throughout the episode ( because they got wetter ) , echoing his transition into " The Man in Black " .
Jack moved on with the rest of his group , then after encountering the heart of the Island he awoke in the same place that the MIB 's body was discovered by Jacob .
Similar to how Jacob thought MiB was loved more and apparently the " obvious choice " to protect the island at their young age , Jack is also the " obvious choice " .
But , clearly , Hurley becomes the island 's protector , and if the writers intended on paralleling the past , then Jack becomes Smokey .
Smokey is gone .
Smokey was the boosted manifestation of the MIB 's soul :
He wanted to leave the island at all costs , he felt betrayed by " Mother " and by Jacob and he was disgusted by people in general - all before his dead in the light .
So my interpretation would be this : the light does n't turn everybody into a smoke monster , it distills the very essence of a human being and manifests it , that 's why it does n't seem to harm Jack - he let go when he stood in the light , there was nothing evil in him anymore .
So , the only way to produce another smoke monster would be , IMHO , if a " bad " man enters the light again .
Smokey is not gone .
There was a Smokey before MIB and mostly likely a smokey after MIB .
Mother represents both parts of the protector of the Island ( the jacob and MIB parts ) .
she was most likely smokey and this is how she was able to wipe out everyone in MIB 's villiage .
Then when she died the parts of the island protector were split up between Jacob and MIB .
There have been numerous references to Smokey being the protector of the island ( Egyptian hieroglyphics , the Others , Dharma folk ) .
MIB had begrudgingly fulfiled this role until he was able to put his plan in place with the Locke loophole .
Jack waking up in the same place as MIB after he went into the light gives credence to the theory that he becomes Smokey , although I dont know if I necessarily believe this yet .
The ancient Egyptians believed in five parts of a soul : the Ib ( heart ) , Sheut ( shadow ) , Ren ( name ) , Ba ( personality ) and Ka ( life force ) .
When the MIB appears at an " exit point " he has not survived the encounter with the source so the life force is gone .
The MIB never seemed to have a name , and very little " heart " , so the smoke monster is a combination of Sheut and Ba .
Mother said they could not hurt each other .
It seems as if Jacob cannot kill MIB and that is why he returned as Smokey .
Kate and Jack are not forbidden to kill him .
The smoke monster is the result of Jacob breaking the rules , i.e. he harmed and killed his brother .
Darlton suggested in the podcast for Across The Sea that Jacob did n't technically kill the MiB because it was indirect .
If you knock someone out and then they float down river into the Source , that 's indirect enough not to break the rules .
Likewise , manipulating Ben to kill Jacob is indirect and does n't break the rule .
If that 's true , why has Smokey never done that to Jacob in the 2000 years they 've been there ?
Seems a pretty good loophole to me .
Bash Jacob 's head in until he 's unconscious and then throw him into a river face down .
Using that logic , it 's technically the river / water killing Jacob , not Smokey .
Although Jack could hurt the Man In Black he can't kill him , that 's why Kate has to kill him .
Kate could kill him because the light was off , Jack could have killed MIB too , because the light is what gave them power , but he got stabbed by MIB .
Therefore Kate finished it .
The Smoke Monster was never anything more than a " fail safe " , intended as last resort in case a Guardian of the Source fails to do his job or cannot do it any longer .
There are two Smoke Monsters
Smoke Monster # 1 - The Man in Black 's essence .
It can shift into someone 's form as long as that person is dead .
Only killed Bram and Jacob 's other security guards while in the smoke form .
Smoke Monster # 2 - The Devil .
It killed the Pilot , Eko , and Rousseau 's team .
It was trying to pull Locke down the cave to hell , because of how jealous it was of him that he was healed by the island .
When Jacob chucked the Man in Black down the centre of the island , the black smoke comes out , twice as big as otherwise seen .
This is because half of it is the Man in Black 's consciousness , and the other part is the Devil .
Jacob and the Man in Black hate each other , but agree to respect each other while the devil is still alive .
The Man in Black disguises as Isabella ( someone who Richard would listen to ) .
This is when it gets interesting , because the smoke monster sound is heard , but the Man in Black is in the form of Isabella .
This was the devil smoke killing the officers , and then it tries to kill " Isabella " , but fails .
The Man in Black , in his real form , frees Richard .
The Man in Black knew that the other smoke monster was the devil , so he told Richard to kill him ( He knew Richard would immediately think that Jacob was the Devil , but the Man in Black wanted Jacob dead too anyway , so it did n't matter for him to tell Richard that Jacob was n't the Devil ) .
The Man in Black thought the island was hell because it is where the Devil lives
The Man in Black says to Richard " the Devil took my body " .
He could have literally meant that the Devil took his soul out of his body ( because the Man in Black 's body is found after by Jacob ) .
The Man in Black tells Richard that he only has one chance to kill the devil , and when Richard unsuccessfully returns after talking to Jacob , the Man in Black got angry that Jacob got in the way , he just said " him " instead of " Jacob " .
Isabella 's ghost tells Hurley to tell Richard that if the Man in Black leaves the island , they all go to hell .
She saw the devil smoke in its real form , and thought it was the Man in Black .
The Man in Black wants Jacob and the candidates dead so he can leave the island , and he wants the devil dead for the curse it had on him .
Spain ’s best - known investigative magistrate , Baltasar Garzón , is now being prosecuted in a politically driven case that should have been thrown out of court .
Judge Garzón is charged with ignoring a 1977 amnesty law when he decided to investigate the disappearances of more than 100,000 people during Spain ’s 1930s civil war and the decade of Francoist repression that followed .
The charges were brought by two far - right groups who fear an open investigation of the Franco - era record .
Unfortunately , one of Mr. Garzón ’s fellow magistrates sustained the complaint and brought formal charges this week .
As a result , he will now be suspended from his duties pending trial .
If convicted , he could be barred from the bench for up to 20 years , effectively ending a career dedicated to holding terrorists and dictators accountable for their crimes .
That would please his political enemies , but it would be a travesty of justice .
The real crimes in this case are the disappearances , not Mr. Garzón ’s investigation .
If , as seems likely , these were crimes against humanity under international law , Spain ’s 1977 amnesty could not legally absolve them .
The suspected perpetrators are all dead , and Mr. Garzón long ago halted his investigation , passing jurisdiction to local Spanish courts in the areas where the victims were exhumed .
What is self talk many would like to know ?
How does self talk work and what does self talk have to do with my business success ?
Is self talk necessary in my daily life ?
If I start self talking what do I say to myself that will help me visualize and focus on the important things in life .
Many people have asked these questions
Because they do not understand that positive thinking and mentally focusing on their desires is a vital part in every life and positive thinking to see true and lasting success .
So in this post I would like to help by explaining and answering these questions .
Self talk is the key to many things in life .
It leads to freedom from incessant , nagging thoughts and worries , and to inner strength , peace of mind , a sense of bliss , and in its higher levels , to spiritual awakening and enlightenment .
By self talking you can control your emotions and see the positive over the negative thoughts that seek to rent space in your mind .
Self talking is words that you put together that promote powerful images that you would like to see you life to become .
With self talk you can motivate yourself in to action and meditate on the things around you bending the world to your will .
Self talk and meditating has been done for thousands of years by some of the world ’s greatest thinkers and smartest men in history .
Everyone ’s self talking points are different as to what they desire and want to achieve or acquirer in life .
There are many ways one can self talk or meditate to themselves to motivate the mind and gain the power of confidence in ones life .
By self talking everyday to your self as to what you would like to achieve for that day you are starting off on a journey of self realization that your life is important and worth living that it does have true purpose and can mold the world to your wants and needs .
Self Talking and meditation is practiced and followed for various reasons and aims , such as for gaining peace of mind , spiritual growth and spiritual awakening , as well as for relaxation , health , success , mental powers and the development of pure positive thought .
The reason self talking is so important to your business success is that it keeps you focused on the important things that make your business a success .
By starting everyday out with a set plan of action and words that are your words as to how you see yourself you can project to others the confidence and well being of a well lived life .
Which shows a calmed down body and mind , that has little to no stress or anxiety .
A normalized blood pressure and a healing effect on the body .
If people took the time each day to self talk and meditate as to whom they are and what they want to evolve into the world would be a place of extreme out word positive energy .
So many say what steps do I need to take to gain this new found thinking in my life ?
First it is very important to write down all the things you would like to achieve in life and business then each day repeats them over and over in your mind as to these things becoming a reality .
Next remain positive and focused keeping an open mind to idea ’s and the world around you .
Drink lots of water to hydrate the mind as well as the spirit .
Remain in control of your emotions and self talk when anyone or any situation presents itself or tries to rent space in your mind that is of a negative manner .
Take time out of your day and find a place where you can relax your mind of noise and loud sounds a place where you are undisturbed .

Jennifer McCreight , a Purdue University student in the United States is asking women around the world to show a little cleavage or a little leg on Monday as a humorous test to disprove an Iranian cleric ’s theory that immodest dress has the power to make the earth shake .
The story began when Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi , Tehran 's acting Friday prayer leader , said : “ Many women who do not dress modestly … lead young men astray , corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society , which ( consequently ) increases earthquakes . ”
Jen McCreight who describes herself as a liberal , geeky , nerdy , scientific , perverted atheist feminist trapped in Indiana , wrote in her blog :
I have a modest proposal .
Sedighi claims that not dressing modestly causes earthquakes .
If so , we should be able to test this claim scientifically .
You all remember the homeopathy overdose ?
Time for a Boobquake .
On Monday , April 26th , I will wear the most cleavage - showing shirt I own .
Yes , the one usually reserved for a night on the town .
I encourage other female skeptics to join me and embrace the supposed supernatural power of their breasts .
Or short shorts , if that 's your preferred form of immodesty .
With the power of our scandalous bodies combined , we should surely produce an earthquake .
If not , I 'm sure Sedighi can come up with a rational explanation for why the ground did n't rumble .
And if we really get through to him , maybe it 'll be one involving plate tectonics .
The Boobquake event on Facebook already has 123,680 confirmed supporters , including many men .
The photo above is from the Facebook page .
And here is a video message on Boobquake :
Iranians themselves have also launched creative campaigns against censorship and repression in the past .
One of the most recent was the Men in hijab campaign to support Majid Tavakoli , a jailed leading student activist .
It seems the Iranian story has become world wide sensation this time .
A merger would reportedly create the second biggest airline in the US
Two of the biggest airlines in the United States - United and US Airways - are discussing a possible merger , reports say .
The companies are said to have spent two weeks deep in talks but have not yet reached a deal .
There have been a number of tie- ups between prominent airlines since their industry was hit by sharply higher fuel prices and the global recession .
Spokesmen for both companies said they would not comment on the speculation .
Reports of the talks in the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers prompted stocks in both airlines to rise in after - hours trading on Wednesday .
US Airways shares leapt by $ 1.35 - or 20 % - to $ 8.17 , while United 's parent company UAL Corporation rose $ 1.53 ( 8 % ) to $ 20.48 .
A merger between the two companies would create America 's second - biggest airline after Delta Air Lines , reports say .
The International Air Transport Association said the global airline industry sector would make a combined loss of $ 2.8 bn ( £ 1.9bn ) this year , with European and US airlines suffering the most .
The recent drama over Apple ’s rejection of Adobe technology caused quite a stir online , generating a large number of blog posts , massive amounts of commentary , a fair share of whining , and much hating .
With Adobe finally resigned to the fact that they were effectively shut out of the iPhone ( at least for now ) , it seems like the Android community is getting much more attention suddenly , as previously reported by Android Police and others .
As a result , Adobe seems to be pushing Flash and Air more aggressively and announced on their Air blog that developers have already started porting Adobe AIR applications to Android very successfully :
" Over the last few days , developers in the Adobe AIR for Android private beta started creating AIR applications for the Android OS .
Using existing code from Flash applications or their AIR applications created for the iPhone , developers were able to create applications in just a few short hours and for one developer in just 10 minutes ! "
With a large amount of high quality AIR apps already available ( Tweetdeck comes to mind ) , the amount of available Android apps is about to increase significantly .
In conclusion , here is some actual feedback posted by Flash developers :
" It literally took me 10 minutes to compile for Android , and get the game on my new Nexus One phone "
- Alan Queen
" Performance - wise , AIR for Android is fast .
With barely any work on my part , I got my three existing mobile games running in AIR for Android . "
- Josh Tynjala
" Well with no code changes , about 2 hours to have the graphics tweaked ( thanks to @pneal ) , I was able to port Happy Peg over to Android . "
- Matthew Keefe
" My Nexus One arrived yesterday ( FedEx Saturday delivery FTW ) about 4 pm , and I had Fruit Smash Organic ported to the device and running beautifully by 7 pm !
That includes downloading and installing the SDKs , walking through a Hello World tutorial , charging the device for a little while , and making some minor code edits . "

What can we say ?
Flash is really important to consumers nowadays , and it will take a long time before HTML 5 can make a big enough dent in Flash 's market share ( this is assuming Flash will stand still , which they wo n't ) .
With most Android devices promising full support for Flash 10.1 sometime after the first half of 2010 , is this a checkmate for Apple ?
Probably not a mate , but a check for sure .

( CNN ) --
With her 5 - week - old daughter crying in a bathroom at Nordstrom , and not knowing how to get the baby to latch on to her breast , Garima Nahar found herself surrounded by other women .
Some offered tips , but one woman told the new mother to cover up or turn the other way .
" I had to kind of hide my tears and just be brave in front of her , because , you know what , ' I have a crying baby and I do n't want to deal with you right now , ' " said Nahar , a software manager in Chicago , Illinois .
Women across America have felt uncomfortable in public situations when breastfeeding their children .
Sarah Hood of Fayetteville , Arkansas , who works in advertising , got stares when breastfeeding her son in the open .
Working mothers like Nahar and Hood have had to carefully tailor their schedules so that they can pump milk in the middle of the day , and avoid stares when they put bottles in the communal refrigerators .
Some have to use a bathroom stall to pump milk , as there is no other space available .
Nursing mothers will now get additional support , thanks to page 1239 of the health care bill that President Obama recently signed into law .
It requires employers to provide " a place , other than a bathroom , that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public , which may be used by an employee to express breast milk . "
Only companies with less than 50 employees can claim it's an undue hardship .
" It reflects both a shifting attitude , a shifting reality , and also the impact of research that shows that it 's healthier for the kids , and therefore good for the company , good for the family , " said Ellen Galinsky , president and co-founder of the nonprofit research organization Families and Work Institute .
A recent study in the journal Pediatrics showed breastfeeding a child for the first six months of life would save nearly 1,000 lives and billions of dollars each year .
That 's because breastfeeding reduces the risk of certain illnesses such as pneumonia , according to the study .
Much of the cost comes from excess premature deaths , the study authors said .

Major medical and health organizations agree that breast milk by itself is sufficient for newborns and infants until they are 6 months old .
But a 2009 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while 74 percent of women start breastfeeding , only 33 percent of mothers relied on breastfeeding only at three months .
At six months , the numbers go down to 14 percent .
" There really is a lack of support for breastfeeding moms , and you see that in the statistics of breastfeeding rates , " said Andi Silverman , mother of two sons and author of " Mama Knows Breast : A Beginner 's Guide to Breastfeeding . "
Attitudes toward breastfeeding generated copious discussion in social media circles when in December 2008 Facebook came under fire for taking down photos of mothers nursing babies .
Thousands of users held a virtual protest and petitioned the social networking giant to allow breastfeeding photos .
" It 's such a sad thing that our society looks at this as disgusting or weird , " said Julie Dye of Boulder , Colorado , who was involved in that campaign .
At the same time , Dye herself has never personally had a bad experience breastfeeding in public .
" I will breastfeed anywhere , at almost any time .
However I try not to be in your face , " she said .
" It does take some confidence -- you just have to know that it 's the right thing for your child . "
But some view the enthusiasm for breastfeeding as hysteria .
Hanna Rosin , contributing editor at the Atlantic , is n't convinced that the medical benefits of breastfeeding are more than modest , and denounces the message that failing to breastfeed is irresponsible .
Rosin wrote this piece in the Atlantic detailing her views .
The pressure to breastfeed is still tremendous :
One woman with breast cancer recently wrote to Rosin that she is embarrassed to give her child a bottle , she said .
And Cheryl Rosenberg of Orange County , California , says she experienced " nasty looks " when mixing formula in public for her first two children , who had rare allergies to breast milk .
" If you nurse for only a little while , there 's definitely an indictment on it , " said Rosenberg , who is a blogger and part of Silicon Valley Moms Group along with Nahar and Hood .
" It 's a lot of pressure to breastfeed from others in society , and yet the society as a whole does n't support it . "
Still , Rosenberg is enjoying breastfeeding her third child .
Rosin agrees with others that it 's " a lovely , natural part of mothering , " but does n't like the pressure .
Rosin herself breastfed her first two children and , as she wrote in her article , decided on breastfeeding her third child only part time .
She 's also in favor of the provision about breastfeeding spaces in the health care law .
It 's easy to see how moms might give up on breastfeeding if they go back to work , said Renata Matos of Kansas City , Missouri , who breastfed her son while working as a local government auditor .
Carrying the pump around , making sure that the milk gets to the baby , and finding time to pump all are challenges with a full - time job , she said .
Traveling is also a hassle :
It always took Matos longer to go through airport security with her pump and milk .
About 49 percent of companies have some kind of space for nursing mothers to express milk , Galinsky said .
In companies with 100 employees or more , it 's 53 percent ; in 1998 , it was 37 percent .
The part of the law addressing breastfeeding spaces is " a win for the family and a win for the company -- they have less absenteeism , and the children are healthier , " Galinsky said .
Not everyone is so enthusiastic .
The Texas Association of Business calls it " inappropriate , " saying the relationship between the employer and employee should be handled privately , not through a mandate from the federal government .
Most employers do make accommodations , and this law will create additional expenses , he said .
" At a time when the economy is suffering , adding costs to employers means fewer employees , " Hammond said .
Twenty - four states also have workplace - related legislation about breastfeeding .
Read about the laws here .
A breastfeeding room does n't have to be fancy , but should have a table , chair and outlet for plug - in pumps , said Dr. Melissa Bartick of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Breastfeeding Coalition .
There should also be easy access to a refrigerator and a sink .
" The notion that if you have a baby or are nursing you should stay at home -- it 's just a historical notion these days , " Galinsky said .
When I was compiling the previous list I was forced to leave off several creatures for various reasons .
Either they did n’t fit the criteria for the list , they were too similar to others on the list , they seemed too obvious , or in the case of number 1 I completely missed it during my research .
Having recently stumbled across the original list , I decided to revisit some of those entries that did n’t make the cut last time .
So here are another 10 cases of ( mostly ) parasitic behavioral modifications .
These are in no particular order .
10 Cyborg beetle
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAeV96bTRiI
Scientists at the University of California Berkley have developed a wireless flying - insect cyborg .
By attaching a radio receiver to a large African beetle and connecting electrodes to its nervous system and flight muscles the researchers were able control the flight of the beetle remotely .
A simple electric pulse to the brain signals flight , another is used to signal descent .
Left and right turns are achieved by stimulating the muscle of the opposite wing from the direction of the turn .
9 Rabies
Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in warm - blooded animals .
The virus is usually spread from a bite or scratch .
From the point of entry the virus travels to the brain and causes swelling , which if left untreated could lead to death .
An infected animal may exhibit uncharacteristically aggressive behavior becoming violent and attacking without cause , increasing the chance of a bite and the spread of the virus .
8 Plasmodium
Plasmodium is the genus of the organisms that cause malaria .
Normally mosquitoes live on nectar , but when a female is ready to lay her eggs she requires one or two meals of blood for additional energy .
Mosquitoes that become infected by plasmodium change their feeding habits .
In the early stages the mosquito feeds less often .
This gives plasmodium a chance to build up in the mosquitoes saliva .
Once a significant number have built up the mosquito goes on a feeding frenzy .
Instead of eating one or two meals an infected mosquito will eat over and over and for longer periods glutting itself on blood .
Thus increasing the chance of transmission .
7 Pomphorhynchus laevis
P. laevis is a parasite that uses host manipulation to facilitate its transmission from intermediate to primary host .
The intermediate host is the freshwater amphipods of the genus Gammarus and primary host is fresh water fish such as perch .
Much like Toxoplasma gondii does with mice , P. laevis manipulates its host to not fear the scent of predators .
In some cases the victim actually seeks out the smell .
The infected will also spend more time out in the open , increasing its chances of being predated .
As well as being attracted to the smell of the predator an infected organism may also show signs of color changes that make them easier to spot by predators .
6 Toxoplasma gondii
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaD8CMoZ7v0
T. gondii appeared on the first list for its ability to alter the behavior of rodents and make them attracted to the scent of cats .
What did n’t appear in that entry was the fact that humans may become infected as well .
Infected women seem to become more intelligent , outgoing , conscientious , sexually promiscuous , and kind .
Men on the other hand have opposite reactions becoming anti-social , suspicious , jealous and morose .
Both sexes tend to be more prone to feelings of guilt , decreased novelty seeking and slower reaction time .
T. gondii has also been linked to incidences of schizophrenia and other mental health problems .
Anti-psychotic drugs commonly used for people with schizophrenia have been shown to reverse the behavioral changes in infected rodents returning their fear of cats .
5 Meloe franciscanus
When the blister beetle species M. franciscanus is still in its larval stage it will join with other larvae and form up into a big clump that looks very similar to a female bee .
This wriggling clump of larvae produce a chemical that mimics the sex pheromone of female bees of the species Habropoda pallida .
When a male bee gets a sniff of the chemical it comes in to mate with the clump and the larvae hitch a ride .
The larvae are then transferred to a female bee during mating .
After successfully mating the female bee burrows into the ground and lays an egg ( and the tag - along beetle ) .
The larva then eats the pollen the bee provided for its young and then parasitizes the bee larva .
4 Acacia trees
The relationship between the acacia tree and the ants that live on it has long been thought of as a symbiotic one .
The trees provide nectar for the ants to feed on and the ants protect the tree from other plants and animals that would potentially damage it .
New research is showing that the relationship is more one sided than originally thought .
It turns out that the acacia tree is able to produce chemicals that actually drive the ants into a defensive frenzy .
It also turns out that the tree can also produce chemicals to drive the ants away completely , like when it is time to produce more pollen .
The chemical is thought to be in the pollen itself .
So after it has all been carried off by bees and birds the ants return .
3 Phengaris alcon alcon blue butterfly
The alcon blue butterfly is a brood - parasite .
Much like the cuckoo bird uses other birds to raise its young , the alcon blue uses ants .
The caterpillars secrete a chemical cocktail which mimics those of local ant larvae .
If an ant happens to find a caterpillar it will pick it up and carry it back to the nest and care for it as if it were one of its own .
The ants feed , clean and care for the caterpillar even to the point of ignoring their own brood ( the caterpillars may even eat the ant larvae ) .
The caterpillar can spend as much as two years mooching off the ants before finally forming a chrysalis and eventually becoming a full grown adult butterfly .
But as if raising the butterflies young was n’t bad enough …
2 Ichneumon eumerus
Ichneumon eumerus is a wasp that parasitizes the alcon blue butterfly .
When I. eumerus detects an alcon caterpillar inside the ants nest it , like the caterpillar , releases its own chemical cocktail .
The ants are repelled from the wasp and driven into a frenzy even going so far as to attack each other .
In the confusion the wasp slips into the lair , locates the caterpillar and deposits an egg inside it .
After the wasp leaves things slowly return to normal and the ants go back to caring for the caterpillar .
But when the alcon forms a chrysalis what emerges is a wasp and not a butterfly .
1 Myrmeconema neotropicum
The hits just keep on coming for our friends the ants .
M. neotropicum is a tetradonematid nematode parasite .
The primary ( and so far only known ) host species is Cephalotes atratus , an ant in the South American rain forests .
C. atratus is an ant that is normally all black , but an infected ant has a bright red gaster that resembles berries found in the canopy .
This change is believed to trick birds into eating the ant so that it can spread the eggs in its droppings .
The droppings are gathered by the ants and fed to their young who then become infected , completing the cycle .
But changing the color of the ants abdomen is n’t the only trick up M. neotropicum ’s sleeve , it also alters the ants behavior .
An infected ant begins to forage away from the colony more , it becomes sluggish , and It holds its bright red butt up in the air making it look very much like a juicy berry .
An international study based at the University of Pittsburgh provides the first identification of a human enzyme that can biodegrade carbon nanotubes - the superstrong materials found in products from electronics to plastics - and in laboratory tests offset the potentially damaging health effects of being exposed to the tiny components , according to findings published online in Nature Nanotechnology .
The results could open the door to the use of carbon nanotubes as a safe drug - delivery tool and also could lead to the development of a natural treatment for people exposed to nanotubes , either in the environment or the workplace , the team reported .
The researchers found that carbon nanotubes degraded with the human enzyme " myeloperoxidase " ( hMPO ) did not produce the lung inflammation that intact nanotubes have been shown to cause .
Furthermore , neutrophils , the white blood cells that contain and emit hMPO to kill invading microorganisms , can be directed to attack carbon nanotubes specifically .
" The successful medical application of carbon nanotubes rely on their effective breakdown in the body , but carbon nanotubes also are notoriously durable , " said lead researcher Valerian Kagan , a professor and vice chair in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health in Pitt 's Graduate School of Public Health .
"
The ability of hMPO to biodegrade carbon nanotubes reveals that this breakdown is part of a natural inflammatory response .
The next step is to develop methods for stimulating that inflammatory response and reproducing the biodegradation process inside a living organism . "
Kagan and his research group led the team of more than 20 researchers from four universities along with the laboratory groups of Alexander Star , an assistant professor of chemistry in Pitt 's School of Arts and Sciences , and Judith Klein - Seethharaman , an assistant professor of structural biology in Pitt 's School of Medicine .
Additional Pitt researchers included Yulia Tyurina , a Pitt assistant professor of environmental and occupational health in the Graduate School of Public Health , and Donna Stolz , an associate professor of cell biology and physiology in Pitt 's medical school ; other researchers are from Sweden 's Karolinska Institute , Trinity College in Ireland , the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health , and West Virginia University .
Carbon nanotubes are one - atom thick rolls of graphite 100,000 times smaller than a human hair yet stronger than steel .
They are used to reinforce plastics , ceramics , or concrete ; are excellent conductors of electricity and heat ; and are sensitive chemical sensors .
However , a nanotube 's surface also contains thousands of atoms that could react with the human body in unknown ways .
Tests on mice have shown that nanotube inhalation results in severe lung inflammation coupled with an early onset of fibrosis .
The tubes ' durability raises additional concern about proper disposal and cleanup .
In 2008 , Star and Kagan reported in " Nano Letters " that carbon nanotubes deteriorate when exposed to the plant enzyme horseradish peroxidase , but their research focused on cleanup after accidental spills during manufacturing or in the environment .
For the current study , the researchers focused on human MPO because it works via the release of strong acids and oxidants - similar to the chemicals used to break down carbon nanotubes .
They first incubated short , single - walled nanotubes in an hMPO and hydrogen peroxide solution - the hydrogen peroxide sparks and sustains hMPO activity - for 24 hours , after which the structure and bulk of the tube had completely degenerated .
The nanotubes degenerated even faster when sodium chloride was added to the solution to produce hypochlorite , a strong oxidizing compound known to break down nanotubes .
After establishing the effectiveness of hMPO in degrading carbon nanotubes , the team developed a technique to prompt neutrophils to attack nanotubes by capturing them and exposing them to the enzyme .
They implanted a sample of nanotubes with antibodies known as immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) , which made them specific neutrophil targets .
After 12 hours , 100 percent of IgG nanotubes were degraded versus 30 percent of those without IgG .
The researchers also tested the ability of macrophages , another white blood cell , to break down nanotubes , but after two days , only 50 percent of the tubes had degenerated .
In subsequent laboratory tests , lung tissue exposed to the degraded nanotubes for seven days exhibited negligible change when compared to unexposed tissue .
On the other hand , tissue exposed to untreated nanotubes developed severe inflammation .
Scott Golder recently wrote blog post at Cloudera entitled “ Scaling Social Science with Hadoop ” where he accounts for “ how social scientists are using large scale computation . ”
He begins with a delightful quote from George Homans :
The methods of social science are dear in time and money and getting dearer every day .
He then turns to talk about the trajectory of social science :
When Homans — one of my favorite 20th century social scientists — wrote the above , one of the reasons the data needed to do social science was expensive was because collecting it did n’t scale very well .
If conducting an interview or lab experiment takes an hour , two interviews or experiments takes two hours .
The amount of data you can collect this way grows linearly with the number of graduate students you can send into the field ( or with the number of hours you can make them work ! ) .
But as our collective body of knowledge has accumulated , and the “ low - hanging fruit ” questions have been answered , the complexity of our questions is growing faster than our practical capacity to answer them .
Things are about to change .
This is his bouncing off point for thinking about how “ computational social science ” provides new opportunities because of the “ large archives of naturalistically - created behavioral data . ”
And then he makes a very compelling claim for why looking at behavioral data is critical :
Though social scientists care what people think it ’s also important to observe what people do , especially if what they think they do turns out to be different from what they actually do .
By and large , I agree with him .
Big Data presents new opportunities for understanding social practice .
Of course the next statement must begin with a “ but . ”
And that “ but ” is simple :
Just because you see traces of data does n’t mean you always know the intention or cultural logic behind them .
And just because you have a big N does n’t mean that it ’s representative or generalizable .
Scott knows this , but too many people obsessed with Big Data do n’t .
Increasingly , computational scientists are having a field day with Big Data .
This is exemplified by the “ web science ” community and highly visible in conferences like CHI and WWW and ICWSM and many other communities in which I am a peripheral member .
In these communities , I ’ve noticed something that I find increasingly worrisome …
Many computational scientists believe that because they have large N data that they know more about people ’s practices than any other social scientist .
Time and time again , I see computational scientists mistake behavioral traces for cultural logic .
And this both saddens me and worries me , especially when we think about the politics of scholarship and funding .
I ’m getting ahead of myself .
Let me start with a concrete example .
Just as social network sites were beginning to gain visibility , I reviewed a computational science piece ( that was never published ) where the authors had crawled Friendster , calculated numbers of friends , and used this to explain how social network sites were increasing friendship size .
My anger in reading this article resulted in a rant that turned into a First Monday article .
As is now common knowledge , there ’s a big difference between why people connect on social network sites and why they declare relationships when being interviewed by a sociologist .
This is the difference between articulated networks and personal networks .
On one hand , we can laugh at this and say , oh folks did n’t know how these sites would play out , is n’t that funny .
But this beast has n’t yet died .
These days , the obsession is with behavioral networks .
Obviously , the people who spend the most time together are the REAL “ strong ” ties , right ?
Wrong .
By such a measure , I ’m far closer to nearly everyone that I work with than my brother or mother who mean the world to me .
Even if we can calculate time spent interacting , there ’s a difference in the quality of time spent with different people .
Big Data is going to be extremely important but we can never lose track of the context in which this data is produced and the cultural logic behind its production .
We must continue to ask “ why ” questions that cannot be answered through traces alone , that cannot be elicited purely through experiments .
And we cannot automatically assume that some theoretical body of work on one data set can easily transfer to another data set if the underlying conditions are different .
As we start to address Big Data , we must begin by laying the groundwork , understanding the theoretical foundations that make sense and knowing when they do n’t apply .
Cherry picking from different fields without understanding where those ideas are rooted will lead us astray .
Each methodology has its strength and weaknesses .
Each approach to data has its strengths and weaknesses .
Each theoretical apparatus has its place in scholarship .
And one of the biggest challenges in doing “ interdisciplinary ” work is being about to account for these differences , to know what approach works best for what question , to know what theories speak to what data and can be used in which ways .
Unfortunately , our disciplinary nature makes a mess out of this .
Scholars are n’t trained to read in other fields , let alone make sense of the conditions in which that work was produced .
Thus , it ’s all - too - common to pick and choose from different fields and take everything out of context .
This is one of the things that scares me about students trained in interdisciplinary programs .
Now , of course , you might ask :
But did n’t you come from an interdisciplinary program ?
Yes , I did .
But there ’s a reason that I was in grad school for 8.5 years .
The first two were brutal as I received a rude awakening that I knew nothing about social science .
And then I did a massive retraining as an ethnographer drawing on sociological and anthropological literatures .
At this point , that ’s my strength as a scholar .
I know how to ask qualitative questions and I know how to employ ethnographic methods and theories to work out cultural practices .
I had to specialize to have enough depth .
Of course , there ’s one big advantage to an interdisciplinary program : it ’s easy to gain an appreciation for diverse methodological and analytical approaches .
In my path , I ’ve learned to value experimental , computational , and quantitative research , but I ’m by no means well trained in any of those approaches .
That said , I am confident in my ability to assess which questions can be answered by which approaches .
This also means that I can account for the questions I ca n’t answer .
Now back to Big Data… Big Data creates tremendous opportunities for those who know how to assess the context of the data and ask the right questions into it .
But mucking with Big Data alone is not research .
And seeing patterns in Big Data is not the same as hypothesis testing .
Patterns invite more questions than they answer .
I agree with Scott that there ’s the potential for social science to be transformed by Big Data .
So many questions that we ’ve wanted to ask but have n’t been able to .
But I ’m also worried that more computationally minded researchers will think that they ’re answering social science questions simply by finding patterns in Big Data .
It ’s the same worry that I have when graph theorists think that they understand people because they can model a narrow kind of information flow given the perfect conditions .
If we ’re going to actually attack Big Data , the best solution would be to combine forces between social scientists and computational scientists .
In some places , this is happening .
But there are also huge issues at play that need to be accounted for and addressed .
First , every discipline has its arrogance and far too many scholars think that they know everything .
We desperately need a little humility here .
Second , we need to think about the differences in publication , collaboration , and validation across fields .
Social scientists are n’t going to get tenure on ACM or IEEE publications .
Hell , they ’re often dismissed for anything that ’s not single author .
Computational scientists often see no point in the extended review cycles that go into journal publications to help produce solid articles .
And do n’t get me started on the messy reviewing process involved on both sides .
We need to find a way for people to start working together and continue to get validated in their work .
I actually think that the funding agencies are going to play a huge role in this , not just in demanding cross - disciplinary collaboration , but in setting the stage for how research will be published .
Given departmental obsessions with funding these days , they have a lot of sway over shaping the future here .
There ’s also another path that needs to be used : cross - bred students .
Scott Golder , our fearless critic , is a good example of this .
He was trained in computational ways before going to Cornell to pursue a PhD in sociology .
This is one way of doing it .
Another is to start cross - breeding students early on .
Computer scientists : teach courses for social scientists on how to think about Big Data from a computational perspective .
Social scientists : allow computer scientists into your core courses or teach core courses for them to understand the fundamentals of social science methodology and social theory .
And universities : provide incentives for your faculty to teach students outside of their departments and for departments to encourage their students to take classes in other departments .
It ’s great that we have Big Data but we need to develop the intellectual apparatus to actually analyze it .
Each of us has a piece to the puzzle , but stitching it together is going to take a lot of reworking of old habits .
It can be done and it is important .
The key is to let go of our grudges and territoriality without letting go of our analytic rigor and depth .
Destacan autoridades de Michoac�n que en el atentado contra Minerva Butista se utilizaron fusiles de asalto AK - 47 y R - 15 , adem�s del Barret 50 , capaz de derribar un helic�ptero
Ciudad de M�xico | Lunes 26 de abril de 2010
EFE | El Universal
18:00
M�s de 2 mil 700 tiros de grueso calibre fueron disparados el pasado s�bado en un atentado contra la secretaria de Seguridad P�blica del estado mexicano de Michoac�n , Minerva Bautista G�mez , quien result� lesionada aunque se encuentra estable , inform� hoy una fuente oficial .
En el ataque se utilizaron " mas de 2 mil 700 proyectiles " , dijo el secretario de Gobierno de Michoac�n , Fidel Calder�n , en declaraciones a la radio .
" Desafortunadamente tiene gran capacidad de fuego la delincuencia organizada " , agreg� el funcionario , quien dijo que Bautista G�mez " est� estable , muy pronto va dejar el hospital " .
La secretaria , acompa�ada de sus escoltas , fue atacada en la madrugada del pasado s�bado en una carretera de Michoac�n , la cual fue bloqueada con un tr�iler por los sicarios .
En la acci�n murieron dos escoltas y dos civiles , mientras diez personas resultaron heridas , entre ellas la funcionaria .
El occidental estado de Michoac�n es una zona dominada por el cartel de La Familia , que en los �ltimos meses se ha disputado el control del territorio con otras organizaciones criminales .
La violencia es atribuida a los carteles de la droga , los cuales , tras ser golpeados por las fuerzas federales , libran guerras intestinas contra la Polic�a y los militares .
Los sicarios del narcotr�fico emplearon en el hecho fusiles de asalto AK - 47 ( sus favoritos ) y R - 15 , adem�s del Barret 50 , capaz de derribar un helic�ptero .
Las autoridades tambi�n les decomisaron lanzacohetes .
Por otra parte , la Secretar�a de la Defensa Nacional ( Sedena ) inform � hoy en un comunicado que el pasado s�bado un grupo de soldados rescataron a cinco personas de manos de cinco secuestradores , quienes fueron detenidos .
A los capturados , les fueron decomisados 35 armas largas , 9 armas cortas , 1 lanzacohetes , seis mil 723 cartuchos de diferentes calibres , 269 cargadores , 3 granadas de fragmentaci�n y 2 veh�culos .
Esta acci�n tuvo lugar en el rancho " El Lodo " , en el municipio de San Fernando , del estado de Tamaulipas , donde los carteles de las drogas de Los Zetas y del Golfo , antes aliados , se disputan a sangre y fuego el control de la zona fronteriza con Estados Unidos .
Harry Markopolos in September 2009 .
( Haraz N. Ghanbari / AP )
The man who tried futilely for 10 years to expose the largest Ponzi scheme in history has written a book about his failed crusade .
" No One Would Listen : A True Financial Thriller " ( Amazon.com ) is released March 2 .
Harry Markopolos relives his tragic tale , how he discovered Bernard Madoff was a fraud , how he tried for years to get the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate , how no one would listen .
Madoff became a national symbol for Wall Street greed .
Markopolos , an ordinary - seeming if quirky finance whiz , has been harder to peg .
Just why was he the only one to figure it out ?
Why did he alone try so hard for years to expose the scam ?
Why did n’t anybody listen ?
Markopolos is embarking on a national media tour to tout his book .
He ’ll be on " The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , " the " Today " show , and a bunch of others .
WBUR ’s Curt Nickisch got the first radio interview with the man who ’s still coming to terms with the fact he ’d always been right about Madoff , but it did n’t do any good .
Here ’s the story .
" I always think of the terrible tragedy .
It ’s just a hard thing for me to live with . "
Harry Markopolos
It was a cold day in December 2008 .
Harry Markopolos was at a Boston - area karate studio , where his twin boys were getting lessons .
His phone buzzed with two voicemails from friends of his .
That ’s when Harry found out his fight was over , and that his nemesis had surrendered .
“ They called to inform me that Madoff had turned himself in and admitted to a $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme , ” Harry says .
“ I returned those two calls as quickly as I could , and I felt a tremendous burst of energy and then I almost fainted . ”
Harry fell against a railing , grabbed it to hold on .
What was racing through his mind was complicated .
Vindication , definitely .
Harry had known Madoff to be a fraud for almost 10 years .
And he had told the authorities again and again .
Now he knew — they knew — he was right .
But there was also sorrow .
For people who were just now finding out -– what Harry always knew would happen -– that they had lost everything .
“ Since the news broke on Dec. 11 ( 2008 ) , I have not been able to get a full night ’s sleep .
I wake up and contemplate it in the early hours of the morning .
And I always think of the terrible tragedy .
It ’s just a hard thing for me to live with . ”
But Harry can also live with the fact that he tried .
This 53 - year - old with brown eyes and a little bit of a comb - over turned something that did n’t add up into an obsession .
“ Harry was , or is , a math whiz , ” says Frank Casey , who worked with Harry back in 1999 , when it all started .
“ And to be honest with you , he was sort of geeky .
If you know what I mean . ”
“ Really did n’t want to have interpersonal skills with other members of the firm because he just liked doing what he did . ”
Harry saw Madoff as a domestic terrorist .
Somebody who was undermining the U.S. financial system .
Somebody who had 60 billion reasons for not wanting Harry asking questions .
Frank was a marketing guy at the small Boston company Rampart Investments .
Harry is what Frank called “ the brains . ”
The guy who came up with and managed the complex investment products that it was Frank ’s job to go out and sell on commission .
“ I saw in him a tremendous power that was sort of untapped , ” Frank says .
“ And I figured I could make a buck off of it . ”
Frank thought :
If Harry could model something on what this bigwig down in New York — this Bernie Madoff — was apparently doing , that would bring in some dough .
So Frank made a trip to New York .
Got the basic info on how Madoff said he was investing and what the returns looked like .
To be honest , it did n’t make sense to Frank .
But he was like , what do I know ?
If Harry can copy this , we ’re in the money .
“ So I go to Harry and say , why ca n’t you do this for us ?
And he looks at it for five minutes I swear , and he says , this thing ’s a fraud .
I said , Wow . ”
That ’s when they knew , all the way back in 1999 , that Bernard Madoff , the respected former NASDAQ chairman and adviser to the feds , was a fraud .
So what do you do with that ?
In the financial business , if something does n’t smell right , you just stay away .
But there ’s something about Harry that turned this into a 10 - year crusade .
Harry In The Army Harry grew up in Erie , Penn .
He went to a Catholic school , where the discipline and moral education made an impression .
He went on to a Jesuit college on an Army scholarship and served afterward in the Maryland Army National Guard .
“ Quite frankly up until that point in my career I had never run into anyone that was that dedicated , ” says Colonel Michael Schleupner , who remembers the first time he met Harry .
It was 2:30 in the morning .
Everyone else was sacked out .
Harry was charging around in a Jeep like it was World War III .
“ In addition to being a hard worker , Harry is a very very bright man , ” Schleupner says .
“ In fact , in many ways , I often wondered how he wound up in the military .
He does n’t suffer fools very well .
Some people were turned off by the fact that he was very blunt in the way he spoke .
I was n’t the least bit disturbed about that though , because he always delivered . ”
Harry eventually left the Army for a career in financial services -– it seemed like a good fit for his analytical mind .
But that military background came out in his growing fixation on the Ponzi scheme .
Harry kept a loaded shotgun in his home office .
He assembled a team modeled on an anti-terrorist cell .
For one , Harry saw Madoff as a domestic terrorist .
Somebody who was undermining the U.S. financial system .
And two , Harry saw Madoff as a lethal enemy .
Somebody who had 60 billion reasons for not wanting Harry asking questions .
Harry was pretty sure Madoff was taking in some dirty money offshore from organized crime and drug cartels .
If they found out Madoff was duping them , Harry says , Bernie would get whacked .
“ Madoff had his life on the line and I felt that — to protect his secret — I did n’t think I would be long for this world if he discovered what I was doing , ” Harry says .
So Harry kept a loaded shotgun in his home office .
And assembled a team modeled on an anti-terrorist cell .
His assistant , Neil Chelo , was one member .
Frank Casey , the marketing guy , was another .
And Frank recruited Michael Ocrant , a journalist who covered the hedge - fund industry .
They gathered information in the field .
Frank says
Harry took point .
He was the one who went to the Securities and Exchange Commission .
“ Harry carried the heavy sandbags to the SEC , ” Frank says .
“ And Neil and I and Mike had scoops , and we ’d dig up sand and put it in the bags for him .
Opportunistically .
And he would lug them down . ”
Harry first chose to go to the SEC in 2000 because that was the proper channel .
The agency had the authority to walk right into Madoff ’s operation and blow the scheme wide open .
The Boston office listened to Harry .
But they passed it on to the New York office , which had jurisdiction .
Harry says he did n’t hear from New York .
At first Harry and his team thought the SEC was just complacent .
So in 2001 , Mike Ocrant , the journalist , published an article questioning Madoff .
Within a week , Frank Casey remembers , the investor magazine Barron ’s followed suit .
“ Well , Harry , I and Neil were giving each other high fives on Monday morning after Barron ’s came out , because we thought the SEC was going to ride to the rescue .
Everybody reads Barron’s !
Surely !
Nothing .
Nothing .
Nothing happened .
For months . ”
Forget complacent , they thought .
The SEC ’s just incompetent .
The problem was , they had the smoke , but no gun .
So they figured : Find more smoke .
Put that smell of gunpowder right under the SEC ’s nose .
Dinosaur Tracks
Harry went to talk to someone for advice : Pat Burns , who works for a fraud watchdog group in Washington .
He remembers the day Harry laid it out for him .
Burns got this surreal feeling .
“ And it ’s sort of like you ’re going out and you ’re looking for tracks , and you know the old cartoon movie where they pan back and you realize you ’re standing in the track , ” Burns says .
“ It ’s a dinosaur track -– that was the scenario that we were in .
Harry was tracking dinosaurs .
He was tracking a very big animal . ”
" And we are in Boston , sort of like the little kid in that story , The emperor has no clothes !
And we ’re yelling it , but nobody ’s listening . "
For the first few years , Harry did n’t know exactly what kind of animal .
How exactly Madoff was making such fantastic returns .
He had two theories : either a kind of insider trading or a Ponzi scheme , where investors are paid supposed returns by money coming in from new investors .
It was n’t until 2002 , when Harry traveled to Europe for business , that he figured out which .
He kept meeting money managers , who bragged about having a “ special relationship ” with Bernie .
“ And when you hear it the first time , ” Harry says , “ you take it at face value .
When you hear it the second time , you get suspicious .
And after you ’ve heard it 14 times in two weeks , you know it ’s a Ponzi scheme . "
Harry Markopolos now knew where to focus his team .
Whenever one of them would meet , say , a risk manager at some international bank , they ’d ask , What do you know about Bernie ?
By this time , Harry had newborn twin sons .
He could use the sleep .
But he ’d still stay up at night when they were down , to work on the case .
In 2005 , he went back to the SEC with his most damning warning ever , in plain English : “ The world ’s largest hedge fund is a fraud . ”
He spelled out more than two dozen red flags .
Common sense signals that Madoff was running a multi-billion - dollar Ponzi scheme .
The SEC would n’t comment for this story .
A report from the SEC at the time reveals it doubted Harry , but looked into Madoff anyway , out of “ an overabundance of caution . ”
The SEC found no fraud .
The Emperor Has No Clothes
One person at the SEC who ’s not authorized to talk says some people at the agency got Harry .
But he rubbed most the wrong way .
And they could n’t get past that to really listen to him .
Frank Casey can only imagine .
“ I mean , you ’re telling me , here ’s this idiot in Boston who ’s a math geek .
He ’s kind of quirky .
He wears an orange shirt and mismatched tie and a math whiz .
And he ’s kind of got no interpersonal skills - – not real smooth . ”
Harry Markopolos testified before Congress in February 2009 about what he saw as systemic failings of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
His advocacy is one way he is trying to make good out of what he also sees as a personal failing .
( Susan Walsh / AP )
And then there was the New York - Boston mistrust .
Bernard Madoff was a big deal in the Big Apple .
He used to run a stock exchange .
He sat on advisory boards to the SEC .
“ Bernie ’s in New York .
And everyone kneels down to the emperor in New York , and everyone was afraid to say the emperor has no clothes , ” Frank says .
“ And we are in Boston , sort of like the little kid in that story , The emperor has no clothes !
And we ’re yelling it , but nobody ’s listening . ”
The years went on with nobody listening .
2006 . 2007 . 2008 .
Frank and Harry and Neil were no longer working at the same company anymore .
They could have , you know , fallen out of touch .
But Harry would not let it go .
Despite their continuing efforts , they totally missed a whole layer to the Ponzi scheme , which , ironically , has become the most public .
“ We were not perfect in our investigation , ” Harry says .
“ One of the things we missed , and it was pretty obvious –- in retrospect of course , was that Madoff was raiding the temples !
That he was destroying the Jewish community here at home . ”
See , Harry and his team had had only really known about the money from wealthy clients at European banks and the private hedge funds around New York City that funneled investor money to Madoff .
They did n’t know about people like Nancy Robinson , who lived 10 minutes away , in Newton .
She had more than a million dollars in an account directly with Madoff .
Nancy remembers getting her statement in November 2008 .
“ The economy had started to really collapse .
According to this statement we had treasury bonds , U.S. Treasury bonds , and I thought , good , smart move , that was really safe ! ”
Nancy laughs .
She did n’t get any more statements after that .
The Ponzi scheme collapsed - – could n’t raise enough new money to pay off investors who were cashing out .
Bernard Madoff turned himself in on Dec. 11 , when he decided it was time .
Harry ’s former commander , Col . Mike Schleupner , remembers seeing on the news that a little known Massachusetts finance guy by the name of Harry Markopolos had been trying for almost a decade to expose the scam : “ I — when I heard that he was the one , I could n’t help but just smile .
There ’s something about Harry ...
He simply ... keeps coming and coming and coming .
He simply does n’t give up . ”
So far , only one of the victims has contacted Harry to say thanks for not giving up .
It ’s Nancy Robinson of Newton : “ He was a crusader ! ” she says .
“ He wrote how many memos and how many e-mails .
Out of a sense of duty , or obligation .
Which is astounding .
Thank you , Harry !
That ’s my message :
Thank you , Harry ! ”

The Census Bureau reports New Home Sales in March were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate ( SAAR ) of 411 thousand .
This is an increase from the revised rate of 324 thousand in February ( revised from 308 thousand ) .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
The first graph shows monthly new home sales ( NSA - Not Seasonally Adjusted ) .
Note the Red columns for 2010 .
In March 2010 , 38 thousand new homes were sold ( NSA ) .
The record low for March was 31 thousand in 2009 .
The second graph shows New Home Sales vs. recessions for the last 45 years .
Sales of new single - family houses in March 2010 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 411,000 ...
This is 26.9 percent ( ±21.1 % ) above the revised February rate of 324,000 and is 23.8 percent ( ±18.7 % ) above the March 2009 estimate of 332,000 .
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of March was 228,000 .
This represents a supply of 6.7 months at the current sales rate .
And another long term graph - this one for New Home Months of Supply .
Months of supply declined to 6.7 in March from 8.6 in February .
This is significantly below the all time record of 12.4 months of supply set in January 2009 , but still higher than normal .
The final graph shows new home inventory .
New home sales are counted when the contract is signed , so this pickup in activity is probably related to the tax credit .
Note that that a few thousand extra sales NSA in March can make a huge difference in the SAAR .
Any further pickup in sales because of the tax credit will happen in April and then sales will probably decline again .
Armistice Tour raises 1250 submissions
Armistice Tour raises 1250 cannabis law reform submissions in first week
Dakta Green 's cannabis law reform tour of the North Island is making people stop , think and act .
" We 've collected more than 1250 submissions so far , " said Dakta Green mid Friday afternoon .
" The number is increasing daily We 've collected 50 already today , and we aim to have 2000 by next Friday when we deliver them to the Law Commission offices in Wellington .
Maryjane the Cannabus is due in Hawera tonight and her Daktavist crew will campaign for cannabis law reform in Hawera tomorrow .
Halfway through his two - week tour of provincial North Island centres , Dakta Green reports an overwhelmingly positive reception from Heartland Kiwis to his campaign .
" We could n't fight them off with a stick , " he exclaimed jokingly about Thursday 's reception at New Plymouth .
" I think the support for cannabis law reform is overwhelming . "
" The only people that are objecting to it ( the Armistice Tour ) will not stop and have a discussion .
" They have pre conceived ideas that all drugs are bad . "
Dakta Green reports some interesting observations after a week on the road , visiting rural communities to inform them that everyone has a right to have their say in New Zealand 's revamp of the drug laws .
" We have lots of non smoking supporters .
Not many people knew that New Zealand 's 1970s - era drug laws were in for a much - needed overhaul .
And that ordinary Kiwis did , in fact , have the right to speak up on cannabis laws . "
While members of New Zealand 's cannabis community are buoyed by news of submission numbers , many feel the Armistice Tour is also an important face - to - face contact to engage in democratic debate over fair and rational cannabis policy with fellow citizens .
Dakta Green says cannabis law reform is the defining Freedom issue of our age , where the common person
growing their own medicine confronts organised and influential big business interests .
" Prohibition did n't work for Alcohol and it clearly does n't work for Cannabis .
Our current drug policies are a direct attack on ordinary Kiwi families .
Dakta Green will personally deliver submissions to the Law Commission offices in Wellington on April 30 , before celebrating J Day with the Daktory Ethos of " Live like its Legal " in the Capital 's iconic waterfront Frank Kitts Park on May 1 .

ALEX is convinced he 's blessed .
His hospital trauma doctor certainly agrees .
The image of a 30 - centimetre kitchen knife embedded in his face is too shocking to show here , but his hospital X - ray reveals how lucky he is to be alive .
An X -ray of Alex 's skull .
On March 20 , Alex , 19 , and a group of friends gathered in Pyrmont for his brother 's 21st birthday .
They booked an apartment and enjoyed an incident - free night at Star City casino .
As they were heading home , trouble flared .
' 'A friend got involved in an argument with two guys behind me .
I turned back to see if he was all right .
Before I knew it , a fight broke out , '' Alex said .
'' One of the guys threw a punch in my face , or at least I thought it was a punch .
He stabbed me in the head with a knife . ''

In addition to gallery work , the store features consignment pieces including prints , apparel and toys - all at affordable prices .
Desmond is special .
Or at least that 's what we 've been hearing since he made his miraculous reappearance after blowing the Hatch at the end of Season Two .
In last night 's episode , " Happily Ever After , " we found out why — sort of .
Our favorite Scotsman has been brought back to the island by father - in - law Widmore , who wants to stop Fake Locke from escaping to the outside world .
" [ Desmond is ] the only person I 'm aware of in the world who has survived a catastrophic electromagnetic event , " Widmore tells Jin .
" I need to know if he can do it again , or we all die . "
Widmore has set up a test room with two solenoid coils near Hydra Island 's generating station .
He puts an understandably reluctant Desmond between them .
" Do n't worry , " Widmore says .
" If what I 've heard about you is true , you 'll be just fine . "
( Nevermind the guy who went in to check something before the test and accidentally got fried . )
Widmore turns on the power .
The coils heat up , and Desmond screams in pain .
In the generating station , a computer shows " Gauss field phasing adjustment for coil form deterioration " with electromagnetic fields counting down from 200 EMF to around 150 .
Gauges show a magnetic flux density from 170 gauss up to 200 .
And there 's an electromagnetic radiation frequency that starts at 120 pHz and goes up to 200 .
Desmond collapses — and wakes up in the alternate universe .
What 's more , sitting inside an MRI in the alternate universe causes this Desmond to access memories or visions of his life in the other universe — so just as the guy could jump between different points of time with his mind in season three , he can now jump between universes mentally .
It 's all very flashy — all very Lost .
But just what , exactly , does this all electromagnet stuff mean in a scientific sense ?
Electromagnets are just what they sound like : Magnets powered by electricity .
But these magnets are n't permanent , like the ones on your fridge ; once the electricity turns off , so does the magnet .
All you need to create an electromagnet is a battery and a wire .
By running the electricity through the wire , you create a magnetic field .
Because of this , we 're exposed to electromagnetic fields constantly , according to John Webster , a professor emeritus in the University of Wisconsin 's biomedical engineering department .
" Your wall current goes at 60 hertz , or 60 cycles per second , " he says .
" We 're all bathed in a small of amount of that all the time . "
Widmore 's experiment makes use of solenoids — loops of wire around a metallic core that will produce a magnetic field when an electric current is passed through it .
Solenoids are real devices , but in Lost , they 're operating at picoHertz — very low frequencies that do n't cause any damage .
" Every time somebody gets into an MRI scanner , they 're in one of the strongest magnetic fields known to man , about 4 tesla , " Webster says .
" And that does n't hurt them . "
The gauges in the generation station showed the magnetic flux — or the strength of the magnetic field — to be 200 gauss ( a term which Webster says went out of vogue after WWII ) , which equates to .02 Tesla .
" That 's a pretty weak field , " he says .
And what about the poor guy who got fried before Desmond 's test ?
That also reeks of bad science .
" You have to have microwaves before you can have heating , " Webster says .
" Radar , which is an extremely high microwave frequency , has been known to cook eyeballs of sailors who got in front of it in WWII .
[ Lost is using ] very low frequencies , which I do n't think can do anything .
If they have big coils , what are the coils going to do at low frequencies ?
There 've been a lot of experiments done to people —
Otto Schmidt at the University of Minnesota has done them — where he puts people in dark boxes and turns on very strong fields to see if people know when they 're on and off .
And the people can't perceive these strong fields . "
Though electromagnetic fields wo n't hurt people , they can mess with your electronics .
" After WWII , the military set off atomic bombs up in the atmosphere , which created electromagnetic pulses , " Webster says .
" They found that a lot of electronic equipment all over the place got disabled .
So there 's no doubt that if you set off an atomic bomb in the atmosphere that it affects electronic equipment , but it does n't harm people . "
Unless , of course , you 've got a pacemaker .
( Guess how you protect your electronics ?
By putting them in a Faraday cage . )
Even more puzzling is the phrase " Gauss field phasing adjustment for coil form deterioration . "
Webster is skeptical that it means anything .
" I know what phase is , I know what deterioration is , " he says .
" What are they saying ?
They have some force that decays with time , and gets smaller and smaller ? "
One thing Lost did get right , however , was what happens when metal and an electromagnetic field are in the same room .
There have been numerous instances of metal objects ending up inside MRI scanners .

The US and European space agencies have drawn up plans for a major space mission to the Jupiter system , to launch in 2020 , a talking point at last week 's Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Texas .
The Europa - Jupiter System Mission will focus on Jupiter 's icy satellites Europa and Ganymede , investigating their chemistry and geology .
Dr Robert Pappalardo from Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has led a study to scope out the venture .
He told BBC science reporter Paul Rincon why this mission could yield " spectacular results " .
Europa may harbour an ocean beneath its thick crust of ice
PR : Why is Europa such an attractive target for planetary scientists ?
RP : Europa rises to the top of places that we want to explore in the Solar System , because we 're trying to understand whether it's an environment where life could possibly exist .
Europa probably has a subsurface ocean of liquid water , where that ocean is in direct contact with rock below it and that ocean is below an ice shell that is relatively thin .
So Europa may have the ingredients for life .
It almost certainly has liquid water and probably has the molecules from which life can be built .
And a big question is whether it has the chemical energy that can allow for life in that ocean below the surface .
EUROPA JUPITER SYSTEM MISSION Nasa : Jupiter Europa Orbiter could launch on Atlas rocket in 2020 Esa : Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter ( above ) lofted by an Ariane Probes use Venus gravity assist to arrive six years later Orbiters conduct joint observations at other Jupiter moons
Would finally settle into orbits around dedicated targets Studies will focus on Europa 's and Ganymede 's interiors End destructions will allow unique measurement opportunities PR :
What kind of life might survive on Europa ?
Are there any analogues on Earth that could give us clues ?
RP : If there 's life at Europa , we 're not expecting it would be big fish or whales or anything , we 're expecting it would be microbial life - single - celled organisms .
That 's the picture of what life could be like there .
I do n't want to give the wrong impression .
This mission is n't to find life , but to understand whether Europa has the environmental conditions that might allow for life .
Then we could follow up in the future with missions that could actually search for whether there is evidence of life .
PR : What shape will this mission take ?
RP : The mission as a whole is bigger than just Europa .
It is exploration of the whole Jupiter system with two spacecraft .
One will end up going into orbit around Europa to study it in detail and the other will go into orbit around Europa 's neighbour Ganymede to study it in detail .
By comparing these two icy moons , both of which probably have oceans below their surfaces , we 'll learn much more than the sum of the parts .
Ganymede 's ocean is probably deeper beneath the surface , not in direct contact with the rocky mantle .
It might not be as hospitable to life but that 's the kind of thing we need to understand better .
We have an idea of how these moons work , but we do n't understand in detail how they work .
With two spacecraft in orbit around each moon , we can learn a lot about the interior structure of the satellite .
Scientists would like to get down on to the surface of Europa
We can learn about the depth to the ocean and the thickness of those oceans and we can map the surfaces and the geological processes that have affected these satellites in detail .
We 'll also understand a lot more about their chemistry .
Then we 'll understand Jupiter system as a whole by understanding the interactions of these moons with the magnetosphere of Jupiter , we 'll know more about the chemistry of Jupiter itself .
Even the rings of Jupiter and the small satellites and what do they tell us about the history of the system as a whole .
Both spacecraft will spend about two - and - a - half years in orbit around Jupiter , making close flybys of the Galilean satellites before entering orbit around their respective target moons .
PR : In terms of sending a probe down to the ice on Europa - or Ganymede - will you be able to do that on this mission ?
By comparing these two icy moons , both of which probably have oceans below their surfaces , we 'll learn much more than the sum of the parts
Dr Robert Pappalardo , Nasa JPL RP :
There is some consideration as to whether it will be possible to send a penetrator - which the UK is looking into - to the surfaces of Europa or Ganymede , or maybe both .
That would try to understand the ice properties and get in more detail at the chemistry .
Using seismology it would get at the exact thickness of the icy shells .
It 's uncertain whether that will come to fruition , but these spacecraft will set up the ability to send landers to these moons in the future .
So , to follow up on Europa and whether there really could be life there , one would want to send a lander to the surface of Europa that could dig down beneath the top layer of ice which is very processed by the radiation environment at Europa and get below that radiation - processed layer and understand what 's there .
Are there organic materials in that ice ?
PR : You 've mentioned the radiation environment , how difficult will it be to operate a spacecraft at Europa ?
It seems like one of the most hostile places to go in the Solar System .
RP : The radiation is the principal challenge to the Europa spacecraft .
We have to design a spacecraft that can operate in this very severe radiation environment .
The kinds of radiation - hardened parts for such a mission do exist .
The real challenge is to educate the community who will be proposing to build instruments for this mission on how to construct instruments which will be able to operate in this radiation environment .
We 've done it before - the Galileo spacecraft made many flybys of Europa and even of Io , which is even deeper in the radiation belts of Jupiter .
But never before has a spacecraft spent so much time - as this spacecraft will - in the vicinity of Europa ; something like a year we want the spacecraft to be able to function .
So , it 's a challenge , but it can be overcome and it's going to return spectacular results , really opening our eyes to how this icy satellite works and , for that matter the mission as a whole , as to how the Jovian system works .
Scientists want to understand whether Europa 's ice shell is thin ( l ) or thick ( r )
PR : How will the mission assess Europa 's habitability ?
What are some of the ways in which tidal heating affects the moon , for example ?
RP : This idea of how material moves from the bottom to the top ( of the ocean ) is pretty important .
That we could try to get at with radar sounding - ( to determine ) what 's going on inside the ice shell .
With regards to the issue of tidal heating , and how it 's distributed , if we can understand the 3D nature of the icy shell , we 'll understand better what these " chaos " regions are , for example .
One idea is that these chaotic regions are places where the ice has completely melted through .
Another idea is that they 're areas where tidal heating has been concentrated in pockets of warm ice that get tidally heated to the point where it runs away and partially melts .
By using gravity , we might be able to get at the topography of that seafloor and the local thickness of the ice shell and how it varies across the satellite .
Those get at issues of tidal heating .
If it 's extreme tidal heating like we have at Enceladus in the Saturn system , we might be able to measure the heat coming off the satellite itself .
In specific regions you might be able to find hotspots .
Again , exchange processes are very important : how do you get stuff from the oceans to the surface ?
Is it by melting ?
Is it by convection - where warm " blobs " of ice rise from the bottom to the top ?
If convection is going on , the ice shell must be about 20 km thick .
We want to understand if that means that material from the ocean can still get up to the surface .
Convection is a way that can happen - to dredge material up from the ocean to the surface .
If the ice shell 's thin and it 's melted in spots , it 's a direct transport .
But if it 's thick , we want to understand if convection is getting us material from the ocean to the surface .
And for that matter whether it can transport surface material rich in oxidants - which could be a fuel for any life that 's there - down to the ocean .
We want to try to understand the chemistry of Europa 's ocean by both infrared techniques and by trying to understand the composition of particles that make it from the surface up to the spacecraft .
Charged particles hit Europa 's surface and knock particles off to make a very thin atmosphere .
We can measure the composition of that atmosphere directly from the orbital spacecraft around Europa .
The ice shell of Europa has been cracked and shifted about
PR : What do you think of the prospects for finding sub- surface oceans on the moons Ganymede and Callisto ?
RP : The evidence from the Galileo spacecraft is that those satellites do also have subsurface oceans .
But they have n't been well characterised .
It 's the same as Europa : we really need to confirm it and characterise those oceans .
The best evidence for the oceans comes from the Galileo magnetometer experiment that says the subsurfaces of these moons are behaving like conductors , so there must be a salty water layer down there .
But Ganymede and Callisto are different beasts because they have thicker H20 layers in total ( ice plus water ) .
They are so thick that beneath the ocean layer there is more ice , but a higher density ice - a different form of ice that sinks relative to water .
So it 's an ocean sandwich , with the ocean at about 150 km depth , and then regular ice above and higher density forms of ice below .
Those oceans are n't expected to be in direct contact with rock below , which makes Europa 's ocean a more attractive place to think of in terms of habitability .
[ Ganymede is ] the only moon with its own magnetic field .
That implies a hot , convecting metal core down within Ganymede today
Also , with Ganymede and Callisto , the oceans are much deeper below the surface .
Europa's is thought to be maybe 20 km below the surface , wheras Ganymede 's and Callisto's should be something like 150 km .
It 's more difficult to characterise those oceans ; it 's much less likely - probably impossible - that radar would penetrate all the way to the oceans .
But we 'll be able to get at the shallow subsurface structure .
With magnetometry , we could better characterise the depth and thickness of those oceans .
We 'll be able to get some hints at composition , but it 's not yet clear if those oceans have erupted on to the surface somehow .
It 's much less likely that they 'll have melted all the way down , but maybe convection can dredge up material .
So those oceans are a little more mysterious , a little harder to get at .
But it makes an important comparison to Europa .
The real value will be to understand the context : how all these worlds relate , how they 're similar , how they 're different .
With Ganymede , a really important objective is to understand its magnetic field .
It 's the only moon with its own magnetic field .
That implies a hot , convecting metal core down within Ganymede today .
So understanding that magnetic field is going to tell us a lot about why is Ganymede hot and how does that relate to past activity of all the satellites with the goal of bringing together the big picture of the Jupiter system and how these moons relate to one other .
Io is the most volcanic place in the Solar System PR :
The mission will also investigate Jupiter 's moon Io .
What do we want to know about Io and the volcanic activity there ?
RP : Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System .
The plan is for the Nasa spacecraft to make three or four encounters with Io .
Getting at the composition is key .
From a fast flyby we should be able to directly get at the composition of the atmosphere .
We might even be able to fly through a plume and understand directly what is that stuff coming off
Io .
Then we can understand whether that is the stuff polluting Europa and understand the transport processes from Io to Europa .
Understanding the interior of Io is key .
We are going to have to see what is realistic from the close flybys , but there are ideas that might be able to test whether the interior of Io is really molten - as one model suggests .
How melted , how hot is that interior ?
Then , by understanding the distribution of volcanic centres , of the heat coming off
Io and where the volcanoes are , combining with past data from Galileo , we can get a better picture of where the tidal heating is distributed within
Io and a better idea of how the tidal heating process works .
That does n't need to be done in close flybys - that comes from monitoring Io over time .
We have two - and - a - half years in the Jupiter system before going into orbit around the satellites .
One can even get a handle on the composition from distant observations , in the ultraviolet and the infrared , by watching Io erupt .
PR : The community of scientists who study icy satellites has been wishing for a Europa mission for decades .
What does this mean to them ?
RP : It 's been a long , arduous effort to get to this point - to make the scientific case for the importance of Jupiter system exploration - and Europa and Ganymede in particular .
The scientific community is just thrilled to be able to move forward in exploration of the outer Solar System .
We see this as the next in a series of flagship missions to explore the outer Solar System .
In following up on Cassini 's discoveries at Saturn - especially the geysers of Enceladus and the methane - ethane lakes of Titan - we want to send a mission to explore Titan in detail and orbit that moon in future .
But it takes a long time and lots of money to get to the outer Solar System , so it will be little while before we 're ready to get back to Saturn and Titan , but it will happen .

The budding harmonica player will inevitably be confronted with important technical choices as he learns how to master his instrument .
One of these choices concerns the way he positions the harmonica to his mouth to produce single notes .
Two methods are especially widespread : the first is known as puckering or lip pursing , and the second is called tongue blocking .
In this article , I will focus on some of the characteristics of each technique that come to my attention .
The player learning harmonica will often adopt one of the two former single - note techniques according to personal preference .
I personally started by using the puckering technique , which requires the player use his lips to manage the air flow ( kind of like when whistling ) into a single hole of the harmonica .
A second more challenging technique , however , may be more advantageous in the long term : this technique is tongue blocking .
This technique , often associated with a " Chicago " blues style [ cf. Ricci , 3:00 ] , requires the player cover a greater part of the instrument 's mouthpiece with his lips and to block unneeded holes with his tongue .
Virtuoso classical harmonica player Franz Chmel is particularly fond of this last technique , and strongly recommends players to master it for technical reasons .
In his June 2001 lecture for the International Course for Concert Harmonica , Chmel expresses some of his basic opinions about the puckering vs. tongue blocking problem .
He lists four major advantages tongue blocking offers over puckering : volume , tone production , breathing and vibrato .
Here 's an extract from his lecture :
1 Volume
If you really want to play loudly [...] you can only achieve this with the tongue blocking method .
Because your tongue is blocking the holes , your lips can create much higher pressure on the mouth piece , and as a result there is higher pressure inside your mouth cavity .
( The louder you play in the puckering position -- and thus the higher the pressure is inside your mouth -- the firmer your lips need to be pressed onto the mouth piece , which substantially restricts tone production possibilities .
In the tongue blocking position , however , your tongue supports your lips considerably .
By putting your tongue on the mouth piece the whole mouth cavity is available for tone production . ) [ p.13 ]
2 Tone production
[...]
Changing the oral cavity allows for many different ton colours , ranging from hard to soft and delicate , from dark to light ... [ p.13 ]
3 Breathing technique
[...]
Players who use tongue blocking can compensate [ a lack or surplus of air ] by letting the air flow through their mouths while playing . [ p.13 ]
4 Vibrato
The most common vibrato of the harmonica is the hand vibrato which , however , is not a real vibrato in the true sense of the word .
In fact , the hand vibrato is a tremolo rather than a vibrato . [ p.13 ]
[...]
The throat vibrato has a serious disadvantage : it can not be produced over the whole range of the instrument .
While it is possible to produce in the octave above middle C , it is of limited use two octaves above middle C and , as far as I know , almost impossible to achieve outside these ranges . [ p.19 ]
Hence , if the player can master tongue blocking , it is in his opinion the technique which may allow the player to exploit the potentialities of the harmonica to the very highest degree .
If Chmel admits using the puckering technique as well , he encourages players to learn tongue blocking first because of how lip pursers generally find tongue blocking more difficult .
Here is how he describes his tongue blocking method :
I use the right side of my tongue to block the holes rather than the tip of my tongue , which clings to the left corner of my mouth ( so that air cannot escape on the left side unintentionally ) . [ p.13 ]
Hence , if one grants an authoritative quality to Chmel 's opinions , inasmuch his playing can be considered exemplary , tongue blocking appears to offer several advantages over the puckering technique .
Also , his lecture destroys the myth that tongue blocking is a technique which only applies to " Chicago blues harp players " .
A third single - note technique , often referred to as " U - block " also exists , for which documentation is unfortunately very difficult to find .
But Chmel simply considers it an intermediary technique for advanced players , somewhere in between puckering and tongue blocking .
Geico voice actor fired after insulting tea parties
Sometimes you have a headline that makes the rest of the story superfluous , but here 's the background .
Actor Lance Baxter , otherwise known as " D.C. Douglas , " currently known as the man who informs you how much Geico can save you on car insurance , left a message last month with FreedomWorks in which he asked the group how many " mentally retarded " people it had on staff and what it would do when a tea partyer " killed someone . "
On April 14 , FreedomWorks put his voicemail online .
Today , Douglas reports he 's been dropped from Geico 's campaign .
His dramatic news release is here ; he claims to have been motivated by " the recent gay and racial slurs slung by Tea Party members at Congressman Barney Frank and Representative John Lewis during the Health Care Reform Weekend , " and says he 's " open to any attorneys taking on this case pro bono .

In the midst of a rather anodyne episode , this one shot reminded me of what makes / made The Simpsons so brilliant .
For all the talk recently of a breach of America ’s special relationship with Israel and of how the Obama administration is putting unprecedented pressure on Israel and other such things , it ’s worth remembering that our tax dollars are going paying a significant chunk of Israel ’s national budget .
America provides approximately 4 % of Israel ’s total budget ( Source : Divide this number , $ 2.5 billion , by this number , total expenditures of $ 58.6 billion ) including approximately 15 % of the cost of the Israeli Defense Forces ( Source : Divide this number , $ 2.34 billion , by this number , $ 13.3 billion . )
Obama has never threatened to reduce the amount of aid we are giving to Israel – despite the fact that we have been facing an economic crisis and Netanyahu has , rather than acting as a loyal ally , been undermining Obama ’s foreign policy .
Obama has made no move to undermine the strategic alliance America has had with Israel ( right wing hysterics notwithstanding . )
But there is a junior partner in this relationship .
It is insanity for Israel for any country to commit to unilateral support no matter the actions of the beneficiary of its aid .
But , Netanyahu ’s government has demonstrated a pattern of undermining important alliances : with Turkey ( the publicly announced intention to humiliate Turkey ’s ambassador to Israel ) , with the United Arab Emirates ( by the assassination ) , with the United States ( by snubbing the Vice President of the United States ) , and with Brazil ( as the foreign minister boycotted a speech by President Lula . )
Fareed Zakaria concludes from this that Netanyahu “ is actually not serious about the Iranian threat . ”
If tackling the rise of Iran were his paramount concern , would he have allowed a collapse in relations with the United States , the country whose military , political , and economic help is indispensable in confronting this challenge ?
If taking on Iran were his central preoccupation , would n’t he have subordinated petty domestic considerations and done everything to bolster ties with the United States ?
Bibi likes to think of himself as Winston Churchill , warning the world of a gathering storm .
But he should bear in mind that Churchill ’s single obsession during the late 1930s was to strengthen his alliance with the United States , whatever the costs , concessions , and compromises he had to make .
In a smart piece of analysis in Israel ’s Haaretz newspaper , Anshel Pfeffer , no fan of the Obama administration , writes , “ When senior ministers or generals list Israel ’s defense priorities , there is always one point on which there exists total consensus :
The alliance with the United States as the nation ’s greatest strategic asset , way above anything else .
It is more crucial than the professionalism of the Israel Defense Forces , than the peace treaty with Egypt and even than the secret doomsday weapons that we may or may not have squirreled away somewhere …
But [ Netanyahu ] has succeeded in one short year in power to plunge Israel ’s essential relationship with the United States to unheard of depths . ”
The Obama administration has reiterated again and again that it remains committed to America ’s special relationship with Israel .
As it should .
Israel has a thriving economy , is one of the regional superpowers ( the other being Iran ) , has historic ties to America , and shares many of our values .
Throwing around charges of anti-Semitism as the right wing does in America and as Netanyahu and his associates have been alleged to do , is shameful .
As Barack Obama ( whose introduction of a presidential Seder was profiled in the New York Times over the weekend ) , Andrew Sullivan , and J Street have all demonstrated to be pro-Israel is not to be pro-Likudnik :
There is a very honest , thoughtful debate taking place inside Israel … Understandably , because of the pressure that Israel is under , I think the US pro-Israel community is sometimes a little more protective or concerned about opening up that conversation .
But all I ’m saying though is that actually ultimately should be our goal , to have that same clear eyed view about how we approach these issues .
This is precisely what we are lacking :
An honest and forthright dialogue about our strategic interests and alliance .

I was sixty pages into Understanding Comics when I realized it had already earned a spot in my top - ten favorite nonfiction books .
Do n’t ask me what the other nine are because I had never thought about my top - ten favorite nonfiction books until that moment .
I just know that Understanding Comics : The Invisible Art is one of them .
This is a graphic novel about the theory , history , and art of comic books .
What hooked me though was McCloud ’s presentation of how the human mind handles images and language , and he does it within the comic format .
It is nothing short of genius .
McCloud begins the book trying to answer the question “ what is comics ? ”
The definition he comes up with is “ juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence , intended to convey information and / or produce an aesthetic response in the viewer . ”
He goes on to examine that definition by looking at how comics have evolved through human history , from the Aztecs to the 1400s to modern day .
What we often consider to be a childish form of entertainment today is a form of communication that seems to have been natural to humans since our beginning .
And McCloud argues that comics are a legitimate art form that has largely gone unstudied .
It is chapter two that begins to look deeper into how images affect us .
I found it fascinating , and like I said , by chapter three I was hooked .
McCloud ’s theories are not really new .
Marshall McLuhan , Will Eisner , Neil Postman , and others have written about how media affects us , but McCloud ’s presentation makes all the difference for me .
What ’s Marshall McLuhan ’s famous saying ?
The medium is the message ?
McCloud goes into the theory , the nuts and bolts if you will , of comics making - panel arrangement , the different types of transitions , the style of art , time , line , and color .
What keeps all of this accessible to those of us who are n’t artists is the fact that McCloud always brings it back to how the reader is a participant in all of this .
A discussion on how time is handled in comics did n’t mean much to me until I saw how I create the time and motion from the ink on the paper .
Another recurring theme is how all of this is a relatively new art form in terms of being examined and pushed to its limits .
Novels , poetry , music , art - virtually everything that could be done has been done .
McCloud argues that comics still have a lot of unexplored territory .
He touches on how some artists and writers have experimented with the aforementioned aspects of comics , like time and color .
He encourages new writers and artists to do more .
I would have loved to have used this book when I taught High School English .
I ’m sure it would have saved the lives of some of the gang members I taught .
As an English major , I feel slightly cheated that this was n’t in the curriculum .
It should be required reading in College English classes , but as McCloud states , new art forms are judged by their predecessors .
Any study of language , art , and what it means to humans would greatly benefit from Understanding Comics .
Am I laying it on too thick ?
I ca n’t say enough good things about his book .
Art Spiegelman , author of Maus , writes this :
Cleverly disguised as an easy - to - read comic book , Scott McCloud ’s simple - looking tome deconstructs the secret language of comix while casually revealing secrets of Time , Space , Art , and the Cosmos !
The most intelligent comix I ’ve seen in a long time .
The Cosmos , people .
It does n’t get any better than that .

The Vatican prime minister who made comments Monday linking homosexuality to paedophilia has been severely criticized by gay rights activists around the world .
Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone
... many others have shown , I have recently been told , that there is a relationship between homosexuality and pedophilia — Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone
The official , Holy See secretary of state , Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , said yesterday that instead of celibacy , homosexuality was responsible for recent allegations of child abuse by Catholic priests .
He said , on a televised broadcast in Chile , that " Many psychologists and psychiatrists have shown that there is no link between celibacy and paedophilia but many others have shown , I have recently been told , that there is a relationship between homosexuality and paedophilia .
This pathology is one that touches all categories of people , and priests to a lesser degree in percentage terms . "
He also claimed to have documents of scientific studies proving his claims .
His statements were immediately criticized by several gay rights groups in both South America and Europe .
The president of Italy 's largest such group , Arcigay , Paolo Patané , says " The equation between homosexuality and paedophilia is a false , despicable and anti-scientific statement that affects the lives and dignity of millions of gay and lesbian people .
It confirms the cynicism and cruelty of the Vatican hierarchies , which have covered sex crimes committed by members of the church for years throughout the world against thousands of innocent boys and girls " .
Gaylib , a conservative gay group , condemned the statement , saying that it was " worrying that the foreign minister of a state that occupies the heart of the Italian capital would use arguments that are considered passé even in the Third World . "
The president of Chilean gay rights group , Movement for Homosexual Integration and Liberation in Chile , Rolando Jiménez , said that the statement was " a perverse strategy by the Vatican to shirk its own ethical and legal responsibility by making a spurious and disgusting connection . "
[ Bertone is ] clumsily trying to shift attention to homosexuality and away from the focus on new crimes against children that emerge every day — Aurelio Mancuso , former president of an Italian gay rights group
The cardinal 's statements are not the first time the Catholic Church has made allegations of a link between homosexuality and paedophilia .
In 2005 , the Vatican prohibited men from becoming priests if they " showed deeply rooted homosexual tendencies . "
The move came shortly after a major child abuse scandal in the United States , and the move was seen as implicitly linking homosexuality with paedophilia .

A male guppy from the upper mountain streams of Trinidad ; upstream males are brightly colored compared to downstream males and , like females , grow more slowly , are more herbivorous , and live longer than downstream fish .
( Photo : FSU Department of Biological Science )
In the natural stream communities of Trinidad , guppy populations live close together , but evolve differently .
Upstream , fewer predators mean more guppies but less food for each ; they grow slowly and larger , reproduce later and less , and die older .
Downstream , where predators thrive , guppies eat more , grow rapidly , stay small , reproduce quickly and die younger .
While it is clear to ecologists that an ecosystem shapes the evolution of animals living in it , population biology experts such as Joseph Travis of The Florida State University believe the reverse can also be true , making the relationship between evolution and ecology a model of reciprocity .
Now , he can prove it .
The evidence comes from an experiment in evolution that Travis designed with David N. Reznick of the University of California - Riverside and their fellow members of an interdisciplinary research team .
Findings from the study expand the body of knowledge about the interactions between evolution and ecology by demonstrating that evolutionary adaptations can also act as triggers for a cascade of in - tandem changes to both ecosystem and animal .
In the experiment , led by Ronald D. Bassar of UC - Riverside , the team used artificial streams — filled with the same spring water and insect larvae found in Trinidad 's natural habitats — to examine whether genetically distinct guppies from upstream or downstream had different effects on ecosystem processes .
They compared the two types of guppies because earlier work showed that the little freshwater fish could evolve rapidly from a downstream " type " to an upstream " type . "
The Lower La Laja River in Trinidad is one of four streams used as guppy introduction sites .
( Photo : Pierson Hill , FSU Department of Biological Science )
The team found dramatic differences between the effects of each type of guppy on the nutrient cycles and overall productivity of the stream ecosystems .
Travis said the results , which emerged very rapidly during the experiment , predict that the team 's larger experiment — introducing downstream guppies to upstream habitats — will show that evolutionary change also will drive substantial changes in the ecosystem at the same time .
" Within just four weeks , the two types of guppies drove the parameters of the artificial streams in very different directions , " said Travis , the dean of Florida State 's College of Arts and Sciences and a distinguished professor in its Department of Biological Science .
The study is described in the Feb. 1 , 2010 , online edition of the journal PNAS ( Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ) .
It was funded by a five - year , $ 5 million grant from the National Science Foundation 's Integrative Biological Research ( FIBR ) program .
It is essential that scientists better understand the evolution - ecology feedback loop and the surprising speed with which an ecosystem can be altered by adaptations in a species that populates it , said Travis , because so many animals and plants are evolving in response to ecosystem changes caused by humans .
As an example , he points to the overharvesting of fish , which can cause some species to get smaller and die younger , which in turn could alter their ecosystem via a feedback loop that might eventually mean no fish to harvest at all .
" Evolution can be very fast , " he said .
" When our research team started this project , we already knew that downstream guppies mature earlier , make more and smaller babies , have less colorful males , and tend to be more carnivorous and less herbivorous than upstream guppies .
Past work by David Reznick , our study 's principal investigator , showed that if you take downstream guppies and introduce them to pools upstream with no guppies , the descendents of those founders will evolve to look like upstream guppies in a few dozen generations . "
Travis and team hoped that their experiment would reveal whether the two types of guppies , upstream and downstream , were different enough that switching out one for the other would cause substantial changes in ecosystem processes .
They collected guppies from the two different Trinidadian stream communities and placed them in the replicate , artificial streams that they 'd built alongside the corresponding natural habitats .
" We also were careful to calibrate any effects against purely environmental differences , such as what one might see if we compared different , naturally occurring densities of guppies in both natural upstream and more crowded downstream conditions , " Travis said .
" So , our experiment simultaneously compared the ecological effects of guppies of each type in two densities , one double the other .
That design enabled us to learn whether the changes we saw in the ecosystem processes were caused by the natural differences in guppy density or the differences in the guppy ' type . ' "
" Type " mattered .
For instance , because downstream guppies ate more insect larvae and less plant material , they excreted more nitrogen and less phosphorus .
" The combined effects of different grazing and different fertilization patterns served to change algal growth rates , detritus decay rates — because guppies can eat the little animals that eat decaying leaves — and the overall oxygen consumption rates in the ecosystem , " Travis said .
" The evolutionary effects we documented are so large that an ecologist can no longer say , ' Sure , you evolutionary guys can show some effect from genetically based differences , but those effects are small in the big scheme of things . '
Well , they are n't small .
The changes generated by the new guppy species are at least as great as those found by doubling the density of existing guppies .
" We also show that the standard approach to theory in ecology and evolution , which is to say , ' Let 's keep ecological variables constant and study evolution ' or ' Let 's keep evolutionary variables constant and study ecology , ' is n't necessarily a good approximation for reality , " Travis said .
" We now know that evolutionary effects and ecological effects can unfold on comparable time scales . "
Next , the researchers will examine how the feedback loop from the changed ecosystem shapes a new round of local adaptations in the relocated guppies .
The PNAS paper " Local adaptation in Trinidadian guppies alters ecosystem processes " was co-authored by Travis and research team colleagues from Cornell University , the universities of Nebraska and Georgia , Drexel University and Siena College , as well as UC - Riverside .

" I'm a little nervous about that to be honest with you , " Woods told ESPN 's Tom Rinaldi , who asked him what he expects when he returns to golf on April 8 following an auto accident which led to an indefinite leave from professional golf and an admission of multiple affairs .
" It would be nice to hear a couple claps here and there . "
Woods conducted two interviews Sunday afternoon at Isleworth , the golf club near his home in Windermere , Fla .
In addition to ESPN , Woods spoke with the Golf Channel .
The interview was offered to ESPN with no restrictions on questions , but with a five - minute time limitation , plus an agreement to hold it for airing on television beginning at 7:30 p.m. ET .
Woods has n't been questioned by reporters since he was involved in a one - car crash outside his Florida home in the early - morning hours of Nov. 27 .
He declined to answer questions about the specifics of the accident .
" Well , it 's all in the police report , " he said .
" Beyond that everything 's between [ wife ] Elin and myself and that 's private . "
He also would n't get into specifics about his infidelity , though he did tell Rinaldi that " just one is enough ... and obviously that was n't the case . "
After his auto accident , Woods admitted to infidelity and said Dec. 11 he would take an " indefinite break " from golf .
Woods spoke publicly for the first time Feb. 19 , when he confessed to cheating on his wife .
But he did n't take any questions after his 13 - plus - minute statement .
" I hurt a lot of people , not just my wife , " he told Rinaldi on Sunday .
" My friends , my colleagues , the public , kids who looked up to me .
There were a lot of people that thought I was a different person and my actions were not according to that .
That 's why I had to apologize .
I was so sorry for what I had done . "
He was in a Mississippi clinic from Dec. 31 until Feb. 11 , then went to an Arizona clinic for a week of family counseling after his Feb. 19 statement .
He did n't say what he was in treatment for , but did say " It was really tough to look at yourself in a light you never want to look at yourself , that 's pretty brutal . "
Woods denied that any of his associates were involved in his off - the - course affairs .
" It was all me , " he told the Golf Channel .
" I 'm the one who did it .
I 'm the one who acted the way I acted .
No one knew what was going on when it was going on .
" I 'm sure if more people would have known in my inner circle , they would have stopped it or tried to put a stop to it .
But I kept it all to myself , " he said .

But that has n’t stopped one Photoshop wizard from flipping Yorke ’s role , placing the eco-conscious frontman at the center of his own masterpiece .
The video , a time - lapse rendering of Yorke created via Photoshop , is set to a soundtrack of Radiohead tunes .
An acoustic rendition of The Bends ’ “ Street Spirit ( Fade Out ) ” and OK Computer ’s “ Karma Police ” has been launched from relative obscurity to one of Technorati.com ’s highest ranked video ’s across the web .
While entertaining , amazing , and , to some bloggers , motivating , the time - lapse video also garners critical comments from bloggers who shout falsity and praise graspable physical art while detesting , in a semi- hypocritical fashion , digital art — a situation likely summed up by Yorke and Co. in an obscure OK Computer B - side .

What other musician should this Photoshop extraordinaire tackle ?
( CNN ) --
In the midst of first lady Michelle Obama 's campaign against child obesity and chef Jamie Oliver 's prime - time TV initiative for cleaner cooking , a chicken chain is crowing about some aggressively fat - laden fare .
KFC 's long - rumored Double Down waddles into stores on April 12 , boasting an ingredient list that prompted a copywriters ' caveat on the product 's
Web page that it is " Real !
No fooling . "
The bun - free ( " so meaty , there 's no room " ) sandwich features two pieces of bacon , two slices of melted cheese and " Colonel 's Sauce " - which KFC officials said is a " zesty mayonnaise " -- slathered between two chicken filets , either original recipe ( 540 calories and 32 fat grams per KFC.com ) or the slightly slimmer grilled version ( 460 calories and 23 fat grams ) .
Response from around the Internet ranges from Consumerist.com 's " mysteriously tempting ( and potentially lethal ) " and the Huffington Post 's " going too far " to the Lincoln Journal Star 's " fast - food - related crimes against humanity , " but KFC 's gamble on the Double Down 's outré appeal to calorie scoffers seems downright chicken in light of a new baseball concession pitched by the Toledo Mud Hens .
At a March 24 press conference , V / Gladieux Enterprises , the catering company that services Fifth Third Field announced a sundae , " Which is fifteen scoops of Toft 's ice cream served in a full size souvenir helmet for $ 25 .
It will serve 1 to 8 fans , you can enjoy by yourselves if you love ice cream or share with family and friends . "
Food court city :
How does where you live affect what you eat ?
A solo at - bat with the Fifth Third Fanatic Freeze would average 2,325 calories , based on a ½- cup scoop size -- before a grand slam addition of whipped cream , hot fudge , rainbow sprinkles , peanuts , and cherries .
Dessert not on the roster ?
That same full - sized batting helmet can switch - hit as a bowl for cheese - drenched Fifth Third Nachos -- a perfect snack after you 've finished running the bases the approximately 341 times it would take a 150 - pound person to burn off the aforementioned ice cream .
The Mud Hens and KFC's Colonel are hardly the first food vendors to flip a big ol ' bird at the calorie cops .
Here are a few that have flown outrageously afoul over the past few years .
Burger King : Meat 'normous Omelet Sandwich
The King did n't just come slinging a brand new portmanteau of " meat " and " enormous " with this limited - time item .
Starting in 2005 , the now - discontinued breakfast bomb came loaded with two eggs , one sausage patty , two slices of ham , three slices of bacon and two slices of American cheese on a long , toasted bun .
That 's 770 calories , 47 fat grams and a near guarantee of waking up in a cold sweat from a food coma nightmare starring that creepy , plastic - masked King .
Taco Bell Chicken Ranch Taco Salad
A salad sounds pretty sensible , right ?
Depends on what you mean by " salad . "
A cheeky 2009 commercial for the chain 's crispy tortilla - swaddled heaps of rice , beans , cheese , meat and additional tortilla strips defined the dish as " technically a salad " due to the presence of some lettuce shreds buried under the other ingredients .
The Bell 's 54 fat - grammed Chicken Ranch Taco Salad is the second most caloric item on the menu , weighing in at 910 , but comes served , improbably , with reduced fat sour cream .
GCS Ballpark : Luther Burger
Baseball 's Best Burger
In 2006 , Sauget IL 's Frontier League baseball team , the Gateway Grizzlies paired up with Krispy Kreme Donuts to pay homage to the Luther Burger , popularized at Atlanta 's Mulligan 's restaurant .
The multi-meal mash - up consists of a thick , bacon - and - cheese - topped burger patty , stuffed inside a sliced , glazed donut .
It 's estimated to weigh in around 1,000 calories with 45 grams of fat .
It was declared by professional face - stuffer Adam Richman of Travel Channel 's Man v. Food to be " deliciously psychotic . "
Hardee's : Monster Thickburger
Hardee 's CEO Andrew Pudzer told CNBC upon the Thickburger 's 2004 debut that the 1,320 - calorie , 95 - fat - gram sandwich was " not a burger for tree huggers . "
After downing two 1/3 - pound beef patties , four strips of bacon and three slices of American cheese stacked on a mayonnaise - slathered bun , it seems unlikely that many eaters would be able to summon the strength to walk outside to a wooded area -- let along sling their arms around it .
The chain also offers a bun -free , lettuce - wrapped 1/3 - pound Low Carb Thickburger , should one of those wacky health nuts insist upon coming along for lunch .
Players will face old and new enemies of the Doctor Doctor Who will be regenerating earlier than expected - this time into a character in a computer game .
Writers from the hit BBC show have joined forces with videogame creator Charles Cecil to come up with four interactive episodes of the show .
It is part of the BBC 's drive to increase computer literacy among those who are n't regular net users .
The creators of Doctor Who : The Adventure Games hope it will bring new people into computer gaming .
" Establishing new forms of drama is exactly what the BBC should be doing , " said Simon Nelson , head of BBC multiplatform in Vision .
" By aiming these interactive episodes at the broad audience of the TV show - unique in British television , in that it encompasses at least three generations - we 're aiming to encourage the family to gather round the PC or Mac in the same way they do the television , " he added .
The four two - hour dramas will allow fans to take on the role of the Doctor , enter different universes and fight some new enemies .
Matt Smith , who plays the Doctor and Karen Gillan , who plays companion Amy , have provided voice - overs .
The first of the games , developed by UK game designer Sumo Digital , will be available for free download via the Doctor Who website in June .
The first episode of the new series of Doctor Who was broadcast on 3 April and was watched by more than eight million viewers , according to the BBC .

The other day I was reading a great roundup of projected and wanted features in the upcoming Android 2.2 Froyo release , over at AndroidAndMe .
The author , Taylor Wimberly , was going over what he thought was likely to be included next and then mentioned something about the Nexus One that instantly intrigued me .
He said :
I spoke with Google ’s Eric Tseng during CES and he told me there were many secrets left in the Nexus One that we would discover later .
Could it be that Google has loaded Nexus One with unactivated , hidden features , making the crowd favorite device into Pandora 's box ?
Just when you thought you figured your little companion out inside and out , it turns into a mysterious stranger .
Nexus One With Wireless -N
The first such secret got uncovered when we found out that the Wi-Fi / Bluetooth chipset Google and HTC put into the Nexus One is none other than the Broadcom BCM4329 , which has hardware to support both 802.11n and FM radio .
Google officially only supports b/g , as evident from the current specs .
Yesterday , Google and Broadcom released an updated version of the driver for Android , and in a flash , Cyanogen has been able to integrate it into his CyanogenMod ROM for the Nexus One , getting 802.11n running without a hitch .
In his reply to our tweet asking for clarification , Cyanogen pointed out that it's the following 2 changes by the Broadcom committer to the Android source tree that made this possible :
@kmobs , another Android developer quickly compiled CyanogenMod with the new changes and threw it up on his Nexus one in a quick video review :
So what does it mean to an average Nexus One user ?
You can wait for the latest official version of CyanogenMod to be released , flash your phone with it , and enjoy the new functionality ( this is the beauty of custom ROMs for Android - quick turnaround time ) .
Or if you do n't want to flash a custom ROM , you can wait for Google to add support into the official Android version which make take any amount of time - possibly even months .
Nexus One With FM Radio
So if the Broadcom chip supports FM radio besides the 802.11n Wi -Fi , is there support for it seen somewhere on the horizon ?
And before you say " who needs FM radio on a 3G phone ? " , consider how often you lose your 3G reception , how many people in other countries do n't even have data plans , and how many stations do n't broadcast online .
Finally , if you are not convinced there is demand for FM radio on the phone , check out these 2 Google support threads full of users pleading for its support : thread 1 , thread 2 .
Neither Google nor Broadcom has made it clear yet whether they would be interested in supporting and enabling FM radio , so at this point we are unsure whether it would be coming .
However , if we find out that the Droid Incredible , which already supports FM radio also sports the same Broadcom chip , it might not take Cyanogen or another ROM developer long to figure out how to take it out of one HTC phone and add it to another .
More Undiscovered Nexus One Secrets
What other undiscovered secrets can the Nexus One have in store for us ?
Nexus One Video- Out
My first guess would be support for video - out , the same way the Droid Incredible supports it via a MicroUSB - HDMI adapter .
Since Nexus
One can play 720 p video , there should be nothing but software stopping it from being able to support video - out .
We asked HTC for a more official response , and , as expected , it came back negative for now :
I understand how important it can be to receive information on using video out functionality on the HTC Nexus One .
Unfortunate this HTC Device does not have the hardware or software to support the Video out functionality .
Please keep updated on the support page for your Nexus One at www.htc.com/www to receive information on future updates or work a round for your HTC Device
No dice yet , but we 're not losing hope .
What else do you think the Nexus One is hiding ?
The trial of Astrid Finch is seen as a test case for prostitutes ' safety A massage parlour boss who offered " happy endings " has been cleared of running a brothel from her bungalow .
Claire Astrid Finch , 49 , of Chalton Heights in Chalton , Bedfordshire , was found not guilty at Luton Crown Court of keeping a brothel for prostitution .
She took out adverts in newspapers and on the internet , selling topless massage " with happy endings " .
She told the court she wanted to work with other women for the sake of " safety " and " camaraderie " .
Ms Finch had denied keeping a brothel from November 2004 to November 2008 and was unanimously cleared by the jury .
On 19 November 2008 , she was arrested in a police raid on the bungalow in a quiet cul - de-sac .
This has been 16 months of sheer hell for me but today I have had my own happy ending
Claire Finch
Up to four other middle aged women would work from the property , but Ms Finch told police she did not provide other services but some of her colleagues did .
She would take a fee to pay for use of the premises and newspaper advertising .
The prosecution alleged Ms Finch worked as a prostitute for many years .
Anna Morris , for the defence , said her client had opened up her home because of concern for the safety of herself and others .
Ms Morris highlighted 18 incidents of serious violence against sex workers in Bedfordshire over a four - year period and said that was the " tip of the iceberg " .
' Victory for women ' Miss
Finch told the jury : " I wanted to work with a second person .
It is not only safety , it is camaraderie .
" It was n't all sex .
A lot of clients said they like to come because it was clean and safe . "
Outside court the mother of two said : " This is a victory for women who want to do this work from the safety of their houses .
" This has been 16 months of sheer hell for me but today I have had my own happy ending .
" I will now do whatever I can to campaign to have the law changed . "
The International Prostitutes Collective said : " This not guilty verdict greatly strengthens the case for prostitution to be decriminalised so that women are able to work more safely together as in New Zealand . "

A TTC etiquette campaign the TTC does n't know about ( with printable posters )
Etiquette is n't just for fancy dinner parties ; it 's something that one should think about at all times , especially when out in public .
To that end , New York artist Jason Shelowitz has recently plastered etiquette posters , reminding citizens of proper behaviour in the public area that needs it the most — the subway system .
Recognizing ( stealing ) a great idea when we see it , we here at the Post think the TTC deserves ( needs ) a similar campaign .
So , we have loosely formed the Toronto Transit Civility Commission , the TTCC , to remind the public of the responsibilities inherent in travelling with fellow " human " beings .
The TTCC are now proud to unveil our first three posters , which you can download below at full - resolution , printable sizes !
You can totally print them out and do , I do n't know , whatever you want with them !
Legal things !
And send your etiquette pet peeves to us at thecity@nationalpost.com !
We can posterize your peeve , possibly !
But remember , this is n't aimed at TTC staff .
That 's a whole other ball of etiquette wax .

Michael 's Dispatches Warthog
Details Published : Tuesday , 23 March 2010 10:37
Page 1 of 3
Kandahar , Afghanistan
23 March 2010
The mission required crossing a bridge that had been blown up a couple hours earlier by a suicide car bomber .
The attacker hit a convoy from the 82nd Airborne , killing American soldier Ian Gelig .
Now with a hole in the bridge and recovery operations underway , our mission was cancelled .
So I called the Air Force to see if they were busy .
Yes , it turns out , the Air Force is busy every day , but Captain Kristen Duncan took me down to the ramp where the A - 10 “ Warthogs ” are parked .
Two pilots were gearing up to fly from Kandahar over to neighboring Helmand to support a British unit .
The A - 10 “ Warthogs ” are slow — not supersonic — but fantastically agile .
The aircraft dart like dragonflies and seem to change direction against the laws of physics .
The A - 10s can turn so fast that they can break the laws of healthy physiology , and can cause a pilot to pass out and crash his airplane .
And so pilots wear G - suits to help counter adverse fluid dynamics .
The helmets offer no ballistic protection .
Helmets that ground troops wear can stop bullets , and have done so in Iraq and Afghanistan on many occasions , usually knocking out the wearer .
I remember a Marine Major in Mosul who got shot in the head .
He said it knocked him out cold .
He said it was n’t pleasant getting shot in the head , but he was downtown in Mosul back in the action when I asked about it .
Army Lieutenant Colonel Terry Jamison also got shot in the helmet in the same city , Mosul .
When I asked LTC Jamison about getting shot while flying his Kiowa Warrior helicopter , he said the bullet somehow missed his head but ventilated his helmet .
( I saw the helmet . )
Pilots wear light helmets because of the hard turns , plus some high - G accidents can cause neck injuries .
Lieutenant Colonel Eric Murphy is an A - 10 pilot from Baltimore .
Lt Col Murphy flies with the 104th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron from the Maryland National Guard .
In his day job , “ Captain ” Eric Murphy is a commercial pilot who flies A320s but today he ’s not flying British tourists traveling within the United States .
He ’s going to Helmand Province to cover the British “ Royal Welsh . ” I remembered some Royal Welsh from Iraq .
There had been much fighting .
A lot of killing that went both ways .
They had been Men of Valor .
As Lt Col Murphy crawled in , I wished him luck in covering the British , but did n’t say that some of those British soldiers are my personal friends .
It was good to see the A - 10s heading out there .
The Brits appreciate it .
Flare dispensers under each wing .
A - 10s have more tricks than Harry Potter , such as the flares designed to lure heat - seeking missiles away from the engines .
Over these battlefields , pilots often pop the flares as “ We see you ” warnings to the enemy .
If the enemy is in the open and no civilians are around , they are unlikely to get a friendly flare warning , but sometimes it ’s better to hold off on the big weapons ; the enemy might be fighting from a built - up area .
Today , Lt Col Murphy ’s 30 mm cannon is loaded with 1,150 rounds .
The 30 mm can destroy tanks , but believe it or not , typically will not penetrate the walls around Afghan homes .
When the 30 mm fires , it ’s almost unbelievable .
The bullets do n’t fly in a laser - like stream , but sort of spray in a lethal mist , as if the cannon is shot - painting a swath with huge bullets .
If the enemy is in the open , the cannon is like a weapon of mass destruction .
When people are hit with M - 16 bullets , the wound is often more like a couple small holes , but when bodies get hit with weapons this large , they fly in pieces .
A - 10 cannons are tilted down so that the pilot can fly level while strafing .
This is important :
In Mosul , in 2004 , an F - 14 was strafing downtown after a massive truck bomb in December and many other bad surprises ( I was not there ) , and the pilot told me he was fixated on the target .
Since the F - 14 cannon is tilted up for “ Top Gun ” air combat , the pilot had to nose down the F - 14 and was diving straight into the target and nearly crashed .
The hard turn to avoid crashing damaged his aircraft and the pilot had difficulty landing on the aircraft carrier later that night .
Since the A - 10 gun is tilted down , it can fly level and strafe without accidentally crashing into the target .
Lt Cols Tim Eddins and Eric Murphy climb up the telescoping ladder into their jets and go through one of many checklists .
Watching Air Force missions and all the checklists is reminiscent of watching space launches .
Checklist after checklist of obscure terms .
Occasionally they say things normal people might recognize , like “ brakes . ”
MOSCOW — Kyrgyzstan has essentially reversed a decision to close an American air base that is central to the NATO mission in nearby Afghanistan , after the United States acceded to sharply higher rent and to minor restrictions on the site , Kyrgyz and American officials said Tuesday .
The turnabout is a victory for the Obama administration as it seeks to step up operations to quell the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan .
The Kyrgyz government had ordered the base closed in February , apparently under pressure from the Kremlin , which has resented the deep American military presence in an area of the world that it has long considered its zone of influence .
The Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan has been used since 2001 as a refueling stop and transit hub for operations in Afghanistan .
Thousands of personnel and roughly 500 tons of cargo pass through the base each month .
It has also been a focal point in the struggle between the United States and Russia for influence in the countries of the former Soviet Union .
Russia pledged a $ 2 billion loan to Kyrgyzstan on the day in February that the Kyrgyz president announced that the United States would be evicted from the base .
Read More About New ZealandNew Zealand ’s economic freedom score is 84.1 , making its economy the 3rd freest in the 2020 Index .
Its overall score has decreased by 0.3 point , with small declines in scores for property rights , judicial effectiveness , and government integrity slightly offsetting an improved government spending score .
New Zealand is ranked 3rd among 42 countries in the Asia–Pacific region , and its overall score is well above the regional and world averages .
Politically , this frustration is epitomized by the Tea Party movement .
It may have some legitimate concerns ( taxation , the role of government , etc. ) , but its message is lost in the madness .
And now the anemic Republican establishment , covetous of the Tea Party ’s passion , is moving to absorb it , not admonish it .
Instead of jettisoning the radical language , rabid bigotry and rising violence , the Republicans justify it .
( They do n’t want to refute it as much as funnel it . )
There may be a short - term benefit in this strategy , but it ’s a long - term loser .
A Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday took a look at the Tea Party members and found them to be just as anachronistic to the direction of the country ’s demographics as the Republican Party .
For instance , they were disproportionately white , evangelical Christian and “ less educated ... than the average Joe and Jane Six - Pack . ”
This at a time when the country is becoming more diverse ( some demographers believe that 2010 could be the first year that most children born in the country will be nonwhite ) , less doctrinally dogmatic , and college enrollment is through the roof .
The Tea Party , my friends , is not the future .
You may want “ your country back , ” but you ca n’t have it .
That sound you hear is the relentless , irrepressible march of change .
Welcome to America : The Remix .
By Calvin Palmer
Sixty - five years after the Second World War ended , it is still invoked to further political arguments even though those who fought in the conflict – the Greatest Generation — are dwindling in number .
The financial crisis in Greece has plunged the country into crisis and it faces a bail - out by the EU .
The Germans have been among Greece ’s harshest critics following the announcement that its budget deficit was four times the level laid down by the eurozone .
Needless to say such criticism has not gone down well with the Greeks .
Theodoros Pangalos , deputy prime minister , said Germany had no right to reproach Greece for anything after it devastated the country under the Nazi occupation .
“ They took away the gold that was in the Bank of Greece , and they never gave it back , ” Pangalos said .
“ They should n’t complain so much about stealing and not being very specific about economic dealings . ”
Andreas Peschke , spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry , rejected the accusations by saying Germany had paid Greece the equivalent of more than € 4.4 billion ( $ 5.9 billion ) in formal war reparations and compensation for slave laborers .
“ A discussion of the past is not of great help in resolving Greece ’s problems , ” he added .
German media have not helped to pour oil on troubled waters .
Earlier this month , Stern magazine published an article that accused the Greeks of frittering away German taxpayers ’ savings .
Another German magazine , Focus , further published a front cover that depicted a statue of the Venus de Milo making an obscene gesture under the title “ Greek cheats . ”
Greek newspaper Eleftheros Typos responded to the Focus front cover by printing a doctored photograph of the statue atop Berlin ’s Victory Column holding a swastika .
German ambassador to Greece , Wolfgang Scultheiss , was summoned to Parliament for a dressing down by the speaker , Filippos Petsalnikos , who speaker described the German coverage as “ offensive ” and “ surpassing all limits ” .
The Mayor of Athens , Nikitas Kaklamanis , has also waded into the dispute .
“ You [ Germany ] owe us 70bn euros for the ruins you left behind , ” he said .
The Greek Consumers ’ Federation has called on shoppers to boycott German goods .
The Greeks feel aggrieved that the country ’s crisis is largely due to outside forces such as the financial markets and the EU .
In a world where the “ Do n’t Blame Me ” mentality is the norm , Greek anger is , perhaps , understandable .
Germany ’s concerns stem from a widely - held belief that , as Europe ’s largest economy , it will eventually have to foot the bill for Greece ’s economic laxity .

Fighting a social media addiction
Here was the challenge given to 200 University of Maryland students from a variety of majors : Abstain from social media for 24 hours .
That meant no iPhone or text messaging .
No laptops or netbooks .
No Gchatting or Twittering .
No e-mail and absolutely no Facebook .
Ah , a return to simplicity .
But just read the blogs these students wrote after the traumatic experience -- it 's very easy to confuse these students with crack addicts who went cold - turkey , smokers not given the comfort of a patch while quitting , alcoholics forced to dry up .
The university 's new release on the study last week reported that some descriptions popped up over and over : " In withdrawal .
Frantically craving .
Very anxious .
Extremely antsy .
Miserable .
Jittery .
Crazy . "
" I clearly am addicted and the dependency is sickening , " one student said .
Another student had to fight the urge to check e-mail : " I noticed physically , that I began to fidget , as if I was addicted to my iPod and other media devices , and maybe I am . "
The study -- " 24 Hours : Unplugged " -- was conducted by the university 's International Center for Media & the Public Agenda in late February and early March .
Researchers found that American college students struggle to function without their media connection to the world .
" We were surprised by how many students admitted that they were ' incredibly addicted ' to media , " said Susan D. Moeller , a journalism professor and director of the center , said in the university 's news report on the study .
Students found themselves surrounded by new technology and blaring TVs , even when they were trying to avoid them .
And it was boring to walk around without a soundtrack being piped into their ears from an MP3 player .
" It was really hard for me to go without listening to my iPod during the day because it 's kind of my way to zone out of everything and everyone when I walk to class , " a student wrote .
" It gets my mind right .
Listening to music before I go to class or take an exam is my way of getting amped up like a football player before a game .
It sounds weird but music really helps to set my mood or fix my mood and without it I had to rely on other people to keep me in a good mood . "
But it 's not just the entertainment value .
When cut off from social media , many students felt cut off from other humans and lived in isolation .
The study found that the friendships and relationships these 18 - to 21 - year - olds were dependent on technology .
" Going without media meant , in their world , going without their friends and family , " Moeller said .
One student wrote that texting and instant messaging friends gives a feeling of comfort : " When I did not have those two luxuries , I felt quite alone and secluded from my life .
Although I go to a school with thousands of students , the fact that I was not able to communicate with anyone via technology was almost unbearable . "
Being cut off from the wired world also meant being cut off from news and information -- not that any of them were regularly watching the news on TV , picking up a newspaper , listening to the news on the radio or visiting a news Web site .
One student who failed the assignment and cracked open a laptop during the 24 - hour - ban learned about the violent earthquake in Chile from " an informal blog post on Tumblr . "
Another student suddenly had less information than everyone else about a range of subjects , including sports and news and cultural references .
While students had an insatiable appetite for news , they relied on a broad range of sources , showing little loyalty to any , the university 's news report said .
" They care about what is going on among their friends and families and even in the world at large , " said researcher Raymond McCaffrey , a Ph.D. student who used to work at The Washington Post .
" But most of all they care about being cut off from that instantaneous flow of information that comes from all sides and does not seemed tied to any single device or application or news outlet . "

AN OXFORD University student who set up a group championing men ’s rights is hosting his first get - together at the weekend .
Alex Linsley , 20 , a second year economics and management student at Merton College , launched the Man Collective - Oxford in November .
He set up the organisation to provide man - to - man support after noticing the high number of young men committing suicide in Oxford .
Now , working with friend Marc Quinn , he is hoping to bring like - minded men together at an event called The Gathering , to explore everything from healthcare to sexuality and gender policy .
He said : “ Although there is quite an established network and movement of guys who are taking a stand and starting to challenge society ’s expectations of them in the States , in the UK there is really nothing similar . ”
Support for the group in Oxford remains relatively small , with just eight regular members , but Mr Linsley said there was a lot of interest from further afield , both within the university and the wider community .
He said the aim was “ just to talk about where we , as men , are similar , and how we can support each other in getting the best out of men . ”
He added : “ It is very much pro-women ’s rights as well .
“ We want to remain completely separate from the women - haters who do n’t represent anything we are about at all . ”
The Gathering is at The Hatton , Hatton Garden , London , on Saturday , between 10 am and 5 pm .
Tickets cost £ 25 -£ 45 .
He is anticipating about 50 people , including women , will attend the day , which will include workshops , speakers , discussion groups and other activities .

Next time you find yourself in a bad mood , do n’t try to put on a happy face — instead tackle a project that has been stymieing you .
Melancholy might just help you hit peak performance , reports Joseph Forgas , a professor of psychology at the University of New South Wales , in the journal Australasian Science .
Forgas reviewed several of his studies in which researchers induced either a good or bad mood in volunteers .
Each study found that people in a bad mood performed tasks better than those in a good mood .
Grumpy people paid closer attention to details , showed less gullibility , were less prone to errors of judgment and formed higher - quality , persuasive arguments than their happy counterparts .
One study even supports the notion that those who show signs of either fear , anger , disgust or sadness — the four basic negative emotions — achieve stronger eyewitness recall while virtually eliminating the effect of misinformation .
[ For more on how a negative mood boosts cognition , see “ Depression ’s Evolutionary Roots , ” by Paul W. Andrews and J. Anderson Thomson ; Scientific American Mind , January / February 2010 . ]
A while ago , wandering around the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich , I came across a little vignette of modern British mores that , a month later , I 'm still trying to process .
A mardy little teenager was delivering an extended harangue in which she itemised her poor mother 's failings from the point at which she 'd first considered conception .
As her mother stood silently , a tide of spittled invective breaking over her , the daughter used her final weapon ; " And if you do n't get me a bottle of water , right now , I ... am ... going ... to ... FAINT ! "
There was a hush throughout the gallery .
Filial impiety is all very routine in our public spaces , but the improper hydration of a child in your care ?
Surely a case for the authorities .
What I may have been the only witness nerdy enough to notice was the background to this little domestic drama .
The scene was being played out in front of a replica of the James Caird , the lifeboat in which Ernest Shackleton and five companions made the awful 15 day trip from Elephant Island to South Georgia in 1916 .
As I sat in the cafe later , necking a hard - won jug of free tapwater , I realised how odd our relationship with water has become .
Sure we 've persuaded restaurants to stop charging us for it but no fewer people seem to be wandering around like overgrown babies , clutching plastic sucky - bottles .
We 've deprived restaurants of a small profit line during a financial crisis , we 've added another burden to the waiter 's life and have made precisely no impact on the bloated profits of the multinationals selling us our own water in plastic bottles .
I 'd love to blame advertising .
It would be great to say that the multinationals themselves , the Nestles , the Coca - Colas , the PepsiCos and the Danones had created this idiotic behaviour but , truth is , I 've never seen an ad specifically advocating carrying the stuff around .
Have we , of our own volition , come up with the idea that if we stand for more than eight minutes without consuming some form of beverage , we 'll shrivel to something in a Ray Harryhausen movie ?
Remember when the first thing you 'd do on arriving home after a day out was put the kettle on ?
' Oooh .
Me feet are killing me .
Let 's have a nice cuppa ' .
Today , after a couple of hours in the high street , downing soda after energy water after smoothie after triple - mocha - whippochino and entirely unable to locate a public lavatory , you 're most likely to walk through the front door , rush to the bathroom and piss like a racehorse .
Anyone with the brains to read ( outside the ad agencies that come up with this sort of rubbish ) must by now be aware that the argument that water ' detoxes ' is entirely spurious , that the ' two litres a day ' myth is just that and that buying water shipped from places like Fiji - even if it can be ' greened ' through some ' offsetting ' sophistry - is as immoral as it is absurd .
Yet somehow , we 've programmed ourselves deeply .
Stand , sometime , in the queue at the airport ; the last few feet before the metal detector , where the travelling classes are having their bottles torn from their hands by stone - faced airport stormtroopers .
Witness the genuine pain on their faces .
It makes me want to throttle them all individually .
It 's bottled bloody water .
You can survive without it until you get on the plane .
You saw the security signs , you know that poor sod is only trying to stop someone blowing your holiday to smithereens over Staines , yet you act like you 're being brutally deprived of a human right .
You tut about waste as it's thrown into the blue bin as if it was n't your own , vacuous credulity that made you give £ 1.50 to a multinational for it half an hour ago .
A decade ago the only people who carried a water supply hooked to their belt were either planning a sweaty week under canvas or heading out to be shot at .
Now every desk jockey on expenses , every Boden - clad holidaymaker wants to get onto a two hour flight with enough water to support a Forward Operating Base in Helmand for a fortnight .
We have got to get over this .
More prominent food writers than I led the charge for the provision of tap water in restaurants and they appear , on the whole , to have succeeded .
The campaign immediately grabbed the attention of restaurant goers across the country ( though let 's be entirely honest here .
It was because the British are tight , not because we 're green .
I still find that the person who squeals the loudest about tapwater at the table is the one most likely to whip out a calculator to split the bill and then stiff the waitress on the tip ) .

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Pwn2Own Interview with Charlie Miller Posted by Sarah @ 03:42 GMT
Charlie Miller , the Pwn2 Own contest winner for two years in a row , gives his take on Internet security .
Guess what — your Mac OS is no less vulnerable than its Microsoft Windows counterpart .
Windows 7 or Snow Leopard , which of these two commercial OS will be harder to hack and why ?
Windows 7 is slightly more difficult because it has full ASLR ( address space layout randomization ) and a smaller attack surface ( for example , no Java or Flash by default ) .
Windows used to be much harder because it had full ASLR and DEP ( data execution prevention ) .
But recently , a talk at Black Hat DC showed how to get around these protections in a browser in Windows .
No operating system and browser is immune to an attack .
And , Flash is the bane of security ( well , one of it anyway ) .
In your opinion , which is the safer combination OS + browser to use ?
That 's a good question .
Chrome or IE8 on Windows 7 with no Flash installed .
There probably is n't enough difference between the browsers to get worked up about .
The main thing is not to install Flash !
The interview was conducted by Matteo Campofiorito at OneITSecurity .

Encyclopedia Dramatica Owner May Face Charges Down Under ... Despite Not Being In Australia
from the jurisdictional - issues dept
Thank you for reading this Techdirt post .
With so many things competing for everyone ’s attention these days , we really appreciate you giving us your time .
We work hard every day to put quality content out there for our community .
Techdirt is one of the few remaining truly independent media outlets .
We do not have a giant corporation behind us , and we rely heavily on our community to support us , in an age when advertisers are increasingly uninterested in sponsoring small , independent sites — especially a site like ours that is unwilling to pull punches in its reporting and analysis .
While other websites have resorted to paywalls , registration requirements , and increasingly annoying / intrusive advertising , we have always kept Techdirt open and available to anyone .
But in order to continue doing so , we need your support .
We offer a variety of ways for our readers to support us , from direct donations to special subscriptions and cool merchandise — and every little bit helps .
Thank you .
– The Techdirt Team
You would think after all these years on the internet we would have figured out how to deal with basic jurisdictional issues , but there are still plenty of countries who think that the laws in their country can reach over borders and be applied to people and websites in completely different countries , just because they do n't like it .
The problem with this , of course , is that if this is true , it automatically creates a very low ceiling for all internet communications , since they are all automatically held to the most draconian censorship laws out there .
But , still , someone sees something they do n't like online , even if it 's from another country , and legal threats come out .
The latest such example involves the guy who runs , which might be simply described as ... 4 chan 's version of Wikipedia , or the " internet troll 's Wikipedia . "
However you want to describe it , it 's filled with content you probably do n't want your mom looking at .
But , it 's quite an institution at this point .
But it turns out that the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission ( HREOC ) is upset about a " deliberately offensive article about Aborigines , " and is threatening to take the site 's operator , Joseph Evers , to court .
The thing is , the stuff on Encyclopedia Dramatica are deliberately offensive to .
That 's the point .
But the nice thing about the internet is that if you do n't like that sort of thing , you can avoid it .
Furthermore , Evers is in the US and is n't breaking any US laws .
But really , what good does this do for Aborigines or Australia ?
All this threat does is call a lot more attention to this offensive article .
Prior to this most people now reading about it never would have known about it .
Those who spend their time on ED would see it , but that 's what they find amusing anyway .
Of course , it also turns out that ED is apparently on Australia 's " secret " censorship filter list , so if the gov't ever gets around to forcing ISPs to block sites , the people offended by ED wo n't be able to access it ( and everyone else will just route around the filters anyway ) .

What is the worst thing we can do to our future generations ?
Saddle them with a huge national debt , or give them a substandard education so they can’t compete in the world job market .
Right now , it seems like we are doing both .
I know this is considered blasphemy in some circles , but there are things for which I do n’t mind paying taxes .
In 1996 , 21 - year - old John Leonard saw a Pepsi ad that jokingly offered a Harrier fighter for 7 million “ Pepsi points . ”
Under the contest rules , that should have required drinking 16.8 million cans of Pepsi , but Leonard found a loophole — he could earn the points by simply buying them for 10 cents each .
So on March 28 he delivered 15 original Pepsi points , plus a check for $ 700,008.50 to cover the remainder plus shipping and handling .
And when Pepsi failed to deliver the jet , he sued .
He lost in the end — the court ruled that the ad did n’t constitute an offer — but Leonard can still argue that he was in the right .
He claimed that a federal judge could not hear his case fairly , and that instead he should have faced a jury of “ the Pepsi generation . ”
( Thanks , Brendan . )
Beachgoers were reluctant to leave the water despite advice from lifeguards
Tsunami warnings in Australia are to be reviewed after thousands of beachgoers shrugged off alerts following Chile 's huge earthquake .
Lifeguards struggled to clear beaches in Queensland and New South Wales as people either returned to the water or came down to watch the tsunami arrive .
Attorney - General Robert McClelland said police and emergency services may be used in future .
Pacific states went on alert after the quake but most areas were unaffected .
The waves that hit Australia 's east coast were hardly noticeable .
Mr McClelland described the response to the tsunami warning as " disappointing but understandable " .
" People saw the earthquake , of course , literally thousands of kilometres away and did n't appreciate the dangers , " he said .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Emergency responders provide public warnings .
They [ people ] should abide by them because they are not lightly given , they are not given at a drop of a hat . "
He said he had asked state emergency ministers and surf life - saving organisations in New South Wales and Queensland to review the reaction and look at ways of educating the public about tsunamis .
In Chile , the official death toll from the 8.8 magnitude quake has been reduced to 452 from 800 , but hundreds of people are still missing .

According to Interia.pl and GazetaPrawna.pl , vocalist / guitaristof Polish extreme metallerswas formally charged on Monday ( March 8 ) for insulting Roman Catholics .
made headlines in his native country in September 2007 when hereportedly called the Catholic Church " the most murderous cult on theplanet " during aperformance in Gdynia and tore up a copy of the Bible onstage ( see video below ) .
After the incident , , head of thesuedfor promoting Satanism .
Although a court expert witness on religiousmatters said that the act of destroying the Holy Bible could offendsomebody 's religious feelings ( a criminal offense under Polish law ) , the case was discontinued because no one exceptaccusedof insulting their religious beliefs .
( Under Polish law , there must beat least two formal complaints before a charge is laid .
The previouscomplaint was made in 2008 , and recently an unspecified number of othercomplaints had been filed . ) is pleading not guilty to the charge .
According to Metal As Fuck , in the first hearing , under cross examination , stated what he does on stage is part of artistic license and it was n'tsupposed to offend religious feelings .
However , an expert on religioushistory and studies from Jagellonian University in Krakow stated thatevery copy of a bible could be considered a religious icon .
There was no judgment ruled againstin the first hearing , but now that a second complaint has been filed , the matter will be heard by the courts .
If found guilty , faces up to 2 years in prison .
In a 2009 interview withmagazine , bassistexplained that the Bible - tearing incident was by no means a spontaneousoutburst .
" We 'd been doing that for two years on tour before ithappened in Poland , " he said .
" So , we had discussed it many timesbefore .
Ashow is ashow , andfans are coming to ashow .
fans know whatis about , know what the lyrics are about , and know at least a little ofthe philosophy behind the band .
So , it 's kind of surprising that thereare people coming to the shows and feeling offended with what we doonstage .
If such a person comes to a show , he comes with the purpose ofbeing offended , I guess , and it should n't be like that .
We 're notoffending any particular person .
We 're just offending the religion thatwe've been raised in . "
Sluts - they 're everywhere .
But how does one find the elusive loose woman of ill repute ?
Ripping an entire chapter from The AskMen Guide to Douchebaggery is UCSB student Johnny Valamehr , who penned this colorful guide .
Observe :
Yes , you read it right ; this article is all about how to find that promiscuous princess during a night out on the town .
Men , if having a one night stand or same night sex is of interest to you – take some notes .

Oh , alliteration !
I think I need a t - shirt with " Promiscuous Princess " screened on the front .
But joking aside , Valamehr is clearly a master wordsmith .
If you 're wondering what kind of publication would want a piece like this , let us direct you to Ole Today .
A group of students from the University of California , Santa Barbara started Ole Today in August , 2009 .
It appears to be the typical amateur publication , full of articles about whether the world will actually end in 2012 and sympathetic coverage of racist - themed parties .
We would n't waste the virtual ink , except for one thing : in his " humorous " piece , Valamehr is advocating some dangerous behavior .
Advertisement
However , first he clarifies exactly what he means by slut :
Now before I get into the meat of it ( pause ) , let me just make one thing clear – when I say slut , I am simply referring to a woman who is ready to be sexually adventurous and looking to hook up .
There is absolutely nothing wrong with that .
Men and women alike have every right to identify what they want and go after it in the realm of dating ( emphasis his ) .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Memo to asshats everywhere with woefully misguided ideas about humor : just because women can call themselves sluts and claim it is n't an insult does n't mean you can do it , too .
It 's a derogatory term used to shame women for enjoying sex .
Furthermore , Valamehr 's definition of slut is incredibly far - reaching .
Basically any woman with a sex life could qualify ( maybe this is this an example of the new prudeishness we 've heard so much about ) .
Once he gets that disclaimer out of the way , Valamehr gives us a rundown of the behavior that indicates a girl who is DTF .
Unfortunately for his readers , any guy who follows his advice is almost certain to come across as the biggest creep in the universe .
Or worse .
Valamehr suggests men look for women who are A . Alone at a bar and B. Smoking or doing drugs .
His insistence that women who smoke cigarettes are more likely to be sexually free reads like something straight out of the Gatsby - era , but far more importantly , telling men to seek out lone women who are drinking heavily is simply not a good idea .
This is predatory behavior .
He even acknowledges that the " slut " may be looking to " forget her woes " - and what 's sexier than a sad chick , amIrightbra ?
He goes on to say :
Whenever a woman is interested in risk taking behavior , she is usually interested in having a good time through a lot of other means .
If she smokes a stogey , she 'll probably smoke your dick , too .
And with drugs , many women use them as a form of escapism combined with plausible deniability to have a good time , such as " Oh my god I was so fucked up , it just happened " .
We know you wanted it to happen , no need to front Ms. Daisy .

Drinking - or using drugs - is not an invitation to have sex .
Neither is tilting your head to the side ( another " sign " of a slut ) .
And telling guys to actively seek out women so wasted they will need to somehow excuse their own behavior is irresponsible .
You know who looks for drunk , unhappy women , alone at the bar without any female friends ?
Rapists .
Furthermore , " we know you wanted it to happen " is practically their mantra .
So while we would like to point out that there is absolutely nothing wrong with casual sex ( even drunk casual sex ) , there is something very wrong with this seduction technique .
Any man dumb and inept enough to follow Valamehr 's advice will end up coming off as a total creep - at worst , he could end up behind bars .
Isla Vista : 7 Ways To Spot The Slut [ Ole Today ]
Related : Sex , Lies , And Stereotypes : Can Women Really Get Laid Whenever They Want ?
Mises often said that ideas are more powerful than armies .
In the midst of war — and all governments are , to some extent , at war with their own people — it can take a leap of faith to agree .
But if you step back and look at the progress that the ideas of liberty are making , it is easy to believe that what Mises said was exactly right .
Ideas know no borders .
They are not inhibited by considerations of space .
They can eat through the limits of time .
They grow and spread by individual decisions and actions that no one can control .
In the end , governments cannot manage ideas , and are even rendered powerless by them .
I would like to share an example of how this works based on my recent trip to Brazil .
The background takes us to fifty - one years ago , when Mises travelled to Argentina to give a series of lectures .
He helped cultivate the seeds of freedom in a region increasingly under the sway of government control and intervention .
His lectures were published , translated into many languages , and continue to wield influence among new generations .
Massive trees from these seeds are thriving today in Latin America .
This past month , Brazilian financial and ideological entrepreneur Helio Beltrão invited a delegation from the Mises Institute to the formal inauguration of the new Instituto Ludwig von Mises Brasil .
The idea was to give this organization a wonderful kick start toward becoming another institution of revolutionary ideological impact , flourishing in Latin America as the Mises Institute has in the US .
Economic Policy : Thoug ... Ludwig von Mises Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 2.99 ( as of 10:25 EST - Details )
Mises.org.br is already substantial and serious .
I was there for MisesBrasil ’s sponsorship of the first Austrian economics conference in the country ’s history .
Hundreds of young people gathered in Porto Allegre to hear Joe Salerno , Mark Thornton , Tom Woods , and me from the US , and Antony Mueller , Rodrigo Constantino , Fabio Barbieri , and Urbiratan Iorio from Brazil .
David and Patri Friedman were also with us .
The moderators were Helio and Globo TV journalist Maria Beltrão .
There were simultaneous English - Portuguese and Portuguese - English translations , and the entire program was webcast as well .
All talks will be archived on the site , with subtitles in English or Portuguese as required .
Among many other projects , MisesBrasil is also bringing back into print the excellent Portuguese translation of Human Action , as well as other books of Mises .
Already in print is the translation of Economic Policy , those very lectures by Mises , with the far better title in Portuguese of Six Lessons .
This year , the 23rd conference of the allied Liberty Forum , sponsored by the Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies , was held at the Pontifical Catholic University of Porto Alegre .
The theme was the life and work of Ludwig von Mises .
The 5,500 students in attendance each got a copy of Six Lessons .
The highpoint of the conference was the presentation of the prestigious award for leadership in liberty to Helio , and the talk he gave was an intellectual call to arms .
The love for liberty and learning was palpable , but so was the desire for practical action .
As in the whole history of liberalism , that means finding a way to throw off the yoke of central power .
Thus is there secessionist sentiment alive in Brazil .
The students , faculty , and business people ritualistically stood for the national anthem , but they sang movingly the anthem of Rio Grande do Sul , the southernmost state whose capital is Porto Alegre .
All hail organically formed associations and down with coerced collectives !
Human Action : A Treati ... von Mises , Ludwig Check Amazon for Pricing .
I also learned that the state of São Paulo — we North Americans flew into its capital city , a great commercial hub — fought a war for independence against the central government and its new dictator and constitution in 1934 .
There is a very impressive monument to the secessionists , and a tradition .
And at Helio ’s conference Patri Friedman talked in part about secession , the basis of his Seasteading Institute .
And I was moved to see how his father David sometimes resembles Murray Rothbard .
Brazil ’s taxes — a gigantic VAT being the worst — are even higher than what Obama plans .
The interventionism in this country is truly horrific .
The tariffs are abusive too .
But a warm , well - mannered , and generous people can help make up for a cold , cruel state .
And I was impressed by not having to take my shoes off at the airport , nor my laptop out of its case ; by free - flowing shower heads ; and by restaurant menus that listed lower prices for women than for men , to mention just a few of the Brazilian things outlawed in the Land of the Free .
Thanks also to Graziella Beltrão for one of the great parties in the history of the Western hemisphere , held in Helio ’s and Graziella ’s spectacular home , in honor of Joe , Mark , and me ( Tom not having arrived yet ) , complete with traditional Brazilian food , band , and singer .
Also impressive were Helio ’s “ Taliban ” ( as they are kiddingly known ) , the smart young Misesian - Rothbardian - LRC ’ers who aide him with the Instituto .
Many thanks to Cristiano Chiocca , Leandro Roque , and Fernando and Roberto Chiocca , among many , for all their help .
I was also pleased to see none of the anti-religious prejudice so common to the US movement .
Instead there is tolerance .
One person had complained about the appropriate inclusion of Rothbard as well as Mises on MisesBrasil ’s handsome crest .
Wait until he sees the crest of the new Swedish Mises Institute — founded at our conference in Salamanca in discussions with Helio .
It features Mises and Hoppe .
This kind of movement , the result of vast amounts of human energy and inspiration , cannot be cobbled together by a government bureaucracy , nor can it be stopped by one .
It is the manifestation of human energy , applied with vision and entrepreneurship , driven forward by brilliant technique and hard work , and with its purpose secure in a burning passion for liberty and truth .
We have long known that Austro - libertarianism is the only truly international economic - political movement outside of Marxism .
How thrilling to see a borderless boom , not Fed backed , but truth based .
This is a worldwide struggle , and now especially , we must work together , in the tradition of Mises and Rothbard , for the good of all .

It 's time to part company
http://www.jewishworldreview.com -- ONE POLITICAL QUESTION we have to answer is whether George W. Bush or Albert Gore shall be president , and just which party will control the House of Representatives and the Senate .
But I 'd suggest that there 's a far more important long - run question we must answer :
If one group of people prefers government control and management of people 's lives , and another prefers liberty and a desire to be left alone , should they be required to fight , antagonize one another , and risk bloodshed and loss of life in order to impose their preferences , or should they be able to peaceably part company and go their separate ways ?
Like a marriage that has gone bad , I believe there are enough irreconcilable differences between those who want to control and those want to be left alone that divorce is the only peaceable alternative .
Just as in a marriage , where vows are broken , our human rights protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution have been grossly violated by a government instituted to protect them .
Americans who are responsible for and support constitutional abrogation have no intention of mending their ways .
Let 's look at just some of the magnitude of the violations .
Article 1 , Section 8 of our Constitution enumerates the activities for which Congress is authorized to tax and spend .
James Madison , the acknowledged father of the Constitution , explained it in The Federalist Papers : " The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined .
Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite .
The former will be exercised principally on external objects , as war , peace , negotiation and foreign commerce .
...
The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs , concern the lives and liberties , and properties of the people , and the internal order , improvement and prosperity of the State . "
Nowhere among the enumerated powers of Congress is there authority to tax and spend for : Social Security , public education , farm subsidies , bank bailouts , food stamps and other activities that represent roughly two - thirds of the federal budget .
Neither is there authority for Congress ' mandates to the states and people about how they may use their land , the speed at which they can drive , whether a library has wheelchair ramps and the gallons of water used per toilet flush .
A list of congressional violations of the letter and spirit of the Constitution is virtually without end .
Americans who wish to live free have two options :
We can resist , fight and risk bloodshed to force America 's tyrants to respect our liberties and human rights , or we can seek a peaceful resolution of our irreconcilable differences by separating .
That can be done by peopling several states , say Texas and Louisiana , controlling their legislatures and then issuing a unilateral declaration of independence just as the Founders did in 1776 .
You say , " Williams , nobody has to go that far , just get involved in the political process and vote for the right person . "
That 's nonsense .
Liberty should n't require a vote .
It 's a God - given or natural right .
Some independence or secessionists movements , such as our 1776 war with England and our 1861 War Between the States , have been violent , but they need not be .
In 1905 , Norway seceded from Sweden , Panama seceded from Columbia ( 1903 ) , and West Virginia from Virginia ( 1863 ) .
Nonetheless , violent secession can lead to great friendships .
England is probably our greatest ally and we have fought three major wars together .
There is no reason why Texiana ( Texas and Louisiana ) could n't peaceably secede , be an ally and have strong economic ties with United States .
The bottom line question for all of us is should we part company or continue trying to forcibly impose our wills on one another ?

I kinda want to say something about the site , but I do n't want to clutter up the page with my dumb thoughts that the vast number of visitors would n't care about .
But you 're looking at the source because you care about something , which probably is not my dumb thoughts , but here they are anyway .
When Abe was alive , people would ask , what are you going to do when he dies ?
Well , the secret 's out : I updated the status .
Only 25 minutes after he died , as far as I can tell , but did n't prevent people on twitter from bitching about it .
Years ago I did plan to write some sort of automated updater , like maybe something that would poll IMDB every 15 minutes , get their status , and autoupdate maybe ?
But there 'd still be the hassle of updating that automated script every so often to account for changes in whatever I was polling , and I could n't get the motivation .
And as it turned out I did manage to update within a half hour , so that 5 minutes of consternation every few months or so were all for naught .
And in some naive way , Abe was one of those guys who you figured would never really die .
Partly because of the death hoax he had in 199 something , and that was decades ago , so it had the feel of the universe having its joke and probably having the good sense not to bother with it again .
And partly because he played this old slow guy on Barney Miller , and some eons later he's on Conan being some old slow guy , and you 'd get the feeling he'd be alone in the post - nuclear 23rd century wasteland looking for roaches to poop on .
I 'm writing this about four hours after he died , and I 've already been asked this a number of times : what are you going to do with the site now ?
Well , you 're probably looking at it .
It 's still the same joke , just the other side of it .
The site will continue to give the Abe Vigoda status , and you can still reload the page for the update .
And I wanted to write this now because it seems like I do n't really have the interest in maintaining features like this anymore , so if I write this now , this is probably how this text will remain until the site no longer exists .
But that 's what 's getting me a bit .
I had n't really thought of that until a couple years ago when a guy with a defunct podcast asked me how long I would maintain the site after Abe died .
And I said , " Uh ... well , until I die , I guess . "
Which suddenly put a shot of personal mortality into a thing that had been a vague , safer concept of mortality .
Someday
Abe would die , but celebreties are barely real , so a celebrity 's death is just the kind of thing you can make a one - page joke site out of .
But I like the joke , the simplicity of it , the unpretentious but slightly odd honesty of it .
The fact that it 's essentially been the same joke for 15 (! ) years adds to it , for me .
Now , as it's the other side of the same joke , the longer I maintain it , the more it ages .
It has depth and character and probably an oaky finish if I knew what that was .
And 10 years from now , 20 years from now , it 'll have that same quality .
I mean it 's not a deep belly laugh kind of joke , but could you imagine how it would feel to look at this site giving the Abe Vigoda status after it 's been online for 35 years ?
So I want it to go on forever , but of course it wo n't .
What am I , a rich guy ?
It 's not like I 'm going to hire a lawyer to maintain a trust for hosting provisions to be maintained after I die .
So probably the status of Abe Vigoda being dead will continue until I myself am dead , and the reality of that is unexpectedly making me think about the finality of death more than usual .
I kinda feel like it'd be a funny meta joke if some kid being born now were to grow up and eventually register abevigodacomstatus.com which would go on for decades after I die , but I 'm just now thinking that 's possibly actually a metaphor with implications that I 'm not currently interested in exploring .
But for as long as this goes on , it 'll amuse me .
And actually I 'm putting this in a hidden div rather than comments , to increase the chance that it 's picked up by web archivers .
And that 's even a bit of a fool 's errand anyway , because if very few people are going to read this , how many are going to read the source of this page in an archive after the site is gone ?
But somehow just putting the words here and knowing it'll be saved Somewhere Else actually feels a little better .
It 's not that people will read it , but just knowing there 's a possibility that it will continue to exist .
Well , thanks Abe .
I know I 'm writing all about me here , but thanks for being who you were , and thanks for having a sense of humor about yourself which inspired this .
I have no idea if you were any good with technology or if you ever saw this site , but I am sure people around you knew about it and told you about it .
Either you did n't understand it , or did n't care ... and while I 'm inventing a conversation with you , I 'm also going to invent the scene where someone showed it to you , you were puzzled , but laughed , shook your head , and appreciated that it was just a harmless fun bit of crazy .

Federal law enforcement agencies typically do n't confirm an investigation , the U.S. Attorney 's Office said in the release .
The Department of Justice has an exception for matters that have received substantial publicity , or matters in which the department feels the need to reassure the community that law enforcement is investigating the incident , according to the statement .
Spiders and silkworms are masters of materials science , but scientists are finally catching up .
Silks are among the toughest materials known , stronger and less brittle , pound for pound , than steel .
Now scientists at MIT have unraveled some of their deepest secrets in research that could lead the way to the creation of synthetic materials that duplicate , or even exceed , the extraordinary properties of natural silk .
Markus Buehler , the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Associate Professor in MIT 's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , and his team study fundamental properties of materials and how those materials fail .
With silk , that meant using computer models that can simulate not just the structures of the molecules but exactly how they move and interact in relation to each other .
The models helped the researchers determine the molecular and atomic mechanisms responsible for the material 's remarkable mechanical properties .
Silk 's combination of strength and ductility — its ability to bend or stretch without breaking — results from an unusual arrangement of atomic bonds that are inherently very weak , Buehler and his team found .
Doctoral student Sinan Keten , postdoctoral associate Zhiping Xu and undergraduate student Britni Ihle are co-authors of a paper on the research to be published on March 14 in the journal Nature Materials .
Silks are made from proteins , including some that form thin , planar crystals called beta - sheets .
These sheets are connected to each other through hydrogen bonds — among the weakest types of chemical bonds , unlike , for example , the much stronger covalent bonds found in most organic molecules .
Buehler 's team carried out a series of atomic - level computer simulations that investigated the molecular failure mechanisms in silk .
" Small yet rigid crystals showed the ability to quickly re-form their broken bonds , and as a result fail ' gracefully ' — that is , gradually rather than suddenly , " graduate student Keten explains .
" In most engineered materials " — ceramics , for instance — " high strength comes with brittleness , " Buehler says .
" Once ductility is introduced , materials become weak . "
But not silk , which has high strength despite being built from inherently weak building blocks .
It turns out that 's because these building blocks — the tiny beta - sheet crystals , as well as filaments that join them — are arranged in a structure that resembles a tall stack of pancakes , but with the crystal structures within each pancake alternating in their orientation .
This particular geometry of tiny silk nanocrystals allows hydrogen bonds to work cooperatively , reinforcing adjacent chains against external forces , which leads to the outstanding extensibility and strength of spider silk .
One surprising finding from the new work is that there is a critical dependence of the properties of silk on the exact size of these beta - sheet crystals within the fibers .
When the crystal size is about three nanometers , the material has its ultra-strong and ductile characteristics .
But let those crystals grow just beyond to five nanometers , and the material becomes weak and brittle .
Buehler says the work has implications far beyond just understanding silk .
He notes that the findings could be applied to a broader class of biological materials , such as wood or plant fibers , and bio - inspired materials , such as novel fibers , yarns and fabrics or tissue replacement materials , to produce a variety of useful materials out of simple , commonplace elements .
For example , he and his team are looking at the possibility of synthesizing materials that have a similar structure to silk , but using molecules that have inherently greater strength , such as carbon nanotubes .
The long - term impact of this research , Buehler says , will be the development of a new material design paradigm that enables the creation of highly functional materials out of abundant , inexpensive materials .
This would be a departure from the current approach , where strong bonds , expensive constituents , and energy intensive processing ( at high temperatures ) are used to obtain high - performance materials .
Peter Fratzl , professor in the department of biomaterials in the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam , Germany , who was not involved in this work , says that " the strength of this team is their pioneering multi- scale theoretical approach " to analyzing natural materials .
He adds that this is " the first evidence from theoretical modeling of how hydrogen bonds , as weak as they might be , can provide high strength and toughness if arranged in a suitable way within the material . "
Professor of biomaterials Thomas Scheibel of the University of Bayreuth , Germany , who was also not involved in this work , says Buehler 's work is of the " highest caliber , " and will stimulate much further research .
The MIT team 's approach , he says , " will provide a basis for better understanding of certain biological phenomena so far not understood . "

Alan Wake Is Already A Hero In Bright Falls ?
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Thursday , 29th of April 2010 - 02:08 PM ]
Let 's start by watching episode one of the prequel .
A video titled " Oh Deer " , it is the real intro for what is going on in the game 's story .
A story that is starting off by showing reporter Jake Fisher going on the case of something and heading to a small town called Bright Falls .
Let ' see how that goes .
Alan Wake Bright Falls : Oh Deer
Ok , so what the fuck is going on here ?
Our new friend , Jake , is on the path of something , and has happy birthday sung to him by a bunch of yokels that seem to worship Alan Wake - all for no discernible reason .
I can see it all being kind of creepy I guess .
Oh yea , then Jake hits a deer that can not be seen with his head lights on , but is only visible with a small flash light .
This is , of course , before it is " creepily " drug into the woods .
Also , who opens a body bag after diving for it and then just leaves it behind .
Those things are very useful to have around .
I know , I have one in my car . *
There has to be more .
I mean this is suppose to be setting us up for Alan Wake .
Oh , there is .
Episode two : " Time Flies . "
Let 's see if there are any more answers on how it differs , and to what the fuck is going on .
And ..?
Nothing more .
WTF ?!?
Yea seeing " hillbillies " could be a little unnerving .
Not to mention the weird flash of the Wolf Man .
But really ?
Is this what we have to start with ?
On top of that , seeing the weird citizens and the quick transitions of dark to light ?
How is this not just a re-imagination of Silent Hill ?
It even had a weird doctor that wanted to help with a story , but not be recorded .
The blacking out .
The scrawling weird phases and pictures .
The insanity .
I mean come the fuck on .
I was expecting something I had not felt I 've seen before , not a new twist on the same story and game .
I guess in the end , this could all be just some ploy to get everyone talking .
We may be given only the tip of the iceberg that is going to be Alan Wake .
We 'll have to see , but these clips do nothing to set Alan Wake apart from Silent Hill .
This chart compares the Congressional Budget Office ’s ( CBO ’s ) projections for the end of year balance of Social Security accounts from 2008 and 2009 .
These balances are presented as a percentage of taxable payroll , a weighted average of taxable wages and taxable self - employment income which provides an estimate of the earnings subject to payroll taxation each year .
For perspective , in 2010 taxable payroll is projected to be $ 5.6 trillion in real terms .
Concretely , when the balance of these accounts becomes negative , Social Security is paying out more in benefits than it collects in payroll taxes in a given year .
In 2008 , the CBO projected that outlays would exceed revenues for the first time 2019 and in 2009 CBO projected that this threshold would be crossed in 2016 .
In fact , this year Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it collects .
While part of the acceleration in the onset of Social Security deficits is due to the impact of the recession on taxation , by all projections , the unsustainable deficits in Social Security will continue into the future .
There 's nothing like the vaguely sadistic pleasure of a good revenge movie , from Uma Thurman hacking the limbs off the entire Japanese mafia to any of the 36 vengeance - crazed madmen Mel Gibson has played .
But it 's all fantasy , right ?
Real people do n't go on a Payback - style path of destruction when they 're wronged .
6 The Trung Sisters ' Kung Fu Rebellion

Trung Trac and Trung
Nhi were simple - living sisters in a small village sometime in first century Vietnam , who by the way had been trained from childhood in martial arts .
This will become very important later .
The area at the time was ruled with an iron fist by the Chinese , who had a kind of zero tolerance policy when it came to their subsidiaries acting like they were all unique and independent .
So when Trac 's husband broke with convention and took a stand , the Han warlords decided to respond with a display of brutality that would have done the Roman Empire proud .
They executed the outspoken rebel , and then went ahead and raped his widow Trac because why not .
OK , see this ?
This is my ass kicking face .

The Payback :
We now take it as pretty common knowledge that you just do n't mess with Vietnam , even if you 're an immensely powerful and technologically superior nation .
They know kung fu , or something , and apparently every time they get invaded they simply level up .
Due to their traditional Confucian teachings , the Han Chinese considered women to be pretty useless .
So they did n't realize that Trac and Nhi had been schooled in badass martial arts since they were little girls and thus were n't prepared to take any of Confucius ' shit .

Ulykken fant sted på E18 mellom Lillesand og Kristiansand fredag formiddag .
Føreren var alene i leiebilen da det gikk galt .
- Mannen som var involvert i ulykken var delvis bevisstløs da vi kom til stedet .
Ting kan tyde på at det var en medisinsk årsak til at han mistet kontrollen over bilen , men vi er ikke ferdige med etterforskningen , sier operasjonsleder Bjarne Bakken ved Agder Politidistrikt til VG Nett .
Leiebilen fikk ikke omfattende skader i sammenstøtet med autovernet .
Ambulansepersonell kom raskt til stedet og kjørte mannen til sykehus .

- Vi har det helt forferdelig
Bilførerens kone bekrefter at det er mannen hennes som har krasjet enda en gang .
Hun mener at deler av medietrykket etter Toyota - episoden kan være årsak til den nye ulykken .
- Nå er det nok .
Vi har det helt forferdelig .
Grunnen til at dette skjedde var at han ikke følte han ble trodd av noen .
Det ble rett og slett for mye for ham , sier kona til VG Nett .
Selv trodde hun det var en misforståelse da politiet tok kontakt om ulykken fredag .
- Jeg sa at dette skjedde for to uker siden .
Men så sa de at det var i dag .
Jeg kunne ikke tro det , forteller kona gråtkvalt .
Sverget på at han snakket sant
Fredag kveld var hun på sykehuset hvor mannen hennes er innlagt .
Hun ber om at familien får ro nå som mannen er syk .
- Han har hatt det veldig tøft hele tiden .
Vi har prøvd å si at han har det vanskelig , og at han må vente med å snakke om det , forteller kona , som presiserer at mannen absolutt ikke har noe å skjule .
VG snakket med 50 - åringen selv torsdag , i forbindelse med at et vitne mener han « bøllekjørte » .
- Jeg sverger på at jeg snakker sant .
Gasspedalen hengte seg opp .
Jeg forsøkte å bremse .
Det må kanskje noen ha sett .
Jeg var svært stresset .
Jeg var svært stresset og hadde mer enn nok med å kontrollere bilen , sa han til VG .
Krasjet for to uker siden
Det var torsdag for to uker at 50 - åringens Toyota Prius krasjet i autovernet .
Også da på E18 - strekningen mellom Kristiansand og Lillesand .
Mannen forklarte etter ulykken at gassen hadde hengt seg opp .
Ifølge veimyndighetene skal bilen ha holdt lav fart da eieren krasjet den i autovernet .

A Delta IV rocket rumbled and roared off launch pad 37B at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida Thursday evening , sending the GOES - P satellite soaring into a crisp and clear night sky .
With liftoff at 6:57 p.m. EST , the rocket could be seen for several minutes after launch , and booster separation was clearly visible to observers on the NASA Causeway .
The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite - P , or GOES -P , is the latest in a series of meteorological satellites designed to watch for storm development and weather conditions on Earth as well as detect hazards with its emergency beacon support and Search and Rescue Transponder .
It will take ten days for the satellite to maneuver to its geostationary equatorial orbit at 35,888 km ( 22,300 miles ) .
Once there , GOES - P will get a new name : GOES - 15 .
It will take five months for all the instruments on board to be tested and calibrated .
After that , GOES - 15 will be a back - up satellite , stored on - orbit and ready for activation should one of the operational GOES satellites degrade or exhaust their fuel .
The satellite is a cooperative effort between NASA and NOAA , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
NOAA has two operational GOES satellites : GOES - 12 in the east and GOES - 11 in the west .
Each provides continuous observations of environmental conditions in North , Central and South America and the surrounding oceans .
GOES - 13 is being moved to replace GOES - 12 , which will be positioned to provide coverage for South America as part of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems , or GEOSS .
Thanks to Alan Walters for great images of the launch .
On a personal note , I ’ve now seen three different launches – each with a different launch vehicle — in just four weeks here at Kennedy Space Center ( space shuttle Endeavour , SDO on Atlas and now GOES - P on the Delta IV . )
KSC is a busy spaceport , indeed !

Imagine a simple burial in a handcrafted pine box surrounded by family and friends on a nature preserve bursting with blooming native wildflowers .
Sound idyllic ?
That ’s what the folks at The Wilderness Center in Ohio are betting on .
Two years ago , they opened Foxfield Preserve , one of the nation ’s first nature preserve cemeteries for green burials as an ecopreneurial venture to increase the center ’s income in support of its conservation mission .
Gordon Maupin , executive director of The Wilderness Center , says “ green ” or “ natural ” burials are 100 percent ecologically safe , non-controversial , and a natural way to give back to the planet .
They are also an innovative way to generate income for ongoing care of conservation land in a time when the funds to do so are thin .
However Maupin cautions there is a considerable planning process , as with any other start - up venture .
Natural burials were the tradition worldwide up until about the Civil War , when more “ modern ” methods of burials — embalming chemicals , steel caskets and concrete vaults — became the norm .
In a natural burial , a person is :
• Laid to rest , dressed in natural fibers such as cotton or wool
• Placed in a biodegradable container ( not made of endangered tropical wood )
• Not embalmed
• Not placed in a vault
In addition , the burials are very low density so that nature will dominate landscape .
In the Foxfield Preserve cemetery , they anticipate hosting no more than 200 burials per acre .
( About 10 of the preserve ’s 42 acres are useable . )
This is in contrast to a modern cemetery where one would find more than 1,000 burials per acre .
The majority of modern burials put steel caskets and concrete vaults into the earth .
According to some estimates , the U.S. annually buries more than 100,000 tons of steel , 1.6 million tons of concrete and 800,000 gallons of embalming fluids , which often contain formaldehyde and other chemicals , some of which may trickle into watersheds .
Memorial Ecosystems , Inc. , started the first nature preserve cemetery in 1998 at Ramsey Creek in South Carolina .
Today , there are 15 other natural cemeteries in the US , but the Foxwood Preserve is the first operated by a conservation organization .
When initially exploring the idea , Maupin enlisted the help of graduate students enrolled in a social entrepreneurship program to figure out the feasibility .
They consulted with Memorial Ecosystems , Inc. , board members , and retired morticians .
The Wilderness Center already owned the preserve ’s 42 - acres , and the conservation cemetery idea seemed like a good one .
It would give back to the community by sustaining wildlife habitat , a clean watershed , clean air , and walking trails .
But it would also require planning and steep , start - up costs .
“ You must approach this like you are starting a business , ” Maupin says , “ because you are . ”
Initial steps included :
• Thorough land survey and plot map .
•$ 200,000 to build a paved driving loop that is wide and deep enough to support vehicles , as well as reinforced turf wings for parking .
• Create an entry and install signage
• Develop marketing materials
• Navigate through IRS laws
• Create a sturdy legal structure
• Follow state laws , including Ohio ’s requirement for $ 50,000 trust account
Since opening up in August 2008 , they have sold 60 plots and had about a dozen burials .
The plots are $ 3,200 pre-need and $ 4,000 at need .
A portion of the cost can be a tax - deductible donation .
While this cost is more than most traditional cemetery prices , the savings on vault , casket and other items make natural burial much more economical .
Maupin anticipates recovering startup costs within a few years .
With just two years under their belt , they have net $ 40,000 .
Maupin says the most expensive ongoing cost is supporting two full - time employees and benefits .
But the long - term gain will be worth it .
When a plot is purchased , part of the fee is a legacy donation ( about $ 1,600 ) to The Wilderness Center , which helps to support its conservation education programs .
The burials also develop a strong emotional connection between the families and the land .
“ We allow families to close the grave , ” Maupin said , “ which most cemeteries do not .
It is a very powerful experience for the families . ”
Maupin said the Wilderness Center anticipates building a stronger connection to the community through its nature preserve cemetery , which will cause more individuals to be stakeholders in the success of the conservation organization .
“ As a nonprofit , the more you can connect to a community , the better off you are , ” he said .
“ There are quite a few things you can do as a conservation organization that earn income to advance your mission , and if you can come up with these ideas , then , why not ? ” ﻿

Sacrament and beyond
A little light theological speculation for Sunday …..
According to Catholic doctrine , during Mass , the consecrated wafer and wine are “ transubstantiated ” into the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ , which are consumed by the worshipers .
The question is , what happens then ?
In the first place , since you are what you eat , does n’t that mean that all practicing Catholics are partially composed of divine substance , in the same proportion as the ratio of consecrated wafers to everything else they eat ?
Even more disturbing , the molecules making up the wafer and wine , having played their roles in the body ’s chemical reactions , are eventually passed back into the lower digestive tract and excreted .
Remember , this is material which the Church ’s doctrine claims is actually the physical substance of a deity .
Consecrated communion wafers are holy objects requiring special handling .
So what is the theological status of feces and urine containing the same substance ?
Are the sewer systems in Catholic countries suffused with a faint radiance of the Divine ?
( Similar questions could be posed concerning semen — would fellatio qualify as an indirect form of receiving communion ? — but that really has more ramifications than I have room to get into here . )
I wonder if the Church ’s theologians have ever considered this problem .
“ I offer my apologies for the worries , “ [ Akio Toyoda ] said .
“ Many customers are wondering whether their cars are OK . “
I have been trying to find the full text of Toyota 's apology for the safety problem that has finally resulted in a massive recall of their vehicles for repair of their accelerators .
Sadly , I fear the full text consists of this :
This is shockingly inadequate , as so may apologies these days are .
This lays the problem entirely on the consumer -- consumer worries and wondering whether their cars are OK , not on Toyota 's manufacturing defective cars and its failure to respond immediately to the problem once it was brought to their attention .
This is like the ubiquitous , " If I have offended you by [ my saying that you are a fat cow ] , I am sorry . "
This sort of aplogy does not apologize for calling the person a fat cow but for offending him or her , which is entirely different and is consistent with the idea that the listener 's being offended is his or her problem , not the speaker 's problem .
Mr. Toyoda could have said , " I am sorry that we made defective cars and put your lives in jeopardy , " but he did n't .
What is worse , we have here a classic example of " too little ; too late . "
State Farm reported the problem to the NHTSA in 2007 .
Even more disturbing is the fact that NHTSA was getting complaints about acceleration problems in Toyotas in 2003 .
I have to believe Toyota was the first to know about it but chose to put its head in the sand .
The recall is going to cost $ 900 million by one estimate .
And they are losing something like $ 1.55 million per week in sales .
No wonder putting their heads in the sand seemed attractive .
I own a 12 - 13 year old Toyota pick up that has served me well .
And my wife has a Rav4 .
She is a little concerned that she will have accelerator problems .
Her fears are due entirely to the fact that Toyota has been totally unforthcoming about exactly what cars , made when are vulnerable to the problem .

Andy Murray , No.1 British Tennis player , was possibly dumped due to his ‘ seven - hour - a - day PlayStation 3 addiction ’ .
According to Telegraph , Murray ’s agent said at the time that the split had been “ amicable ” and “ mutually agreed ” .
However , sources close to Sears said one of the causes was the world number fourâ€™s long hours playing video tennis and PlayStation 3 games such as the best selling Call of Duty sequel .
Brad Gilbert , Murray ’s former coach , has said in the past that Murray spends “ seven hours a day ” playing video games .
Celebrity or otherwise we can’t blame the dude , Modern Warfare 2 has been running our lives for the past few weeks too , he ’s probably not alone in the late night button bashing & relationship issues .
Free Exchange reprints this fantastic chart from the Economist :
The really fascinating charts , for me , are the second two .
The one in the middle shows how consumption grew a little bit faster than income through the 70s , 80s , and 90s — but then the gap between the two completely spiralled out of control in the 2000s .
There ’s your credit boom and inevitable crunch right there .
And I ca n’t help but look at the payrolls chart in the light of the anti-immigration sentiments of Lou Dobbs and the like .
It ’s a lot easier to welcome foreigners to your shores when your payrolls are growing by 20 % a decade than when they ’re shrinking .
Incidentally , I think there ’s a misprint in the graphic : the third chart should n’t have that asterisk , since the growth rate in that one is per decade , not per year .
It seems silly to do it that way , I would have made all the growth rates annual , and maybe added a population - growth or bar to the final chart .
March 9 , 2010 - TF2 Team
Yesterday , we announced that Steam and all our Source engine games will be coming to the Mac .
Sound too good to be true ?
Well , guess what :
It is true !
There are no catches !
Sometimes life actually works like that .
The bad news is that we 've just truth bombed your hard - earned lie detector back to the stone age , and you 'll probably lose all your money to the next international lottery scam that sneaks through your spam filter .
Still , Steam on the Mac !
Since we 're getting a lot of email asking the same basic questions , we figured we 'd just answer them here :
Q : I own TF2 on the PC .
Do I have to buy it again on the Mac ?
A : No .
If you own TF2 on the PC , you own TF2 on the Mac ( and vice versa ) .
You do n't have to buy the game twice .
In addition , the Steam Cloud will automatically propagate your configuration settings and custom sprays to your Mac for you .
Q : Is it just some crappy emulated version of TF2 ?
A : No !
Also :
How dare you !
Mac users are n't getting a crappy emulated version of the game .
TF2 will run natively on OSX , like an actual big boy game for adults .
Q : Hmm , that all sounds pretty good .
But I 'll bet I can't play with my friends who own Macs if I 'm on my PC .
A : Mac and PC users will all play together , on the same servers .
We 're not creating two separate universes .
We 're all going to be one big , happy family with guns locked in a bloody , never - ending struggle for cap points .
WASHINGTON — Violence in Afghanistan is up nearly 90 percent from this time last year , according to a new Pentagon report submitted to Congress Wednesday .
Despite that increase and a 240 percent spike in roadside bomb attacks - a major factor in overall violence statistics - and increasing Taliban tactics to discredit President Hamid Karzai 's government with shadow governments , some officials said they are seeing encouraging trends .
" We have the beginnings of the potential for real change , " said a senior U.S. defense official who is closely involved with the Obama administration 's Afghanistan strategy .
The additional troops ordered by President Barack Obama , the official said , " have begun to have some impact on reducing the Taliban 's ability to operate . "
The new report tracks progress in Afghanistan from October 2009 to March 2010 , revealing that an overall decline in stability over the last several years appears now to have steadied .
But overall violence has risen , mostly due to an increase in allied offensives reaching into Taliban - controlled areas , as well as successful Taliban efforts to return to areas that had been cleared by U.S. troops .
The United States faces two major concerns in Afghanistan , the senior defense official said : developing Afghan security forces and stopping corruption .
A recent poll indicated that more than 80 percent of Afghans are affected by government corruption in their daily lives .
About a third believe the government is less corrupt than a year ago , but a near equal number believes it is more corrupt .
Progress is slow .
The government was to have enacted 13 new anti-corruption measures by the end of February , but as of last month , only one of the decrees had been signed , the Pentagon report said .
" Public perceptions of the government with regard to corruption continue to be decidedly negative , with blame placed on ISAF and the rest of the international community as well as the government , " the report says .
ISAF is the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force .
There have been some recent acts aimed at cleaning up corruption , the defense official said , citing an Afghan police general who was convicted of stealing from a " widows and orphans " fund .
But overall , eliminating corruption is " elusive now .
It was elusive two years ago .
And it was elusive five years ago . "
The official said building Afghan security forces is both challenging and risky .
" There is significant risk to us attaining our goals , " the officials said .
" There is a lot of concern over the ability of the Afghan National Police to grow . "
The report describes problems inside the force with individuals not on the payroll doing police work in some districts , as well as " ghost police " who are on the payroll but do n't actually show up for duty .
The entire police force has begun to be drug tested , and the most recent results found nearly 14 percent of the force tested positive .
The report also details a severe shortage of trainers to build the Afghan forces to sufficient size and quality .
But , the senior defense official said , there 's been some progress on that front within the last month .
" Since the report closed , we 've had more commitments of trainers , " the official said .
" It 's 20 to 30 percent better since the report closed . "
The report also indicated that the recent capture of some Taliban leaders over the border in Pakistan has been demoralizing to some Afghan Taliban fighters .
The fighters are under more pressure than ever , the report says , but they are still able to get money for their fight from Islamic states outside Afghanistan .
Iran , the senior defense official said , has been " a mixed bag . "
" They 're doing some positive things in Afghanistan , and some very negative things . "
" It might sound weird and gross to put mayonnaise in a chocolate cake , but it makes sense when you think about it . "
Some things just go together — peanut butter and jelly , cheese and crackers , chocolate and mayonnaise .
Wait , what ?
You do n't yet know about how awesome chocolate mayonnaise cake is ?
Today 's recipe was actually inspired by a SE Talk thread .
I can't say I know its exact origins , but it 's certainly nothing new — many recipes refer to it as " World War II " or " Depression - Era " chocolate cake .
It 's a testament to the resourcefulness of home cooks through the ages ; in times of food scarcity or limited budgets , you have to get creative .
It 's no wonder this recipe has lasted — this chocolate cake is moist , tender and delightful .
And really easy to make .
It might sound weird and gross to put mayonnaise in a chocolate cake , but it makes sense when you think about it .
Mayo is just oil , eggs , and a little vinegar .
The oil makes the cake beautifully moist and tender , and the vinegar punches up the chocolate flavor a little .
What 's nice about it is it's not too sweet , and extremely chocolatey .
I decided to make it a 2 - layer 9 " cake , with a simple chocolate frosting recipe from Smitten Kitchen ; but it 's just as delicious by itself with a little whipped cream or a scoop of ice cream .
When chocolate cake is this good , you do n't need to dress it up too much .

It is not unusual for members of Congress to arrange group rentals in Washington to share housing costs and , for some , underline their continuing “ outsider ” status .
What is highly unusual , and unjustifiable , is the tax - exempt status as a religious institution enjoyed by a boarding house called the C Street Center that caters to conservative Christian lawmakers .
The $ 1.8 million townhouse came to public notice last year when three recent tenants  Senator John Ensign ; Mark Sanford , the South Carolina governor and former congressman ; and former Representative Charles Pickering Jr.  were embroiled in marital infidelity scandals .
Mr. Pickering was accused by his estranged wife of entertaining a mistress at the house .
The center soon lost most of its city tax exemption , after District of Columbia officials decided it was a residence , not a church .
And now a coalition of mainline Christian ministers is demanding that the Internal Revenue Service end the center ’s federal tax exemption and its shield of nontransparency .
The coalition is rightly concerned that the center is exploiting , and thereby cheapening , the constitutional protections guaranteed legitimate religious institutions .
The ministers say the center should be investigated as “ an exclusive club for powerful officials ” who reportedly enjoy low rents and other tax - subsidized benefits in a rooming house “ masquerading as a church . ”
This is no table top idea still confused about chemical or physics properties – the muon catalyst fusion method is well understood and has been until a decade or so ago , widely researched .
The idea came before 1950 from Andrei Sakharov and F.C. Frank , who predicted the phenomenon of muon - catalyzed fusion on theoretical grounds .
Luis W. Alvarez et al. , analyzed the outcome of some experiments with the muon ’s incident on a hydrogen bubble chamber at Berkeley in 1956 , observed muon - catalysis of exothermic p-d , proton and deuteron , nuclear fusion , which resulted in a helion , a gamma ray , and a release of about 5.5 MeV of energy .
The Alvarez experimental results , in particular , spurred John David Jackson to publish one of the first comprehensive theoretical studies of muon - catalyzed fusion in his ground - breaking 1957 paper .
( “ Catalysis of Nuclear Reactions between hydrogen isotopes by μ−-Mesons ” .
Physical Review 106 : 330 )
This paper contained the first serious speculations on useful energy release from muon - catalyzed fusion .
Jackson concluded that it would be impractical as an energy source , unless the “ alpha - sticking problem ” could be solved , leading potentially to an energetically cheaper way of producing the catalyzing muons .
By 1957 the idea to bind atoms using muons seemed a rich research field .
Until 5 – 10 years ago , muon - catalyzed nuclear fusion experiments were conducted in muon facilities in the United States , Switzerland and Russia , and all achieved an energy balance of about 40 % .
These countries withdrew from these studies because of the decommissioning of muon facilities or a lack of experts who could deal with the tritium fuel , a radioactive material .
That left The RIKEN Foundation ’s Nishina Center for Accelerator - Based Science and the RIKEN–RAL Muon Facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom .
The RIKEN–RAL Muon Facility generates the most powerful pulsed muon beam in the world , and the center has taken a leading role in applied studies of muons .
Teiichiro Matsuzaki , director of the RIKEN - RAL Muon Facility says , “ Using muons , we can achieve nuclear fusion in a comparatively small facility at reasonable cost . ”
Matsuzaki and scientists at the facility have been conducting unique experiments as part of fundamental research into the use of muons to develop industrially viable nuclear fusion technology .
The RIKEN–RAL Muon Facility creates , artificially generated , the most powerful pulsed muon beam in the world , and the center has taken a leading role in applied studies of muons .
Muon - based nuclear fusion does not require such ultrahigh temperatures or superdense states , says Matsuzaki .
Compared to magnetic field confinement fusion and inertial confinement fusion , muon - base nuclear fusion could allow stable nuclear fusion to be induced in a smaller facility at lower cost for a longer period of time .
The issue is then how muon - based nuclear fusion can be induced .
The fuel medium , a mixed gas of deuterium and tritium , is cooled to temperatures below around − 250 °C , causing the gas to form a liquid or solid .
Using negative muons , the injection of a beam of muons into the fuel medium then generates muonic tritium atoms ( tµ ) , which are similar to hydrogen atoms .
As muons are 207 times heavier than electrons , the muon orbits the nucleus at a distance much shorter than that for electrons .
Thus , tµ atoms are extremely small , and because the tµ atoms have no charge , they collide with deuterium atoms without being affected by repulsive electrical force .
This process produces muonic deuterium–tritium molecules ( dtµ ) , which are also similar to hydrogen atoms , and which have a nucleus consisting of a muon , a deuterium nucleus and a tritium nucleus .
Similar to the tµ atom , the dtµ molecule is extremely small , which allows the deuterium and tritium nuclei to come into very close proximity , thus inducing the desired d–t nuclear fusion .
At the end of the fusion instance , the muon in the dt molecule is liberated and becomes available for the creation of a new dtµ molecule .
Thus a chain of nuclear fusions occurs .
This reaction is called ‘ muon - catalyzed nuclear fusion ’ because the muons act like a catalyst that drives nuclear fusion .
This scenario has gotten to 40 % efficiency without the deep fuel cooling .
In the RIKEN–RAL Muon Facility , a single muon is capable of inducing d–t nuclear fusion 120 times before it decays , producing 2 GeV of energy .
Generally about 5 GeV of energy is required to produce one muon , corresponding to an energy balance of 40 % .
For scientific break - even the efficiency level required is estimated to be 3 – 10 times higher where a single muon needs to induce d–t nuclear fusion 1,000 – 3,000 times before decaying .
The fusion waste is helium , where about 1 % has a muon still stuck aboard and preventing the liberated muons from catalyzing subsequent nuclear fusion reactions .
Matsuzaki has learned the muons can be stripped from the muonic helium as the atoms collide with deuterium and tritium atoms in the fuel , the “ Reactivation ” step seen in the graphic .
Gaining efficiency depends on improving two points : how to strip the muons from the muonic helium atoms efficiently , and how to create dt molecules more efficiently .
When the fuel is made much denser by cooling , the muonic helium atoms can be stripped of their muons more easily because of the increased probability of collision with deuterium or tritium atoms .
Also denser fuel will contribute to an increased probability of creating dtµ molecules by more frequently bringing muonic tritium and muonic deuterium atoms into close proximity , as well as increasing the frequency of nuclear fusion induced by a single muon and increasing the efficiency of the nuclear fusion cycle .
That offers a tantalizing possibility , if muonic helium atoms can be completely stripped of their muons , at the present level of dtµ creation efficiency , a single muon could induce nuclear fusion 340 times before decaying , which will be close to the scientific break - even condition .
Matsuzaki and his team have shown that the efficiency of the nuclear fusion cycle improves as the temperature of the solid fuel is increased from 5 to 17 K ( 0 K = – 273.15 °C ) and will attempt to increase the temperature of the solid fuel further to investigate how the efficiency of the nuclear fusion cycle might increase .
If the temperature is increased too far , the solid fuel will melt and become a liquid .
The fuel , however , stays solid up to temperatures of 30 K provided that the pressure is maintained above 1,000 atmospheres .
Matsuzaki and his team have finished designing the laboratory equipment for this experiment , which will be a world first as it has never been attempted before .
The new equipment allows for other ideas for experimentation .
Controlling the molecular - excited state of the deuterium in the fuel by irradiating it with a laser beam may enhance the production of dtµ molecules .
Applying an electric field to the fuel may increase the efficiency of stripping the muons from the muonic helium atoms .
In 2008 , a new muon facility was constructed in Japan .
This facility , the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex ( J - PARC ) , produces an intense beam of muons .
It seems Matsuzaki has the tenacity to get much closer to a breakeven fusion and could get beyond .
The research he leads is full of strong points and potential .
Even with the innovation to super cool the fuel and the coming experiments , one thing just jumps out at the casual observer – that 5 GeV of energy of required to produce one muon – is a gold mine looking for an engineer .
Cut that 5 GeV by half and Matsuzaki might already have the breakeven technique .

Just like the rest of the Internet , we ’ve been totally captivated by Die Antwoord , the South African oddball rap group fronted by a guy named Ninja with an awesome haircut and some terrible tattoos .
They blew up early last month after Boing Boing posted their “ Zef Side ” and “ Enter the Ninja ” videos , slickly produced clips featuring Ninja ’s unique , slang - heavy flow , his bandmate Yo - Landi Vi$$er ’s creepy soprano , and their friend and progeria victim Leon Botha .
They ’re the self appointed representatives of South African zef culture , something they ’ve explained as “ the ultimate style … our full flex … like on the video game , when you reach the next level .
Zef is the next level . ”
But because Ninja has performed under different personae , it was then assumed Die Antwoord was an elaborate prank ; if that ’s the case , we salute his commitment to a strangely enticing character .
Our e-mail interview with the group does n’t really get to the bottom of things , but it does feature the phrase “ popped out the slime bunny . ”
( By the way , we know this is like a million jillion years late in Internet time , but we sent our questions a while ago , and their representative , Dirk the Oracle , just got back to us . )
How long were you performing as Die Antwoord before you began getting international attention ?
Die Antwoord was in the oven for about five years .
It popped out the slime bunny about a year ago , but we ’ve only been popular for about three weeks now .
Do you have any sense why the band blew up when it did ?
What makes now the right time for Die Antwoord ?
It was a full moon on the third of February 2010 when everyone started freaking out .
“ Now ” is all we got , my bru .
Have you been reading everything that ’s been written about you online ?
Sort of .
Do you hope the attention you ’ve gotten will spread to your peers in South Africa ?
Is there a lively cultural scene around you that has been ignored internationally ?
Fok , I actually do n’t know what ’s going on with anything in this place .
Is changing the international perception of South Africa important to you ?
Not really .
How have things changed for you guys in day - to - day life ?
Someone goes shopping for us now .
Were you working day jobs ?
No .
What can people expect from your live shows ?
A total mind fuck .
Where did the financing for your music videos come from ?
We made them with some friends who all worked for free ‘ cause they love our music .
You ’ve been frequently described as “ white trash . ”
Do you accept that term ?
What does it mean to you ?
It means someone does not know what they are talking about .
Our style is zef .
We not trash , we are fuckin’ fancy .
White rappers still have a hard time gaining credibility in the U.S.
Is that barrier one that concerns you ?
This is not a barrier that concerns us , because as you may have noticed , we have fucked this barrier in the face .
Why do you rap in English ?
Why did you select an Afrikaans name ?
In South Africa we speak English and sometimes Afrikaans , sometimes Zulu , sometimes Xhosa .
We rap like we speak .
Die Antwoord just has a nice ring to it .
What does “ ninja ” symbolize to you ?
Who ’s your favorite ninja of all time ?
When I was a boy , I wanted to be a Ninja .
Now I am a man , now I am a Ninja .
The girl ninja from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was quite spif .
I like the way she hid her skills from her master .
What ’s your relationship with Leon Botha ?
Leon is a good friend of ours .
He has the biggest collection of nineties underground rap albums I have ever seen in my life .
His bedroom looks like a CD shop .
Leon is also a jedi mind - fuck scratch D.J. He D.J. ’s under the name D.J. Solarize , and he often opens for us when Die Antwoord perform live .
Leon is a cool performer , and so we asked him if he wanted to be in the “ Enter the Ninja ” video with us and he said cool .
My favorite work we ’ve done with Leon are the dark little short films we made that are hiding in the SECRET CHAMBER on our interwebsite .
You ’ve expressed interest in having Neill Blomkamp make the Die Antwoord movie .
Have you reached out to him ?
Neill is making a music video with us .
We ’ve been chatting for a while now .
We have n’t spoke about the movie yet .
What is your vision for the film ?
It ’s the story of how Die Antwoord started .
Do n’t want to talk about it too much .
It ’s nicer to watch a movie instead of speaking about it .
I understand you ’re heading to the U.S. ?
We leaving for L.A. and NYC this Sunday .
We flying business class .
They say in business class everything is free .
They say you fly in a bed .
They say the waitresses do n’t wear tops .
We just do n’t know what to wear yet .
I ’m thinking of just wearing my underpants and takkies .
Yo - landi is thinking of wearing her new red SHOPRITE CHECKERS sweater with the yellow smiley faces .
Some Internet reports describe Ninja as just the latest persona of “ mixed - media artist ” Waddy Jones .
Is that inaccurate ?
I used to be called Waddy Jones .
But I changed my name to Ninja because it ’s more me .
I ’m a rapper .
Valve have confirmed that Steam and Source are to be released for Mac .
After last week ’s cunning campaign , they ’re not only releasing their back catalogue of games for the shiny plastic blobs , but also intend to simultaneously release Portal 2 on both PC and Mac this Christmas .
The other headlines are that Mac and PC gamers will be able to play multiplayer together , and that Mac is now considered a “ tier - 1 ” platform by Valve , alongside PC and 360 .
Although I ’m not sure how FPS games will be playable on single button mice .
( Tee hee hee . )
Details below .
Go on , have a whole press release :
March 8 , 2010 – Valve announced today it will bring Steam , Valve ’s gaming service , and Source , Valve ’s gaming engine , to the Mac .
Steam and Valve ’s library of games including Left 4 Dead 2 , Team Fortress 2 , Counter - Strike , Portal , and the Half - Life series will be available in April .
“ As we transition from entertainment as a product to entertainment as a service , customers and developers need open , high - quality Internet clients , ” said Gabe Newell , President of Valve .
“ The Mac is a great platform for entertainment services . ”
“ Our Steam partners , who are delivering over a thousand games to 25 million Steam clients , are very excited about adding support for the Mac , ” said Jason Holtman , Director of Business Development at Valve .
“ Steamworks for the Mac supports all of the Steamworks APIs , and we have added a new feature , called Steam Play , which allows customers who purchase the product for the Mac or Windows to play on the other platform free of charge .
For example , Steam Play , in combination with the Steam Cloud , allows a gamer playing on their work PC to go home and pick up playing the same game at the same point on their home Mac .
We expect most developers and publishers to take advantage of Steam Play . ”
“ We looked at a variety of methods to get our games onto the Mac and in the end decided to go with native versions rather than emulation , ” said John Cook , Director of Steam Development .
“ The inclusion of WebKit into Steam , and of OpenGL into Source gives us a lot of flexibility in how we move these technologies forward .
We are treating the Mac as a tier - 1 platform so all of our future games will release simultaneously on Windows , Mac , and the Xbox 360 .
Updates for the Mac will be available simultaneously with the Windows updates .
Furthermore , Mac and Windows players will be part of the same multiplayer universe , sharing servers , lobbies , and so forth .
We fully support a heterogeneous mix of servers and clients .
The first Mac Steam client will be the new generation currently in beta testing on Windows . ”
Portal 2 will be Valve ’s first simultaneous release for Mac and Windows .
“ Checking in code produces a PC build and Mac build at the same time , automatically , so the two platforms are perfectly in lock - step , ” said Josh Weier , Portal 2 Project Lead .
“ We ’re always playing a native version on the Mac right alongside the PC .
This makes it very easy for us and for anyone using Source to do game development for the Mac . ”
“ Of particular concern is that elements of China ’s military modernization appear designed to challenge our freedom of action in the region , ” the admiral said .
Yalong Bay , on the southern coast of Hainan island in the South China Sea , is the site of five - star beach resorts just west of a new underground submarine base .
The base allows submarines to reach deep water within 20 minutes and roam the South China Sea , which has some of the world ’s busiest shipping lanes and areas rich in oil and natural gas that are the focus of territorial disputes between China and other Asian nations .
That has caused concern not only among American commanders , but also among officials in Southeast Asian nations , which have been quietly acquiring more submarines , missiles and other weapons .
“ Regional officials have been surprised , ” said Huang Jing , a scholar of the Chinese military at the National University of Singapore .
“ We were in a blinded situation .
We thought the Chinese military was 20 years behind us , but we suddenly realized China is catching up . ”
China is also pressing the United States to heed its claims in the region .
In March , Chinese officials told two visiting senior Obama administration officials , Jeffrey A. Bader and James B. Steinberg , that China would not tolerate any interference in the South China Sea , now part of China ’s “ core interest ” of sovereignty , said an American official involved in China policy .
It was the first time the Chinese labeled the South China Sea a core interest , on par with Taiwan and Tibet , the official said .
Another element of the Chinese Navy ’s new strategy is to extend its operational reach beyond the South China Sea and the Philippines to what is known as the “ second island chain ” — rocks and atolls out in the Pacific , the official said .
That zone significantly overlaps the United States Navy ’s area of supremacy .
Japan is anxious , too .
Its defense minister , Toshimi Kitazawa , said in mid-April that two Chinese submarines and eight destroyers were spotted on April 10 heading between two Japanese islands en route to the Pacific , the first time such a large Chinese flotilla had been seen so close to Japan .
When two Japanese destroyers began following the Chinese ships , a Chinese helicopter flew within 300 feet of one of the destroyers , the Japanese Defense Ministry said .
Since December 2008 , China has maintained three ships in the Gulf of Aden to contribute to international antipiracy patrols , the first deployment of the Chinese Navy beyond the Pacific .
The mission allows China to improve its navy ’s long - range capabilities , analysts say .
MOSCOW —
For a few terrifying seconds before a Polish jet crashed in western Russia on Saturday , its crew members knew they were about to die , Poland ’s chief prosecutor said on Thursday , as investigators in both countries analyzed the contents of the plane ’s black boxes .
“ One could say that the crew was aware of the inevitability of the coming catastrophe , if only due to the plane shaking after the wings hit the trees , which we are certain happened , ” the prosecutor , Andrzej Seremet , told a Polish radio station .
The plane crashed in thick fog on Saturday , killing Poland ’s president , Lech Kaczynski , and 95 others , including many top civilian and military officials .
Russian officials said the crew had been strongly warned about the poor conditions , leading to speculation that the pilot was pressed to land so the dignitaries would not be late for a ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre .
That theory was bolstered by an episode from 2008 , when Mr. Kaczynski ordered a pilot to land in Tbilisi , Georgia ’s capital .
The pilot defied him , saying the conditions were too dangerous , and diverted to another airport .
Doing such a thing ignores the plan 's main appeal .
Basically , Dr. Feige proposes to eliminate the entire federal tax system -- including corporate , excise and estate taxes -- in favor of a tiny tax on all financial transactions that would be automatically deducted from special taxpayer accounts resembling those of E - ZPass holders .
( Drivers with E - ZPass have a little windshield gizmo that is automatically read when passing through a toll plaza ; the toll is then deducted from their E - ZPass accounts , which are replenished periodically by credit card or check . )
In a stroke , the Feige plan would sweep away the Rube Goldberg system we 've come to loathe : no deductions , no income tax returns , maybe even no Internal Revenue Service .
The whole thing would raise the same amount of money as today 's system does while saving hundreds of billions of dollars in compliance costs , tax evasion and inefficiencies , according to Dr. Feige .
I know about all the lobbyists with their own special interests , but let 's just dream for an instant .
No longer would economic players contort themselves to avoid taxes -- mostly it would n't be worth it .
And no longer could the government direct the economy through the tax code , which encourages people to do things they might not otherwise do .
Most of these things -- like buying overweight sports utility vehicles to get a light - truck deduction -- are a bad idea anyway .
Instead , Dr. Feige would levy a little toll -- just 0.6 percent -- on the economic highway of life .
This amount -- the professor 's conservative calculations mean we might get away with even less -- would be split by payer and payee in any transaction , meaning on average you would pay 0.3 percent whenever you spent or received money .
It would all be taken care of by your bank 's computers when they paid your check or you withdrew cash .
You 'd hardly notice it -- especially since even someone spending $ 100,000 a year would pay just $ 300 in tax .
But I said the plan is '' revenue neutral . ''
So where would the bulk of the tax revenue come from ?
Well , most of the value of transactions in a modern economy consists of financial dealings : sales of stocks and bonds , currency trading and the like .
And these would be taxed .
Financial services firms would scream , but even they would get some benefit .
There would be no corporate income tax , after all , and while liquidity might be slightly reduced , some economists figure a small tax on financial transactions would cut speculation and dampen volatility .
A Muslim woman has lodged a complaint with federal officials after she said she was fired from her job at a San Mateo clothing store for refusing to remove her hijab , or head scarf .
Hani Khan , 19 , of Foster City said she was fired Monday at the Hollister clothing store at the Hillsdale Shopping Center .
She was dismissed a week after a district manager visited the store , called her into a meeting and said she was not supposed to wear the scarf while at work , said Khan , who is of Indian and Pakistani descent .
A representative from human resources joined the meeting by phone , and Khan said she had been told that she was in violation of the store 's " look policy . "
" I thought it was quite unfair , " Khan said in an interview .
" It was really surprising , especially in the Bay Area , because everybody 's so open - minded and accepting of everybody .
It 's really surprising to see blatant discrimination against someone who is of an Islamic state who is wearing a hijab . "
Khan contacted the Council on American - Islamic Relations , a Muslim advocacy group .
On Tuesday , the organization filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Abercrombie & Fitch , which operates Hollister stores .
The commission cannot confirm or deny the existence of a complaint , a spokesman said .
Abercrombie & Fitch officials did not respond to requests for comment .
Khan , a political science student at the College of San Mateo , said she wore her hijab to her job interview before she was hired as a part - time stockroom worker in October .
She said her direct supervisors had no problem with her headwear , so long as they were of the company 's colors - navy , gray and white - which she said they were .
Zahra Billoo , a spokeswoman for the Council on American - Islamic Relations , said Khan 's firing was " unconscionable . "
" Firing someone explicitly for a religious reason or practice is , in our view , against the law , " Billoo said .
In September , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Abercrombie & Fitch for allegedly discriminating against a 17 - year - old Muslim in Oklahoma by refusing to hire her because she wore a hijab .
The case is pending .

Unter der Überschrift „ Behüten , wo es nötig ist “ , verteidigt Kurt Beck in der Wochenendausgabe der Süddeutschen Zeitung in einem Gastkommentar den Jugendmedienschutz - Staatsvertrag ( JMStV ) .
Dass ein Ministerpräsident in einer große Tageszeitung zur Kritik an dem Konzept des Jugendmedienschutzes Stellung nimmt , zeigt , dass die Bedenken , die speziell die Netz - Community vorgetragen hat , auf der obersten landespolitischen Ebene angekommen sind .
Inhaltlich nimmt Kurt Beck vor allem zu der geplanten ( freiwilligen ) Einführung von Alterskennzeichnungen für Internetinhalte in einem neuen Entwurf zur Änderung des Jugendmedienschutz - Staatsvertrags ( § 5 Abs. 1 und Abs. 2 JMStV -E ) Stellung .
Dieses freiwillige Labeling von Websites durch den Content - Anbieter selbst , soll , so Beck , anerkannten Jugendschutzprogrammen als Filterkriterium dienen .
Diese Jugendschutzprogramme sollen von den Eltern auf den Rechnern der Kinder installiert werden , um so den Zugriff der Kinder auf bestimmte Inhalte zu verhindern .
So zumindest stellt Beck sich das vor .
Und an dieser Stelle zeigt sich bereits das Dilemma .
Diejenigen Websites , die nicht mit einer Alterskennzeichnung versehen werden , laufen nämlich Gefahr , dass sie von Kindern und Jugendlichen , denen von den Eltern ein entsprechendes Filterprogramm vorgesetzt worden ist , überhaupt nicht mehr aufgerufen werden können .
Und das gilt selbst für völlig harmlose Websites .
Denn wenn die Filterprogramme alle Websites ausfiltern , die überhaupt keine Alterskennzeichnung haben ( White - List - Prinzip ) , dann bleibt nicht mehr viel übrig und es entwickelt sich genau das „ Kindernet “ , das Kurt Beck nach eigenen Worten vermeiden will .
Unter anderem an diesem Punkt setzt auch die Kritik aus dem Netz an .
Denn dieser Mechanismus könnte dazu führen , dass ein faktischer Zwang zur Alterskennzeichnung entsteht .
Will man das Risiko vermeiden , dass die eigene Website von Minderjährigen überhaupt nicht mehr genutzt werden kann , wird man im Zweifel eine Alterskennzeichnung brauchen .
Und die kann man sich nicht selbst ausdenken .
Vielmehr muss man sich einer anerkannten Einrichtung der Freiwilligen Selbstkontrolle unterwerfen .
Und das ist für die meisten Websites , die mit ihren Inhalten kein Geld verdienen , keine realistische Option .
Das skizzierte Szenario , wonach mit staatlicher Hilfe in großem Stile Internetinhalte ausgefiltert werden , ist somit keinesfalls abwegig .
Ein solches staatliches Konzept ist außerdem deshalb problematisch , weil sich auch Kinder und Jugendliche auf die Informationsfreiheit des Art. 5 GG berufen können und es auch ihnen möglich sein muss , sich grundsätzlich ungehindert aus allgemein zugänglichen Quellen zu unterrichten .
Genau das ist auch ein wichtiger Baustein auf dem Weg , die Entwicklung von Kindern und Jugendlichen zu eigenverantwortlichen und gemeinschaftsfähigen Persönlichkeiten zu fördern .
Gerade diese Aufgabe des Jugendschutzes wird durch das skizzierte Konzept des Jugendmedienschutzes gefährdet .
Was ebenfalls als problematisch betrachtet werden muss , ist die Vorstellung , dass Access - Provider ihren Kunden derartige Jugendschutzprogramme zum Download anbieten müssen .
Damit wird wiederum der Zugangsprovider mit in die Pflicht genommen , obwohl es hierfür keine nachvollziehbaren Gründe gibt .
Wenn Kurt Beck außerdem von einem richtungsweisenden Modell für ganz Europa spricht , so verkennt er , dass der seit 2003 in Kraft befindliche Staatsvertrag bislang vor allen Dingen deshalb nicht besonders aufgefallen ist , weil Regelungsinstrumente wie die umstrittenen „ Sendezeitbeschränkungen “ für Netzinhalte nur vereinzelt und nicht in der Breite zur Anwendung gelangt sind .
Würde man dieses Vollzusgdefizit beseitigen , dann wären die Auswirkungen möglicherweise auch für Inhaltsanbieter spürbar , die gar keinen jugendgefährdenden Content am Netz haben .
Der grundlegende Fehler des JMStV besteht letztlich darin , dass Instrumentarien aus dem Jugendschutzgesetz ( Sendezeitbeschränkungen , Kennzeichnung nach Altersstufen ) eins zu eins auf den Jugendschutz im Internet übertragen werden .
Die geistigen Väter dieser Konzepte halten das Internet immer noch für eine moderne Variante des Rundfunks und verstehen deshalb auch nicht , dass diese Konzepte erstens nicht effektiv funktionieren können und zweitens die Gefahr beinhalten , dass Inhalte beeinträchtigt werden , die nicht im Ansatz jugendgefährdend sind .
Kurt Beck sagt in seinem Beitrag für die SZ : „ Wer diesen Entwurf als Einschränkung der Freiheit im Netz sieht , der will sich seiner Verantwortung nicht stellen „ .
Vielleicht kennt Kurt Beck ja das Brecht - Zitat „ Gut gemeint ist das Gegenteil von gut . „ .
Im Gegensatz zu Kurt Beck glaube ich , dass , wer Kinder und Jugendliche zu eigenverantwortlichen und mündigen Bürgern erziehen will , nicht daran vorbei kommt , diesen Staatsvertrag insgesamt auf den Prüftstand zu stellen .
Beim Jugendmedienschutz ist ein vollständiges Umdenken erforderlich und nicht nur eine Korrektur des aktuellen Änderungsentwurfs .

Canadian " Prince of Pot " Marc Emery 's battle to avoid being extradited to the US to serve a five - year federal prison sentence for selling pot seeds over the Internet continues as the clock ticks down toward May 10 -- the date by which Canadian Justice Minister Rob Nicholson is to decide whether to okay his extradition or not .
Emery and his supporters are fighting to the bitter end , and they 're picking up some significant support along the way .
Marc and Jodie Emery ( courtesy Cannabis Culture )
Last month , members of all three major English speaking political parties , including the ruling Conservatives , handed in 12,000 signatures on petitions to parliament demanding he not be extradited and addressed the House of Commons on the issue .
Shortly thereafter , the French speaking Bloc Quebecois announced it , too , was joining the cause of keeping Emery in Canada .
Emery was Canada 's best known marijuana legalization advocate and a leading funder of marijuana reform groups there and in other countries when he was arrested in Vancouver on a US warrant for marijuana seed - selling after being indicted by a federal grand jury in Seattle .
He faced up to life in prison under the US charges .
Emery , his supporters , and other marijuana reformers have argued that he was arrested for political reasons -- for his support of the legalization cause -- and the gleeful words of then DEA administrator Karen Tandy provided valuable ammunition for the claim .
Emery 's arrest was " a significant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the US and Canada , but also to the marijuana legalization movement , " Tandy said in a statement the day of the bust .
" His marijuana trade and propagandist marijuana magazine have generated nearly $ 5 million a year in profits that bolstered his trafficking efforts , but those have gone up in smoke today .
Hundreds of thousands of dollars of Emery 's illicit profits are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the United States and Canada .
Drug legalization lobbyists now have one less pot of money to rely on , " Tandy gloated .
For four years , he and his employees and fellow indictees , Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams , negotiated with federal prosecutors , before Rainey and Williams struck plea deals that allowed them to simply remain in Canada .
Then , last September , Emery himself agreed to a plea bargain that would see him serve five years in US prison .
Emery was detained in Canada on September 28 and was jailed until mid-November before he was released pending the justice minister 's decision on whether to approve his removal to the United States .
Since then , the campaign to block his extradition has gone all out .
Even in prison , Emery did podcasts -- " potcasts , " the magazine calls them -- and since his release , he has been as media - friendly as ever .
He has used his Cannabis Culture magazine as a bully pulpit and established a No Extradition ! web site to further the cause .
The high point of the campaign so far came on March 12 when three members of parliament , Conservative MP Scott Reid , New Democratic MP Libby Davies , and Liberal MP Ujjal Dosanjh stood before parliament in Ottawa to deliver the petitions .
All three told the Commons that extraditing Emery for what is considered a non-serious offense in Canada was unfair .
MP Reid , a Conservative leader in the House , reminded the Commons that the Extradition Act specifies that the justice minister " shall refuse to surrender a person when that surrender could involve unjust or undue or oppressive actions by the country to which he is being extradited . "
Reid pointed out that Health Canada used to refer medical marijuana patients to Emery 's seed bank .
He also noted that Canadian courts had found that $ 200 fines were appropriate for seed sellers , while Emery faced up to life for the same offense in the US .
" It appears to me that we have assisted a foreign government arresting a man for doing something that we would n't arrest him for doing in Canada , " said MP Dosanjh .
" As a former premier and a former attorney - general , I sense a certain degree of unfairness in the process .
Countries do n't usually extradite people to countries where they could face inordinate penalties . "
" Many dedicated individuals have collected approximately 12,000 petitions reflecting a strong belief that Mr. Emery or any Canadian should not face harsh punishment in the US for selling cannabis seeds on the Internet when it is not worthy of prosecution in Canada , " said MP Davies .
" The petitioners call on Parliament to make it clear to the Minister of Justice that such an extradition should be opposed .
I am very pleased to present this ; I think it is a very strong reflection of Canadians ' views on this matter and we hope that the Parliament of Canada will act on this , and certainly the Minister of Justice will take this into account . "
" My prospects are getting better , " said an ever optimistic Emery .
" There have been more than 50,000 communications -- phone calls , letters , emails -- to the justice minister , and we have members of all four major political parties , including the governing party , presenting petitions urging the minister not to extradite .
We also have the last three mayors of Vancouver agreeing to sign a statement urging the government not to extradite . "
Support is palpable in his adopted hometown , Emery said .
" I ca n't go 50 feet in this city without people stopping me on the street , " he said from his downtown Vancouver building .
" I have lots of support in this province and throughout the country .
I enjoy a lot of positive affirmation .
For me , this has been excellent -- I 've been giving interviews all over the world , and the movie ' Prince of Pot ' is being translated into Mongolian !
The national TV network there has permission to do two documentaries on pot , and I 'm in both of them . "
Now , all eyes turn toward Justice Minister Nicholson .
A month from now , he will decide whether to extradite Emery or not -- or he may punt .
The minister has the option of applying for an extension on his decision .
There is precedent for the minister to seek an extension , said attorney Kirk Tousaw , who has worked on Emery 's case .
" Renee Boje was committed for extradition , and the decision sat on the desk of three different justice ministers for five years , " he pointed out .
" Renee was a US citizen who committed offenses in America , so she seemed like a much more reasonable prospect for extradition than Marc , who has never gone to America or committed any crimes there . "
In the meantime , the campaign to keep Emery in Canada continues to gather support and argue the position that his was a politically motivated prosecution .
" If the minister believes the prosecution to be politically motivated , he is prohibited from extraditing , " said attorney Kirk Tousaw , who has worked on Emery 's case .
" I do n't know if he will take that position .
The minister may need a lot of time to consider his options . "
The calculations may be as much political as legal , Tousaw said .
" This is a minority Conservative government that is attempting to pass unpopular mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes , and there will be an election sometime this year or early next year , " he argued .
" I think that extraditing Marc Emery will be politically costly to the Conservative Party .
I 'm not sure they can afford to do it if they want to form a majority government . "
" The government does want to extradite me , " said Emery , " but the public pressure not to do it is substantial .
There is nothing to be gaining by extraditing me , and it will piss off a couple of million voters in the next election . "
A month from now , we will know whether the Conservative government is willing to sacrifice the gadfly Emery on the altar of the drug war , or whether it is too concerned about the potential backlash to either reject extradition or postpone the decision .

Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele has had no trouble attracting media coverage , but holding onto the party ’s biggest donors has been more difficult .
Since Steele became chairman in January 2009 , a growing number of prominent GOP donors has stopped contributing to the RNC , choosing instead to direct their money to outlets such as the party ’s Senatorial Committee .
“ There are a whole lot of troubling things going on , and it ’s something that gets talked about with some frequency , ” said a major Republican donor who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ These are people who are longtime , loyal donors — serious , successful people — and to be in the front page of newspapers because someone put a chit in for going to a sex club , it ’s just dumb . ”
According to filings with the Federal Election Commission , at least eight of the RNC ’s top individual donors have declined to contribute in the past 14 months , a list that includes Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus and real - estate mogul Harlan Crow .
Each of the individuals had a record of contributing thousands to the RNC in past years but since 2009 have chosen to direct their money to the NRSC , National Republican Congressional Committee or individual campaign committees .
Marcus , who did not respond to attempts to contact him , donated $ 25,000 to the RNC in 2008 , but nothing since .
In that span he gave $ 70,000 to the NRSC and $ 12,500 to the NRCC .
Crow gave $ 27,000 to the RNC in 2008 but nothing after , though he has given almost $ 90,000 combined to the other two committees .
Other donors including telecom tycoon Kenny Troutt and fast food magnate Jason LeVecke followed similar patterns .
Since Steele took over the RNC he has been buffeted by charges of excessive spending , punctuated this week by a Daily Caller story that revealed RNC staffers charged a $ 2,000 trip to a bondage - themed nightclub in West Hollywood to donors .
While a junior staffer in charge of that excursion has been fired , the resulting media firestorm has managed to once again incite Steele ’s numerous critics .
While most donors contacted declined to speak on the record , Mark DeMoss , chief executive of an Atlanta - based PR company , has been vocal about his displeasure with Steele following the unearthing earlier this month of an RNC fund - raising document which mocked President Obama , House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
“ After the ridiculous presentation by the finance chairman down in Boca Grande , I ’d written Michael Steele that I would not contribute to the party or to any of the committees , and would only give now directly to candidates , ” DeMoss told The Daily Caller on Tuesday .
While the nightclub charge has drawn the most attention , donors seem more concerned about the RNC ’s lavish spending on luxury hotels , limousines and other travel - related expenses .
“ I think the party loses any moral standing to talk with credibility about how Democrats are spending taxpayer money when the RNC is being arguably as reckless with donor money , ” DeMoss said .
“ This has given the RNC the opportunity to quibble over whether he was there and I do n’t care if he knew about that – he certainly knew about the private jets and the limousines and five star hotels . ”
“ To have staff people flying around on private jets and spending five figures at hotels — it was never done that way historically , ” said one donor .
“ When you ’re out trying to raise money people expect you to act responsibly , and acting responsibly starts at the top . ”
Other critics have questioned the professionalism of RNC leadership , which approved the expenditure .
“ There does appear to be a real issue with the RNC ’s discipline and command over its activities and representatives , ” said one local Republican consultant who asked not to be identified to speak candidly .
“ This damaging story could have been avoided if hard dollars were n’t spent to reimburse this guy for the tab … the lesson being you need to have reliable people responsible for planning these events and not just “ wing it . ”
Of course , “ winging it ” appears to be Steele ’s approach to everything . ”
“ I do think that everything rises and falls on leadership .
The chairman sets the tone and hires the staff and sets the agenda , ” DeMoss said .
“ The chairman tolerates certain behavior or not — he ’s ultimately responsible and for Republicans it ’s a tragedy right now that a ridiculous expense report has squandered some real political capital …
Instead the country is fixated on who turned in this expense report … I ca n’t imagine screwing it up any more than that . ”

It is only 12 years since his death but Ted Hughes is to be recognised as one of Britain 's greatest artists as a memorial is erected to him in Westminster Abbey 's Poets ' Corner .
The memorial for Hughes , who was Poet Laureate from 1984 until he died from cancer in 1998 , will lie in the south transept , alongside monuments for William Shakespeare , Geoffrey Chaucer , William Blake and T S Eliot .
He is the first poet to be so commemorated since Sir John Betjeman 's memorial was erected in 1984 .
The decision to place memorials in the Abbey rests with the Dean of Westminster , Very Reverend Dr John Hall , who said not every Poet Laureate was granted the honour .
" Deciding within a few years of people 's deaths that they will be remembered in hundreds of years ' time is of course impossible .
And yet , it is sometimes right to make such a decision , as deans have done over the centuries .
By no means every Poet Laureate has been commemorated in Poets ' Corner .
But the overwhelming weight of advice I have received suggests that this is the right decision , " he said .
Hughes ' widow , Carol , celebrated the decision and paid tribute to her late husband 's " unique enthusiasm for life " .
" I am thrilled that something of his colossal presence will haunt the aisles of Westminster Abbey .
Once the memorial is in place , I hope that those already familiar with Ted 's work will see it as a fitting tribute , and those visitors who come across it unexpectedly might be inspired to discover his work for themselves , " she said .
She also revealed that his appointment as Laureate had come as " something of a shock to the literary community " , considering the dark , sometimes stark , subject matter of his poetry , as well as his much - publicised marriage to the American poet , Sylvia Plath , who committed suicide by gassing herself in 1963 .
She had separated from Hughes by then but he was hounded by some feminists and Plath devotees after she died and some even accused him of driving Plath to her death with his infidelity .
In 1969 Hughes suffered another loss when his mistress , Assia Wevill , also gassed herself and their daughter in an apparent copycat suicide .
Mrs Hughes said : " As a writer who appeared to be outside if not beyond the Establishment , he may not have seemed the obvious candidate .
It was perhaps a surprise then to see over the years how much he relished the role . "
The Dean 's decision yesterday was preceded by a vigorous campaign led by a coalition of writers and poets including Seamus Heaney and Sir Andrew Motion .
Heaney , who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995 , called Hughes a " visionary poet " , and Sir Andrew , another former Laureate , said he introduced a " new kind of landscape into English poetry " .
The dedication of the memorial to Ted Hughes , which has not yet been designed , is expected to take place in 2011 .
Judith Palmer , director of the Poetry Society , said it was an " exciting and brave decision " to memorialise the poet so soon after his death , and testimony to the Establishment 's confidence in his reputation enduring for decades to come .
Hughes was born on 17 August 1930 in Mytholmroyd , West Yorkshire , and raised on local farms .
According to him , " My first six years shaped everything " .
He studied at Cambridge University and first published poetry in a journal launched with fellow students called St Botolph 's Review .
It was at the launch party for the magazine that he met Plath , and they married in 1956 .
They separated in 1962 .
As Plath 's widower , Hughes became the executor of her personal and literary estates .
He oversaw the publication of her manuscripts , including Ariel in 1966 .
He also claimed to have destroyed the final volume of Plath 's journal , detailing their last few months together .
In his foreword to The Journals of Sylvia Plath , he defended his actions as motivated by consideration for the couple 's young children .
He wrote about his relationship with Plath , and his response to her suicide , in Birthday Letters .
It was his final collection and one of his most successful works .
Hughes ' first book of poems , Hawk in the Rain , was published in 1957 to immediate acclaim , and over the next 41 years , he wrote nearly 90 books , winning numerous prizes and fellowships .
Poet 's Corner : Lesser - known artists remembered at Westminster Abbey
* Cædmon – The earliest English poet whose name is known .
He was an Anglo - Saxon herdsman who was originally ignorant of " the art of song " but learned to compose one night in the course of a dream , according to the 7th - century monk Bede .
He later became an accomplished religious poet .
His only known surviving work is " Cædmon 's Hymn " .
* Edmund Charles Blunden – Poet , author and critic born in 1896 .
Like his friend Siegfried Sassoon , he wrote of his experiences in the First World War in verse and prose .
For most of his career , Blunden was also a reviewer for English publications .
He ended his career as Professor of Poetry at Oxford .
* Christopher Anstey – Educated at Eton and King 's College , Cambridge , where he distinguished himself for his Latin verse .
In 1754 , he left Cambridge to work on the family estates .
He published nothing of note until a visit to Bath in 1766 resulted in his famous rhymed letters , The New Bath Guide or Memoirs of the Blunderhead Family .
He ended his days as a country squire at the age of 80 .
Malcolm McLaren , the man who irreversibly changed the face of British music as manager of the Sex Pistols , died yesterday , aged 64 .
He had suffered from cancer for some time and , despite a recent period of good health , his condition had deteriorated rapidly in recent days , according to his spokesman .
He died in Switzerland yesterday morning and his body is expected to be flown home to be buried in Highgate cemetery , north London .
Those paying tribute to him last night included John Lydon , who poignantly signed his statement in the name of Johnny Rotten , the nom de guerre that the one - time enfant terrible used during his Sex Pistols days .
" For me Malc was always entertaining and I hope you remember that , " he said .
" Above all else he was an entertainer and I will miss him and so should you . "
Young Kim , 38 , McLaren 's partner of 12 years , said he was diagnosed with mesothelioma – a rare form of cancer , last October .
She explained : " He died in hospital in Switzerland today , he had been doing well up until recently , he was lucid , I spoke to him yesterday . "
Describing him as the " ultimate postmodern artist " , she added : " I think Malcolm recognised he had changed the culture , he saw he had changed the world . "
" Everyone asks : ' Who was Malcolm McLaren ? '
Everything he did was groundbreaking , as an artist he carried on the link from Andy Warhol . "
Born in north London in 1946 , McLaren went to art school in the city before opening a clothes shop on the King 's Road in Chelsea , London , with his then partner , Vivienne Westwood .
McLaren later said he opened the fashion store , originally called Let It Rock , for " the sole purpose of smashing the English culture of deception " .
The pair began specialising in rubber and leather fetish gear , infamously renaming the shop " Sex " and defining punk fashion for a new generation .
The designer , now Dame Vivienne , said last night that they had not been in touch for a long time but added : " When we were young and I fell in love with Malcolm , I thought he was beautiful and I still do .
I thought he is a very charismatic , special and talented person .
The thought of him dead is really something very sad . "
Dame Vivienne said the couple 's son , Joe Corre , co-founder of the lingerie brand Agent Provocateur , and Ben Westwood , her son from her first marriage , were with McLaren when he died .
Corre said last night :" He was the original punk rocker and revolutionised the world .
He 's somebody I 'm incredibly proud of .
He 's a real beacon of a man for people to look up to . "
While McLaren 's business partnership with Westwood was to influence popular culture in its own right , it was his immersion into the world of music that secured his place in the annals of rock 'n ' roll history .
During a visit to New York , where he wanted to set up a boutique , he briefly managed the New York Dolls .
Last night , Sylvain Sylvain , one of the original band members , described McLaren as a " visionary " .
" Malcolm was the coolest cat I ever knew .
I 'm so sad at his passing , " he said .
" He gave the world incredible music , incredible style .
You can go to Beijing today and see punk shops , and that would n't have happened without Malcolm and Vivienne . "
Back in London , McLaren was determined to start his own band and by 1976 was managing the Sex Pistols , the punk entity that revolutionised popular culture and introduced anarchy to the masses .
Music journalist Jon Savage , who wrote England 's Dreaming , a history of punk and the Sex Pistols , said the movement could not have existed without McLaren .
" I hope he 'll be remembered with fondness .
He was a complex character , a contradictory character .
He could be very charming , he could be very cruel , but he mattered and he put something together that was extraordinary . "
Although the Sex Pistols failed to get to number one with God Save the Queen , which made it to number two during the week of Queen Elizabeth II 's Silver Jubilee , lyrics like " God save the queen / She ain't no human being / And there 's no future / In England 's dreaming " ensured widespread outrage .
And McLaren 's stunts – such as sailing the band past the House of Parliament while performing their anarchist hits – ensured he was rarely out of the public eye .
On touring with the Sex Pistols , McLaren had said : " I had created a feeling that was both euphoric and hysterical .
On that tour bus , you could n't help but be aware of an enormous range of possibilities – that whatever was happening could n't be predicted , that it was a movement towards a place unknown .
We had the means now to start a revolution of everyday life . "
McLaren , who had the band sign their record contract outside Buckingham Palace , had " showmanship in his blood " , according to PR guru Mark Borkowski , who had worked with the impresario since the late 80s .
" It 's the end of an era , " he said last night .
" Malcolm was a fantastic raconteur , with a brilliant and agile creative mind .
He was the greatest part - publicist , part entertainer .
Without him this seismic shift in the music would never have happened . "
After the Sex Pistols split up , McLaren continued to put out unreleased material by the band .
After a battle over loyalties in 1986 , the band eventually received £ 1 m in an out - of - court settlement .
But people would remember his achievements not his public spats , said Borkowski .
" So much of what he did was groundbreaking in art , in fashion .
What people will remember is the last great revolutionary of our times . "
In later years , McLaren still could not resist stepping in and out of the public spotlight , threatening in 1999 to run for the London mayoralty on a policy platform that included selling alcohol in public libraries .
" My effect on London was to create the best and most profound statement of useful protest that has existed since the end of the last war , something that media labelled punk rock , " he said at the time .
McLaren 's spokesman , Les Molloy , said that artist 's family was " devastated " and " in shock " .
He said : " He had been doing very well , it 's a sad day .
I have spoken to his partner . "

LA JOLLA , Calif . 
A funny thing has been happening at Hyundai
The brand known for cheap cars has quietly inched up its sticker prices closer to those of competitors .
The cars are still cheaper , but not by as much — and the South Korean automaker is selling more vehicles than ever at those prices .
" The consumer perception is that Hyundai is a value play , but in reality , it 's really getting up to parity with Toyota and Honda , " said George Peterson of consultants AutoPacific .
The successful price - creep also is proof that more shoppers now put Hyundai on the same quality plane as its Japanese rivals .
" People are thinking about Hyundai in a different way , " says Hyundai Motor America CEO John Krafcik as he wheeled past ocean vistas near San Diego showing off the brand 's new flagship midsize sedan , the 2011 Sonata .
Over a 12 - year period Hyundia 's U.S. market share steadily crept up from 0.6 % to 3 % in 2008 .
The automaker 's share of sales took a great leap forward last year to 4.2 % , Autodata says .
That 's still about half the U.S. market share of Nissan , the smallest of the Big 6 sales heavyweights .
But it reflects double - digit sales growth last year , while the Big 6 — General Motors , Ford , Chrysler , Toyota , Honda and Nissan — all saw sales fall .
Hyundai 's gains have come through a powerful one - two punch of better , more stylish cars and smart marketing maneuvers .
The new Sonata is aimed at truly breaking through into the ranks of those big brands .
The sedan is bigger , gets better fuel economy and weighs less than its rivals , such as Honda Accord and Toyota Camry .
And it 's still priced less than the others , just not as much as in the past .
The 2011 Sonata , just in dealer showrooms now , has a new chrome grille and styling cues aimed at setting it apart from the more conservative Camry , Accord , Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Fusion .
The sedan is getting Hyundai 's biggest model launch yet , with $ 160 million being spent on ads , 25 % more than the launch of the previous - generation 2006 Sonata .
The effort was bolstered by two Super Bowl ads last month and will include commercials in Sunday 's Academy Awards show .
OSCAR AD FLAP : Hyundai replaces Jeff Bridges ' voiceover
The sixth - generation Sonata is an inch longer than the model it replaces , yet is 130 pounds lighter .
Because of engine technology advances , Hyundai offers it with a 198 - horsepower four - cylinder engine that gets 22 miles per gallon in the city , 35 mpg on the highway — and has dropped the V - 6 option .
A turbocharged version of the four and a hybrid are due later this year .
Sonata starts at $ 19,195 and comes in fully loaded at $ 27,395 — slightly below , but squarely in the neighborhood of , Camry and Accord .
Hyundai has n't completely shaken its discount image , says Alexander Edwards , president of consultant Strategic Vision , nor has it shaken buyer doubts about quality that it earned in years past .
Quality has much improved , including high marks for most of its models in the latest Consumer Reports magazine reliability survey .
But Edwards says buyers still depend on Hyundai 's 10 - year , 100,000 - mile warranty .
And Hyundai is n't without missteps .
Just last week , Hyundai stopped the sale of Sonata for a day and will recall the 1,300 or so already sold to fix a faulty front door latch .
While Toyota , with its quality reputation under attack , might seem vulnerable to inroads now , Ford Motor is making the biggest market - share gains , both Edwards and Peterson say .
Still , Hyundai executives are convinced they are scoring more sales with shoppers who compare their vehicles head - to - head against the competition .
Says Krafcik , who worked previously at both Toyota and Ford : " Many would have never chosen Hyundai .
Now , we 're winning the vast majority . "

In this week ’s issue of PARADE , Miley Cyrus talks to Kevin Sessums about saying farewell to her alter ego Hannah Montana and her new love Liam Hemsworth .
In the web exclusive below , the teen queen admits why she ’s steering clear of the country music scene , the real reason she quit Twitter and more .
Has her high energy ever been mistaken for ADD or ADHD ?
“ When I was in middle school I was told I might have one of those and if I were in high school now they would most likely tell me I do have one or both of those and put me on some sort of crazy medication . ”
Miley lets her hair down !
See exclusive photos from PARADE ’s glamorous Cyrus photo shoot
Moving beyond her high - energy reputation .
“ When I was eight years old , people were going , ‘ Oh , my God .
She ’s crazy !
What ’s she going to be like when she ’s 17 ? ’
Well I ’m 17 now and I ’m doing pretty well for whatever it is that I am . ”
Finding unbiased love with Liam Helmsworth .
“ [ Liam has ] become my best friend in the whole wide world .
I love him .
He really respects me for who I am because coming from Australia , he really did n’t know me as the celebrity I am here .
I got to tell him about myself on my own terms and my own way .
He had no preconceived notion of who I was supposed to be . ”

Tapping into her grandfather ’s political legacy .
“ My character ’s name [ in The Last Song ] is Ronnie and that is in memory of my grandfather , Ron Cyrus , who died a couple of years ago from lung cancer .
He was a politician in Kentucky and served in the state legislature for 21 years .
A Democrat .
I recently did a concert in Washington D.C. and I met all these people who knew my grandfather and told me what he had meant to them . ”
Did the Obama girls come to the concert ?
“ Yes .
The First Lady brought them .
I had met them before because I sang at the inauguration .
I think Michelle Obama is the most beautiful person to ever live in the White House .
When she came to my concert she was dressed so classy and yet funky .
I did n’t feel like I was talking to the First Lady .
I just felt like I was talking to a normal person .
I think that ’s what ’s so attractive about that whole family . ”
Having Dolly Parton as her godmother .
“ She is the nicest person in the world .
She ’s so easy to talk to .
She ’s awesome .
I love her .
She always tells me just to do what I love and if I ’m not having fun it ’s not working .
I do n’t know how old she is at this point but every time she is on the stage she is smiling from ear to ear . ”
What she thinks of music ’s latest sensation , Lady Gaga .
“ I love her .
She ’s really smart .
I caught her on Oprah and she was really chill .
I used to be like , yeah , I guess she ’s talented but how much is she really singing .
But I ’ve become a convert .
She has to be smart to come up with all her gags and the stuff she comes up with .
She gets it .
She knows exactly what she ’s doing .
It ’s like Dolly Parton .
Dolly plays up that I ’m - a - cute - dumb - blonde but , believe me , she ’s not dumb .
She ’s sitting on a ba-jillion dollars . ”
VIDEO : Get a behind - the - scenes look at Miley during her exclusive photo shoot .
What she ’s watching — and not watching — on TV .
“ I am screwed up in the mind a little bit because I ’m not like other 16 - or 17 - year - old girls .
I have no perspective of who exactly my fans are , to tell you the truth .
Teenage girls in general are hard for me .
I ’m not a girl ’s girl .
And I do n’t really watch television at all .
But there is one show I ’m addicted to : RuPaul ’s Drag Race .
I love me some RuPaul .
I love RuPaul ’s motto .
It goes something like , ‘ A real lady is never bitchy , a real lady is sassy . ’ ”
Why she ’s steering clear of the country scene .
“ It scares me , that ’s why .
It feels contrived on so many levels .
Unless you ’re wearing a cowboy hat and cowboy boots and singing and whining about your girlfriend or boyfriend leaving you it ’s not going to sell .
I think that ’s why my dad finally got out of it .
You have to wear those cowboy boots and be sweet as pie .
It makes me nervous , the politics of it all .
Her relationship with the ever - present paparazzi .
“ The other day I felt a little bit in danger for the first time because there were too many photographers following me in too many cars .
And I have to ask myself , ‘ Why would any other 50 - year - old man who was stalking a 17 - year - old girl go to jail , but not these guys ?
I ’m not as American as anyone else ? ’
I mean , they could n’t sit outside of a high school but they can sit outside my recording studio .
It ’s creepy . ”
Knowing her faith .
“ The one thing I ’m really strong about regarding my religious beliefs is that you should know a little bit about everything before you define your own beliefs .
I think all religions have a good practice in them .
Liam and I have been reading about Buddhism lately and it ’s all about hope and love .
To me , faith is about having a clean slate and a clean start . ”
Making mistakes and learning the power of forgiveness .
“ You do n’t have to say , ‘ Well , I ’m already a bad person so I might as well go ahead and do this other bad thing . ’
It ’s about knowing sometime that what you did was n’t always the best choice but you now have the chance to start over again .
That ’s the biggest thing to me about my faith : you do n’t have to live tallying up all the things you ’ve done wrong .
It ’s all about forgiveness .
If God who created the world can forgive you then you can forgive yourself . ”
Tweeting up controversy .
“ There has been so much controversy sometimes about what I ’ve said or done because I believe there are no mistakes because God is the only one who can judge us .
That ’s the reason I deleted my Twitter account because I said on there that I believed in gay marriage because everyone should have the right to love each other , and I got such hate mail about my being a bad person . ”
As Mrs. Sirleaf prepares to run for re-election next year , she is not free from controversy .
While the United Nations peacekeeping force in Liberia is winding down , she faces pressure from the nation ’s truth and reconciliation commission , which urged that she and dozens of others be banned for 30 years from holding public office for their roles in the war .
She has conceded that she gave $ 10,000 while abroad in the late 1980s to a rebel group led by Charles Taylor , then a warlord , but for humanitarian services .
In Liberia , she contends , men are more tempted by corruption .
“ In an African context , men have too much of an extended family .
They have too many obligations outside their families and homes , so the demands on them are harder and more intense . ”
At the outset of her election campaign in 2005 , Mrs. Sirleaf took on corruption as “ Public Enemy Number One . ”
She has since had to confront cold reality in a nation of 3.5 million people who struggle with an 85 percent unemployment rate , where 60 percent of the population is under 25 years old .
Mrs. Sirleaf , a Harvard - trained economist , established a structure for combating graft with an anti-corruption commission and a code of conduct for public servants .
The rules ended up snaring two government ministers , including her close relative , A.B. Johnson , who resigned last month as internal affairs minister in a scandal over spending of a community development fund .
She said she was personally betrayed by those former ministers but that Liberia was still overcoming the corruption of values through war and survival .
New research finds that an increase in brain magnesium improves learning and memory in young and old rats .
The study , published in the January 28th issue of the journal Neuron , suggests that increasing magnesium intake may be a valid strategy to enhance cognitive abilities and supports speculation that inadequate levels of magnesium impair cognitive function , leading to faster deterioration of memory in aging humans .
Diet can have a significant impact on cognitive capacity .
Identification of dietary factors which have a positive influence on synapses , the sites of communication between neurons , might help to enhance learning and memory and prevent their decline with age and disease .
Professor Guosong Liu , Director of the Center for Learning and Memory at Tsinghua University in Beijing , China , led a study examining whether increased levels of one such dietary supplement , magnesium , boosts brain power .
" Magnesium is essential for the proper functioning of many tissues in the body , including the brain and , in an earlier study , we demonstrated that magnesium promoted synaptic plasticity in cultured brain cells , " explains Dr. Liu .
" Therefore it was tempting to take our studies a step further and investigate whether an increase in brain magnesium levels enhanced cognitive function in animals . "
Because it is difficult to boost brain magnesium levels with traditional oral supplements , Dr. Liu and colleagues developed a new magnesium compound , magnesium - L- threonate ( MgT ) that could significantly increase magnesium in the brain via dietary supplementation .
They used MgT to increase magnesium in rats of different ages and then looked for behavioral and cellular changes associated with memory .
" We found that increased brain magnesium enhanced many different forms of learning and memory in both young and aged rats , " says Dr. Liu .
A close examination of cellular changes associated with memory revealed an increase in the number of functional synapses , activation of key signaling molecules and an enhancement of short - and long - term synaptic processes that are crucial for learning and memory .
The authors note that the control rats in this study had a normal diet which is widely accepted to contain a sufficient amount of magnesium , and that the observed effects were due to elevation of magnesium to levels higher than provided by a normal diet .
" Our findings suggest that elevating brain magnesium content via increasing magnesium intake might be a useful new strategy to enhance cognitive abilities , " explains Dr. Liu .
" Moreover , half the population of industrialized countries has a magnesium deficit , which increases with aging .
This may very well contribute to age - dependent memory decline ; increasing magnesium intake might prevent or reduce such decline . "
BERKELEY , CA ( KGO ) --
Two new graduates from UC Berkeley 's Business School are trying to turn coffee grounds into a high demand food for local consumers .
But the venture does n't stop there , it gives back to the community as well .
What do mushrooms and a pile of used coffee grounds have in commmon ? " Mushrooms biologically grow really well in hardwoods , and so , coffee acts like a hardwood biologically , and we can grow them pretty well in that , " said BTTR Ventures co-founder Nikhill Arora .
The mushrooms are n't caffeinated produce , they just absorb all the coffee grounds ' nutrients .
So , why in the world are two new graduates from UC Berkeley 's Business School , Nikhil Arora and Alejandro Velez , growing mushrooms for a living ?
" I was a business - political science student .
Alex was business - education .
So neither of us had any background in mycology , but I think we both have the passion to do something -- one , on our own , and two , that kind of looked out for the community and had a social conscious as well , " said Arora .
The pair was inspired after hearing a Cal guest lecturer talk about mushroom - growing as an innovative way to fight malnutrition .
"
We heard of a fact that a lot of women in urban areas in Colombia and East Africa were using the coffee pulp to grow gourmet mushrooms , " said Velez .
Seeded by a $ 5,000 social innovation grant from Cal , they researched and launched a for - profit social venture called BTTR Ventures ; BTTR stands for " Back To The Roots . "
The goal is to be a sustainable company focused on social responsibility .
They 're accomplishing this by diverting one of America 's largest waste streams out of Bay Area landfills .
"
We realized America is like absolutely addicted to coffee , " said Arora .
So it dawned on them they could help the environment , at least locally , by collecting a ton of coffee waste a week from local shops like Peets Coffee and Whole Foods ' Alegro Cafe .
And then at a local warehouse in Emeryville , a small crew of employees packs sterile bags full of grounds , growing hundreds of pounds of gourmet oyster mushrooms a week .
After harvesting , they 're sold at local farmers markets and grocery stores .
A Whole Foods store in Berkeley is one of seven in the Bay Area that buys the BTTR oyster mushrooms .
Now each store orders about 15 pounds per week and apparently they 've been pretty popular because the last delivery already sold out .
But this is about more than growing mushrooms -- the post - mushroom coffee grounds are then re-used as compost , which is sold to consumers , and some is also donated to local school gardens and non-profit urban farms .
In its first year , BTTR Ventures is already growing a profit and making a difference in the community .

At Amazon Reptile Center Inc. , owner Scott Solar is paying for the pink slips he issued .
After several years of growth , the company , which has two reptile pet stores in Montclair and Covina , Calif . , ran headfirst into the recession .
As employees left , they were n't replaced , but recently the company decided to let go of three workers .
In three years , the staff shrunk to five from 12 .
Now , like many owners , Mr. Solar will be paying a higher state unemployment insurance tax as a direct result of those layoffs .
State unemployment insurance taxes are paid throughout the year , as owners pay their other payroll taxes .
States typically have a base unemployment tax , which owners will pay according to the size of their payroll .
But as a company lays off employees , it develops a negative history or so - called " experience rating " that can boost that tax .
" We did n't know there were repercussions , but we had to do it , " says Mr. Solar of his thin staff .
" But now we 're going to be punished for keeping the business alive . "
Adding to the burden , a number of states are running out of funds to pay for their out - of - work populations .
With jobless claims swelling and coffers depleting , at least 35 states are hiking unemployment tax rates this year , according to a survey by the National Association of State Workforce Agencies conducted late last year .
As the year 2016 is coming to the end , it ’s time to calculate of what has happened in last 12 months .
Musically , it was a good year for Allex , who brought you numerous episodes of his Experiment podcast , released lots of new house tracks and also his record label Experiment Records launch in June was a massive landmark of his successful year .

Celebrating 50 years of pioneering research and sharing an inspiring vision for our future , world - renowned primatologist and conservationist Dr. Jane Goodall renews her faith in nature and humanity during the “ Gombe 50 ” anniversary .
2010 marks a monumental milestone for the Jane Goodall Institute ( JGI ) and its founder , Dr. Jane Goodall , DBE .
Fifty years ago , Goodall , who is today a world - renowned global conservation leader , first set foot on the shores of Lake Tanganyika , in what is now Tanzania ’s Gombe National Park .
The chimpanzee behavioral research she pioneered at Gombe has produced a wealth of scientific discovery , and her vision has expanded into a global mission ‘ to empower people to make a difference for all living things . ’
Time , however , has not stood still for Gombe .
The wild chimps of the area have suffered as the local human population has swelled .
Gombe National Park is now a forest fragment , a 35 - square - kilometer island of habitat isolated in a sea of subsistence farming .
Because the problems facing Gombe — unsustainable land practices , overpopulation , and a cycle of poverty — are typical of many other areas , lessons learned by Dr. Goodall and her team provide valuable insights for solutions at Gombe and beyond .
Mongabay first began a working dialogue with Dr. Goodall and the staff of the Jane Goodall Institute at the 2009 Wildlife Conservation Network Annual Expo in San Francisco .
Dr. Goodall was the keynote speaker at this event , which showcased conservationists and environmental projects across the globe .
While the primary intent of this article is to document and share a recent interview with Dr. Goodall , web links to many of the global conservation projects she supports are also included .

AN INTERVIEW WITH JANE GOODALL
Mongabay : Dr. Goodall , please tell our readers about ‘ Gombe 50 ’ and what it has been like to work in the fields of wildlife research and conservation for five decades .
Dr. Jane Goodall : First of all , I think it is utterly extraordinary that it ’s been half a century since I first stepped onto the shores of Gombe ; that is an awfully long time .
Having begun in 1960 , our ongoing research of the chimpanzee community at Gombe is one of the longest documented studies of a wild animal population on record .
We are still learning new things about the chimpanzees of Gombe today , as chimps can live for 50 to 60 years .
And there is still so much left to learn .
Mongabay : How has the field of environmentalism changed over the past 50 years ?

Dr. Goodall :
When I began in the early 1960s even the global scientific community was n’t talking about — or really concerned with — conservation and environmentalism .
Rainforests stretched across Africa and across the global equatorial belt but now these areas have become ever - decreasing fragments of forest .
In turn , wild animal populations have suffered .
Wild chimps , for example , numbered an estimated one to two million in 1900 and now there are fewer than 300,000 spread across 21 nations .
The numbers of wild elephants , tigers , gorillas , rhinos , etc. have all decreased by horrific percentages .
For me , the big change in regard to my take on conservation began in the late 1980s when I realized that the problems of deforestation had come right to the borders of Gombe .
I came to realize that all across Africa the chimpanzees and their forests were in real trouble .
The need to reverse this catastrophic trend is what caused me to make the hard decision to leave the life that I loved out in the forest , working with the chimps in the field of primate research .
Now I travel an average of 300 days a year with the mission to give people hope :
‘ We can pull through our shared environmental challenges if we work together . ’
The really good news is that over the past 50 years people have begun to see that the world is interconnected and that preserving the environment is a responsibility shared by all .
Mongabay : How do you feel about conservation in 2010 ?
What is your outlook for global biodiversity ?

Dr. Goodall :
While it varies from place to place , there is a greater awareness of conservation and more people understand that there is a need to preserve wild places and biodiversity .
But an awful lot of people across the globe cannot do much about it as they are trapped in a deep cycle of poverty .
We are really at a crossroads at this point in time , and the outlook for the future depends on how we in the developed world respond to global environmental challenges and how we reach out to poor communities and help them and ourselves develop and progress along sustainable lines .
Mongabay :
In your new book , Hope for Animals and Their World , you discuss multiple examples of species that have been saved ‘ at the 12th hour . ’
Are there species or areas that you feel are especially vulnerable , ones that may be ‘ falling through the cracks ? ’
Dr. Goodall : Well , the planet is facing what is being called the ‘ Sixth Great Extinction ’ ( comparable to mass extinction events like the disappearance of the dinosaurs ) .
In places like Africa , Madagascar and the Amazon , forests are disappearing at a shocking rate .
For example , by the late 1980s around Gombe , there were no trees , and the local population of chimpanzees had grown isolated .
The chimp communities north and south of the park used to spend a lot of time outside the park connecting with other forest territories and chimp groups , and now they ca n’t without the trees .
When chimps do venture outside the park , they come into contact with people , which has led to numerous problems .
We are now losing many of the amazing animal species that share our planet , and due to unsustainable economic practices , millions of people across the world are caught in a cycle of overpopulation , poverty and disease .
This trend is reversible .
Dedicated people across the globe have successfully stepped up to save wildlife and wild places against seemingly ‘ impossible odds . ’
It ’s why I wrote my book Hope for Animals and Their World to let people know that there is hope for the world ’s animals and there ’s hope for us as well .
These conservationists are my heroes .
Mongabay : Many ‘ hotspots ’ of global biodiversity are within the developing world .
What ’s the best way to help developing countries save their wild areas ( forests ) ?
Dr. Goodall : Developing countries need to adopt environmentally sustainable practices and there needs to be acceptance of these practices by local people at the local level .
I will tell you about the project we developed with the local communities around Gombe called TACARE ( Take Care ) .
In ‘ traditional ’ economic assistance programs , people are given cash subsidies , but there is little done to solve the roots of the problems .
I think the reason our reforestation and education programs have worked so well is that we do n’t follow this practice .
We ’ve invested money into projects only after sitting down with the local leaders and village elders .
Because the Tanzanian nationals who make up our team do the talking , it is understood that they represent local people not ‘ outsiders . ’
And the villagers embrace our projects because they choose the projects themselves .
We have placed a real emphasis on micro-credit lending ( loans of less than $ 200 ) to further the commitment of local people , and all of our projects are developed to be environmentally sustainable — that ’s key .
Working with the Local Community – TACARE .

Right now , across the globe , more people are living on the land than it can support .
At Gombe , TACARE works to improve the local peoples ’ lives by developing sustainable farming practices , educational scholarships , HIV - AIDS information , family planning , health care , and especially projects designed to help women and children — because all around the world as women ’s education improves , family size goes down .
Everyone ’s quality of life improves .
And we have engaged local youth in our global environmental and humanitarian youth program , Jane Goodall ’s Roots & Shoots , which is fostering a new spirit of environmentalism in the next generation .
As a result , the villagers around Gombe now have a much greater understanding of the local environment and their impact on it , and have lessened practices like clear cutting and other processes that harm the forests .
We ’ve already seen trees coming back around many of the villages surrounding Gombe and hopefully the chimps will no longer be trapped within the tiny park .
Mongabay :
What responsibilities do you feel developed countries and global corporations have in this process of helping the developing world ?
Dr. Goodall : People in ‘ developed ’ countries need to rethink the concept of development along an environmentally sustainable model .
We in the developed world have lived too long far beyond our environmental means .
We need to change and we need to work with the developing nations to implement globally sustainable practices .
A greatly outdated mode of thinking in the developed world is ‘ living large , ’ which often has to be supported through a global ‘ resource grab ’ on the part of the developed nations .
Big Business has too often come into conflict with conservation efforts , and in a reckless drive for profits , we all lose out .
With rapid economic development , and large populations of people in nations like China seeking ‘ their share ’ of the natural resources in the rest of the developing world — just as Europe had , just as America is doing — and with all the powerful nations wanting to exercise their right to their share of Africa ’s , Asia ’s , South America ’s resources , wild areas and forest face unparalleled threats , and the local people find themselves relegated to poverty as competition for global resources heats up to reckless levels .
Ultimately , there are no real winners in this competition , as we all lose out if unsustainable economic practices lead to global environmental chaos .
The hollow pursuit of materialism for its own sake is crushing to the human spirit .
What will future generations think of a people who had trouble thinking beyond the next shareholders meeting ?
There is an enormous need for a concerted effort between the conservation groups , industry , business , NGOs , philanthropic interests and governments to foster and develop sustainable practices .
There is room in this world for all of these groups , but we need to act together because , at this point in time , this is the only home that we ’ve got .

Mongabay : What advice would you offer aspiring conservationists in 2010 ?
Dr. Goodall : I would say ‘ not to give up and to get involved . ’
We need to step up to the challenge now .
A real focus of my life these past years has been the development of Jane Goodall ’s Roots & Shoots , the Institute ’s global environmental and humanitarian program for young people from preschool to college .
We now have Roots & Shoots groups in more than in 120 countries and nearly 150,000 members .
‘ Roots make a firm foundation ; shoots seem tiny but to reach to the sun can break through brick walls ( the problems we face ) . ’
Working with individual young people is the program ’s commitment to all of us being able to make a difference , and Roots & Shoots has been so successful because the young people involved choose the projects and work together to develop solutions .
They share problems , they share hopes , they share working through mistakes and together implement change .
And Roots & Shoots is being shared by a generation of young people across the planet .

And there are all kinds of wonderful conservation groups across the globe .
In your part of the world ( California ) there are groups like the Wildlife Conservation Network , and new projects like EcoReserve , which will allow a greater number of people to participate directly in global conservation through ‘ micro- conservation ’ projects .
There are so many opportunities for people to step up in a positive , lasting and meaningful way — to think globally and live locally .
Mongabay : Dr. Goodall , you have a famous quote : ‘ Every individual matters .
Every individual has a role to play .
Every individual makes a difference . ’
Please relate this line of thinking to ideas about how each of us can help preserve biodiversity through our actions .
Dr. Goodall : People feel that they are helpless to solve problems facing the global environment ; that the problems are too large to be dealt with on an individual basis .
But every single day we all make an impact on the world through the choices we make .
And we all have the responsibility to carefully consider our choices .

Are we living beyond our real needs , what is our individual carbon footprint , was there unnecessary waste or cruelty ( product testing with live animal subjects ) involved in the production of the goods that we buy ?
There is so much access to information these days ; we can all make educated choices .
And with the wonders of modern communication , the positive little changes that people make will multiply , first by hundreds , then by thousands , then millions ; by working together we can effect big global change !
We must take stock of and accountability for our actions , and we must be better global stewards than we have been for the sake of future generations .
And if people are still feeling helpless , I would ask that they have faith in the resilience of nature and the power and capacity of the human brain .
We have an amazing brain ; it ’s taken us to the moon , discovered the wonders of modern medicine and built a global information super highway .
We have the ‘ stuff , ’ the problem - solving skills , the communication abilities , and a drive to progress that will allow us to work through today ’s environmental challenges .
After 50 years , my job is now to give people hope .

The Asian Animal Crisis
( 03/18/2010 ) The United Nation declared 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity ( IYB ) .
One of the goals of the IYB is to celebrate the achievements of the Convention of Biological Diversity signed by 192 countries since 1992 .
But what have we accomplished since 1992 ?
Did we put an end to biodiversity loss ?
The truth is that there is not much to celebrate at all .
Asia is a perfect example where the animal crisis and the loss of biodiversity have worsened over decades .
The first question that should come to mind is : how many species have vanished in Asia because of human activities ?
Records of recently extinct species in Asia show 71 species that have disappeared in the wild .
Examples include the Yunnan lake newt ( Cynops wolterstorffi ) from China , the Bonin thrush ( Zoothera terrestris ) from Japan , or the redtailed black shark ( Epalzeorhynchos bicolor ) from Thailand .
Extinction outpaces evolution

Extinct animals are quickly forgotten : the baiji and shifting baselines
( 02/23/2010 )
In 2006 a survey in China to locate the endangered Yangtze River dolphin , known as the baiji , found no evidence of its survival .
Despondent , researchers declared that the baiji was likely extinct .
Four years later and the large charismatic marine mammal is not only ‘ likely extinct ’ , but in danger of being forgotten , according to a surprising new study ‘ Rapidly Shifting Baselines in Yangtze Fishing Communities and Local Memory of Extinct Species ’ in Conservation Biology .
Lead author of the study , Dr. Samuel Turvey , was a member of the original expedition in 2006 .
He returned to the Yangtze in 2008 to interview locals about their knowledge of the baiji and other vanishing megafauna in the river , including the Chinese paddlefish , one of the world ’s largest freshwater fish .
In these interviews Turvey and his team found clear evidence of ‘ shifting baselines ’ : where humans lose track of even large changes to their environment , such as the loss of a top predator like the baiji .

New report : world must change model of economic growth to avert environmental disaster
( 01/25/2010 )
For decades industrialized nations have measured their success by the size of their annual GDP ( Gross Domestic Product ) , i.e. economic growth .

This is what tropical ecologist Jaboury Ghazoul provided during a talk at the Association of Tropical Biology and Conservation ( ATBC ) meeting this summer in Marburg , Germany .
Throwing out a dazzling array of big ideas and even bigger questions — incorporating natural history , biodiversity , morality , philosophy , and art — the enthusiastic Ghazoul left his audience in a state of wonder .
Investing in conservation could save global economy trillions of dollars annually
( 09/03/2009 )
By investing billions in conserving natural areas now , governments could save trillions every year in ecosystem services , such as natural carbon sinks to fight climate change , according to a European report The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity ( TEEB ) .
Examining monkey tools : archaeology expands to include non-human primates
( 08/17/2009 ) Archaeology , the study of ancient cultures and their artifacts , has always been confined to the technology of humans and direct human ancestors .
However , a new study recently published in the journal Nature examines the benefits of expanding the field of archaeology to include non-human primates .
Chimpanzee population plummets 90 percent in supposedly strong region
( 05/06/2009 ) Chimp populations continue to decline in Africa .
A new survey of our closest relatives in the Cote D’Ivoire found that the population fell from an estimated 8,000 to 12,000 individuals to a paltry 800 to 1,200 , a decline that took place in less than twenty years .
Male chimps use meat to seduce
( 04/07/2009 )
Male chimpanzees who share meat with females over a long period of time have a better chance of mating , according to a new study published in PLoS ONE .
Studying chimps in Tai National Park , Côte d’Ivoire , researchers from the Mac Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology observed that female chimps have sex more frequently with males who have shared meat with them at least once as opposed to males who never share .
Dedicated rock - throwing chimp proves longterm planning
( 03/10/2009 ) Biologists have suspected for a long time that animals other than humans are capable of making plans for future events , but it has proven difficult to show conclusively .
However , a new study in Current Biology claims the first unambiguous evidence of an animal premeditating .
Mathias Osvath of Lund University in Sweden has spent a decade observing a male chimpanzee in a zoo collecting stones , making them into concrete discs , and then throwing them at zoo visitors .
Brenda :
Last couple of days have seen two singers die .
First Helen Reddy who was 78 and best known for singing and writing , " I Am Woman " back in the 70's .
Then Mac Davis a country singer and he was also in his 70s .
Brenda : Too early for Turkey Day THG .
Still got over a week to get there .
It 's still September .
THG :
Brenda :
Yes , indeed .
I shall have to do a bit of reading on the lady .
THG : RIP RBG
THG : I shall enjoy
Brenda : Pancakes niiiiice .
THG :
Brenda : Have a good Tuesday THG .
THG :
Brenda :
You make a good point THG .
THG : I 'm going forward believing he will Brenda .
I 'm basing that on my experience here .
It appears he gives a shit .
Brenda : So am I THG .
And I agree with Moose .
Warning would be good .
I had flashbacks to when the OB went down .
THG : I 'm amazed by Haken 's commitment to this site .
Thanks Haken
Moose : I do hope that if Haken does close down here that he ’ll give us some warning .
Brenda : I got a blank page , then another time " there has been an error . "
Then a " make sure you have typed in the address correctly . "
Brenda : Ditto on that thought Moose .
Moose :
Which apparently is n’t a problem here .
lol oops .
Moose : I was able to open the chat page , but could n’t post anything
Beijing Is Key to Creating More U.S. Jobs
China has apparently decided to let its currency start rising again .
There are two objectives .
Domestically , a stronger renminbi will help counter inflationary pressure and dampen the excessive growth that is fueling it .
Internationally , appreciation will start curbing China ’s huge current account surplus and thus counter the pressures that are building in the United States and elsewhere to retaliate against China ’s massive currency undervaluation by installing new barriers against its exports .
The overriding issue is whether China will move quickly enough and substantially enough to achieve these goals .
The renminbi is now undervalued by about 25 percent on a trade - weighted basis and by about 40 percent against the U.S. dollar .
Every day , China buys about $ 1 billion in the currency markets , holding down the price of the renminbi and thus maintaining China ’s artificially strong competitive position .
Several of China ’s neighbors — including Hong Kong , Malaysia , Singapore , and Taiwan — similarly intervene to remain competitive with China and thus substantially undervalue their currencies against the dollar and other currencies .
Such currency manipulation is a blatant form of protectionism .
It subsidizes all Chinese exports 25 to 40 percent .
It places the equivalent of a 25 to 40 percent tariff on all Chinese imports , sharply discouraging purchases from other countries .
It would thus be incorrect to characterize a policy response by the United States and other countries as " protectionist " — such actions should in fact be viewed as anti-protectionist .
Largely as a result of this competitive undervaluation , China ’s global current account surplus soared to almost $ 400 billion and exceeded 11 percent of its GDP in 2007 , an unprecedented imbalance for a major trading country .
This surplus declined sharply during the Great Recession as global demand weakened , but it remained above 5 percent of China ’s GDP even in 2009 .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) estimates that the surplus is rising again and will hit record levels and exceed the U.S. global deficit by 2014 .
In a world where subpar growth and high rates of joblessness are likely to remain for some time , China is exporting large doses of unemployment to the rest of the world — not just to the United States but also to Europe , Latin America , India , Mexico , and South Africa .
If China eliminated its currency misalignment and thus cut its global surplus to 3 to 4 percent of its GDP , that would reduce the U.S. global current account deficit $ 100 billion to $ 150 billion .
Every $ 1 billion of exports supports about 6,000 to 8,000 ( mainly high - paying manufacturing ) jobs in the United States .
Hence , such a trade correction would generate an additional 600,000 to 1.2 million jobs .
Correcting the Asian currency alignment is by far the most important component of U.S. President Barack Obama ’s new National Export Initiative .
Its budget cost is zero , which also makes it by far the most cost - effective possible step to reduce the unemployment rate and help speed economic recovery .
Such exchange - rate realignment is not without precedent .
In 2005 , Beijing announced a new " market - oriented " exchange - rate policy and let its currency appreciate 20 to 25 percent .
In mid-2008 , however , China repegged to the dollar , and the renminbi has ridden it down , taking back about half the previous rise .
China has doubled the scale of its currency intervention since 2005 , now spending $ 30 billion to $ 40 billion a month to prevent the renminbi from rising ; on this metric , its currency policy is about one - half as " market - oriented " as when it announced such a strategy five years ago .
This intervention violates all relevant international norms .
The IMF commits member countries , including China , to " avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other members . "
Moreover , the IMF ’s bylaws call for " discussion " with any countries that practice " protracted large - scale intervention in one direction in exchange markets " — a succinct description of China ’s currency policy over the past seven years .
Similarly , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , which is now an integral part of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , indicates that " contracting parties shall not , by exchange action , frustrate the intent of the provisions of this Agreement . "
Huge current account imbalances , including the U.S. deficit and the Chinese surplus , of course reflect a number of economic factors .
Successful international adjustment requires corrective action by the United States and other countries , as well as by China .
Effective adjustment policies must include much more than currency changes , notably including dramatic fiscal correction by the United States .
But it is impossible for deficit countries to reduce their imbalances unless surplus countries reduce theirs simultaneously , and the restoration of equilibrium exchange rates is an essential element of an effective global " rebalancing strategy " as sought by the G - 20 over the past year .
This is an excellent time for China to begin restoring an equilibrium exchange rate for the renminbi .
The Chinese economy is booming ( and China deserves great credit for leading the world recovery from the Great Recession ) .
But inflation is rising and new bubbles are threatening , and the Chinese authorities have started to take measures to avoid overheating , including by shaving the growth rate .
Currency appreciation would help by lowering the price of imports and dampening demand for exports .
This would also promote a major structural policy goal , helping to rebalance the country ’s economic growth away from exports and toward domestic demand .
The case for a substantial increase in the renminbi’s value is thus clear and overwhelming .
Furthermore , it now appears that China is preparing to renew its gradual ( 5 to 7 percent per year ) 2005 - 2008 appreciations and / or announce a modest one - shot revaluation , with or without subsequent gradual appreciation .
The most sensible approach for China would be an immediate rise of 8 to 10 percent with an indication that it would not move again until 2011 , which would deter the accelerated capital inflows that could result from the one - way bet of a renewed upward crawl and indeed probably trigger a reflow that would ease the conduct of monetary policy .
It is not yet clear , however , whether China will move with sufficient speed and in sufficient magnitudes , over a period of three or four years , to eliminate its undervaluation and resolve the underlying problem .
Hence the United States and other countries , while welcoming any meaningful new Chinese actions , must continue the " carrots and sticks " effort to both persuade China to revalue adequately and prepare retaliatory actions if it does not .
It is of course particularly important that any stepped - up initiatives toward China be multilateral .
The Chinese are much more likely to respond positively to a multilateral coalition than bilateral pressure from the United States , especially if that coalition includes a number of emerging market and developing economies whose causes the Chinese frequently claim to champion .
Much of the blame for the failure of U.S. policy in this area falls on Washington itself because it has been unwilling to face facts and label China a currency manipulator under the plain language of the Trade Act of 1988 .
This has substantially undermined U.S. credibility in seeking multilateral action against China in the IMF , the WTO , the G - 20 , or anywhere else .
If China continues to intervene heavily in the currency markets and manages the renewed rise in a very restrictive manner , say by less than 8 to 10 percent per year , a sensible and effective strategy must begin by reversing that feckless position with deeds rather than just words .
In that situation , the Obama administration could adopt a three - part strategy to promote faster and more substantial appreciation of the renminbi’s exchange rate .
First , the Treasury Department should brand China a " currency manipulator " in its next foreign exchange report to Congress — the report now delayed from April 15 , or in October of this year at the latest — and , as required by law , then enter into negotiations with China on the currency problem .
Second — with the support of Europe and as many emerging market and developing economies as possible — the United States should seek a decision by the IMF to launch a " special " or " ad hoc " consultation to pursue Chinese agreement to remedy the currency situation .
If such a consultation fails to produce results , the United States should ask the IMF Executive Board to publish a report criticizing China ’s exchange - rate policy .
Third , with a broad coalition , the United States should exercise its right to ask the WTO to constitute a dispute settlement panel to determine whether China has violated its obligations to that institution and to recommend remedial action .
The WTO under its rules would ask the IMF whether the renminbi was undervalued , another reason why it is essential to engage the IMF from the outset .
This three - pronged initiative would focus global attention on the continuing misalignment and China ’s unwillingness to initiate adequate corrective action .
The effort would have maximum impact if the United States undertook it with countries constituting a substantial share of the world economy , including emerging market and developing economies as well as the Europeans and other high - income countries .
Asian countries , such as Japan and India , will be skittish in confronting China in this way , but they are hit hard by the Chinese undervaluation and should be increasingly willing to join the coalition as its size grows .
The objective of the exercise is of course to persuade , or " name and shame , " China into corrective action .
Unfortunately , the IMF has no sanctions that it can use against recalcitrant countries .
Hence the WTO — which can implement sanctions — needs to be brought into the picture .
Unfortunately , there are technical and legal problems with the WTO rules too ( like the IMF rules ) , so they might also need to be amended for these purposes in the future .
The United States could of course intensify its initiative by also taking unilateral trade actions against China .
For example , the administration could decide that the renminbi ’s undervaluation constitutes an export subsidy that would be considered in decisions to apply countervailing duties against imports from China .
Congress could amend current laws to make clear that such a maneuver is legal .
In either case , China could appeal to the WTO , and the United States would have to defend its actions under the Subsidy Code .
But product - or sector - specific steps , such as last year ’s tire tariff , are undesirable because they distort and disguise the across - the - board nature of the Chinese currency misalignment .
China ’s competitive undervaluation represents a subsidy to all exports and a tariff on all imports — not just a few .
It requires a comprehensive response via the exchange rate itself .
A U.S. - led global effort offers the best chance to convince China to let its currency rise sufficiently and to help both itself and other countries achieve sustained economic recovery .

When you care enough to overthrow the very best : BYU group picks staggeringly anti-equality Card
by Jeremy Hooper
The BYU Management Society describes itself like so :
The BYU Management Society is a premier organization for business professionals to network , develop careers , serve communities , and support BYU and the Marriott School .
It is a unique , global organization committed to growing moral and ethical leadership throughout the world .
Members meet regularly to interact , attend seminars , and hold gala events such as charity golf tournaments and awards banquets .
Speakers provide exposure to current events and topics in business and the community .
BYU Management Society
Tomorrow night , that same society will honor a person who describes American freedom like so :
" If America becomes a place where our children are taken from us by law and forced to attend schools where they are taught that cohabitation is as good as marriage , that motherhood does n't require a husband or father , and that homosexuality is as valid a choice as heterosexuality for their future lives , then why in the world should married people continue to accept the authority of such a government ?
What these dictator - judges do not seem to understand is that their authority extends only as far as people choose to obey them .
How long before married people answer the dictators thus : Regardless of law , marriage has only one definition , and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy .
I will act to destroy that government and bring it down , so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage , and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn . "
- Writer Orson Scott Card [ Mormon Times , 7/24/08 ]
Yes , that 's right : Author , eye - opening anti-equality voice , and National Organization For Marriage board member Orson Scott Card will be receiving a " Distinguished Public Service Award " from the aforementioned LDS leadership society .
Because apparently leading citizens in an uprising against any government that accepts LGBT people as part of normalcy 's spectrum ( i.e. the peaceful kind of government we seek everyday ) is considered " moral and ethical " in certain circles ?
Wow , we really are seeking our moral answers from a different book !
Reasoned LDS digger Chino Blanco has much , much more on this :

Dear EarthTalk :
What is the potential for carbon “ nanotubes ” in battery technology ?
I heard them referred to as the biggest battery breakthrough to come along in years .
And what else can we expect to see in terms of new battery technology in coming years ?
— R. M. Koncan , via e-mail
The rechargeable lithium - ion batteries now so common in everything from iPods to hybrid cars can store twice the energy of similarly sized nickel - metal hydride batteries and up to six times as much as their lead - acid progenitors .
But these advances are only a small evolutionary step from the world ’s first battery designed by Alessandro Volta in 1800 using layers of metal and blotting paper soaked in salt water .
With battery technology advances long overdue , researchers are racing to develop more efficient ways to store power .
One hopeful option is in the use of carbon nanotubes , which can store much more electricity by weight than lithium - ion batteries while keeping their charge and remain durable for far longer .
But what are carbon nanotubes , and how can they be used to store energy ?
Technicians skilled in working with matter at the molecular ( nano ) level can arrange pure carbon molecules in cylindrical structures that are both strong and flexible .
They have significantly higher energy density and can store more electricity than any currently available technology .
These tubes , each only billionths of a meter wide , essentially become highly efficient , electrically conductive pipes for storing and providing power .
Electrical engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) have formed carbon molecules into tiny springs that store as much electricity as same sized lithium - ion batteries but can maintain a charge while dormant for years and work well in temperature extremes .
Stanford University researchers have created ink made from carbon nanotubes that can be drawn onto paper where it serves as a high - capacity rechargeable energy storage medium .
And University of Maryland scientists have created nanostructures able to store and transport power at 10 times the energy density of lithium - ion batteries .
Other technologies in development include batteries using zinc - air , lithium - air and other combinations of elements to provide longer run-times between recharges .
Others still are working on prototype nuclear batteries , the trick being to make them small enough to be practical , let alone safe .
Of course , the accelerating growth of nanotechnology itself , which has not yet been thoroughly tested to evaluate potential down sides , has some health advocates worried .
Animal studies have shown that some nanoparticles , if inhaled or ingested , can harm the lungs and also cross the blood - brain barrier , which protects the brain from toxins in the bloodstream .
And then there are fuel cells , created in 1839 but only recently commercialized .
Not batteries per se , fuel cells generate , store and dispense power by forcing a reaction between a fuel ( hydrogen from water , methanol ) and oxygen , creating usable non-polluting electricity .
One major hurdle for fuel cell makers is making them small enough to be able to work in laptops and other small personal electronics .

It appears to be , though the official data do not tell the whole story
The volcanic ash clouds creating havoc for the airlines in Europe are also creating unprecedented opportunities .
With air traffic interrupted , workers are patching runways and as one blogger proposed , general aviation pilots are making low passes at airports they rarely get to fly over .
I know , as yesterday I made a low pass of the Dublin International Airport in Ireland — and I was n’t the only one doing it !
closed to all IFR traffic , effectively banning all airline flights .
But VFR flights continued with no restrictions .
It ’s resulted in a few odd things , like the Citation I heard pass twice through Dublin ’s airspace .
The first time it was travelling from Spain to Scotland and the pilot had several exchanges with a Dublin controller about IFR flight being prohibited .
The pilot seemed a little confused about how to proceed .
Hours later , I heard the same jet flying back to Spain , explicitly saying that he was VFR .
Ireland is noted for precipitation throughout the year , but a series of high pressure areas have kept Dublin rain free for two weeks .
More typical conditions would quickly break up a volcanic ash cloud .
But the unusually clear and sunny weather has allowed the ash cloud to persist for six days .
On the radio yesterday , I heard a professor from Galway explain that , overnight , he ’d measured the ash cloud as low as 5,000 feet , much lower than the 20,000 feet it ’s typically hovered at .
Regardless , I have n’t seen any evidence of the cloud .
Haze limited visibility one day to about 6 or 7 miles , but that turned out to be the result of a forest fire .
I ’ve been in Ireland for a few days and have met several general aviation pilots .
One of them , William Flood , owns a beautiful Cessna 180 , N180WJ .
Yesterday William invited me along to do something he ’d never done before : make a low pass at Dublin International .
Trevor Kellett , an Irish dairy farmer and Ireland Aviation Authority flight examiner joined us for the flight .
Class C airspace extends as low as 3,000 feet in the vicinity of Dublin airport , so we approached the airport from the north at 2,500 feet .
We ’d previously filed a VFR flight plan and we were cleared direct to a waypoint northeast of the airport .
Weather was outstanding by Ireland standards .
The overcast layer was at least 5,000 feet , winds were light , and the temperature hovered around 10 °C ( 50 °F ) .
We were directed to fly a right base entry for runway 28 and advised not to go lower than 300 feet .
The controller , who sounded very relaxed , explained that he did n’t want us to go any lower so we would n’t “ scare the workers on the runway . ”
As we approached the runway , the controller called out traffic to us , a Cessna 150 which had also just made a low pass .
At the main terminal , we could see most of the gates were full and no airliners were moving anywhere at the airport .
A Fed -Ex plane and a number of green Aer Lingus planes were visible .
On the other side of the field , we spotted several Ryan Air jets with engines wrapped in clear plastic to protect them from any possible damage from falling ash .
At the departure end of the runway , workers were visible patching the runway .
After the low pass , we departed to the south and flew over downtown Dublin , something Trevor told me we ’d never be able to do on a normal day in Ireland .
Some commercial flights flew on Wednesday , but Ryan Air , which has its main hub at Dublin , wo n’t return to the skies until 5 AM Thursday and wo n’t fly from Ireland to the U.K. until 5 AM Friday .
What ’s been an inconvenience for airline passengers has been a bonanza for GA .
I think there are many of us still grinning today all over Ireland !
There 's a rumor going ' round that Liara T'soni , the blue - skinned biotic who was too busy to come along for the ride in Mass Effect 2 , will turn up in a future DLC release .
Liara was a big help in saving the galaxy in the first Mass Effect but when it came time to do it again in the sequel , she 'd already made plans .
In the years between the two games , she 'd become embroiled in some kind of intergalactic slap - fight with the Shadow Broker , the secretive - some might even say shadowy - buyer and seller of information .
Apparently , getting a little payback is more important than , you know , ensuring the continuation of life as we know it .
But according to Thepwnage.com , " no " actually just meant " not right now , " as evidence has been discovered that she may be joining the crew after all through the magic of DLC .
Audio files featuring Liara talking about the Shadow Broker have been found in the game , with interesting names like " liara_dlc_lead_in " and " liara_norm_intro , " with " norm " presumably referencing the Normandy .
And while it 's obviously just speculation at this point , the site also points out that similar audio files for Kasumi were found long before BioWare acknowledged her existence .
When contacted , EA said only that it does n't comment on " rumors or speculation . "
Fortunately , I do , so let 's get to it .
Liara 's history in the intervening years between Mass Effect 1 and 2 was apparently explored in the four - issue Mass Effect : Redemption comic series but remains a complete mystery to those of us who did n't bother reading it .
There 's obviously a lot of potential there for some very solid DLC ; on the other hand , having already established that the Shadow Broker is a character on par with the Illusive Man hiimself , the prospect of Liara replacing him in a two - hour DLC release seems a bit too breezy .
Is turning the near - mythical Shadow Broker into just another goon and then bumping him off in a glorified loyalty mission doing a disservice to the character and the game ?
Or are we so happy to have Liara back in the crew , and perhaps the sack , that we do n't care about such things ?
I was never much of a fan of the character , but if bringing another biotic aboard means I can finally blow Jack out an airlock , you can count me in .
The hidden audio files can be heard , spoilers and all - you 've been warned ! - on YouTube .
According to a new poll from CBS and the New York Times , 92 % of tea partiers are scared that America is moving towards socialism -- but in a strange twist , most of them seem to like it .
Despite the fear that socialism is coming to America , 62 % of tea party supporters also support Social Security and Medicare .
In fact , nearly half of them either benefit from Social Security or Medicare or have somebody in their immediate family who does .
And about one - third are directly beneficiaries at least one of the programs , compared to about one - fifth of the population at large .
Some other highlights from the poll ( NYT , CBS ) :
18 % of Americans say they are tea party supporters .
66 % of tea party supporters say they usually or always vote Republican .
( Just 5 % vote Democratic . )
73 % say they are conservative .
41 % believe Barack Obama was born in the United States .
While 65 % believe the Obama Administration treats blacks and whites equally , 56 % believe it favors poor people over the middle - class and rich .
89 % are white and 52 % believe too much attention is paid to the problems facing African - Americans .
59 % have a favorable view of Glenn Beck compared to 6 % who view him unfavorably .
( Among all Americans , the numbers are 18 % and 17 % . )
63 % say they get most of their political news from Fox News Channel .
66 % have a favorable view of Sarah Palin , compared to 12 % who view her unfavorably .
( Among all Americans , the numbers are 30 % and 45 % . )
24 % believe citizens can be justified in taking violent action against the government .
52 % believe the federal income taxes they pay are fair .
84 % of the tea partiers believe their views reflect those of most Americans , but only 25 % of all Americans agree ( remember : 18 % are tea partiers ) .

Supporters of the Oxford don who was sacked from her post as Royal Institution director will tomorrow try to dismiss its entire leadership
Several hundred of Britain 's most distinguished scientists will gather tomorrow in a modest , steeply banked lecture theatre in London 's Mayfair to determine the fate of the world 's oldest independent research body , the Royal Institution .
They will debate a motion – described as " unprecedented in legal history " – that would dismiss its current council and replace it with supporters of the institution 's former director , Lady Greenfield .
Susan Greenfield was sacked on 8 January following massive cost overruns incurred during a major refurbishment of the institution 's headquarters that she had instigated .
But now her supporters are mounting a dramatic bid that could lead to her reinstatement .
They say Greenfield is a victim of sexism and want to impose a completely new " transitional council " , made up of their own members , on the institution , which is based in Albemarle Street , Mayfair .
They claim the move would save the organisation – whose directors have included Michael Faraday and Humphry Davy – from ruin .
One supporter , Professor Lisa Jardine , of St Mary 's College , London , said Greenfield was likely to win " anything between £ 500,000 and £ 1 m " at an industrial tribunal because of her treatment .
" That would only exacerbate the institution 's financial crisis .
However , the present council has boxed itself in over this , " she added .
" They are funny boxed - in clique and we are trying to free the institution from their influence . "
However , opponents say the plan would sabotage efforts to refinance the debt - ridden institution .
" A move like that would see the closure of the institution within six months , " one member told the Observer .
" This is a fight for the life of the Royal Institution . "
Greenfield was appointed director in 1998 .
It was hoped that a charismatic , media - friendly new leader would sweep through the institution and introduce new ways to raise funds and popularise science in a body that was widely recognised as being badly out of date .
The appointment was controversial but necessary , said Jardine .
" You either love or hate Susan .
No one ever says ' she is quite nice ' .
However , she is a bloody distinguished neuroscientist . "
But Greenfield 's attempts to generate funds were unsuccessful and the institution was forced to sell its portfolio of properties in a bid to pay off debts incurred in refurbishing its building .
It is now £ 2.5 m in debt , with an annual operating loss of around £ 1.75 m .
" Only a major charity can save us , and so far we have n't found one who seems interested in our survival , " said one member .
Nor are its problems helped by the furore over tomorrow 's vote .
" Corporate organisations work on the principle that you have a rotation of members on its council or trustees , " said Frank James , professor of history at the institution .
" But this motion seeks to replace totally the existing council .
The idea is unprecedented in legal history . "
It is also a concept that alarms many scientists .
" If you replace the whole council , that will bring a great deal of instability , " said Dame Nancy Rothwell , the Manchester neuroscientist who presented the institution 's 1998 Christmas lectures .
" It would disrupt all the RI 's efforts to raise cash , which is why the staff have urged against the plan . "
Many , including Rothwell , warn that if tomorrow 's vote is in favour of the transitional council the Royal Institution would close within months .
The 211 - year - old organisation was set up primarily to promote scientific understanding among the public and for much of its history it succeeded spectacularly , with its lectures being regularly sold out in the 19th century , while in the 20th century its Christmas lectures , televised by the BBC , were watched by millions .
But science popularisation has become a highly sophisticated business .
Young scientists such as Brian Cox and TV series like The Wonders of the Solar System bring glittering scientific images into homes , while the Science Museum and the Wellcome Trust have proved adept at scientific showmanship , presenting complex issues – including shows on stem cell research , DNA databases and other subjects – in a highly accessible manner .
By comparison , the RI has lagged badly behind .
" Susan deserves great credit for all she did to pull the RI into the modern era , " said Oxford neuroscientist Professor Colin Blakemore .
" But it now needs someone else to find a niche for it this century . "
For her part , Greenfield insists she is a victim of sexual discrimination .
" I was unfairly dismissed , " she told the BBC on Friday .
" I am female , and it is my contention that a man would not have been treated in the same way . "
Greenfield has warned that she will take the matter to an employment tribunal at the same time as her supporters are plotting to replace the council .
It does not bode well for the future , said Blakemore .
" Whatever the merits of the various claims , this dispute and the attempt to install an inexperienced council and to reinstate Susan are only going to do further harm to the Royal Institution 's chances of survival . "
Finally , he called and we spent about an hour and a half on the phone .
There was very little small talk - no chit chat , jokes , or laughter ( sorry Don ) .
We got right down to business .
I took a lot of notes , and I will try to reproduce the conversation .
He encouraged me to report on what we talked about , and even offered to assist me in reproducing the details .
He told me some things in confidence , and I think I have my notes flagged in each case so I do n't reveal something he does n't want revealed .
I will attempt to report this as objectively as I can , and I will send him the link so he can let me know if I got any of the details wrong .
In my recent essay Vinod Khosla Debunked , I challenged Mr. Khosla to a written debate on his recent ethanol claims .
Mr. Khosla e-mailed me shortly after that essay appeared , and offered to discuss the matter by phone .
I wanted to first make sure he understood my objections , so we exchanged several e-mails in which I spelled them out .
At my disposal , I had his presentation Biofuels : Think Outside the Barrel ( 10 meg PPT warning ) , a marked up version of his paper Is Ethanol Controversial ? , and a list of talking points I had prepared so I would n't forget to cover any major areas .
Here are the talking points I had prepared beforehand .
These were merely to help my thought process as we talked , and I did n't necessarily cover them in this order .
1. Motivation ?
Is your top priority making money ?
Or helping society ?
2 . Energy balance for ethanol not better than gasoline
Think of energy consumed versus energy returned
versus energy returned Petroleum input is not consumed
Corn inputs are not counted
Comparing refinery efficiency versus an energy ratio 3 .
If the solution fails , what is the cost ?
The white paper asked , but never answered this question
Wasted time and resources - Peak Oil looms
Public loss of credibility
Public disillusionment with alternative fuels
Lost opportunity - public was not encouraged to conserve
Status quo 10 years from now 4 .
Cost of ethanol versus gasoline
If ethanol is cheaper , why has rack price been higher for 25 years ?
If ethanol is cheaper , margins are better , and so it should be able to grow quickly without legislation
Why do you accuse oil companies of gouging when ethanol has better margins ?
5 . Environmental issues with ethanol
Topsoil depletion ; ramping up corn ethanol encourages this
Aquifer depletion
Corn growing pushed to marginal lands
Herbicide and pesticide runoff ; ramping up ethanol will make this worse
How is this different than pollution caused by gasoline ?
6 . Over-promising technology
Nitrogen fixation - Holy Grail of crop science , but very complex problem
Cellulosic economics , yields , etc .
Ca n't bank on these breakthroughs ; but should fund research 7 .
Subsidies
If ethanol is so cheap to make , it does n't need subsidies
Many so - called oil subsidies do n't benefit the oil companies at all ; they benefit consumers 8 .
Food versus fuel
This is already driving up grain prices
Grain stocks being drawn down to record low levels
Exports will be reduced to produce ethanol 9 .
Potentially better solutions
Carbon tax
Solar
Wind
Biodiesel ( esp. algal )
Butanol
Biomass to electricity
Storage system technologies allowing renewable electricity
Electric cars ( Tesla Roadster as example of feasibility ? )
Electric rail ( Alan 's proposal )
General move to electric transportation
Emphasize TOD thread
I did n't expect to be able to go through the entire list , as that would have taken quite a while .
But surprisingly , I did get through most of the list .
I mentioned TOD several times , and I called his attention to the Vinod Khosla - Give Him Your Ideas thread .
I told him he would find a lot of ideas for addressing our energy problems , from people who have put a lot of thought into this very issue .
I told him some of the ideas were very good .
He said that he does not have a large staff , but he would look through the thread ( I also e-mailed him the link ) .
He said he is looking for ideas that are pragmatic .
The Conversation
Mr. Khosla dominated the early part of the conversation .
He approached it in the style of his presentations , in which he argues that this is the right path to take , and that it is feasible .
In the early part of the conversation , he said he does not favor biodiesel .
We did n't get into the reasons , but my guess is that he does n't think it is scalable , nor an ideal solution for the cars Americans are accustomed to driving ( this was a consistent theme ) .
We did n't discuss algal biodiesel , but from his tenor I believe he would have said it is worth funding , but still more of a research project compared to the current status of cellulosic ethanol .
The first thing I asked him was about his motivation : Money , helping society , or some combination ?
He said his primary motivation is to help society .
He said he is very concerned about Global Warming , and thinks our dependence on foreign oil is great cause for concern .
I told him that we are approaching this problem from different perspectives : I am approaching this from a Peak Oil perspective and that the clock is ticking .
I do n't believe we can afford to spend time and resources pursuing pie - in - the - sky solutions .
I said that I wanted to address some specific claims from his presentations .
I started off on the energy balance of ethanol versus gasoline .
We went back and forth on efficiency versus EROI , but he finally preempted my entire argument by saying he does n't even care if the EROI is less than 1 , because corn ethanol is merely priming the pump for cellulosic ethanol or butanol ( which he favors ) .
In fact , he acknowledged some of my arguments against corn ethanol , but said that corn ethanol is just a transitory solution .
I told him that I disagreed with this ; that corn ethanol would be around as long as the subsidies were there .
He went on to say that the ethanol plants he is building ( I did n't clarify whether these were Pacific Ethanol 's plants ) would be similar to the E3 Biofuels closed - loop system .
He said the capital costs are 2.5 times as high ( because I specifically asked about that ) but that the operating costs would be much lower .
I told him that I agreed that this should be the model for building grain ethanol plants , but that we would have to see some in operation before we know if they live up to the claims .
I challenged the claim he made that Brazil displaced 40 % of their petroleum with ethanol .
He said he got that number from another presentation , and would be glad to change it if I can show him the data .
He said he wants to be sure he has his facts correct .
( I will be sending him the raw numbers on Brazil 's energy supply ) .
I challenged him on the oil company bashing .
I said that I work for an oil company , yet I care a great deal about the environment and sustainability .
I said that when he bashes oil companies , he is bashing a lot of good people with the same broad brush .
He said " On this , we will have to disagree . "
He went on to defend the bashing by saying it was political .
He said he is trying to get the California Clean Alternative Energy Initiative passed , and Big Oil is spending a lot of money to fight him on it .
So , he is bashing them in order to get support .
Of course , I already knew all of this .
I can live with a bashing , as long as it is factual .
I told him that it is ludicrous to suggest that Big Oil is gouging when the profit margins on ethanol are even higher .
He again said that it was just politics .
I just do n't agree that stirring up hatred toward a particular group is acceptable politics .
I brought up the " food versus fuel " issue , and he said he rejects that argument .
He said that someone from Shell had come out and retracted an argument they made on this topic .
I had n't heard anything about this , and could n't comment .
But I did indicate that as we continue to ramp up corn ethanol , our corn exports will fall and people in 3rd world countries will go hungry .
I told him the stories are already appearing in the media .
He said that there is plenty of food in the world , and the problem is often ability to pay .
I did n't gain any ground at all in this argument .
He said that he has come out against the ethanol subsidies currently in place , and would like to see those subsidies shifted to biomass subsidies .
I told him that would be a tough political sell , and he agreed .
He said he has spoken out on the tariff that is slapped on Brazilian ethanol .
He thinks eliminating this tariff would lower ethanol prices in the U.S.
He also said that he has heard that Brazil is considering taking this issue to the WTO .
I spoke of my concern that he is over - promising on cellulosic ethanol .
I told him that my fear is that by making these rosy projections , the public will be lulled into complacency , and we do n't have time for that .
After all , they think we are going to transition right into cellulosic ethanol after hearing his projections .
I told him that I do n't believe his projections are realistic .
He countered that they are realistic , and that he has seen a lot of research behind the scenes that is not yet publicly available .
He said he has several cellulosic projects under way , and that he is in the business of making judgment calls .
He also said there are about 50 projects ( maybe it was proposals ? ) on cellulosic ethanol that are underway .
Several times he compared his investments in cellulosic ethanol to his early investments in the Internet or other technologies that paid off despite the scoffers .
One of his consistent themes was that the solution has to be practical , and it had to fit today 's engines or the auto makers would n't buy in .
I told him that I considered this a problem ; that the internal combustion engine was very inefficient .
He agreed , but said a transition to electric would take time .
He said it starts with hybrids , and then you improve the battery technology until the hybrid becomes more and more electric .
He said he is investing in battery technology , and thinks this area has even more potential than ethanol .
On this , I certainly agree .
Then we came to a matter of great disagreement .
He said he believes cellulosic ethanol can displace petroleum because petroleum is expensive .
But he did n't give renewable electricity much chance of displacing coal , because coal is too cheap .
He said that solar is 3 times the cost of coal - generated electricity , and that we have " an infinite supply of coal . "
He said he is more interested in a liquid fuel replacement for petroleum .
I , on the other hand , am more interested in moving our means of transport to renewable electric sources .
We discussed a carbon tax , and we were in agreement that this should be implemented .
However , he feels like it will never be politically palatable .
I just can't understand this , and told him so .
I think this could be sold to the public .
You explain the reason for the tax :
That it is designed to reduce demand and prepare us for a future of declining petroleum supplies .
You can avoid it being a regressive tax by lowering tax rates or increasing the deductions for low - income taxpayers .
There is a way to work this .
He replied that it would break down when everyone tried to get the best deal for their own constituents .
I just think this is too important an idea not to aggressively pursue it .
A carbon tax would begin paying immediate dividends .
I told him that we should have done this long ago , and we should have encouraged adoption of diesels like they did in Europe .
He replied " What we should have done , or should do , is less important than what we can do . "
Areas of Agreement and Disagreement
We agreed on the following issues :
Current energy policy needs a dramatic facelift
A carbon tax is a good idea
Brazil is much more efficient at making ethanol than the U.S. , and the ethanol tariffs should be lifted
Butanol may be a superior choice to ethanol
Grain ethanol subsidies should be eliminated
There is great potential in researching energy storage devices ( e.g. batteries )
We disagreed on the following issues :
The issues surrounding corn ethanol are n't significant since it will be a transitory solution
The solution must fit in today 's engines
Bashing oil companies is acceptable to achieve a political goal
Renewable electricity can't compete with coal
Cellulosic is scalable within the next 5 years
The consequences of failure to deliver can be very high
Food versus fuel will be a serious issue going forward
Conclusions
I already had a pretty good understanding of where he was coming from , but I have tried to accurately relay his position so that others may understand .
This is the least I owe him after he spent that much time talking with me .
However , we still have some fundamental areas of disagreement , and my impression is that he is concerned about Peak Oil , but not in the way I am concerned .
My worry is that over - promising on cellulosic ethanol will prevent us from getting very serious about taking the steps we need to take as a society toward powering down while we still have some choices .
I think we need to fund cellulosic ethanol , but until there are a few pilot plants operating , we just do n't know if it will be feasible on a commercial scale .
I did have difficulty convincing him that corn ethanol is a bad thing , because his position is that it is merely a jumping off point to something much bigger .
He said he would n't be investing in cellulosic if we were n't producing several billion gallons of corn ethanol .
He said that corn ethanol is " priming the pump " , and has shown the feasibility of ethanol as fuel in the U.S .
I obviously have not captured the entire conversation , so if you have specific questions about a particular topic I will answer them .
It was a worthwhile conversation from my point of view , because I think he understands that there are legitimate concerns from people other than special interests .
We agreed to keep in touch as developments unfold .
