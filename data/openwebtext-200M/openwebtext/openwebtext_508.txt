Iran has executed a journalist accused of involvement with a Sunni militant group blamed for a spate of attacks in the south - east , officials have said .
Judiciary spokesman Ali Reza Jamshidi said Yaqoub Mehrnehad and another man were hanged on Monday in Zahedan , the capital of Sistan - Baluchistan province .
Mr Mehrnehad was convicted in February of being a member of Jundallah and of " crimes against national security " .
He was arrested in Zahedan last year while reporting for a Tehran newspaper .
Reports say the journalist also ran a charity apparently focused on improving childhood education .
Sistan - Baluchistan province , which borders both Pakistan and Afghanistan , has long been affected by smuggling , drug trafficking , banditry and kidnapping .
Its population is mainly made - up of the Baluchi ethnic group who are Sunni Muslims .
Jundallah , also known as the Popular Resistance Movement of Iran , says it is fighting against the political and religious oppression of the country 's Sunni minority .
The government says it is a terrorist group .
In February 2007 , Iran hanged a suspected member of Jundallah who was convicted for killing 11 members of the Revolutionary Guards .

MOSAIC ( Ultimately published as FlashForward )
The very near future : Friday , April 17 , 2009 .
MARK DECTER , 47 , is an American physicist working at CERN ( Conseil européenne pour la recherche nucléaire ) , the European particle - physics center near Geneva .
CERN is supported by nineteen member countries , but certain nonmember countries  including the United States and Japan  have made major financial contributions to the Large Hadron Collider , scheduled to be completed early in the first decade of the twenty - first century .
Priced at two billion dollars , the LHC will be the most powerful particle accelerator ever built , capable of smashing protons together with a combined energy of fourteen trillion electron volts .
With the aid of the LHC , Mark Decter , his young research partner GEORGIOS ( " GEORGE " ) PAPADATOS , and their colleagues hope to detect the Higgs boson , the Holy Grail of particle physics .
The Higgs particle is predicted by the electroweak theory ; it 's an important intermediate step in the long sought - after grand unified - field theory that would demonstrate that the four apparently separate forces of nature ( gravitation , electromagnetism , and the strong and weak nuclear forces ) are really just different manifestations of a single force .
Under Mark and George 's supervision , a collision is prepared .
Protons will slam together with greater energy than ever before in the history of the planet .
They 're both excited and anxious : if things go as they predict , they may share a Nobel prize .
There 's a countdown until the collision , scheduled to begin precisely at 10:00 a.m. local time : Five .
Four .
Three .
Two .
One . Zero .
And then  Suddenly all of Mark Decter 's surroundings change .
He 's no longer at CERN ; he 's no longer even in Switzerland .
Instead , he's in a bedroom somewhere  New England , perhaps , judging by the view through the dormer window .
It 's autumn ( not the spring he'd been in a moment before ) ; the leaves have turned color .
And it 's daytime .
If it 's 10:00 a.m. in Geneva , it should be pitch black in the States  but everything is brightly lit .
Mark is in bed , naked .
He 's not alone , though : he 's with a woman .
And , suddenly , to his shock , he realizes it 's an old woman .
His mind recoils from what he thinks of as a hag , but he seems to have no control over his body .
He leans in to the withered woman and strokes her shriveled breast , but then he stops and rises from the bed , needing to visit the bathroom .
And as he makes his way there , he glimpses himself in the mirror above the bureau : the top of his head is bald , the fringe around his ears is gray , and his face is deeply lined .
It 's as if he 's aged twenty years and 
And then , suddenly , Mark Decter is back at CERN .
The particle - collision experiment is over .
Mark is disoriented and stunned  so much so that the disappointment of the experiment having failed to detect the Higgs boson does n't register at first .
What has happened ?
It 's only a matter of minutes before Mark determines that it was n't just he who had a displacement experience  almost everyone at CERN did .
Almost everyone , but not all .
Mark 's partner , George Papadatos , experienced nothing  not even passing time ; he simply blacked out .
It soon becomes apparent that the phenomenon is n't restricted to those at CERN .
Mark 's grad student , JACOB HOROWITZ , had a vision of himself in the future with an older version of CARLY SIMPKINS .
Carly is n't in Geneva ; rather , she works at TRIUMF , Canada 's national meson facility .
A phone call from Mark wakes Carly  it is , after all , only shortly after 2:00 a.m. in Vancouver .
At first , Carly claims that nothing unusual has happened .
But after a moment , she recalls an incredibly vivid dream of herself as an older woman in the company of someone she hardly knows  Jacob Horowitz .
Jacob and Carly have n't spoken to each other since their visions occurred .
Mark and George arrange for Jacob to be questioned by an expert witness - examiner from the Geneva police  and they arrange for Carly to be examined by a similar expert in Vancouver .
The two accounts  including sketches made by Jacob and Carly of the room they were in and transcripts of their conversations , match in almost every particular .
There 's little room for doubt : it was n't just a hallucination , but an actual shared experience .
Meanwhile , CNN is reporting that the phenomenon occurred worldwide .
Some people had visions that included specific time references  newspapers , calendars , watches , and so on .
All the dates match : it seems that for approximately five minutes , the consciousness of everyone on Earth jumped ahead twenty years , six months , five days , and nine hours , to 7:21 p.m. Geneva time ( 2:21 p.m. Eastern Time ) on Tuesday , October 22 , 2029 .
Since the experience began at the precise moment of the proton - proton collision at CERN , George and Mark assume their experiment was somehow responsible .
And that could mean that they are in deep trouble : news reports make it clear that the carnage has been incredible .
Since everyone in 2009 lost consciousness for five minutes , tens of thousands are dead : countless automobiles and airplanes have crashed , medical operations have failed , and so on .
It becomes clear that the world 's population now falls into three categories : about fifty percent had a concrete vision , indistinguishable from normal waking existence ; thirty percent had a vision either of complete sensory deprivation or with a dreamlike quality ; and twenty percent were like George Papadatos : they had no vision at all .
For them , the five minutes simply passed as a blackout .
Although interpretations vary , the most popular one is that those who had realistic visions will be awake at 2:21 p.m. Eastern time on October 22 , 2029 ; those who experienced darkness or dreams will be asleep then ; and those who experienced nothing at all  will be dead .
( The fact that those whose visions were of sleep are predominantly in the eastern hemisphere , where it will be night at that time , and those who had no visions at all were predominantly fifty years or older in 2009 , adds credence to this interpretation . )
But George Papadatos is only 29 ; in twenty years he should be just 49 .
He 's shocked at the idea that he might be dead at so young an age .
George 's shock grows even more profound when he receives a phone call from a woman he 's never met .
She 's called to recount what she experienced during her five minutes of dislocation .
Her future self was reading a newspaper  and the article she 'd started reading just as the displacement ended was about George 's murder .
It seems that one day before the period everyone else was having visions of , George Papadatos will be shot dead , by person or persons unknown .
Can a coherent picture of the future twenty years hence be assembled ?
Apparently yes : it 's a vast mosaic , with billions of pieces , illuminating the politics , culture , technology , and morality of the fascinatingly different world two decades further along .
All sorts of organizations and individuals race to collect and capitalize on people 's visions  but there 's no way for any one group to gather them all .
For the bulk of the novel , we follow the searchings by George Papadatos , who becomes obsessed with investigating his own murder before it actually happens .
Someone somewhere , after all , may have witnessed the event ; this is the frame that provides the springboard to the rest of the novel .
George uses a combination of newspaper and Internet ads and his own detective work to track down parties who might have leads  people from his own life , people mentioned in the newspaper article about his murder , and so on .
George 's investigations serve as our entrée to the visions and lives of many disparate people , from many walks of life , showing us the powerful range of human reactions to foreknowledge of one 's personal future .
The real meat of the book , only hinted at here , is the series of interconnected , intimate , personal stories about the lives of the people George investigates in his search for his own killer ; these stories only obliquely provide clues about the murder  their real narrative purpose is to illuminate the various impacts the visions have on different people .
Typical of the sort of dilemmas we 'll explore is Mark Decter 's own story .
He 's supposed to get married in a few weeks  but the woman he 's engaged to is n't the old woman he saw in his vision ; although age can change appearances , his fiancée , MICHIKO KOMURA , is Japanese ( indeed , she is one of the Japanese physicists working at CERN ) , and the woman in the vision was white .
Michiko had a vision , too .
Mark has to wrestle with the implications of this : the one thing that might have excused his being with another woman was that , tragically , Michiko had passed on in the intervening years .
But clearly she has not ; their marriage is doomed before it 's even begun .
Can he now go through with the wedding , knowing that long before death they will part ?
Other people George encounters will have equally compelling problems .
A man about to become a father for the first time will realize that two decades hence his son will hate him .
A woman who is sacrificing everything in hopes of becoming a famous actor will learn that her dream will not come true .
An engineering student will be stunned to discover that by 2029 he 's become the cordon bleu chef at a fancy restaurant .
The stories will illuminate the human condition without devolving into moralizing , or Twilight Zone / O .
Henry endings , and the ones we follow will interlock , forming their own mosaic .
George will eventually track down the police officer who discovers his body twenty years hence  but the future officer today is a boy just six years old  and he's been traumatized by the horrific vision of the bullet - riddled corpse .
Naturally , everyone wants to know if the visions are  to quote Scrooge  things that will be , or only things that might be .
Although Mark Decter can't explain why the dislocations occurred , he 's adamant that they represent an immutable future : Mark goes on CNN to explain to the world the work of Hermann Minkowski ( 1864-1909 ) , the German mathematician who originally put forth the idea of a space - time continuum , the framework upon which Einstein developed relativity .
Minkowski proposed  and all experimental results to date indicate that we live in  a " block universe . "
If we think of ourselves as existing in a two - dimensional universe , then the space - time continuum is a three - dimensional block or cube .
Seen from the side , each of us is represented by a track through that cube , beginning at the moment we 're born and ending at the moment we die .
Such a block universe can be thought of as a stack of individual frames of motion - picture film , and " now " is the particular frame currently collectively under consideration .
But the future and the past are already recorded on other frames , and are as real and immutable as the one we call " now . "
Indeed , the effect of the proton - proton collision was apparently to simply jump the collective " now " temporarily ahead twenty years , resulting in the visions .
For most of humanity , this is n't what they want to hear ( although it does allow Mark to divorce himself from blame for the carnage that occurred during the experiment at CERN  those deaths were inevitable in the Minkowski worldview ) .
For few people does the actuality of their future live up to their dreams .
Many  including , of course , George Papadatos , who wishes to prevent his own murder  refuse to accept Mark 's view , and are actively searching for ways to prove that the future portrayed in the visions is false or changeable .
Indeed , Mark 's fiance , Michiko , is enamored with the ideas of physicist Frank J. Tipler [ a real person ] .
Tipler contends that near the omega point  the very end of the universe  the artificial intelligences that succeed us will have not only the power and resources , but also the desire , to recreate every possible permutation of human DNA and every possible permutation of human memories  in effect resurrecting from the dead all possible versions of all possible people .
The visions , just possibly , are n't from twenty years hence , but from twenty billion years hence , and they 're not of the one fixed future , but rather of an arbitrarily selected possible future .
Besides wanting to change the future , most people also want to know more about it .
After a debate at the United Nations , it 's decided to attempt to reproduce the phenomenon by having Mark Decter and George Papadatos re-run their experiment at CERN .
Everyone worldwide is warned not to be involved in any dangerous activity  driving , landing a plane , performing or undergoing surgery , at 10:00 p.m. Geneva time .
( The time is offset twelve hours from the last attempt so that those who experienced visions simply of being asleep will perhaps have a chance at substantive visions this time out  although , of course , there 's no guarantee that the start time of the proton - proton collision is in any way related to the apparent time in the visions . )
The attempt to reproduce the vision experience fails , but , to Mark and George 's delight , the Higgs boson is detected this time .
It 's soon determined that it was n't just the original collision at CERN that caused the visions , but rather that the cause was the collision in conjunction with an influx of radiation from the sun , related to the current sunspot maximum ( sunspots wax and wane over an eleven - year cycle ) .
The radiation from the sun arrived without warning and at the speed of light ( meaning no advance indication of a future burst is possible ) , and it takes days to set up the collider  so it seems that there 's no way to reproduce the visions .
Our character - driven stories take a new twist when Mark is proven wrong  the future is not carved in stone .
Michiko proves that a discontinuity in reality has occurred : for five minutes , every human being on planet Earth was experiencing the future , not the present .
During those five minutes , no one at all was actually observing what was going on in 2009 .
But quantum mechanics demands observers : it is the act of observation that causes wave fronts , representing all the possibilities that might be , to collapse into one concrete reality .
The initial experiment with the Large Hadron Collider should have produced the Higgs boson both times , not just the second time  and the fact that it did n't simply underscores that no observers were available during the first attempt , preventing the wave fronts from collapsing .
This discontinuity has broken humanity free of the restricting block universe .
People will be able to use the insights they gained about what might happen to better their lives .
Michiko and Mark marry in a ceremony in Switzerland ; they 're going to face the future , whatever it might bring , together , with their eyes wide open . . .
In an epilogue , twenty years later  in 2029  we learn the ironic resolution of George Papadatos 's story : he was killed by PAUL HABIB , one of the people he'd interviewed while researching his own murder .
Habib had n't known
George at all in 2009 , but George had tracked him down and induced him to reveal his vision  a vision that was meaningless to Habib at the time he shared it , but as the day it portrayed draws closer , Habib realizes that anyone knowing its contents could ruin him .
In a looping effect , underscoring that humanity has indeed broken free of the block universe with its linear life paths , we see that if George had n't investigated his own murder , he never would have been killed . . .

As the AVG LinkScanner continues to spew fake traffic across the internet , web masters say they 've uncovered a reliable means of filtering these rogue hits from their log files .
Bundled with AVG 's newest anti-virus engine , AVG 8 , and used by roughly 20 million people worldwide , LinkScanner checks search engine results for malware before you on click them .
If you type a keyword into Google , for instance , it automatically visits each address that appears on Google 's results page .
This has caused an enormous spike in traffic on sites across the web , including The Register , and many webmasters may not realize where these hits are coming from .
Hoping to fool malware writers , LinkScanner mimics real live human clicks .
At least in part .
When scanning pages , LinkScanner employs the IP addresses of those 20 million people who use the product , and as of last week , it sends the same user agent as Microsoft 's IE6 browser .
But there is a way of eliminating this fake traffic from log files - without clipping the real thing .
Two separate webmasters have learned - through two different avenues - that an AVG request leaves out at least one HTTP header : the " Accept - Encoding " header , which defines what sort of compression a browser can handle .
Filtering or redirecting traffic according to this header ( and the IE6 user agent ) should do the trick - though AVG did not respond when asked for confirmation .
AVG has said " There are still ways for concerned web masters to filter LinkScanner requests out of their statistics . "
But it has n't given specifics - at least publicly .
And any fix may be temporary .
Part of the problem is that AVG wo n't put its cards on the table .
But the company may worry that divulging too much information would feed the black hats .
If a web master can identify AVG scans , so can a malware writer .
But more on that later .
Meanwhile , web masters continue to complain that LinkScanner forces them to pay for extra bandwidth .
But AVG has promised a fix for this problem as well . ®
Bootnote
Many Reg readers have asked why LinkScanner does n't scans links after you click on them .
But it does .
It scans both before and after .
AVG chief of research Roger Thompson argues that this two - layer approach guards against so - called zero - day exploits .
If a site is infected with one piece of malware , there 's a good chance it 's infected with a second , he says , and if you prevent users from even clicking on a site , you protect them from exploits you see as well as those you do n't .
Update
To avoid confusion , we 've updated this story to point out that webmasters are filtering traffic by identifying both the missing HTTP header and the IE6 agent .
It should also be noted that LinkScanner seems to be using two other user agents .
But these are far less prevalent .
At the moment , these are the three user agents the product seems to employ :
Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 6.0 ; Windows NT 5.1 ; SV1 ) User - Agent : Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 6.0 ; Windows NT 5.1 ; SV1 ) User - Agent : Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 6.0 ; Windows NT 5.1;1813 )
The first is the IE6 agent .

The industry must move to regulate the “ dark side ” of the internet according to a committee of MPs .
In its report Harmful Content On The Internet And In Video games , the Culture , Media and Sport Committee ( CMSC ) warned of the effects that violent images found on the internet .
In particular it singled out YouTube for criticism .
It said both adults and children were at risk from harmful content ; particularly those specific problems such as eating disorders or who are depressed .
It was concerned by what it saw as “ shocking ” delays ” in taking down images of child abuse .
“ We are concerned that user - generated video content on sites such as YouTube does not carry any age classification , nor is there a watershed before which it cannot be shown , ” it said in the report .
The Committee has called for a 9 pm watershed with postings containing sex , bad language or violence to be blocked before this time .
It also wants the introduction of a ‘ one - click ’ facility that will let people report clips and websites containing images of abuse directly to the police .
It wants to see an industry body set up to police social networking websites and adjudicate on complaints .
However it short of calling for this to be a statutory body , arguing that its effectiveness would be limited as so many sites are based overseas .
It said leaving it to individual companies to introduce their own measures to protect users had resulted in an “ unsatisfactory piecemeal approach which lacks consistency and transparency ” .
However Google , which owns YouTube said : “ We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users .
“ Given the volume of content uploaded on our site , we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly . ”
Andy Burnham , the Culture Secretary and the Internet Service Providers Association ( ISPA ) welcomed the report .
“ We need urgently to find a consensus about the standards of the future , standards to help navigate this vast and rapidly evolving world if we are to protect young people , ” said Mr Burnham .
ISPA , secretary - general Nicholas Lansman , said : “ The internet industry , with ISPA at the forefront , has an excellent record of self - regulation and I look forward to working with industry , Government and end users to address the challenges identified in this report . ”

Matt sez , " One of my favorite writers , Caitlin R. Kiernan , was the subject of verbal abuse , profanity and homophobic remarks from some sort of security guard when she and her companion went to visit H.P. Lovecraft 's grave .
The guard attempted to make them delete all of the photographs they had taken , despite the absence of any policy forbidding it .
Are cameras like catnip for abusive , power - mad rent - a - cops now ? "
Basic story : Caitlin and her friend have been visiting the grave for a decade or so , paying respects quietly , as do many people .
It 's one of the most photographed stones in the world .
The graveyard 's policies , listed on its website , do not prohibit photos .
The security was incredibly abusive and jerky .
Just another skirmish in the war against photography , as the brave security guards of the world prevent the theft of photons from our poor , helpless inanimate objects .
As Spooky was getting into the car , I finally looked him in the eye and said the only thing I said during the entire encounter ( which elapsed over the space of maybe three or four minutes , start to finish , at the most ) .
I pointed a finger at the man and , very quietly , I said , " You will be reported . "
He screamed , " You do that , you piece of shit ! . "
This is the only time I got a clear look at the man .
He was white , late middle - aged , seemed to have about three - days worth of beard ( salt and pepper ) , and spoke with a heavy regional accent ( do n't ask which one ) .
I am fairly certain that he had been drinking , and he may have been intoxicated .
He certainly acted like a belligerent drunkard .
" … stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery … "
( Thanks , Matt ! )

Nogovitsyn : Mercenaries working for Georgians may disguise themselves as Russians
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Monday , August 18 , 2008
Deputy Chief of the Russian General Staff Anatoly Nogovitsyn warns that Georgia may be planning to commit false flag terror attacks by using mercenaries dressed in Russian uniforms , as Russia moved to guard sensitive infrastructure against terrorist attacks .
In a news briefing on Monday , he said : “ I can not rule out that they might use mercenaries with Slavic appearance for a provocation , clad in the uniform of Russian servicemen , in order to commit subversive acts both on Ossetian and Russian territory . ”
In response to the threat , Russia has stationed troops around the Inguri Hydroelectric Plant , viewed as a potential target .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Nogovitsyn ’s warning that Georgia may resort to subversion in order to enhance its well - groomed image of being the victim of a war that it started with the horrific bombardment of civilian targets in South Ossetia on August 8th , arrives amidst more examples of pro-Georgian western media bias .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Following in the footsteps of the BBC , Rupert Murdoch ’s Sky News used footage of the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali in ruins after the Georgian assault and claimed it was the Georgian town of Gori after it was attacked by the Russians .
In reality , 70 % of Tskhinvali was destroyed , whereas Gori suffered relatively little damage according to a United Nations aid convoy .
“ Russia ’s TV channel Zvezda , which has five camera crews working in Tskhinvali , aired the same footage two days before , on Monday , ” reports Pravda .
“ Sky News showed its report with no sound , whereas the people showed in the Russian report could be heard speaking Russian and Ossetian languages .
The crying people shown in the report were heard cursing Georgian President Saakashvili for destructions and manslaughter . ”
After the controversy came to light yesterday , the Sky News clip was quickly pulled from You Tube .
In addition , CNN last week showed Georgian forces attacking Russian civilians in Tskhinvali , the provincial capital of South Ossetia , but then claimed it showed Russians attacking Georgians in the Georgian town of Gori .
A 12 - year - old American girl who was caught up in the brutal assault by Georgia on South Ossetia attempted to tell the truth about who the real aggressors were during a live Fox News interview , but she was quickly silenced by the host .
Western media coverage of the conflict has reflected a virulently pro-Georgia bias since the very start , once again proving that the press is not independent , but simply a mouthpiece for the same Anglo - American power structure for whom Georgia is merely another client state .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Following is a selection of the top 10 moments from the Beijing Olympics :
Slideshow ( 16 images )
1 ) Usain Bolt breaks the 100 meters world record .
Bolt already owned the record and in front of a packed Bird ’s Nest stadium he ran 9.69 seconds .
He thumped his chest in triumph over the last few meters before his ‘ marksman ’ celebration which became one of the lasting images of the Games .
2 ) Michael Phelps roars in triumph and relief after American team mate Jason Lezak overtook France ’s Alain Bernard on the final leg of the 4x100 freestyle relay to keep alive Phelps ’s dream of beating Mark Spitz ’s record from 1972 of seven golds in a Games - a dream he was to realize .
3 ) Liu Xiang dejectedly walks away from the track as he realizes he has to withdraw from the defense of his 110 meters hurdles title because of a leg injury .
Liu was the most popular sportsman in China and his grimacing departure clouded the Games for millions of home fans .
4 ) Russia ’s Yelena Isinbayeva turns the Bird ’s Nest into her private theatre with a gold medal and world record - breaking pole vault performance that captivated the 91,000 crowd .
After she spent most of the competition lying under a towel , she broke her own world mark with a leap of 5.05 meters .
5 ) The Opening Ceremony .
It emerged that some of the performance seen on television had been enhanced by computers , a child singer was replaced by a supposedly prettier face to mime to her voice and representatives of China ’s ethnic minorities were no such thing .
But it was a jaw - dropping beginning to the Games , culminating in former gymnast Li Ning being swung up the roof of the stadium and ‘ running ’ around the top level before lighting the cauldron .
6 ) German weightlifter Matthias Steiner kisses a picture of his late wife Susann on the gold medal podium , choking back tears over the promise he made to her that he would keep their Olympic dream .
The super - heavyweight made the pledge to Susann at her bedside in hospital as she lay dying after a car crash in 2007 .
7 ) American Matt Emmons blows a 3.3 - point lead on the very last shot of a 120 - shot competition to throw away the gold medal in the “ marathon ” event of shooting .
Four years ago in Athens he had fired at the wrong target and squandered a 3 - point lead .
8 ) Usain Bolt breaks Michael Johnson ’s 200 meters record .
Charging towards the finish line , Bolt has his eye on the clock all the way and once again celebrates his triumph in style -- this time , after he completed his run .
9 ) Rohullah Nikpai wins Afghanistan ’s first Olympic medal with a bronze in the men ’s 58 - kg taekwondo .
Proof that no matter how tough the conditions you have to train in , Olympic success is achievable if you have the talent .
10 ) Estonian Gerd Kanter celebrates his discus gold medal by sprinting down the 100 meter track at the Bird ’s Nest and mimicking Bolt ’s marksman routine .
High school jinks in a week when fun was put back into track and field .

Madhavi Bhasin writes :
On July 7th the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki in an Address before the Arab Ambassadors stated that his Government was looking at the necessity of terminating foreign presence on Iraqi land and restoring full sovereignty .
The U.S. public diplomacy machinery began operating in full swing after the statement was released and has emerged with a self justifying explanation : the remarks of the Iraqi Prime Minister are reflective of the confidence in the stability and democratic progress of Iraq facilitated through the efforts of the Coalition Forces .
The venue and timing of the comments are being considered crucial .
The regional concerns over Iraq ’s stability were expected to be put at rest , while convincing the local population of the independence of the Iraqi regime ahead of elections in autumn .
The more serious considerations behind the demand to begun negotiations for a withdrawal strategy and date have evaded popular attention .
In September 2007 , 17 Iraqis died as a result of unjustified and unprovoked shooting at the Nisour Square .
Personnel of Blackwater Worldwide , a private agency contracted by the U.S. to operate in Iraq , were involved in the shooting .
A week later the Iraqi Government revoked the license of Blackwater to operate in the country .
In the last week of September , Blackwater received a contract worth up to $ 92 million from the U.S. State Department .
In April 2008 the assignment to provide personal protection for diplomats in Iraq by Blackwater has been renewed for the third year .
The FBI is still investigating the killings at Nisour Square ; more than 30 witnesses have been questioned and three Iraqis have testified before the Federal Grand Jury in May 2008 .
Neither the lives of the ordinary Iraqis nor the decisions of the Iraqi Government were taken into consideration while renewing the contracts for Blackwater .
“ This is bad news , ” Sami al - Askari , advisory to Prime Minister Maliki said , “ I personally am not happy with this , especially because they have committed acts of aggression , killed Iraqis , and this has not been resolved yet positively for families of victims . ”
The neglect of such crucial Iraqi concerns by the U.S. has in fact prompted the demand for withdrawing foreign troops from Iraqi soil .
The Nisour Square killing is not an isolated incident .
In February 2007 a Blackwater sniper shot three Iraqi guards , without provocation , ironically from the terrace of the Iraqi Justice Ministry .
In October 2007 a Blackwater personnel was so heavily drunk that he killed the bodyguard of the Iraqi Vice - President .
In the same month an Iraqi civilian was shot for simply driving too close to the State Department convoy .
The Iraqi Government has come to realize that the U.S. is attempting to run the Iraqi state through private contractors who cannot be held accountable for their misdeeds .
The Report from the American Congressional Research Service in July 2007 clearly indicated that the Iraqi government has no authority over private security firms contracted by the U.S. Government .
A shocking incident in the Green Zone in 2006 has demonstrated that the Blackwater personnel have gained greater impunity than the regular U.S. armed forces .
A SUV driven by Blackwater operatives had crashed into a U.S. Army Humvee .
The Blackwater guards disarmed the army soldiers and forced them to lie on the ground at gunpoint until the vehicle was recovered .
Erik Prince , the founder of Blackwater has been a major financial supporter of the Republican Party .
Hence Republican Presidential candidate John McCain is an obvious supporter of Blackwater .
Even Democratic Presidential candidate Barak Obama has refused to rule out the deployment of private security companies in Iraq .
Prime Minister Maliki has realized that the continued U.S. occupation of Iraq is a lucrative business venture for the American private firms like the Blackwater Worldwide .
Echoing the popular sentiment the Iraqi Foreign Minister stated that there will not be ‘ another colonization of Iraq . ’
This is precisely the reason that Iraq has demanded more time for discussions on the Status of Forces Agreement with the U.S .
The mission statement of Blackwater Worldwide reads : “ Blackwater efficiently and effectively integrates a wide range of resources and core competencies to provide unique and timely solutions that exceed our customers stated needs and expectations ” .
The poorly equipped yet struggling indigenous Iraqi forces might be no match for the Blackwater , but it will surely be a national armed force serving and remaing accountable to the Iraqi people .
The demand of Prime Minister Maliki is less reflective of his confidence in the stability of Iraq and more a sign of the growing apprehensions over the privatization of the Iraqi reconstruction efforts .

Repeated handwashing is a common symptom of OCD Scientists say they have pinpointed differences in the way the brains of people with obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) work .
OCD provokes recurrent irrational thoughts such as fears about contamination or accidents , and compulsion to follow fixed rituals .
Scans revealed less activity in a particular region of the brains of both OCD patients and their close relatives .
The Cambridge University study appears in the journal Science .
The researchers said the discovery could potentially improve diagnosis of the condition .
Impaired function in brain areas controlling flexible behaviour probably predisposes people to developing the compulsive rigid symptoms that are characteristic of OCD
Dr Samuel Chamberlain
Cambridge University
It is estimated that between 2 % and 3 % of the population will suffer some kind of OCD at some point in their lives .
Although it tends to run in families , which suggest that genes may be involved , so far they have not been found , and at present diagnosis is based on an interview with a psychiatrist .
The Cambridge researchers used a type of scan called fMRI , which can display brain activity in real time , and the different parts of the brain in which it happens .
Volunteers , including some diagnosed with OCD , their immediate relatives , and some with no family history of the illness , were scanned .
To try to provoke an " OCD " response , they were asked to choose between pictures on two screens side by side , one of which had been randomly selected as the " target " .
The pictures would alternate between left and right , and the volunteer was given occasional feedback as to whether the right target was being chosen .
The test was designed to stimulate " behavioural flexibility " , one of the known problems in people with OCD .
In volunteers without OCD , or a family history of the condition , the test caused activity in a part of the brain called the orbitofrontal cortex .
However , in both the people with diagnosed OCD , and their relatives , the amount of activity was much lower .
Structural differences
While other studies have shown differences in the brain structure of people with OCD compared to people without the condition , this is thought to be the first time that differences in how they actually work have been recorded .
Dr Samuel Chamberlain , who led the study , said : " Impaired function in brain areas controlling flexible behaviour probably predisposes people to developing the compulsive rigid symptoms that are characteristic of OCD .
" This study shows that these brain changes run in families , and represent a candidate vulnerability factor . "
He said that current method of diagnosing the condition could be supplemented by the scan .
Dr Rob Willson , a psychologist specialising in OCD , said that he was excited by the potential of fMRI , even though its cost made it impractical for diagnosing cases .
He said : " What it could do is help test the effectiveness of interventions for OCD , and the more we learn about which parts of the brain are being activated , the more chance we have of understanding the condition better . "

What are these ?
Update : I 've switched which jQuery autocomplete plugin I use for this , see my newer blog entry .
The other day , I made a whole switch from Prototype & Scriptaculous to jQuery .
I 've had the bug to do this for a while , and this is a new project , so I went for it .
I do n't have anything against Prototype , so my main impetus for this was a move towards Unobtrusive JavaScript , and also the speed aspect ( the site I 'm currently working on , if things go accordingly to plan , will do some pretty serious traffic ) .
But , the unobtrusive JavaScript was the key , and really , my switch is more of a philosophy of approach rather than say a dislike for Prototype , etc .
And , of course , it 's something new to play with :)
Before I go any further , I 'll state right now , I am not a JavaScript expert , and I 've been using jQuery now for all of a couple hours .
One of the results of my switch however , was that I hacked DHH 's auto_complete Rails plugin , to work for jQuery .
Simple change .
I tweaked the controller macro , and then gutted the JS helpers , as you just do n't need those when using jQuery in this way .
It does require the jquery - autocomplete plugin for jQuery .
I 've published my Rails plugin for this on GitHub as auto_complete_jquery .
Circling back around , here 's what I did to get all this going .
I did run into one issue ( see step 10 below ) that I 'm still tracking down ( easy solution in the interim , but I 'd like to understand what 's happening , so if you have comments , please let me know ) :
Removed the Prototype and Scriptaculous JS files from the public / javascripts dir of my Rails app .
You do n't have to do this , but I am no longer using them , so saw no need to keep them there , and it helps ensure I do n't mistakenly use something from them or include them in the view .
This includes : prototype.js , controls.js , dragdrop.js , and effects.js .
Removed the prototype - based Rails auto_complete plugin from vendor / plugins .
Installed the latest minified jQuery file in public / javascripts / jquery .
Installed the JS files for the jquery - autocomplete plugin , and its dependencies : jquery.templating.js , and jquery.ui.autocomplete.js .
( see the jquery - autocomplete plugin for these files ) .
Added the jquery.ui.autocomplete.css file to public / stylesheets .
Installed my auto_complete_jquery plugin .
Put the proper includes for the CSS file and the JS files in my application layout file :
<%= stylesheet_link_tag ' jquery.ui.autocomplete ' %>
<%= javascript_include_tag ' jquery/jquery.min' , ' jquery/jquery.templating ' , ' jquery/jquery.ui.autocomplete.ext ' , ' jquery/jquery.ui.autocomplete ' , : cache => ' jquery ' %>
Note that I keep my jQuery JS files in a subdir for organizational purposes , but you can modify as needed .
Changed my existing auto - complete text fields that used the Rails Prototype based auto_complete plugin's helpers to just be plain old text fields , such as :
<%= coffee.text_field : drink , :autocomplete =>" off " %>
This is doing an auto - complete for the " drink " attribute of the Coffee model .
I can simply leave any auto_complete_for calls that existed in my controller , as that works the same .
If you had custom versions that were based on the code from the Prototype - based Rails plugin , just go look at the code in my plugin to see the differences , it 's a simple change .
Add the JavaScript that sets up the auto - complete for the given text field .
This will typically look like :
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) {
$ (" input#coffee_drink " ) .autocomplete ( { ajax : " auto_complete_for_coffee_drink " })
} ) ;
Where does this go ?
It depends .
What I 've been liking is using the JavaScript auto - include plugin , which creates a Rails - style convention for JavaScript files that pertain to individual actions , or are controller - wide .
So in my case , this code would get placed in public / javascripts / views / coffees / new.js , or likely one directory up , as simply coffees.js ( so that I can use it in any CoffeesController action that needs to auto - complete on coffee.
drink .
Without that plugin , you just put it in whatever JS file is appropriately included for the view you 're using it in , etc .
You can of course put it directly into the view in a script block , but then you are n't doing the whole Unobtrusive JavaScript thing as rigidly .
Finally , what I found is that I had to add a route for this .
This is the issue I mentioned above .
It sort of makes sense , but what I 'm unclear on is , why the prior standard / Prototype - based Rails auto_complete plugin did n't require a route .
They both seem to use a GET , define the action the same way , and so on .
I 'm hoping I 'm just missing something obvious .
So , the route I added is :
map.connect ':controller/auto_complete_for_coffee_drink ' , :action => ' auto_complete_for_coffee_drink ' , : format => ' json '
map.auto_complete ': controller/:action ' ,
: requirements => { :action => /auto_complete_for_\S+/ } ,
: conditions => { : method => : get }
A bunch of steps , but pretty simple work .
The app I 'm doing this on is all of a few days old , so I had n't gotten into use of much else in Prototype and so on , thus making the wholesale switch easy .
If you 'd like to learn more about any of these things , and as a comprehensive set of links :
Enjoy !
Update : I removed the jQuery Dimensions JS file and include for it in my layout , as this is now included in the latest jQuery JS file itself .
Update 2 : I do n't know how the standard auto_complete plugin manages to do without routes , but here is a generic route for all auto - complete actions across controllers : I hesitate to put this into the plugin , as routes can be quite tricky in more complex apps , and I would n't want to auto - hose someone :)

President Bush is poised to sign the housing and Fannie Mae bailout bill , after the Senate passed it with 72 votes on the weekend .
But an underreported part of this story is that Majority Leader Harry Reid refused to allow a vote on Republican Jim DeMint 's amendment to bar political donations and lobbying by Fannie and its sibling , Freddie Mac .
This is a rare parliamentary move for a body in which even Senators in the minority party have long been able to force votes .
The strong - arm play illustrates how politically powerful ...
The randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) is the gold standard for evaluating whether or not a therapeutic modality works .
In RCTs testing the effect of acupuncture to improve symptoms , researchers often use “ sham acupuncture ” as a control procedure , on the theory that sticking needles into points that are not on acupuncture meridians should have no effect .
The problem with this approach is that there is really no such thing as sham acupuncture .
In the mechanistic , Western view of the body and medicine , acupuncture is the sum of the parts , so it works like this :
problem + needle + point on meridian = problem gets better
You can insert other things in place of “ needle + point on meridian ” and you ’ll still have an accurate model for Western medicine .
problem + medication = problem gets better
problem + surgery = problem gets better
Each of these focuses on a specific functional or anatomic mechanism for ill health .
High blood pressure ?
Take a beta blocker .
Blocked coronary arteries ?
Replace them with femoral veins ( better yet , internal mammary arteries ) .
In this view , placebos make perfect sense as a way of proving that interventions work :
problem + thing that looks like medication but is n’t = problem does n’t get better
Here ’s where the mechanistic view of the body and how medicine works fails to meet the holistic view .
Acupuncture ca n’t be shoved into the mechanistic “ if A , then B ” box of randomized , controlled trials .
Solid evidence is emerging that the effects of acupuncture are mediated through the limbic - paralimbic - neocortical network .
It plays a central role in the affective and cognitive dimensions of pain–and in regulating and integrating emotion , memory processing , autonomic , endocrine , immunological , and sensorimotor functions .
For instance , a recent study using functional MRI of the brain to trace the effects of acupuncture in the brain stimulated four points : Taichong ( LV3 ) , Xingjian ( LV2 ) , Neiting ( ST44 ) , and a sham point on the top of the left foot .
The hemodynamic response was similar for all four points , as was the sensory experience as reported by the study subjects .
Regardless of the point being needled , acupuncture produced extensive deactivation of the limbic - paralimbic - neocortical system .
In short , there is no such thing as sham acupuncture .
Because the cognitive , affective , and physical intertwine in the limbic - paralimbic - neocortical network , there ’s no way to have a needle stuck into you without experiencing at least some of the effects of acupuncture .
You might think that this would be good news for proponents of acupuncture .
One way to interpret this information is that acupuncture is such a robust modality , it ’s effective even when used outside traditional guidelines .
However this probably wo n’t come as a great surprise–from the Western perspective , interventions remain suspect if they ca n’t be isolated and controlled for .
Even as acupuncture gains a toehold in Western medicine , it ’s unlikely to ever be fully accepted as a treatment modality .

Men ritually cut themselves on the 10th day of Muharram in Kabul A Muslim has been found guilty of child cruelty after forcing two boys to beat themselves during a religious ceremony .
The practice has caused controversy in Britain , but this is the first case of its kind to be brought before a UK court .
Husayn - the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad - and members of his family were slaughtered during the battle of Karbala in Iraq 1,400 years ago .
Ever since that day devout Shia Muslims have commemorated the tragedy with a month - long period of mourning called Muharram .
On the 10th day of Muharram , believers relive the tragedy through the Ashura ceremony .
Millions take part in prayers and processions , and some participate in a traditional flagellation ceremony called " zanjeer zani " .
Using a long - bladed whip called a zanjeer , men beat themselves on the back until they bleed .
The ritual is not obligatory , but many believe it expresses their grief and helps them to re-enact the pain suffered by Husayn and his relatives .
Like many devout Shia Muslims brought up in Pakistan , Syed Zaidi has self - flagellated during Ashura since he was a young boy .
He told Manchester Crown Court that children as young as seven flogged themselves with the zanjeer during the ceremony in his homeland .
Children ' protected '
In this country the laws are very different from those in Pakistan .
If you want children to perform this act , then take them to Pakistan
Prosecutor Andrew Nuttall
Man convicted over Shia flogging
In January this year Zaidi took part in " zanjeer zani " at a centre in Levenshulme , but he then allowed two brothers aged 13 and 15 to do the same .
In the UK the law states that children under the age of 16 should be protected from harm by adults .
Prosecutor Andrew Nuttall told the jury : " In this country children under the age of 16 will be protected under the law from harm .
Beyond the age of 16 it is a matter for them , but a line has to be drawn in the sand and that line is 16 .
" In this country the laws are very different from those in Pakistan .
If you want children to perform this act , then take them to Pakistan . "
The case is the first of its kind to be brought before a British court , but it is not the first time police and prosecutors have been made aware that children are involved in " zanjeer zani " in the UK .
Cases in Bradford have been investigated and referred to Child Protection Officers , but charges were never brought .
Similar cases have also been reported in Greater Manchester , but Crown Prosecution Service lawyers decided prosecuting was not in the public interest because the children involved were willing participants .
The ceremony is very emotional and people get very involved .
At that particular time of high emotion it is very difficult to say no to a child who wants to do it
Safbar Zia Jaffria Islamic Centre
The jury in Manchester has been told that children cannot consent to self - harm .
Both boys admitted they wanted to take part in the ceremony , but Mr Nuttall said children under the age of 16 could not consent to harming themselves , and if they did they had to be protected from themselves by adults .
Shias make up about 10 % of the world 's Muslim population and not all worshippers take part in the all - male ritual of " zanjeer zani " .
The Shia community in Manchester know the practice is controversial .
Safbar Zia , the general secretary of the Jaffria Islamic Centre in Levenshulme , said senior members of the community now tried to encourage believers to donate blood as a sign of mourning rather than beat themselves .
But he admitted many men who become very emotional during the ceremony still beat themselves and if children wanted to take part too they were not stopped .
He said : " How can you stop a child who wants to do this for his faith ?
We can not discourage or stop them .
" The ceremony is very emotional and people get very involved .
At that particular time of high emotion it is very difficult to say no to a child who wants to do it .
" We are trying to educate people but it will take time .
We can't change things overnight . "

Kerry : McCain 's judgment ' dangerous , ' candidate a ' changed man ' RAW STORY
Published : Sunday July 6 , 2008
Print This Email This " John McCain has changed in profound and fundamental ways that I find personally really surprising , and frankly upsetting , " said Democratic Senator John Kerry in a Sunday appearance on CBS 's Face the Nation .
" This is a different John McCain .
This is not the Senator John McCain ; this is want - to - be president John McCain . "
Sen. Kerry was the 2004 Democratic nominee for president .
He lost the election by a narrow margin .
" And the result is that John McCain has flip - flopped on more issues than I was even ever accused possibly of thinking about ! " continued Kerry .
" I mean , this is extraordinary what he 's done :
He 's changed on taxes ; he 's now in favor of the Bush tax cut .
If you like the Bush economy , if you like the Bush tax cut and what it 's done to our economy , making wealthier people wealthier and the average middle class struggle harder , then John McCain is going to give you a third term of George Bush and Karl Rove .
" If you like what has happened to oil prices , John McCain is going to continue that policy .
If you like what you see about health care , John McCain has no health care plan .
" I would have at least expected the John McCain that I knew back then to realize what almost every person in the Pentagon has admitted .
There are very few who walk around and say , ' Going into Iraq was the right thing to do , and we should have done it , or do it again if I have the chance . '
John McCain does .
" I 'm challenging Senator McCain 's judgment , that says , ' There 's no violent history between Sunni and Shia . '
That 's wrong .
His judgment that says , ' This is going to increase the stability of the Middle East . '
It has n't , it 's made it less stable .
The judgment that says , quote , ' This will be the best thing for America and the world in a long time .
It 's the worst thing that we 've done in a long time .
And he 's turned his [ focus ] away from Afghanistan and al Qaeda and made America less safe .
That 's dangerous for our country . "
READ THE REST .
The following video is from the Sunday July 6,2008 broadcast of Face the Nation :
Updated | 5:05 p.m. : BIRMINGHAM , Mich . — Cindy McCain , the wife of Senator John McCain , learned the meaning of “ grip and grin ” today when enthusiastic supporters pulled her hands and she sustained a minor sprain in one of her wrists .
She was shaking hands with supporters at a fund - raising luncheon with her husband in West Bloomfield when one supporter gripped one hand tightly and another gripped her other hand , causing a wrench in one of her arms , campaign officials said .
Mrs. McCain , who has a history of carpel tunnel syndrome , has sensitive arms and was taken to a local hospital for X - rays and was then released .
Mrs. McCain appeared at a press availability here this afternoon with her right arm in a black sling .
“ She has a minor sprain , ” Mr. McCain said .
He said the sling means she “ will not have to shake so many hands . ”
Mrs. McCain smiled and said she was fine .
At the end of a 30 - minute news conference with her husband , she said “ a very enthusiastic supporter got me the wrong way and I ’m absolutely great and this is a precautionary thing . ”
A “ pool ” of reporters had been whisked in and out of the fund - raiser only for the duration of Mr. McCain ’s brief speech and so did not see or record the incident involving Mrs. McCain .
A spokeswoman for the campaign said : “ At some point during the rope line , an enthusiastic supporter shook Mrs. McCain ’s hand and exacerbated an existing carpal tunnel condition for which she has had previous surgeries .
Out of an abundance of caution , she decided to leave the event and visit the local hospital for X - rays , where she was treated for a minor sprain . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - People who have surgery to remove stomach cancer can cut the risk that it will return by getting antibiotics to eliminate a type of bacteria infecting the stomach ’s lining , researchers said on Thursday .
The drugs targeted Helicobacter pylori , a corkscrew - shaped bacteria that is a leading cause of stomach ulcers and also is associated with stomach cancer and other ailments .
The study , published in the Lancet medical journal , found that getting rid of this bacteria reduced the risk of further stomach cancer by about two - thirds over three years .
The study , led by Dr. Mototsugu Kato and Dr. Masahiro Asaka of Hokkaido University in Japan , involved 544 people with early - stage stomach cancer , half who were given the drug treatment and half of who were not .
All of them had undergone surgery to remove the tumor .
The drug - treated group got a week of twice - daily doses of the antibiotics amoxicillin and clarithromycin and the ulcer drug lansoprazole , sold by Japan ’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd as Prevacid .
“ We believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between H. pylori infection and gastric cancer , and also support the use of H. pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer , ” the researchers wrote .
H. pylori can infect the mucous layer that coats the lining of the stomach .
Long - term infection can lead to inflammation that can trigger precancerous changes in the stomach lining .
There are estimates that the bacteria infects half the world ’s people , with the rate around 70 percent in developing countries and 20 to 30 percent in developed countries .
Most who carry the bacteria have no symptoms of infection .
“ No one ’s been sure that if you intervene by getting rid of this bacteria at this late stage that it will do any good , ” Dr. Nicholas Talley of the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville , Florida , who wrote a commentary accompanying the study , said in a telephone interview .
The findings support the idea that getting rid of the bacteria could help prevent stomach cancer from developing , Talley said .
But experts are still debating the issue .
Talley said it might be a good idea to screen people in high - risk places , including Japan and South Korea , for H. pylori infection , and give drugs to treat infected people .
This could involve millions of people getting blood or other tests for H. pylori infection , he said .
“ There ’s a lot of people in the world who are older , who have this bacteria , who have some of these precancerous changes , ” Talley added .
According to the American Cancer Society , stomach cancer is the No. 2 cause of cancer death in men and the No. 4 cause among women , killing around 800,000 people worldwide yearly .
We just got a call from Devline Rossell , a charter captain based out of Venice , Louisiana .
He was shopping in New Orleans to get some supplies before the arrival of Gustav ( currently listed as a tropical storm that has left at least 22 dead in the Caribbean ) and reported that the item most in demand was not food , clothing or shelter .
“ I just left a sporting goods store and you would think that the number - one selling item would be plywood or potable water or gasoline right now , ” he said .
“ Apparently it is AR - 15s and .223 ammo .
I watched at least 20 people buy AR - 15s and cases of .223 . ”
Ca n’t say I ’m surprised .
After the nightmare that was Katrina I think it would be unwise for anyone to assume the state , local or federal government could guarantee his or her personal safety during a natural disaster .
Of course , I think it is foolish to assume that under any circumstance .
The AR buying spree demonstrates that people do n’t think of it as an “ assault weapon ” but rather an arm that is ideally suited for self - defense , which it is .
I also suspect that for some of the folks this is their first firearm .
Goes to show that not only is there no such thing as an atheist in a foxhole but that there is no such thing as a gun-control advocate in one either .
Defcon
A transit agency in New England has filed a federal lawsuit to stop three Massachusetts Institute of Technology undergraduates from publicly presenting research at Defcon demonstrating gaping security holes in two of the agency 's electronic payment systems .
The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority ( MBTA ) also named MIT in the 17 - page complaint , which seeks unspecified monetary damages for violation of the computer fraud and abuse act , negligent supervision and other causes of action .
It also requests a temporary order preventing the students from " publicly stating or indicating that the security or integrity " of the MBTA 's systems has been compromised .
The three speakers are Zack Anderson , 21 , RJ Ryan , 22 and Alessandro Chiesa , 20 , who on Sunday were scheduled to present research into both of the MBTA 's automated payment systems .
Although one method uses magnetic strip technology and the other radio frequency identification , the researchers say it 's trivial to manipulate both cards to add hundreds of dollars in fare amounts .
" Disclosure of this information - if what the MIT undergrads claim is true - will significantly compromise the CharlieCard and CharlieTicket systems , " the complaint states .
" This in turn will harm the overall functioning of the MBTA 's transit services . "
Perhaps the MBTA has n't heard of the Mifare Classic , the world 's most popular RFID card , which just happens to be included in the CharlieCard .
Last year researchers announced a way to crack the smartcard in a matter of minutes .
The trio's research into the CharlieTicket is based on other weaknesses .
" It 's pretty disappointing , " Anderson told El Reg .
" We initially called them to offer them our help in fixing these vulnerabilities .
We have no intention of releasing details that would allow someone to replicate the attacks that can be done . "
Representatives from the MBTA and MIT were n't available for comment .
The lawsuit , filed Friday in US District Court in Boston , capped a week of sometimes tense negotiations between MBTA officials , the students , and their instructor , MIT Professor Ronald Rivest ( the R in the RSA cryptography algorithm ) .
Earlier this week , a meeting at MIT was convened that included the students and their instructor , a MBTA official and a special agent from the FBI cyber crimes division .
" The MBTA official made clear the level of concern reached all the way up to the governor 's office , " Anderson said .
" They wanted to know exactly what types of details we were revealing .
They were pretty concerned about the tools " the students planned to release .
According to the complaint , the students refused to provide MBTA officials with the materials they planned to present at Defcon .
The MBTA is the fifth biggest US transit agency with a ridership of about 1.4 million per day .
Average weekday revenue is about $ 700,000 .
The complaint takes issue with a presentation description that read in part : " Want free subway rides for life ?
In this talk we go over weaknesses in common subway fare collection systems .
We focus on the Boston T subway , and show how we reverse engineered the data on magstripe card , we present several attacks to completely break the CharlieCard , a Mifare Classic smartcard used in many subways around the world , and we discuss physical security problems . "
The description was later changed to remove the first line .
Anderson said the tools scheduled to be released helped streamline research into whether payment systems from other transit agencies were vulnerable to the same types of attacks .
The students never planned to give tools or instructions showing how to add fares to the MBTA cards , he stressed .
This is n't the first time a powerful interest has sued to muzzle a Defcon speaker .
In 2005 Cisco Systems took action against researcher Michael Lynn after he promised to demonstrate how to run a shellcode on a router without authorization .
The two ultimately settled .
NXP Semiconductor , maker of the cryptographically challenged Mifare card , has also taken legal action to silence researchers who poked holes in fare collection systems used in the Netherlands .
A Dutch judge rejected the request .

FULL STORY »
State officers arrested 22 protesters last night after a Hawaiian sovereignty group chained the gates of the Iolani Palace grounds , broke into the palace -- reportedly intending to put its king on the throne -- and hoisted its flag on Statehood Day .
Some members of the group calling itself the Kingdom of Hawaii , Nation , allegedly assaulted a palace employee during the takeover .
After the arrests , palace officials issued a statement saying the historic site would be closed so they can assess the damage .
" Until further notice , Iolani Palace will be closed to the public due to a break - in ... by a group calling itself the Kingdom of Hawaii , Nation .
Until it is possible for us to assess any damage and to ensure that the palace doors are secure , it is necessary for us to restrict public access , " the statement said .
About 25 group members with its king , Akahi Nui , began locking the gates at about 5:30 p.m. , said Kippen de Alba Chu , executive director of Friends of Iolani Palace .
" The king , they said , is going to sit on the throne , " de Alba Chu recalled a man saying .
" They also said we need to open the palace doors or they are going to break them down . "
" Alarms are going off at the palace and the barracks building , " said Noelani Ah Yuen , facilities manager at Iolani Palace , by phone from the Kanaina Building on the palace grounds during the takeover .
" We do n't have any law enforcement here helping us . "
The group had about 15 to 20 guards wearing red shirts who refused to allow people inside the gates .
" The king of Hawaii has returned to his throne , and the state of Hawaii is under a state of arrest by a federal marshal to ensure the interests of the USA , " said a written statement handed out to the media .
It was the second time a sovereignty group locked the palace gates this year .
About 70 members of a separate group , the Hawaiian Kingdom Government , occupied the grounds on April 30 .
" We do n't have any information on this group ( Kingdom of Hawaii , Nation ) , " said de Alba Chu .
" We never heard of them before .
" Other sovereignty groups are very upset with this , " he said .
" It 's ridiculous , " he added .
" We are preserving Hawaii 's history and culture -- that 's why we do n't want any damage to happen to the building or its contents .
That 's why we 're asking all groups to respect the palace grounds . "
He said , " We 're extremely frustrated , and we feel betrayed by the Honolulu Police Department .
Our personal safety was at risk , and the officer just left .
It 's like we can't even count on the Police Department when our safety is in jeopardy .
It 's atrocious . "

A Department of Land and Natural Resources officer hauled away a man wearing a " Security " shirt .
Ah Yuen said she was assaulted when she approached the east gate to talk with people outside the gate at about 6:30 p.m .
Three of the group 's members began slamming the gate on her , trying to push her out , she said .
She called out for help to a nearby police officer , who told her it was not his jurisdiction , she said .
The palace is on state grounds , outside of HPD jurisdiction .
State Department of Land and Natural Resources officers arrived later in the evening and started making arrests .
After Ah Yuen pushed her way back onto the palace grounds , the guards let her go and she went into the administration building .
" I got a few scrapes , my neck is kind of sore , my back is kind of sore , " she said .
" We have an obligation to the people of Hawaii , to the nation , to protect and preserve the palace , and that 's our main concern . "
She was later taken to the Queen 's Medical Center by an official with the Friends of Iolani Palace .
Alfred Love , a group member who contended he was a federal marshal , denied that anyone had been manhandled at a side gate .
The group 's leaders -- King Akahi Nui and Queen Akahi Wahine -- were on the palace grounds but did not speak to the media .
Akahi Nui claims he descends from King Kamehameha I and is the heir to the crown .
The protesters initially allowed the media onto the grounds , but asked reporters and photographers to leave at about 7:30 p.m .
Love said he would escort the king to the throne .
Love " placed the king of Hawaii and his kingdom under federal protective custody and arrested the state of Hawaii from doing anything that would harm or endanger the kingdom , or threaten the treaties of the USA by armed force " against the Kingdom of Hawaii , Nation , the group 's statement read .
Also present was Delano Muller , a man wearing a black suit and tie , who claimed to be a U.N. ambassador for the Kingdom of Hawaii , Nation , and an observer for a human rights organization .
" I'm here as an observer , " Muller said .
Muller and Patrick McCormick , special adviser to Akahi Nui and Akahi Wahine , said they were at the palace as observers because the king had been arrested and wrongly imprisoned for five months in 2002 for trespassing in Ulupalakua on property that had belonged to his great - great - grandmother .
Elton Gushiken said he is brother of the queen and the only relative on the grounds .
He said the king is from Wailuku and that the queen is from Kauai .
Other native Hawaiians began showing up and asking questions at the gates , saying they received word by e-mail of the takeover .
One Hawaiian man told a Kingdom of Hawaii , Nation , guard that Hawaiian sovereignty groups needed to unite , otherwise they will eventually fade away .
" If we fight in small groups , nothing is going to be done , " he said .
Truth , Lies , and Video Games
Apathy is for losers .
Fine , you
do n't have time to start a charity or fight Jack [ Thompson ] , then let your work do
the talking .
Your collective creative output is the real ambassador
that touches millions on a global basis .
Games have the ability to
transform the world .
Do n’t lose sight of that .
You create culture .
We
ARE culture .
Like it or not , you are all already ambassadors for games .
So , better make the most of that responsibility !
Award or not , I ca n’t ever do that for you .
These words were spoken by Jason Della Rocca as he won the Ambassador Award at the Game Developers Conference this year .
Della Rocca has done wonderful work for the International Game Developers Association , but his speech was inspiring : it 's everyone 's job to put a better face on gaming , because whether you 're a hardcore shooter fan or you simply enjoy a few rounds of Peggle , you 're taking part in an industry that many do n't understand , and some would like to control .
We 've recently had the pleasure of speaking to some of the best minds currently working to help the gaming industry grow up , and to some very giving people who seek to put a human face on the suffering of many and alleviate some of that pain .
Their instruments ?
Video games ?
The video industry is growing up .
Luckily for us , many gamers are growing up with it , and we have many capable hands guiding the art form and protecting it from the misinformation about what gaming is , and the type of people who enjoy it .
The battle wo n't be won in the courts
If the mainstream media is to be believed , video games are about as healthy as cigarettes , except they cause psychotic breaks instead of cancer .
Politicians use this artificially created fear of games as an excuse to pass legislation to criminalize the sale of certain games , although so far , each of these pieces of legislation has been successfully challenged and overturned in the courts .
While more people than ever are playing games , and the audience for those games is expanding to include people of both sexes and all ages , the media 's reporting on the industry and its effects on children remains reactionary and woefully misleading .
Being a good person and a gamer is easier than you think .
One of the biggest misconceptions about games is that they 're the domain of adolescent boys .
According to the Entertainment Software Association , the average age of gamers is now 35 .
Approximately 60 percent of gamers play video games with their friends , 40 percent of gamers in the US are women , and almost a quarter of all video game players are over the age of fifty .
If video games are so popular and widely enjoyed , why are they still vilified in the media ?
Who actually plays video games ?
The ESA 's findings might surprise you .
The full answer to that question is complicated , but the short - and - simple version is that , all survey data aside , video games are still a new form of media that older generations by - and - large rarely see or experience first - hand .
Human nature is simple : we fear what we do n't understand .
" [ The demographics for the ESA survey ] would mean that for every 16 - year - old kid there 's a 50 - year - old guy to average out to 33 , and that ’s just not what I see when I go to GameStop or when I read comments online , " said Dennis McCauley of GamePolitics when he talked with Ars .
" I think gaming is still largely a youth culture thing , at least in the sense of the most involved gamers . "
McCauley 's logic makes sense : enjoying games like TextTwist , MineSweeper , and Solitaire might make older players more amenable towards video games in general , but that does n't mean they fully understand the nature of the industry .
Will Wright gave a speech where he pointed out that games are n't the first new trend to be distrusted .
He told us about how he came across an article where the writer described a young man engrossed in some unfamiliar handheld object , apparently to the point where he was out of touch with his surroundings and did n't want to interact with others because it distracted him from his new obsession .
It turns out this account came from a medieval monastery ; the object in question was a book in the hands of a young monk .
Everything , when it's new to society , has to prove its worth .
Games are still perceived by many as toys , and toys are meant to be played with by children .
But the idea of little tykes playing with mature content is more than enough to get concerned parents up in arms .
" I think [ this attitude is ] due in part to the misperception that video games are primarily intended for kids , " said Patricia Vance of the ESRB .
" When you juxtapose that mis-perception with the presence of mature content in a video game , it causes concern .
The more games are thought of in the same way as movies and TV shows , the more acceptance they ’ll gain , and that ’s been happening more and more in recent years . "
Some of the biggest opponents of games in recent political history ( clockwise from top left ) : Hillary Clinton , Elliot Splitzer , Andrew J Lanza , and Leland Yee .
These two ideas about games are at odds : one group sees them as toys with inappropriate content , and the other sees an emerging art form that is giving movies and music a run for their money , quite literally .
Now that games have managed to infiltrate the popular culture at large , the politicians are becoming even more alarmed , and the expensive campaign to pass laws controlling the content of games and their sales may find new allies .
Still , some in the industry are hopeful , and they think these attempts will trend downward .
" [ The political climate ] 's still dicey , but a little better than it has been .
The good news is that the number of serious legislative attempts to regulate games at the state level has dropped off over the last two years , " said McCauley .
" Right now , only Massachusetts is pushing legislation , and that bill seems stalled .
The California law is still under appeal by Gov. Schwarzenegger , and we 're waiting to see if Minnesota decides to take its bill to the US Supreme Court .
They have exhausted their other avenues of appeal .
New York had a bill that looked to be on the fast track to passage until Gov. Spitzer got caught going the GTA hooker route . "
Since McCauley talked to Ars , the New York bill has been signed into law by Gov. David Paterson ( Spitzer 's replacement ) , and the industry is potentially going to challenge it in court .
Politicians have made a point of trying to limit the sales and content of games they find morally objectionable , but the industry has managed to legally overturn every piece of legislation with an undefeated record of 9 - 0 .
This intimidating track record might not stall every attempt , but it sends a powerful message .
The fact that gamers are making up an increasing percentage of voters might have a little something to do with it , too .
At least part of this recognition is due to groups like the Entertainment Consumers Association , the Entertainment Software Association , and the ESRB making an effort to educate both the general populace and elected officials about the reality of video games .
The gamers themselves have stepped up , and have become their own PR machine , showing the world that our favorite hobby is enjoyed by good , upstanding people .

August 10 , 2008 -- “ Given everything that is occurring in Tarija , Santa Cruz , Pando and Beni , we have to denounce … that we are on the threshold of a real coup d’etat against the constitutional order ” , announced Bolivian minister of the presidency , Ramon Quintana , on August 7 .
The day before , two bullets were fired into his car in an assassination attempt during a visit to the city of Trinidad , in Beni .
Beni is part of the “ half moon ” of the resource - rich eastern departments including Santa Cruz , Tarija and Pando , that are a stronghold of the opposition to the left - wing government of indigenous President Evo Morales .
“ What the prefects are doing today is nothing more than an act of sedition , of contempt , or organisation of illegal forces , paramilitaries , to go against all public liberties ” , added Quintana .
Later that day , the mayor of Santa Cruz , Percy Fernandez stated “ that the armed forces should overthrow the national government because it is useless ” .
Sitting besides him was Santa Cruz prefect , Ruben Costas .
This right - wing offensive is occurring in the lead - up to referendums on whether or not to recall Morales and eight of the nine departmental prefects , organised for August 10 in an attempt to resolve the political stand - off between the government and the social movements , largely based in the west , on the one hand , and the forces of the oligarchy determined to stop the process of change .
During the week leading up to the vote , a small group of balaclava - wearing protesters took over the airport of Tarija and successfully prevented the scheduled meeting between Morales and Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez and Argentina 's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner — the visiting presidents ’ plane being unable to land .
Both Morales and vce- president Alvaro Garcia Linera cancelled their traditional independence day speeches due to fears of violent protests in Sucre .
Sucre is Bolivia ’s constitutional capital and capital of Chuquisaca department , where an opposition candidate recently won elections for prefect .
The former prefect , from Morales ’ Movement Towards Socialism ( MAS ) , is now in exile in Peru , following a series of violent attacks .
Morales was also forced to suspend political events in Beni , Pando and Santa Cruz as a few hundred opposition protesters surrounded airports in these regions .
Sensing defeat in the polls , the right - wing opposition — led by the half moon prefects — have unleashed a campaign of violence , terrorism and intimidation with the intention of not only stopping the electoral process going ahead but of overthrowing the president .
Polls continue to show an increasing support for Morales , which is now around 60 % , while a number of opposition prefects look set to lose their seats .
Cochabamba prefect Manfred Villa Reyes , one of the most likely to be removed , has already stated he will not accept the results of the referendum .
In Santa Cruz , Costas looks set to win by a wide margin .
A key aim for the opposition is to ensure that in the vote on the presidency Morales receives as little of the vote as possible in the east in order to proclaim that he is “ no longer president ” of that part of Bolivia .
The half moon prefects , along with the eastern agribusiness and gas industry elites , have been promoting a campaign for autonomy for the eastern departments to protect their interests from the national - indigenous project of the Morales government .
Whipping up fear of “ indigenous revenge ” and playing on the prejudices of the mestizo and white middle classes , the elites have run a racist campaign , which has including violent lynch mobs attacking indigenous people .
Adding to the social conflict , miners , disabled people and transport drivers have mobilised across the country , shutting down roads over their demands .
In Huanuni , violent clashes between police and miners left two dead and many more injured .
Following the deaths , Morales affirmed that their demands would be attended to via sincere and responsible dialogue , but that the most important thing right now was the unity of Bolivians to maintain national integrity .
In this context , the need for international solidarity with Bolivia ’s democratic process of change becomes paramount , as Chavez has repeatedly stated .
The defeat of the Morales government would be a defeat not just for the oppressed in Bolivia , but the project for a Latin America independent from US imperialism .

Below is an abridged article by Hugo Moldiz , MAS leader and head of the General Staff of the Peoples , which unites most of Bolivia ’s social movements .
It has been translated by Federico Fuentes .
* * *
On August 10 , the possibilities of consolidating and strengthening a national - popular project , that creates equal rights and opportunities for all without exclusion and racism , by building on the things we got right and correcting errors , will face off against the project of the old Bolivia .
The forces of the old Bolivia involve the privileged , who sometimes confuse and utilise oppressed social sectors , and talk about democracy and justice while benefiting from being in positions of power .
August 10 will be more than a simple referendum to decide the permanence or not of the presidency of Evo Morales and eight of the nine prefects of Bolivia .
The result of the recall referendums will determine the continuity and deepening of the process of change initiated in 2006 , or the beginning of the return to a Bolivia based on exclusion and material and symbolic privileges for a tiny group of families .
Therefore a lot is at play .
But talking about change is abstract if it is not grounded in what is at stake , which the powerful media machine has dedicated itself to distorting and manipulating .
Symbolic changes
The political - electoral victory of December 2005 and the inauguration of Morales as president on January 22 , 2006 , marked the beginning of one of the most profound chapters in all of republican history .
A series of symbolic , political , material and cultural changes began to occur .
Bolivia — a country with an indigenous majority , independent of their status as peasant , worker , petty trader , professional , intellectual and student — for the first time had an indigenous president , adding weight to the warning issued by Tupac Katari , an indigenous person who was quartered by the Spanish colony after surrounding La Paz in 1781 , when he said : “ I will return and be millions ! ”
With his entry in the Palacio Quemado , Morales opened the possibility of a rupture of the colonialism in force until now — one of its manifestations being racism — and of substituting it with peace and democracy , with a society where men and women , indigenous and non-indigenous , can coexist .
That is why the swearing in of the indigenous president in Tiwanacu , a day before the official act in Congress , acquired a symbolic value never experimented with before .
The indigenous people dreamed about storming heaven , with votes and without rifles — and unlike in the past , invited others to construct a homeland for all .
Political changes
In the political sphere , the popular victory of 2005 represented a great possibility , paraphrasing former US president Abraham Lincoln , to construct “ a government of the people , by the people and for the people ” .
And this is no exaggeration .
As well as the symbolic value of being indigenous , Morales wagers on the construction of a political power in which the urban and rural oppressed classes , including broad fractions of the middle classes hit hard by neoliberalism , can have a protagonistic participation .
We are not dealing here with the subordination of indigenous people to an imperial and white project , as has occurred in our history , but rather a rebellious Indian that the privileged want nothing to do with .
In Bolivia , a project is underway aimed at going beyond capitalism and towards the construction of a society and state where there is an equilibrium between humans and nature , between social and political democracy .
And the project is not just national .
Morales forms part of a group of regional leaders working towards the unity and integration of Latin America .
Economic change
Changes have also occurred in the economic sphere where important steps forward have been taken .
This statement makes sense if we compare the current situation with the destruction caused in Bolivia and other backward countries by the fundamentalist application of a neoliberal model .
The figures are stark .
The level of industrial development of Bolivia , already very precarious , decreased from 19 % to 12 % during the 20 years of neoliberalism .
The informal market increased , the state bank was privatised and what was private was owned by transnationals .
Services became more expensive and natural resources — oil and minerals — were handed over to foreign corporations that barely left a tribute of no more than 20 % on average .
Thousands of workers were thrown onto the streets .
The result of such destructive actions can not be repaired in a few years , especially in the second poorest nation in Latin America — for whom extraordinary natural wealth has meant poverty for its inhabitants , due to the concentration of profits in few hands .
What has Morales done up until now ?
Faced with this past , much more than what other countries in better conditions have done in two years .
International reserves have increased from US $ 1.7 billion to close to $ 7.5 billion .
Petroleum rent has increased from $ 300 million to more than $ 2 billion per year , product of the nationalisation of petroleum .
The income from mining has increased due to an increase in taxes and the state recuperation of the Posokoni mines and the Vinto tin smelter , as well as supporting the mining cooperative sector .
In all the macroeconomic indicators , growth in these last two years has been superior ( more than 5 % ) to those registered during the period of state capitalism ( 1952 - 85 ) and the two decades of a market economy .
The volume of exports continues its ascending trend since 2005 .
There is also the never before seen support given to small producers with the creation of the Popular Development Bank and the Peoples Trade Agreements ( TCP — part of the Bolivarian Alternative for Latin America trading bloc ) .
There is also the productive and commercial reconversion of thousands of people that neoliberalism had condemned to import and sell as contraband used clothes , along with the first steps taken in line with a firm decision to advance towards an industrialisation that is compatible with the preservation of the environment .
It is not that nothing has been done , but the greatest lag , which can be explained by the magnitude of the political confrontation in Bolivia , is found in the distribution of land .
Its not just that close to 700,000 hectares have been handed over to campesinos ( peasants ) , out of an estimated 20 million , it ’s that latifundio ( large landed estates ) is alive and well in the hands of the agro-exporting bourgeoisie .
Between 1996 and 2005 , 36,815 hectares of fiscal land was distributed , that is , 3681 hectares per year on average .
In the period 2006 - 07 , the Morales government distributed 697,882 hectares to campesinos in the departments of La Paz , Pando , Santa Cruz and Tarija , or 350,000 hectares per year .
According to the vice - ministry of land , 200 times more land was redistributed to campesinos in two years than during a decade of the previous regimes , and out of 14.7 million hectares of land that have been assessed in three years , almost 9 million hectares is communitarian property , 577,000 small properties and 888,000 hectares belonging to medium and large companies .
Despite the creation of state companies , it is true that capitalist relations of production continue to be predominant .
But looking towards the future , a longer transition awaits us .
Social changes
With Cuban - Venezuelan cooperation , 15,000 medical consultations have been registered , 250,000 eye operations have occurred and 10,000 people ’s lives have been saved due to the expansion of health care .
At the end of the year , Bolivia will be the third country after Cuba and Venezuela to be free of illiteracy in Latin America .
The payment of the “ dignity rent ” pension ( 3000 bolivianos ) to all people over the age of 60 and the “ juancito pinto ” bonus ( 200 bolivianos ) for children of primary school age , is something that marks a will to benefit all Bolivians via a better distribution of wealth .
The “ energy revolution ” is not being left behind and , with the help of Cuba , some 15 million energy saving light bulbs will be placed in all homes by the end of the year , representing a decrease of 70 % in electricity consumption .
Constituent process
But , perhaps the best synthesis of the choice of advancing to the future or returning to the past , can be found in the struggle to the approve or reject the new constitution , and the totality of the constituent process that began with force in 2000 .
A victory of the popular project in the referendums would represent a grand possibility of opening up a process of dialogue with the objective of breaking the catastrophic deadlock and give the county a new constitutional text .
The dominant classes , led by the agro-exporting bourgeoisie , are small but are currently unleashing an implacable offensive , driven by the US , against the emancipatory project led by Morales .
On the other side is the majority of people , in which , if the old unionism can leave behind its conservatism and the mestizo middle classes can overcome their prejudices , the conditions will exist to take a significant leap forward — together with a government that has to consolidate its advances but also correct errors in all spheres — towards the construction of a society with equal rights and opportunities for all .

SIOUX FALLS , S.D. 
In his telling , his opponent is wrong on the Iraq war and wrong on the ailing economy , a would - be George W. Bush running for what amounts to a third term .
“ This is a guy who said I have no knowledge of foreign affairs , ” Senator Barack Obama says , his voice hitting a high C on the incredulity scale , before he adds : “ Well , John McCain was arguing for a war that had nothing to do with 9/11 .
He was wrong , and he was wrong on the most important subject that confronted our nation . ”
The crowd rises , clapping and cheering at this pleasing whiff of partisan buckshot .
As Mr. Obama stands poised to claim the crown of presumptive Democratic nominee , he is , gingerly , fitting himself with the cloth of a partisan Democrat despite having long proclaimed himself above such politics .
That his shift in tone was inevitable and necessary , particularly as Mr. McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , slashes at Mr. Obama as weak on Iran and terrorism , does not entirely diminish the cognitive dissonance .
For 17 months , Mr. Obama , of Illinois , has changed remarkably little about his stump style .
He projects the image of a post - partisan candidate with the confidence of a man convinced he holds a copyright .
Man Forced Daughter to Kill Cat
By Margaret Lyons in News on Aug 1 , 2008 6:35 PM
Danield John Collins , 39 , pleaded guilty yesterday to one count of domestic violence / animal cruelty and two counts of neglect of a dependent .
He forced his 7 - year - old daughter to stab the family 's cat .
Collins was arrested March 13 after he was accused of forcing his daughter to stab Boots , the family 's eight - month - old feline , with a knife .
The girl and Collins ' 11 - year - old son said their father ordered them to stab the cat because he wanted them to " learn to kill . "
Police said the defendant 's son tried to hide the cat from his father , but that Collins was able to find the animal and strangled it as his children looked on .
Authorities said Boots had suffered a broken leg , broken teeth , a bruised ear , ripped lip and two stab wounds , but died as a result of being strangled .
Collins , of Muncie , says he was drunk at the time and does n't remember the incident , but he did n't dispute his children 's account .

To the Editor :
Re “ Police and a Cyclists ’ Group , and Four Years of Clashes ” ( news article , Aug. 4 ) , in which I am quoted as the director of Time ’s Up , which promotes the Critical Mass rides but is not involved in organizing them :
The function of Critical Mass is to create a safe space where people can ride together .
Group rides like Critical Mass play an important role in generating new cyclists , who in turn become everyday bike commuters .
The ride grew steadily for a decade until the crackdown after the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City .
The article reports that Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly “ said the Police Department wants to work with the riders . ”
By no means has the Police Department tried to work with us .
Critical Mass riders have been harassed , spied on , beaten , arrested and even sued by the city .
Yet we have prevailed in the courtroom  it has been proved over and over that police statements do not match videotaped evidence .
We also contest Mr. Kelly ’s claim that Critical Mass riders go against traffic .
While it is true that the ride has no set route , under normal circumstances , it does follow the traffic flow .
Most appalling is Mr. Kelly ’s and the spokesman ’s assertion that the ride was “ hijacked ” by an “ anarchist group ” before the Republican convention .
This is a baseless scare tactic .
Critical Mass has no leaders .
The lack of control that Mr. Kelly calls anarchy can be better termed community .
Our house was built around 1900 .
It is an end - terrace house with 2 bedrooms , located in an inner-city area in Bury , Lancashire , UK .
Our household comprises me and my partner , with no children , and we live in the property all year round .
No planning restrictions are in effect in our area .
This is a guest post from Andy Hunt ( solar_bud on The Oil Drum ) .
It 's an inspiring account of what can be done today with a modest property to live efficiently and maintain a degree of energy security .
Annual Energy Use
We use around 3200 units of electricity annually from the grid , although this is expected to fall once we install the second stage of our solar PV system .
This includes all cooking , as we do n’t have a gas supply , and is about average for our part of the country .
Our heating system is 100 % wood and solar fuelled , so we do n’t tend to count heating in our energy consumption .
We go through quite a few logs over the course of a winter though !
We use a ‘ green ’ electricity tariff , initally Npower “ Juice ” but now Good Energy as it's 100 % renewable unlike Juice .
About Us and Why We Did It
I work as Sustainability Manager for a local Council , and have a long - standing interest in energy issues , climate change and fossil fuel depletion .
I have always wanted to live in an eco-house , and my home renovation project of our very ordinary Victorian terraced house has made that dream a reality .
My partner comes from a family whose motto is “ mend and make do ” , and she has grown up with solid fuel heating all her life .
She is very practically minded , the daughter of an electrician , so her ideas and practical suggestions have been a very valuable part of our ‘ green ’ experiment .
Heating
The existing gas central heating system was converted to run on wood fuel and solar power .
I hired a plumber who disconnected the existing radiator system from the ( cheap and low - quality ) gas combination boiler which was running it when I bought the house , and connected it up to a new wood burning stove which was installed in the fireplace in the living room .
The stove has a back boiler which runs two pipe loops – one connects the stove to a dual - coil hot water storage cylinder in the bedroom directly above , and the other connects the stove to the radiators in the house .
The hot water storage cylinder is heated by convection from the back boiler , and on the return pipe from the cylinder to the stove is a pipe thermostat .
When the temperature of the return pipe ( and hence the water in the cylinder ) reaches 60 °C , the thermostat starts a circulation pump in the radiator circuit , which pumps hot water around the house .
This ensures that the hot water cylinder is heated as a priority , and is kept hot at all times .
When choosing a wood stove , it is essential to choose the right type for the application and situation .
An ordinary room heater stove will provide warmth and cooking facilities in an emergency such as a power cut .
A larger stove with a back boiler like ours can also run a central heating and hot water system , but is more expensive to install .
If you live in a smoke control area , you must legally install a stove which is exempt from the Clean Air Act by DEFRA for burning wood in a smoke control area .
Most stove manufacturers make such models , but at the time of writing the only wood stove with a back boiler which is CAA - exempt is the Dunsleyheat Yorkshire stove .
In the summer , the cylinder is heated by a solar hot water system , which is plumbed into the lower coil in the hot water storage cylinder – the wood stove is plumbed into the top coil .
Our solar hot water system is by Zen Eaga Solar – it is a flat plate system , and works well .
Most solar hot water system installers will provide a dual - coil cylinder as part of the installation .
The cost of the cylinder is actually a substantial part of the cost of the whole system .
Power Generation
The house uses solar photovoltaic panels and a battery back - up system for power security and low carbon emissions .
In the house there are two ring - mains - one which serves the heavy duty appliances in the kitchen such as the hob , cooker and washing machine , and a second one which serves the rest of the house .
When considering solar PV for electricity generation , I did n't like the idea that I would still lose power during a power cut if the system was grid - connected .
So I went for a hybrid system , which does n't feed excess power into the grid but stores it in batteries , will work during a power cut for several days , and can also take mains electricity when it is available .
We currently have 330 Wp of solar PV ( to be expanded to around 700 - 900 Wp soon ) , connected to a 720 Ah battery bank and an inverter - battery charger , which serves my second ( low power ) ring main .
The inverter / charger is a Powermaster 1.5 kW pure sine wave inverter which can take a 240V mains input , or can run off the batteries and solar PV in the absence of mains electricity .
It was originally designed for use aboard boats , and so we just use the grid as our ‘ shore power ’ equivalent .
Interesting to think of our home as a ship afloat at sea when we are running off - grid !
Our PV panels are currently two Schüco 165 Wp polycrystalline panels – the next stage will see an additional 165 Wp Schuco panel plus a 200W Kyocera polycrystalline panel , bringing our installed capacity to 695 Wp .
The 30A solar controller on the inverter / charger can take up to 1kWp of solar , so even then there will still be room for another 200 - 300 Wp of PV , as long as we can find the roof space for it !
In the summer the system will run for around a week at a time before the batteries need to be recharged from the mains .
Further PV addition should improve this so that it runs pretty much constantly over the summer months .
In the winter when the PV is n't generating as much , the batteries can be charged from the mains and in UPS mode the inverter will switch over to the batteries during a power cut , which will last us for 3 days or so , giving us desk lamps , TV ( using a laptop and TV card ) , central heating pump , solar pump and general electrical gadgetry which makes life much more bearable during a power cut .
The only things we can't use during a power cut are the heavy - duty kitchen appliances .
The fridge can be plugged into the off - grid ring main during a power cut with an extension reel .
Batteries and inverter .
Water and Sewage
We have only made fairly basic water efficiency improvements at Green Cottage - the installation of two water butt in the garden holding around 450 litres , a dual - flush toilet and spray nozzles on the bathroom taps all help to reduce water consumption .
We do have a dishwasher and a washing machine but they are both ' A ' rated for energy and water efficiency .
Studies have shown that dishwashers make more efficient use of water and electricity than washing up by hand , and we have a manual ‘ wonder washer ’ for clothes which we can use during power cuts .
Our dishwasher is a very new model , and the instructions give details on how to connect it up to make use of solar - heated hot water .
However , we tend to use our solar hot water for baths and showers only , so the dishwasher is actually connected to the cold water supply in our case .
Not ideal , but with British summers the way they are , we need all the solar power we can get just for washing ourselves !
Insulation
We have had the standard 250 mm of loft insulation installed under a Scottish Power discount insulation scheme a few years ago - most utilities offer these schemes under the Government 's Energy Efficiency Commitment .
You can find out which are the cheapest schemes in your area by telephoning your local Energy Efficiency Advice Centre on 0800 512 012 .
Unfortunately our house does not have a wall cavity and so we can't install cavity wall insulation .
We have no intention of getting external insulation done - far too expensive !
The nice thick Accrington brick walls of our home give a good thermal mass though .
Summer Cooling
The high thermal mass of our old house helps to keep it cool in the summer .
We are lucky in that our living room is on the North - facing side of the house , but houses the wood stove which heats the house in the winter .
This arrangement means that in the winter , the living room is the warmest room in the house , and in the summer it is deliciously cool , even in the hottest weather .
The high thermal mass of the house means that the North side stays very cool , like a larder , even whilst the back of the house is baking in the midday sun .
Lighting
All the lights in the house are Compact Fluorescent Lamps , otherwise known as energy - saving bulbs .
We tend only to use low - power desk lamps rather than the ' big light ' in each room .
As the desk lamps run from the solar PV / battery system , this means that we get free electricity to run the house 's lighting , and also that we have lighting even during a power cut .
Appliances
All appliances are energy efficient appliances , under the European rating system .
The kitchen appliances are ' A ' rated , with the exception of the fridge , which although old is still working .
Rather than scrap it and buy a new one , we invested in a ' Savaplug ' , which regulates the motors on old fridges and reduces their energy consumption .
We watch television on a laptop computer with a LCD monitor , and a TV card , which uses very little electricity .
The same computer doubles up as our stereo CD player and DVD player , which means we have very little entertainment technology clutter .
Even with 100 % electric cooking , our electricity bill is very low , typically around £ 5 - 6 weekly .
One measure we have recently taken to cut our electricity consumption is a flat - bottomed kettle to go on our wood stove – electric kettles use huge amounts of electricity , and our £ 3 aluminium stove - top kettle from Ikea will hopefully make a significant difference to our electricity bill !
The Garden
Although just a small terraced house back garden , ours is crammed with food plants , biodiversity and storage areas .
Our back garden is South - facing , and has been planted up according to Permaculture design principles .
A huge variety of perennial fruits and berry plants are crammed into a small area , with an additional raised bed for growing annual vegetables .
Perennials include : strawberries , blackcurrants , redcurrants , whitecurrants , blueberries , a grape vine , apple tree , pear tree , raspberries , cranberries , blackberries and hazelnuts .
We have tried a variety of different things in the raised beds – the most successful to date have been carrots , pak choi , tomatoes ( although we have had problems ripening them as they grow against an East - facing wall ) , French beans , onions , potatoes and a pumpkin which we have just harvested .
We also had a butternut squash plant in the miniature greenhouse which did very well , although the pot it was in turned out to be too small for it in the end .
A storage space for logs , a bunker for kindling , a small lean - to greenhouse and a table and benches for enjoying the sun are all crammed into this typical small terraced house back yard .
Space has even been found for a network of four small wildlife ponds and wildlife areas amongst the food growing , and the garden has a significant population of frogs , which is good because slugs and snails are a big problem .
We use copper ‘ slug rings ’ to try to keep small plants safe , but it ’s a constant battle , and I may well try other approaches in the future such as beer traps .
Conclusion
It has taken a good few years to get from standard gas - heated end - terrace to low - carbon eco-cottage , a lot of hard work , improvisation and a reasonable chunk of hard - earned cash , but we love the end result .
The old gas combi used to really struggle to heat the house , but the wood stove system warms the brickwork through , and we are really cosy .
It 's also great not having to use any kind of heating in the summer , as the solar hot water system provides us with a cylinder full of free hot water , and even the solar pump runs on free electricity .
I 'd like to thank Powerswitch for the inspiration , help and encouragement provided on their forums .
There 's nothing quite like relaxing in a hot bath knowing it has been heated free of charge by the sun , and free veggies from our back garden taste so much better than from the supermarket .
A couple more PV panels and we will be finished .
And then , we might start looking for a small patch of woodland for our next project ...

Christopher Soghoian says :
Ever since TSA 's creation after 9/11 , passengers willing to undergo a pat - down and hand - search have been able to fly without ID .
This rarely discussed , and little used right was documented by the courts in Gilmore v. Gonzales .
While mostly just a way to assert your rights , the technique often had the added benefit of allowing the traveler to skip to the front of the security line .
With little warning , on Thursday , TSA announced a new change in policy .
Passengers who refuse to show ID , citing the rights , will be refused entry to the boarding area .
Passengers who claim to have lost or forgotten their ID will still be allowed to fly .
This new rule seems to only apply to terrorists that are unable to lie , while at the same time , massively cutting into the rights of passengers .
Barack Obama 's pioneering status is inspiring to some voters , and discomfiting to others , and the way in which race is discussed may push voters toward or away from him .
Race issue moves to center of campaign
Given the historic presence of the nation 's first major - party African - American presidential nominee , it was likely inevitable .
But now the combustible issue of Barack Obama 's racial identity has been thrust squarely into the heated political battle of the 2008 race .
Obama Wednesday warned voters that John McCain or his allies would try to " scare " them with his race , and McCain campaign manager Rick Davis responded furiously on Thursday , accusing Obama of playing the race card .
Advertisement
Davis 's statement came just a day before McCain 's planned address to one of the nation 's premier African - American groups , the Urban League , Friday morning in Orlando , a forum likely to keep the debate heated into the weekend .
Behind the accusations from both sides in the last 24 hours lies a furious battle to frame the racially charged conflict many in both campaigns have been girding for and to find effective ways to blame the other campaign for any unpalatable racial subtext to a race that — in theory — could actually show the better angels of America ’s nature .
Both sides face risks and opportunities : Obama 's pioneering status is inspiring to some voters and discomfiting to others , and the way in which race is discussed may push voters toward or away from him .
McCain could benefit from discomfort with race or he could — like Hillary Rodham Clinton , his predecessor in battling Obama — be distracted and ultimately diminished by constant charges of racism , accurate or not .
McCain aides say their goal is to pre-empt what they believe is Obama 's effort to paint any conventional campaign attacks as race - based .
Obama ’s aim , in the view of the McCain camp : " to delegitimize any line of attack against him , " said McCain aide Steve Schmidt .
He said he saw that potential trap being sprung when Obama predicted in Missouri Wednesday that the GOP nominee would attack the Democrat because he " does n't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills . "
" I do n't [ care ] whether it helps or hurts us , " Schmidt said .
" A lie unresponded to becomes the truth . "
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said McCain 's campaign was " misinterpreting " both the " tenor and the meaning " of Obama 's words .
" I think they should probably be a little less paranoid about parsing every word we say and a little more focused on actually addressing the challenges that Americans expect the president of the United States to take on , " he said .
To campaign watchers , in fact , Obama 's warning Wednesday seemed less a direct attack on McCain than as part of a running effort to cast all attacks on Obama in the worst possible light : as products of ignorance at best and bigotry at worst .
But Schmidt said McCain had learned the lesson of Clinton 's campaign , which began by taking her and her husband 's affinity with African - American voters for granted but wound up seeing days and weeks consumed by racially charged gaffes and allegations , ranging from a New Hampshire supporter 's suggestion that Obama had dealt drugs to Bill Clinton 's own comparison of Obama 's campaign to the Rev. Jesse Jackson's .
Remarkably , in fact , Schmidt sees a sort of political soul mate in Bill Clinton .
" Say whatever you want about Bill Clinton , " Schmidt said , " but it 's deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of Obama was race - based .
President Clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject .
Every American should be proud of his record as both a governor and president .
But we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a President of the United State of their own party . "
A former chief strategist to Hillary Clinton , Howard Wolfson , echoed Schmidt 's comparison .
" I think the McCain camp watched our primary on the Democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very , very harmful for a candidate 's prospects , " Wolfson said on Fox News Thursday , adding that the allegations against Clinton were unfair .
" They heard something that Senator Obama said and they felt they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics . "
Schmidt said McCain 's aides felt forced to talk about race , and that they do n't plan to do it again .
But the aftermath of this campaign flashpoint — which began with a McCain ad using Paris Hilton and Britney Spears to paint Obama as a preening rock star — indicated points were scored for the Republican side .
Obama 's campaign quickly put out a statement Thursday retracting the candidate 's suggestion that McCain had improperly used race , and , while on a conference call with reporters , campaign manager David Plouffe declined repeatedly to revisit any aspect of the question of race .
" We were n't suggesting in any way he was using race as an issue , " Plouffe said of McCain , though he did n't explain how Obama ’s words could be taken any other way .
He also declined to engage speculation that McCain was responding so forcefully to highlight Obama 's race .
" I really ca n't speak to the McCain campaign 's motives , " he said .
A prominent Obama backer , Alabama Rep. Artur Davis , however , suggested an ulterior motive to McCain 's grievance .
" It 's ridiculous , it 's offensive and you have to wonder if there is a double motive for it , " he said , suggesting McCain was , in appearing to defend himself , trying to use race against Obama .
McCain aides said they 'd been on guard against charges of racism , anticipating the day the issue would arise .
Obama made similar comments last month at a fundraiser in Florida .
" And did I mention he 's black ? "
Obama asked , mockingly imitating what he predicted " Republicans " would say about him .
But , Schmidt noted , the comments , taking place at a Friday - night fundraiser with only a pool reporter and not long after the Democratic primary wrapped up , were not widely picked up .
And Obama did n't specifically mention McCain by name — as he did on the campaign trail this week .
" He injected this yesterday , " Schmidt said .
" We are compelled to respond .
Tomorrow , if he does not do it again , we will not talk about it again . "
In addition to positioning themselves as having been forced to raise the issue only to knock it down , McCain 's campaign is also embracing the victim role in part to ensure that Obama can't seize it .
Specifically requesting that his emphatic point be included , Schmidt said : " We will not be smeared on this subject , period . "
Reiterating the point , McCain spokesman Brian Rogers invoked the specter of McCain 's bloody 2000 primary race .
" For a guy who has actually been the victim of attacks like this , with his daughter in South Carolina , that 's unacceptable . "
In the 2000 South Carolina primary , push polls suggested that McCain ’s daughter Bridget — whom he and his wife , Cindy , adopted from Bangladesh — was his own , illegitimate black child .
Republicans outside the campaign see another motivation on work by the GOP nominee .
After weeks of Obama driving the race on his terms , McCain is now trying to go on the offensive and not let the Democrat set the contours on what may be the defining issue of the campaign .
" I believe the McCain camp recognizes they need to define Obama and knock him on his heels every single day , " said Scott Reed , a Republican strategist who ran Bob Dole 's 1996 campaign .
" For a week he 's been on defense , " said Republican consultant Phil Musser of Obama .
" It 's the first time in a while — and he does n't like it . "
Democrats and Republicans traded accusations about who was trying to inject race into the campaign .
" These are the politics of Nixon and Atwater — it 's transparent , it 's indecent , and it 's most of all it's a sign of desperation , " said Jim Jordan , a Democratic consultant , adding that McCain 's charge that Obama was playing the race card was a straightforward attempt to highlight Obama 's race .
" I assume this is what passes for cleverness in the hapless McCain campaign — that they think somehow it seems less racist to call Obama a racist . "
A Republican strategist said , on the contrary , that Obama was introducing race to rally his core supporters .
" Why should it be any surprise ? " asked GOP strategist Chris LaCivita .
" The Democrats have always used race to motivate their base .
This year would be no different . "
To put such traditionally red states with significant black populations such as Virginia , Georgia , North Carolina and Missouri in play , LaCivita said , Obama must boost black turnout to unprecedented levels and motivate liberal whites .
" The only way he gets to that ?
Inject race into the campaign . "
One certainty : With Davis ' stinging accusation , McCain 's aides brought race to the foreground of a campaign where the issue has never been far from view .
" It 's a very dangerous game , " said Doug Schoen , a Democratic pollster .
" It 's unpredictable what it will do . ”
The next step , Schoen said , might well be “ a step downward . "

Many nursing mothers who have been hospitalized for breast abscesses are afflicted with the " superbug " methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA , but according to new research by UT Southwestern Medical Center physicians , conservative treatment can deal with the problem .
The study focused on hospitalized women with mastitis , and showed that MRSA was much more likely to be found in those who had both mastitis ( an inflammation of the milk glands ) and abscesses ( pockets of infection ) .
" The take - home message is that a patient with mastitis does not necessarily need an antibiotic against MRSA , " said Dr. George Wendel , professor of obstetrics and gynecology and senior author of the study , which appears in the September issue of the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology .
" She will improve with a less specific antibiotic as long as she also empties her breasts , either through feeding or pumping , and if there 's an abscess , gets it treated . "
The study also showed that if a nursing mother has an abscess , she does not immediately need antibiotics against MRSA , but can be switched to them if tests reveal she has MRSA .
The study was designed to determine which antibiotic treatment is best for severe cases of mastitis , which can be caused by clogged milk ducts with or without infection , and breast abscesses , which are caused by bacterial infections , generally by aureus .
There are many strains of staph , one of which is MRSA .
Treating mastitis or breast abscesses immediately with powerful drugs that fight MRSA carries a risk of creating even more antibiotic - resistant strains of staph , Dr. Wendel said .

" The physician can take the time to test the patient to determine what kind of bacteria she has , " Dr. Wendel said .
" We found that you 're not going to put the patient at a disadvantage if you start her on antibiotics while you wait for culture results , then switch her to more powerful medication if she has MRSA . "
The study involved 136,459 women who delivered at Parkland Memorial Hospital between 1997 and 2005 .
Of those , 127 were hospitalized with mastitis , which tends to strike younger women having their first child .
The researchers found that about 59 percent of the women with both mastitis and abscesses had MRSA , while only 2 percent of women with mastitis alone had MRSA .
Because the study tracked women who had been hospitalized , there is no way to know whether this proportion is the same in women treated for mastitis on an outpatient basis , Dr. Wendel said .
MRSA is resistant to many antibiotics , but the researchers found that even in cases when the exact cause of the mastitis or abscess had not yet been determined , and the women initially received antibiotics that do n't affect MRSA , all eventually recovered completely .
During the study , when tests showed that a woman had MRSA , she was switched to vancomycin , an antibiotic effective against it .
About 2 percent to 10 percent of all nursing mothers develop some sort of breast inflammation such as mastitis , the researchers said .
Symptoms of mastitis include unexplained fever and deep soreness or swelling in one breast but not the other .
In contrast to mastitis , an abscess is caused by a localized infection , which causes pain in a specific area that can feel hot to the touch and appear red on the skin .
" Women should seek medical care if they have any symptoms or concerns for breast infections , " said Dr. Irene Stafford , resident in obstetrics and gynecology and lead author of the study .
Other UT Southwestern researchers involved in the study were Drs. Jennifer Hernandez and Vanessa Laibl Rogers , both assistant professors of obstetrics and gynecology ; and Drs. Jeanne Sheffield and Scott Roberts , both associate professors of obstetrics and gynecology .

Yet for the right patients , methadone can be a godsend .
Alexandra Sherman , a patient of Dr. Heit ’s at his Fairfax , Va. , clinic , suffered for years from hip and shoulder pain that “ felt like somebody stabbing me with a knife , ” she said .
Pain began to rule and ruin her days .
Dr. Heit gave her OxyContin and later , because it seemed to work better and because of the expense , switched her to methadone .
Her insurance at one point covered only $ 500 in prescriptions , which paid for just one month ’s worth of OxyContin , compared with methadone ’s cost of $ 35 a month .
Methadone “ has given me my life back , ” Ms. Sherman said .
But Dr. Heit did not just throw drugs at her problem .
He told her that she would also have to try physical therapy as well .
They signed a contract listing mutual obligations  she would follow directions , he would be on call .
He starts patients at low doses , makes them bring in their pill bottles so he can count how many are left , and may give urine tests to deter mixing drugs .
Some doctors , like Dr. Theodore Parran of Case Western Reserve University , also require methadone patients to give them the names of relatives or friends they can call from time to time .
But not all doctors have taken such precautions .
Tony Davis , a contractor in Victorville , Calif. , had just turned 38 in 2004 when , after years of migraines and back pain , he saw a new pain doctor in his Kaiser Foundation Health Plan .
The doctor , who had already given him the sedative Xanax , prescribed methadone because of his continued pain .
The second day on the two medications , Mr. Davis said , “ I ’m feeling really weird , ’ ” recalled his wife , Pebbles Davis .
The two lay down for a nap and when she woke up , her husband was dead .
Ms. Davis recalled that the coroner had told her , “ Given the medicines he was on , his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump . ”
The case went to an arbitrator , who ruled that although Mr. Davis had overused his drugs in the past , the doctor had failed to warn him about the new risks of starting methadone together with Xanax and that the care was substandard .
Ms. Davis was awarded more than $ 500,000 .
“ I never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband , ” she said .
( Money Magazine ) --
There was something odd about the commercial , but it took me a little while to put my finger on it .
This not - too - young , not - too - old , not - too - hip hipster with sideburns is talking about his credit - card company .
Seems it has a new Web site that helps him plan how he 'll pay off his balance - someday .
The ad has the bright , soothing tone of a spot for , say , Lipitor or Advair .
Credit - card debt is presented as if it 's just another of those unfortunate but manageable conditions that a lot of people live with .
And that 's the surprise .
Are n't credit - card ads supposed to be about all the awesome stuff you can buy ?
Here 's a lender all but admitting that many of its customers live beyond their means .
We 've come a long way , babies , when even the credit - card marketers are talking about Americans ' chronic debt .
If you read this magazine , chances are you have your itch to spend mostly under control .
But that does n't mean you should n't worry about your neighbor 's wobbly balance sheet .
The personal savings rate in this country , which was above 10 % in the early 1980s , has fallen to almost zero .
That savings could have been seed corn for future economic growth ; instead , we 've been relying on capital from abroad .
Overextended borrowers are behind the still - unfolding mortgage crisis .
Besides all that hardheaded economic stuff , a pervasive spendthrift culture makes it that much harder to teach our kids good money habits .
Or for that matter , the general life skill of delaying gratification .
Now some smart folks are calling to bring back an old - fashioned virtue : thrift .
What 's needed are more institutions , both private and public , to encourage everyday savings , says Barbara Dafoe Whitehead of the Commission on Thrift , a project of an ideologically eclectic group of think tanks .
" Institutions build in ideas about what is and what is not smart to do , " she says .
Your local bank or S&L used to cheerlead for thrift - remember Christmas clubs ? - but that was before the financial industry discovered the charms of interest - only liar loans .
Of course , the government already spends a lot to get people to save .
IRAs and 401 ( k ) s cost the Treasury more than $ 100 billion a year in forgone taxes .
Trouble is , high - income people , who 'd probably save anyway , capture most of that benefit , according to a Tax Policy Center study .
And retirement is just one important kind of savings .
There 's rainy - day money .
Or saving for a future purchase instead of pulling out the MasterCard .
Here 's one really simple plan to reach all kinds of would - be savers : Make U.S. savings bonds ridiculously easy to buy .
Peter Tufano of Harvard Business School observes that the government has actually eliminated its marketing budget for EE and I bonds .
Yet these are very effective savings tools , especially for the younger and lower - income savers that banks are n't trying to attract .
( Bet you did n't know this :
It 's not uncommon , Tufano has found , for banks to turn down people for a basic savings account if they 've bounced checks in the past . )
Tufano and Princeton 's Daniel Schneider have proposed adding a line to tax forms so you could get part of your refund back in bonds .
Aside from the convenience , this would send a signal that Uncle Sam thinks saving is a good thing to do with your refund .
Another idea is to sell savings bonds in retail stores , perhaps in the form of gift cards .
My grandmother would have loved that .
Tufano has also been studying a wilder notion .
How about combining savings and lotteries ?
" The average household spends $ 514 a year on lotteries , " says Tufano .
" That 's more than they spend on dairy products . "
In Britain , savers can buy bonds that enter them in a lottery in lieu of paying interest ; they 're quite popular .
Whitehead likes this idea too , although I suspect mostly for rhetorical purposes .
" The lottery infrastructure is so perfect , so well designed for capturing the extra buck or two , " says Whitehead .
She 's calling attention to the vast sums that government already spends selling the hope of luck .
It 's time thrift got its own marketing campaign .
SAN FRANCISCO – Here along Market Street , heavily tattooed bicyclists with too many piercings in too many places weave through traffic , ducking subway steam vents , trolleys , motorists and a sea of jaywalkers .
They 're bike messengers – a fixture in most large cities – slinging satchels stuffed with legal documents , blueprints , executives ' lunches and eviction notices .
But the internet is gaining on these roadsters faster than they can pedal their fixed - gear , brakeless bikes .
In a world where documents travel by e-mail and the web , and electronic signatures are legally binding , the business of moving physical wood pulp from point A to point B is struggling .
Anecdotes from the Big Apple to San Francisco and parts in between suggest the click of a Send button is undermining the bike - messaging trade .
In the last two years , three messaging companies in San Francisco have folded .
Courier service Bucky's of Seattle trashed its bike fleet last year .
And there are nearly 1,000 fewer bike messengers in New York than a decade ago .
" There is really not much left .
It 's dying , " says Matt Flores , co-owner of Wheels of Justice , a San Francisco courier service .
Flores recently halved his full - time bikers – " document clerks , " as he calls them – from eight to four .
His top runner earns $ 50,000 a year , he says .
By far the biggest broomstick through the spokes of the bike messenger comes from the nation 's court systems and their embrace of electronic filing .
The millions of pages of paperwork generated by trial lawyers were once the bread and butter of bike messaging .
Now about half of the U.S. state courts have some form of electronic filing .
And under guidelines adopted by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts , an electronic filing system is now available in about 99 percent of the nation 's federal courts .
Federal bankruptcy courts went electronic beginning in 2001 , followed a year later by the district courts .
Federal appellate courts started following suit in 2005 .
The last holdout was the nation 's largest federal appeals court , the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco , which began testing an electronic filing system in January .
While many district court judges still demand paper " courtesy copies " of some filings , which are usually hauled by bike messenger , many state court systems are moving online completely , according to the National Center for State Courts .
In California , home to one of the world 's largest judicial systems , electronic filing is expected to be mandatory statewide by the end of the decade .
" We 've seen about a 30 percent decline in our use of bike messenger services , due largely to electronic filing , " says Kevin Livingston , a spokesman for Thelen Reid , a nationwide law firm .
Years ago , phone books in the nation 's largest cities were shot through with page after page of courier - service listings .
Now the phone book itself is obsolete .
" The total pie of courier services has been shrinking , " says Christine Chan , a co-owner of Urban Express in New York , which contracts with hundreds of bike messengers .
" Obviously , the need for couriers to carry items is declining . "
But bike messenger Lon Cook of San Francisco , like many others in the business , is philosophical .
He says there will always be a need for bike messengers in big cities , even if their backpacks are n't as full as they once were .
" First we had the fax machine and now e-mails , " says Cook .
" There 's always something new .
A bike messenger is part of the scenery in the road . "
Fergus Tanaka , a five - year veteran now riding in San Francisco , shares Cook 's optimism .
" What is really necessary for the industry is adaptation .
Clearly , if we branch out to other realms and other parts of the economy that need transportation , bike messengers can stick around for another 50 years , " the 28 - year - old says .
It 's a lifestyle , he adds , like no other .
There 's a reason , he says , that messengers ' bodies are often pierced and inked – that their hairstyles are often improved with helmet hair .
" There 's a freedom associated with bike messaging , " the tattooed Tanaka says .
" Nobody requires me to wear a suit and tie to work .
They just want to make sure you can ride a bike and know where you are going . "
The dangers of the job are obvious .
And then there are the lesser - known perils .
" We used to have this one run .
I called it the piss run .
You went around to different homes where elderly people lived , to collect their samples , " he recalls .
" I went to this one lady 's house , threw it in my bag and , when I got back , I reached in my bag and my hands were all wet .
There was piss all over my bag . "
The internet , he says , ca n't do what he does .

Black journalist suspects racial profiling by McCain campaign David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday August 5 , 2008
Print This Email This
At a McCain campaign event on Friday , one senior reporter for a local Florida paper , the Tallahassee Democrat , was ordered by a member of McCain 's security detail to leave the media area outside McCain 's bus .
Another reporter who asked why he was being removed was also made to leave .
Although the reporter , Stephen Price , is black , a McCain spokesperson insisted that " race had nothing to do with it " and said that Price was standing in an area reserved for the national press corps .
He could not explain why no other local reporters were moved out of that area .
Price appeared on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann on Monday and provided more details of the incident .
" It was pretty odd that I 'm the only black reporter , " he stated .
" All of the other reporters were white .
... I was told because I was not national that I had to be removed .
Did n't make sense to me . "
Price noted that prior to his ejection he had done nothing to call attention to himself and that the first sign he had of trouble was when " a gentleman in a brown suit came and asked me what I 'm doing here .
I show them my credentials .
...
He asks me , ' Are you national ? ' ...
A Panama City police officer comes to me with his gun , with his hand on his holster , asking me what 's going on , and this thing starts gaining momentum pretty quick . "
" We could n't find any other national reporters in the area at the time , " Price continued .
" My friend , the writer from the Palm Beach Post , said , ' Well , Stephen , you 're guilty of being black while reporting . ' ...
This guy had to know that we all were n't national , because ... he had to be familiar with them .
So if he did n't recognize me , well , he surely could n't recognize the other reporters there also . "
Olbermann said he had not been able to get the McCain campaign to comment on the incident , but he saw it as further evidence of a change in McCain 's campaign style compared to eight years ago .
" In the 2000 presidential campaign , John McCain 's openness to reporters and their access to him underscored the image McCain wanted to advance as a straight - talking , honest maverick , unscripted , unafraid , uninterested in having consultants micro-manage his statements , " Olberman noted .
" What , then , does that say about McCain today ?
His access and openness are gone . "

The Big “ I ”

Impeachment is once again back in the news and once again not on the table for the Democratic leadership , although it sounds like Nancy Pelosi might be willing to talk , even if it is now almost too late :
Pressed on ABC ’s “ The View ” about whether she had unilaterally disarmed , the author of “ Know Your Power : A Message to America ’s Daughters ” said she believed the proceedings would be too divisive and be a distraction from advancing the policy agenda of the new Democratic majority .
Then she added this qualifier : “ If somebody had a crime that the president had committed , that would be a different story . ”
That assertion only threw fuel on the impeachment fire as advocates of removing Mr. Bush cited the 35 articles of impeachment compiled by Representative Dennis Kucinich , Democrat of Ohio , as well as accusations in a new book by author Ron Suskind of White House orders to falsify intelligence , an accusation that has been denied .
Kucinich , you crazy little bastard , God love ya !
But as the story points out , the Democratic leadership absolutely does not want any part of an impeachment battle :
Despite whatever resonance pursuing the president might have in progressive Democratic circles , it is not the message Democrats want to carry into an election where they need to appeal to swing voters to increase their Congressional majorities and win the White House .
They would rather devote their final weeks to pushing economic relief and health care , even if they thought Mr. Bush and the conduct of the war merited impeachment hearings .
And leading Democrats argue anyway that Mr. Bush has already been tried and convicted in the court of public opinion .
“ He has been impeached by current history , ” said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois , chairman of the House Democratic Caucus .
“ He is going down as the worst president ever .
The facts are in . ”
To me , that is not enough .
I think there needs to be a bitchslap in the historical record to let future generations know that what this president and this administration did were wrong and unamerican and violate almost everything we are supposed to believe in .
Our Founding Fathers created the system we knows as “ checks and balances ” in order to try and ensure that no one branch of government – especially the executive branch , whose constitutional powers are very , very weak indeed – gain too much power over the other branches .
Everybody has their reasons why the president and vice president should be impeached , from the false intelligence in the rush to war , the PATRIOT act , outing undercover CIA agents and then lying about it – the list goes on and on .
My personal favorite reason is the signing statements the president abuses in order to sign laws approved by the people ’s representatives while explaining why they do not apply to him or why he is not going to enforce them .
It is this reason why it is important to make sure that even if we have decided just to bury out heads in the sand for the next four months and pray that president stupidpants does n’t start any more wars , future generations – and the next president , be it McCain or Obama – must know that this consolidation and abuse of power must not stand .
Thankfully , Dennis Kucinich ( the crazy little guy with the big ears and ridiculously hot British redhead model wife ) has never let go of this issue and every now and again another lawmaker gets on board .
It is for the future that we must not allow the imperial presidency of George W. Bush to become the norm .
While it is agreed an impeachment proceedings would definitely gum up the works for the remainder of this term – and could even have dire effect in the November election ( and it ’s impossible to know which of the two parties would catch the brunt of that backlash … ) – it is absolutely the duty and responsibility of Congress not only to reclaim their constitutionally recognized powers but place a permanent check and balance on this presidency .
It ’s unfortunate that Bubba was impeached for such a stupid reason as lying about getting his wang mouthified because the country ’s distaste of that event has convinced lawmakers that Americans would sour on any impeachment , even one as justified as outing an undercover CIA agent – a felony if you or i did it .
According to the Constitution , the president and vice president may be impeached for “ high crimes and misdemeanors , ” a purposefully vague phrase .
But as we have pointed out before , Alexander Hamilton , one of th authors of the Constitution , further explained impeachment in Federalist Papers # 65 :
The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men , or , in other words , from the abuse or violation of some public trust .
They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL , as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself .
( the emphasis on “ political ” is Hamilton ’s )
We are running out of time .
There are less than than 160 days left the Bush Presidency and unless we make a point of saying this will not stand , future generations might assume we were OK with what these scumsucker screwheads did .
And I do n’t want that on my conscience .

Better Late Than Never
If I had to choose between George W. Bush , naked and neighing on all fours while being ridden around the Oval Office by a spurred cowgirl Condoleezza Rice , or enduring his shredding of domestic and international law to wage an illegal war and bilking of the country on behalf of his corporate backers , I could learn to stomach a wide array of sexual escapades .
Let our elected leaders and candidates have quick homosexual encounters in airport bathrooms , bring as many hookers as they want to their hotel rooms , and screw around with their campaign staff as long as they exhaust their libidos on lusts other than war , torture and economic mismanagement .
Adolf Hitler , after all , was an abstemious and monogamous vegetarian who loved his German shepherd .
But , unfortunately for us , and hapless politicians like John Edwards , our press finds it more lucrative to report salacious sex scandals than the death and maiming of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians , although the mainstream press showed , for once , a remarkable restraint until Edwards was forced to confess .
We hear more about pricey hookers and the bathroom code of cruising homosexuals than the revoking of habeas corpus , the use of torture as an interrogation technique , and the plundering of our country by rapacious corporations .
Television dominates our news content , and its ethical standards hover around those of the National Enquirer .
The press has become our arbiter of personal morality .
Have an affair and they will trap you in the middle of the night in a Los Angeles hotel bathroom ; they will dig up the escort you met in a Washington hotel room and splatter your private foibles across television screens and news pages .
These stories gratify our prurient fascination with illicit sexual liaisons .
They are part of the blurring of news with the tawdry world of reality shows and television entertainment .
They produce titillating rituals of public humiliation and disgrace .
They also lacerate the secret guilt of those who have felt or acted upon lust while in committed relationships .
It is all Jerry Springer , all the time .
Reporters often know the sins of which they speak .
They can shame John Edwards , Eliot Spitzer , Larry Craig and Bill Clinton and then head off to a hotel bar to do the same thing .
The moral lapses of our media inquisitors , which I witnessed for over two decades as a reporter , can be as reprehensible as the behavior of those they cover .
I do not trust or believe most politicians .
I have covered too many .
The question is not how we can get good people to govern .
The question is how we can limit the damage of mostly mediocre , callow men and women , who comprise the majority of those who yearn for power , from doing the most harm .
This comes through the rigorous checks and balances of a functioning democracy , not self - appointed political saviors .
But we always prefer saviors , those who make us believe they have attained moral and heroic summits that elude us .
There is something sad and pathetically human about Edwards ’ affair and his cowardly attempt to lie about it .
I never liked Edwards .
He is all flash and sparkle with his boyish $ 400 haircuts and oily sincerity .
He preached a faux populism , one at odds with his record in the Senate , to sell himself to voters .
But , even as I do not condone what he did , I feel sorry for him .
He is being crucified by journalists and politicians , and a public , who often behave no better .
We demand that our politicians play superhuman roles .
They cannot exhibit the weaknesses and temptations we carry within ourselves .
They must appear to be perfect parents , wives or husbands .
We insist that they behave like the idealized couples we watch on television or in the movies .
Campaign appearances , with the dutiful spouse as prop , are scripted mini-dramas .
We live in a society so saturated in lies that we can no longer distinguish between a married couple in a sit com and on the campaign trail .
Bill and Hillary continue to act out their sham roles of committed husband and wife .
And , despite all the evidence to the contrary , people continue to believe in the Clintons ’ charade .
Political leaders no longer need to be competent , sincere or honest .
They only need to appear to have these qualities .
The most essential skill in political theater , which has no room for knowledge or debate or trust , is artifice .
Those who are most able to entertain , that is , to deceive , succeed .
Those who cannot play these roles , like Ralph Nader , are pushed to the sidelines .
There are worse things done by politicians than illicit sexual adventures .
Ask an Iraqi .
Ask an Afghan .
Ask a detainee at Guantanamo .
Ask an unemployed steelworker in Ohio .
But in an age of images and entertainment , in an age of instant emotional gratification , we do not want honesty or even reality but the reassurance of old clichés , stereotypes and mythic narratives .
We want leaders who are willing to pretend they live in a make - believe world of happy couples and perfect relationships .
We want to feel that they like us and we want to like them .
This gives us what television gives us , a simplistic narrative around which to frame our lives .
This narrative defies the messiness and disorder of the real world .
If politicians adhere to this ridiculous narrative of personal happiness and fidelity , designed to reassure us that the world is ordered and neat and constant , they can commit egregious war crimes and strip us of our power .
If they do not we will find better actors .
Edwards ’ dishonesty does not compare to Bush ’s impeachable crimes .
But Edwards ’ political career has been cut short , unlike Bush ’s , because he had the bad luck to get caught out of character behind the curtain .
( CNN ) --
The young Afghan girl sits in the center of the room , weeping .
Using her hand and her blue scarf to hide her face , she recounts how she was brutally raped by five gunmen .
The 12 - year - old girl , gang - raped in Afghanistan , weeps as her family demands justice .
The girl 's tragic case is one of many in war - torn Afghanistan , activists say .
The 12 - year - old girl 's family members say they 'll take their own lives unless justice is served .
" We will all commit suicide ; this is not living , " cries the mother of the girl , whose gang - rape occurred in Northern Afghanistan .
The girl 's adolescent voice pleads for help from Hamid Karzai , the president of Afghanistan .
The girl 's elderly and immobilized father trembles and can only raise a quivering hand as he sobs .
He is rendered helpless in a country where a man 's dignity and honor is protecting his family .
Her little brother sits in the back , far too young to understand the situation but still traumatized by the devastated cries around him .
He wipes away his tears .
The children 's mother sobs .
" We 've been violated .
We can't live our lives .
We ca n't sit .
We can't sleep at night , " she says .
Video of the crushed family aired on the privately owned Ariana TV two weeks ago before it was posted on the Internet by an activist group , the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan .
In a country riddled with corruption , despair and lawlessness , the family has risked their lives by coming forward .
They have since met with Karzai , according to an aide who said the president wept with the family and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice .
Karzai has fired the police chief from the city where the attack occurred , the aide said .
The family lives in a government - provided safe house in Kabul , Afghanistan .
" This is just an example among thousands of other cases , " says Shaima , a member of RAWA .
" The rest go unnoticed by the media . "
Shaima is not her real name ; she uses it to protect her identity .
RAWA members themselves have often been targeted for raising taboo issues in a culture in which women and children are often treated as second - class citizens .
" Women and girls , especially young girls , are the most unprotected people of Afghanistan .
They are raped , kidnapped and murdered , " Shaima says .
Just last week , a 3 - year - old girl was kidnapped and raped by unidentified men , a government official confirms .
The toddler was later released and , the official says , is recovering .
" Rapists are roaming around with impunity , " Shaima says , turning her attention to a man -- said to be the son of a powerful official -- who is accused of raping 22 girls in the northern province of Sar - I - Pul .
Sayed Nurallah says his 14 - year - old daughter was one of the aforementioned victims .
Nurallah says that coming forward with his daughter 's story makes him a target , which he firmly accepts .
He says that seeking justice for his daughter is a matter of integrity .
" She wakes up in the middle of the night screaming , " Nurallah says of his daughter .
" Her arms , legs , her body -- she is always tense and frightened . "
Nurallah also pleads for justice .
" I have one question for Mr. Karzai :
If this was your little girl , what would you do ? "
His firm tone changes to one of grief .
He breaks into quiet sobs .
" I just want justice for my child , " he says .
Shaima says justice is hard to find .
" These criminals are never brought to justice , because police and government authorities are either involved or they can't handle the crimes , " she explains .
" With criminals and warlords in the political scene , we cannot expect justice to be served . "
Another factor that impedes victims from coming forward is some interpretations of Sharia , or Islamic law .
Some authorities rule for a rape to be validated , victims must have four witnesses to the crime .
If not , the victims can be charged with fornication or adultery .
Statistics quantifying crimes against children are hard to come by in Afghanistan , an impoverished nation ravaged by three decades of war .
In March , the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission said that deteriorating security in large parts of the country , a growing culture of criminal impunity , weak law enforcement institutions , poverty and other factors had contributed to increasing violence against women , such as rape and torture .
The commission also said that Afghan girls are often forced into marriages against their will .
Radhika Coomaraswamy , the U.N. special representative for children in armed conflict , plans to release a report in October on the state of Afghan children .
Coomaraswamy went to Afghanistan this summer to establish a monitoring and reporting system on what is deemed as grave violations committed against children .
" In many cases of violence against children , there is a sense of impunity .
People continue to violate children 's rights without any sense of feeling that they will be held accountable , " Coomaraswamy said .
She found that sexual violence against young boys is also a problem .
In what is known as " bacha - bazi , " or " child 's play , " boys are forced to dress in female attire , dance and perform sexual acts .
" I can't think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in Afghanistan , " Coomaraswamy says .
" In all our meetings with children , it takes a lot of time to make them smile .
That to me shows that there is not happiness in their hearts . "
She hopes that the monitoring program will deter people from taking advantage of the vulnerability of children in the combat zone .
Coomaraswamy does concede that the Afghan government alone cannot do much right now .
" War has completely destroyed that administrative infrastructure , " Coomaraswamy says , " even if they had the laws , it is impossible to implement . "
All About Afghanistan • Afghanistan War
Adm Mullen said the results of war in Iran would be unpredictable America 's top military officer has said opening up a new front in the Middle East through a strike on Iran would be " extremely stressful " for US forces .
Adm Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was commenting on the likelihood of US or Israeli military action over Iran 's nuclear programme .
Tensions have risen amid reports Israel could be planning a possible strike against Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Iran denies its nuclear programme is anything other than peaceful .
The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says it has been clear for some time that Adm Mullen does not want to attack Iran .
But his latest remarks suggest he is fighting hard behind the scenes for both the US and Israel to think carefully about the consequences of an attack before considering mounting it , he says .
This is a very unstable part of the world and I do n't need it to be more unstable
Adm Mike Mullen
At a US defence department news conference , Adm Mullen refused to say what Israeli leaders told him during meetings last week about any plan to strike Iran .
But he warned that opening up a third front , after Iraq and Afghanistan , would be " extremely stressful , very challenging , with consequences that would be difficult to predict " .
Asked if he was concerned Israel would strike before the end of the year , he said : " This is a very unstable part of the world and I do n't need it to be more unstable . "
The admiral said that if a conflict began , he believed Iran would have the capability to disrupt ship traffic through the strategic Strait of Hormuz , a waterway near the Gulf , but he would not say if the US Navy was stepping up its patrols in the region .
He said : " I believe [ Iran is ] still on a path to get nuclear weapons and I think that 's something that needs to be deterred . "
Iranian leaders say their nuclear intentions are peaceful He added : " My position with regard to the Iranian regime has n't changed .
They remain a destabilising factor in the region .
" But I 'm convinced that the solution still lies in using other elements of national power to change Iranian behaviour , including diplomatic , financial and international pressure . "
He called for dialogue between the US and Tehran .
Adm Mullen 's boss , US President George W Bush , has also been asked about recent speculation that there might be a military strike on Iran .
The president has said all options were on the table but that military action would not be his first choice .
His senior soldiers will be pleased to hear it , our Washington correspondent says .

Nodding donkeys and oil rigs could become a more common sight
At first glance Britain 's green fields and ancient woodlands have little in common with deserts of Saudi Arabia or the Texas plains - but the oil deep beneath parts of the UK could be the next frontier in the bid to beat the energy crisis .
A record number of prospectors are scouring scores of sites across the East Midlands , Yorkshire and a swathe of southern England .
The dizzying rise in oil prices over the past year to above $ 147 a barrel has made even the smallest pockets of oil and gas commercially viable .
Environmentalists fear drilling for oil will ruin some of Britain 's most beautiful landscapes but the government and oil companies say that it will help secure the UK 's energy supplies amid a global grab for oil .
" Indigenous resources are becoming more important for security of supply , " says Mark Abbott , managing director of Egdon Resources , an exploration and production firm that operates an oil field in the Lincolnshire Wolds .
Tiny but growing
The UK's onshore oil industry is still tiny compared to production in the North Sea but is attracting the attention of companies from as far afield as the US , Australia and Canada .
In May , the government awarded a record 97 new licences to 54 applicants for onshore oil and gas exploration .
Five years ago , only eight licences were granted .
Hampshire - based Egdon Resources obtained six of those licences , allowing the firm to prospect for oil and gas in Dorset and the East Midlands .
Mr Abbott says a typical UK oil field will contain one million to 10 million barrels of oil .
" It 's not Saudi Arabia or even the North Sea .
" But if we find oil , it 's quick and easy to put in small , low - key production facilities and then tanker the oil out to refineries , " he says .
' Prolonged process '
The company has proven reserves of one million barrels of oil - worth around $ 118 m ( £ 63 m ) at today 's prices and nine million barrels of " contingent reserves " - reserves that in the company 's opinion have a more than 50 % chance of production .
There is a huge global grab for energy going on .
We 've got to make sure that Britain is protected ; that we have the energy we need
Malcolm Wicks , Energy Minister Despite the potential bonanza it 's a tough business .
The firm , which was established in 1997 , is loss making and only saw its first sustained oil production in the second half of last year .
Total revenues from oil sales in the six months to January 31 totalled £ 758,000 .
" It 's a prolonged process - developing the ideas , applying for the licences and finding partners .
The first three or four years we were quite resource constrained . "
Self - sufficiency
The UK has a long history of oil production .
Onshore drilling in the East Midlands proved vital to the war effort during World War I and the discovery of oil and gas in the North Sea in the late 1960s allowed the UK to become largely self - sufficient in the two resources .
But this is changing .
The UK became a net importer of gas in 2004 and is expected to become a net importer of oil by 2010 as production in the North Sea declines from its 1999 peak of about 2.9 million barrels a day .
Building and maintaining offshore platforms is costly and as fields mature there are fears that the return will no longer be enough to cover costs and make big profits .
Drilling onshore costs a tenth of the £ 10 million to £ 20 million needed to drill an offshore exploration well , making even small reserves of oil highly profitable at today 's high prices , says Egdon 's Mr Abbott .
" We can operate at $ 30 to $ 35 a barrel ( of crude ) .
Offshore , only the biggest companies could operate at that level , " he says .
' Global grab '
The government is keen to encourage companies like Egdon to exploit the UK 's energy resources .
UK OIL PRODUCTION - KEY FACTS
The UK produces 1.6 million barrels of oil a day Onshore makes up just 1.5 % of this The biggest onshore oil field is BP's Wytch Farm in Dorset .
It produced 7.6 million barrels of oil last year , around 85 % of the UK 's total onshore production .
Source : BP , BERR " The era of cheap energy is well and truly dead and therefore Britain would do well to get its energy from sensible places and think imaginatively about where those places might be , " Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks told BBC 's Newsnight .
" There is a huge global grab for energy going on .
We 've got to make sure that Britain is protected ; that we have the energy we need . "
Energy companies , which must pay an additional 20 % levy on top of corporation tax , are also big contributors to the Treasury 's coffers .
According to industry group UK Oil and Gas , the sector paid £ 7.8 bn in taxes in the 2007 - 2008 financial year and this is forecast to jump to between £ 12.5 bn and £ 16.5 bn next year depending on the direction of oil prices .
Environmental fears
But not everyone shares the government 's enthusiasm for exploiting the UK 's resources .
Environmental groups have been angered by West Sussex County Council 's decision to give permission to Northern Petroleum to drill an exploration well near Chichester .
There are fears that oil production could harm the environment
The site in Markwells Wood is part of the South Downs and a designated area of outstanding natural beauty .
Jacquetta Fewster , director of the South Downs Society , says the drilling would lead to the destruction of trees and hedgerows and the visual impact of the drilling tower and its lighting would be " inappropriate " .
" It 's very quiet , full of wildlife when you walk along the footpaths , you 'll often come a across a deer , " she says .
" Drilling for oil is n't compatible with a place that should be for quiet contemplation and getting away from urban life . "
Dallas - style boom ?
Northern Petroleum says that it will minimise the environmental impact and stresses the economic benefits of oil production .
" It is our opinion that 100 million barrels of oil or even more is recoverable from the UK South of England alone , possibly more , " the company says .
" This would be advantageous to the country , not just for the creation of jobs in the haulage and service maintenance sector for example , but also ... in adding a large amount to the chancellor 's purse and reducing the UK 's energy deficit . "
Industry experts say fears of a Dallas - style oil boom in the UK are overstated given the small size of onshore reserves .
The UK has just 0.3 % of the world 's proven oil reserves and the lion 's share of these are still under the North Sea .
But while oil prices remain above $ 100 a barrel , it seems certain that nodding donkeys and drilling rigs will become more commonplace among Britain 's hedgerows , coppices and wheat fields .

Nose comes with a handy option to generate profiling stats .
To profile your code , create a test dedicated to this purpose and run it with the right options :
$ nosetests -- with - profile -- profile - stats - file stats .pf test_performance
This will run the tests that corresponds to the test_performance name and generate a stats .
pf file .
Nose uses hotshot , so if you want to generate a file that can be read directly by the pstats module and all the statistics tools out there , you need to convert it using the hotshot . stats module .
From there , there is plenty of tools that can transform such a file into a visual graph .
Most of the time , they use Graphviz to render a graph , by generating a file dot can read .
This software is most of the time easy to install through a binary distribution on your system .
If you need to compile it … good luck .. 😉
Anyway , from there , I use gprof2dot , which renders a nice graph with meaningful colors .
From the author :
If you want to use it , I have created some console scripts for conveniency , you can install using easy_install :
$ easy_install pbp.scripts
It creates a gprof2 dot script you can use , following the author documentation , but also a hotshot2 dot script that will convert automatically a statistics file and pass it to gprof2dot :
$ hotshot2dot / path/to/my/hotshot/file
This will print in the output a dot file , you can send to the dot program , using a pipe :
$ hotshot2dot / path/to/my/hotshot/file | dot - Tpng -o output.png
You will get the visual result in output.png .
The authorised Facebook Scrabble launched in July
The developers of the popular Facebook application Scrabulous have suspended the game for some users following legal action by toy maker Hasbro .
The application has been disabled for users in the US and Canada .
Hasbro , the makers of Scrabble , are suing the Calcutta - based founders of Scrabulous , claiming they are infringing its copyright and trademark .
Hasbro had asked Facebook to block access following the launch of its own official version of Scrabble .
A spokeswoman for Facebook told the BBC that the final decision to suspend the game was made by the developers , not the site itself .
Defence campaign
Scrabulous has been one of the most popular applications on Facebook , regularly racking up more than 500,000 users each day .
Fans have mounted a vigorous defence campaign since the joint owners of Scrabble , Mattel and Hasbro , announced their intention to sue the Facebook developers back in January .
In a statement , Facebook said that " games are an important part of the social experience on Facebook " and they hope that the dispute will not discourage other developers from testing new ideas .
" We 're disappointed that Hasbro has sought to draw us into their dispute , " it said .
" Nevertheless , we have forwarded their concerns to Scrabulous and requested their appropriate response . "

Let me begin by saying “ I am so not a gadget guy . ” I do n’t have an iPhone .
Heck , I did n’t have a cellphone at all until April when I joined Percona as a consultant .
I do n’t ooh and aah over other people ’s gadgets most of the time .
I do n’t have , you know , that kind of envy .
I ’m sure you see where this is going : I got a gadget and I think it ’s really cool .
Anyway , my wife and I have a bunch of computers ( desktops and laptops ) and we had been feeling the pain for a long time : the files were only on one computer , and we wanted them available .
I built a file server and then realized that it was going to be really expensive in terms of power alone , so I went back to USB drives for backups , and kept thinking about it .
After a long time I decided to buy an HP Media Vault and install ultra - low - power , oversized disks in it — I did that , and will write about it elsewhere .
And then I discovered that it has a media server in it .
And not being a gadget guy , I had honestly never heard about these things before .
Really .
I read up on it a little bit and decided hell , sharing files is nice , but I have about a thousand CDs that could go on this thing , and my wife has hundreds too .
That ’s even better than file sharing !
I copied the music from her iTunes library to the shared Music folder on the server and boom , Rhythmbox magically saw it all .
I could n’t believe I ’d never heard about this before .
Best thing since sliced bread .
I even had all my music ripped already to my iRiver HD340 .
In OGG format .
And then I found out the HP Media Vault does n’t support OGG format .
Boo ! Boo! Rubbish !
Filth !
Slime !
So I fixed that .
Now I ’ll show you how .
Disclaimer
If you try what ’s on this page and something breaks , it is your fault , not mine .
I make this information available without any warranties or representations .
The basics : log into the server
The HP documentation for the Media Vault is totally incomplete and assumes you want to install their GUI program and control the thing from your Windows desktop .
There ’s a much better way .
The Media Vault has a full - featured web interface .
Log into the web console .
I ’m going to assume that your HP Media Vault ’s DNS name is hpmediavault , so you can log into it with this URL .
Once you do , set the admin password to secure the server .
Remember it .
The next fun thing : the server runs GNU / Linux and has SSH enabled by default .
Yes , that ’s right : you can just SSH into the thing !
The password you set in the previous step is now your SSH password .
Your SSH username is root , no matter what you set the admin username to .
Next , open up a terminal and SSH right in :
ssh root@hpmediavault
Type the password you chose in the previous step .
You should see the following :
baron@kanga : ~$ ssh root@hpmediavault root@hpmediavault 's password : BusyBox v1.01 ( 2008.02.08-22:41+0000 )
Built - in shell ( ash ) Enter ' help ' for a list of built - in commands .
- sh : ca n't access tty ; job control turned off #
As you can see , the server runs with a stripped - down set of command - line tools called BusyBox .
You ’re golden .
Let ’s get working on installing OGG and FLAC support .
This will not be hard at all if you can use a command - line editor .
Step 1 : install ipkg
Behind the scenes , the Media Vault ’s media streaming is provided by Firefly , formerly known as mt - daapd ( DAAP is the iTunes server protocol ) .
This is a Free Software media server , and it ’s highly capable .
But the version that ships on the device is old and does n’t support OGG .
You ’re going to fix that by installing a newer version .
But first , you have to install a package management system that will install the newest Firefly software for you .
The package management system is ipkg , the Itsy Package Management System .
It ’s really easy to install .
First , let ’s see where your hard drives are mounted :
# mount / dev/md6 on / share / 1000 type ext3 ( data=writeback )
If yours is n’t / share / 1000 , use a different value in the following commands .
Now you want to make an installation directory and change to that directory :
# mkdir -p / share /1000 / tmp && cd / share /1000/tmp
Now let ’s find the installation image to download .
Go look here for the latest version of the image :
http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optware/cs05q3armel/cross/unstable/
Search for “ hpmv2- bootstrap ” on that page .
You should find a file something like this : hpmv2-bootstrap_1.2-4_arm.xsh .
Copy the link location for that , and go back to your command prompt .
Now download the file to the Media Vault , substituting the correct URL into the command below :
# wget http://ipkg.nslu2-linux.org/feeds/optware/cs05q3armel/cross/unstable/hpmv2-bootstrap_1.2-4_arm.xsh
And now , just execute it :
# sh ./hpmv2-bootstrap_1.2-4_arm.xsh
You should see “ Setup complete ” when it ’s done .
That ’s it .
It installs itself and mounts the installation directory as / opt , which is where all your software will appear in the future .
This will persist after a reboot .
You can see the changes with the mount command :
# mount / dev/md6 on / share / 1000 type ext3 ( data=writeback ) / share /1000 /.optware on / opt type ext3 ( rw )
Before you move on , update its cache of available software :
# ipkg update
I got this installation procedure from the Yahoo group on hacking the Media Vault .
Step 2 : Install Firefly Nightly
I was n’t able to determine whether the latest stable Firefly release has OGG streaming enabled , so I installed the latest nightly release .
At some point in the future I ’m sure a stable release will have it , but I breathed a prayer to Saint Hewlett and installed the nightly , following instructions I also found on Hacking the Media Vault .
Fortunately it seems to work fine for me .
Here ’s how I did it :
# ipkg install mt - daapd -svn
Pretty easy .
After you do this , it will download a bunch of things and install them until it says “ Successfully terminated . ”
Now you need to configure it .
You probably noticed that the installation said “ To complete this installation , make any necessary changes to the config file in / opt/etc/mt- daapd/mt-daapd.conf , and start the daemon by running / opt/ etc / init.d/S60mt- daapd ” .
Here ’s how to do that .
# vi /opt/etc/mt-daapd/mt-daapd.conf
If you like a different editor , feel free to use it .
I like vi .
Here are the lines that you need to change :
mp3_dir = / share / 1000 / Music servername = HPMediaVault extensions = .mp3,.m4a,.m4p,.ogg,.flac
I ’m assuming you are keeping the defaults , as I did on mine .
All my music is in the Music share , I want to keep the same server name ( what shows up in iTunes / Rhythmbox ) , and I want to add .ogg and .flac to the extensions Firefly will index and stream .
Step 3 : Stop the built - in server , start the new one
Next you need to stop the built - in media server and start the one you just installed .
Here ’s how to see what ’s running :
# ps -eaf | grep daap 32530 nobody 1096 S < /usr / sbin / mt - daapd 32531 nobody 1984 S < /usr / sbin/mt-daapd 32160 root 488 S grep daap
There are two processes running .
This is normal .
Let ’s stop them :
# killall mt - daapd
If you now run the ps command above , you should n’t see anything running .
You can start the new server :
# /opt/etc/init.d/S60mt-daapd
Now you should be able to see the daemon running :
# ps -eaf | grep daap 32681 nobody 3796 S / opt / sbin/ mt - daapd -c /opt/etc/mt-daapd/mt-daapd.conf 32682 nobody 4512 D /opt/sbin/mt-daapd -c /opt/etc/mt-daapd/mt-daapd.conf 32703 root 488 S grep daap
Notice that it ’s a different binary running — not the one in /usr / sbin .
At this point you ought to be able to start up your favorite music player ( iTunes , Rhythmbox ) and stream OGG and FLAC files from the media server .
Test that before you go on to the next little bit .
Step 4 : Change which media server starts on boot
There ’s one last little detail .
If you shut down your Media Vault and restart it , the old media server will start instead of the new one .
The GNU / Linux variant on the Media Vault does n’t have any nice init scripts , so I had to hunt around to find out how to do this .
After a bit of poking , I found that the /etc / inc / func_daapd.inc script has the start and stop commands .
The startup process for the Media Vault is written in PHP , oddly enough .
Here are the relevant lines :
144 $ ret=mwexec ( " /usr/sbin/mt-daapd - k " ) ; 147 killbyname ( " mt - daapd " , " " ) ; 162 $ ret=mwexec ( " /usr/sbin/mt-daapd " ) ;
I commented them out and changed them to
143 $ ret=mwexec ( " / opt/etc/init.d/S60mt-daapd - k " ) ; 144 # $ ret=mwexec(" /usr/sbin/mt-daapd - k " ) ; 161 $ ret=mwexec ( " / opt/etc/init.d/S60mt-daapd " ) ;
162 # $ ret=mwexec(" /usr/sbin/mt-daapd " ) ;
Notice I did n’t change the killbyname command , since once it is started the binary has the same command name as the old one did .
I tested restarting the Media Vault and after restart , it was working OK again .
I do not know whether the built - in command to reset the media server will work with these changes ; I suspect not .
But if you want to do that , you can log in and do it from the command line .
Conclusion
If you followed the steps I listed above , your Media Vault ought to be serving FLAC and OGG files in WAV format to your music player ( audiophiles , rejoice : your FLAC is not downconverted to MP3 ! ) .
After doing this , I have to say I think this piece of equipment is pretty darned awesome , and I ’m really happy I bought a low - power , quiet , small , fun gadget that I have full control over .
And I have n’t even talked about sharing files yet !
That ’ll be another post .
Postscript
A few miscellaneous things I ’ve learned :
The default mt - daapd configuration file does n’t have a defined rescan_interval .
This means it ’ll never notice when you add music to your filesystem .
But you can poke it via the web interface ( http://hpmediavault:3689/index.html ; the username is empty , the password is defined in your config file ) to make it update .
Also , and I ’m not sure how well this works , there ’s an option to gzip the list of songs , which might make startup quite a bit faster when your iTunes / Rhythmbox connects and gets the song list .
This is documented in the config file too .
Update : I ’ve been running my server this way for a while and it seems to run fine .
Django snippets : RequestFactory .
I ’ve been wanting this for ages ; when I finally got around to writing it it turned out to only be a dozen or so lines of code .
Makes it easy to create mock request objects in Django , which you can then use for testing view functions directly ( bypassing the current test client mechanism which requires views to be assigned to a URLconf before they can be tested ) .
IP - address ( Internet Protocol Address ) — is a unique numeric identifier ( address ) of a device ( usually computer ) , connected to the Internet .
Each device ( computer , laptop , dedicated server , mobile phone , etc. ) on the Internet has its own IP - address .
Since you are currently connected to the Internet - it means that your computer also has its own unique address on the network .
But you can be connected to the Internet through a router or gateway in your local network .
In this case , your computer from the Internet visible with the same IP address , which has your router or gateway .
IP addresses can be static ( when provider assigned a permanent address to the user ) , and dynamic ( if the provider gives you the IP address from the pool of free addresses on DHCP when you are connecting ) .
Static IP - address provides possibility to organize permanent access to the same computer through the time .
Vice versa , when is used dynamic IP there is no guarantee that using the same address the same device will be accessed .
As far as personal computers usually do not require permanent access , providers assign to such users dynamic IPs .
Dynamic IP assignement gives a way to save address space for providers and gives them an ability to serve more clients with the less address space .
That 's why obtaining static IP from provider costs some additional money to the regular paymants for Internet access .
In addition , built on the basis of virtual hosts computer can act as multiple devices with the multiple IP addresses and sites .
For example , web hosting services on the Internet .
So , as you can see there could be situations when to one computer multiple IP - addresses are assigned .
Usually in such cases it is assignements of several static IPs , but in some situations it is could be a mix of static IPs and dynamic IPs on a different network interfaces of the computer .
Knowledge of your IP address allows to provide an access to services and programs on the computer ( games , chat rooms , FTP , remote access to desktop , etc . )
For today there are two different types of IP - addresses used ( in the terms of technical protocols ) - IP v4 and IPv6 .
Federal authorities have scheduled a press conference for Tuesday afternoon amid reports that a fortunate traffic stop by Aurora Police may have disrupted an assassination attempt against Barack Obama .
KUSA -TV is reporting that two men have been arrested on weapons charges after the traffic stop early Sunday .
The first man , identified by the station as Tharin Gartrell , 28 , was charged with suspicion of being a felon in possession of a weapon after police found two rifles , a high - powered scope and methamphetamine in his car after the traffic stop .
When police accompanied Gartrell to his hotel in Glendale , a second man jumped from a window and was injured in a four - story fall , according to the station .
That man was then arrested , but has not been identified by police .
Federal authorities are refusing to comment about why they believe the case is possibly tied to an assassination plot , but scheduled a news conference for 4 p.m. Tuesday .
Late Friday night Google solved the third Gmail outage of the past two weeks , but questions remain about the stability of the Webmail service , which is affecting the Google Apps hosted software suite .
Like the previous two outages , the latest one occurred as a login error that locked users out of their accounts .
This time , some users were prevented from accessing their accounts for more than 24 hours .
All three outages affected not only individual Gmail users but also people who use it as part of the Google Apps suite of collaboration and communication applications .
Google acknowledged the Gmail problem Friday and said it affected " a small subset " of the service 's users .
The company did n't immediately comment about what is causing the recurring login problem , nor did it provide a more specific figure for the amount of Gmail users affected .
The long outage was painful for several Google Apps users contacted via e-mail .
Denmark 's chapter of Fair Allocation of Infotech Resources ( FAIR ) , an international nonprofit group , just started using Google Apps .
When the outage hit , system developer Benjamin Bach was showing the suite to his colleagues , ahead of the planned launch of FAIR Denmark 's Web site this week .
The outage lasted more than 24 hours .
" Seeing such a long outage during the very first few days makes us wonder if a free solution provided by Google is actually ' pro ' enough for us .
We cannot correspond with schools in Africa or partners in Denmark and afford being out - of - mail for a whole day , " Bach said .
FAIR , based in Norway , is devoted to supplying computer products to developing countries .
The Denmark chapter is just getting off the ground and expects to grow its Apps user base from four people to up to 20 .
Google Apps comes in versions , including Basic and Education , which are free , and Premier , which costs US $ 50 per user per year and includes additional functionality , a 99.9 percent uptime guarantee for Gmail , and phone technical support .
" I can give them a lot of credit for providing a free service , but they lose some of that when saying ' your e-mail is totally inaccessible , and we 're not going to tell you why or for how long . '
It 's arrogant .
I 'm a system administrator , so I deserve to know a little more , " Bach said .
Indeed , Google seemed slow to address this latest outage .
The first problem reports started appearing in the official Apps and Gmail discussion forums on Thursday afternoon U.S. Eastern Time .
However , Google did n't acknowledge the problem in the forums until almost 5 p.m. on Friday , more than 24 hours after the first reports appeared .
Google declared the problem solved shortly after 10 p.m. on Friday .
Also out for more than 24 hours was Howard Feldstein , chairman of the Mexico chapter of Democrats Abroad , the official U.S. Democratic Party organization for American expatriates .
" We 're quite busy leading up to the convention .
I have relied on Gmail not only for e-mail but for my primary contact list and was totally isolated for more than a day , " he said .
Abhishek Parolkar , an IT consultant in Bangalore , India , also lost access to his Google Apps Gmail account for more than 24 hours , which disrupted important billing messages from clients .
Sadie Upchurch , president of Glinting Communications , a public relations firm near Atlanta , was affected for about 15 hours .
" I was on client deadlines and had to work around for re-routes and resends of e-mails from those clients , " she said .
" I do remind myself that I 'm not paying for the service and that there 's a level of patience and adequate backup you 've got to have when you 're getting something for free , " she added .
Still , it 's common for organizations to try out Google Apps via its free Basic version before considering a move to the fee - based Premier edition , so a wobbly e-mail component is unlikely to entice anyone to upgrade .
Google serves all of its Gmail users , from individuals to Google Apps Premier account holders , from the same infrastructure , so Gmail outages hit all types of users indiscriminately .
The suite , even in its free version , is geared at workplace use and designed for employee collaboration , which is why it contains calendar , word - processing , spreadsheet , presentation and Web site creation applications .
For that reason , it 's unlikely that Google would consider several lengthy Gmail outages in a span of two weeks as the norm for Apps .
After all , Google has aspirations that Apps will grow its very small presence among large enterprises , which demand high performance and availability levels from their software .
Apps is currently used mostly by small organizations .

But among its millions of clips is a treasure trove of rare and fascinating arts footage , lovingly posted by fans .

You may prefer Rudolf 's Swan Lake duet with Miss Piggy ( also on YouTube ) .
But a more traditional pas de deux with Margot Fonteyn from Prokofiev 's Romeo and Juliet delivers a glimpse of Nureyev 's sublime physicality as a dancer ; the balcony scene in particular gives him plenty of room to flex his muscles , with lifts and leaps aplenty .

Pina Bausch 's Bluebeard ( Barbe Bleue ) , 1977
Posted ( in 12 parts ) in its entirety , Bausch 's ' tanztheater ' piece based on Bartók 's opera Bluebeard 's Castle is typical of her assault - on - the - senses style of choreography .
A meditation on male - female relations perhaps , the piece is interspersed with snatches of Bartók 's opera , features a stage carpeted with dry leaves and a cast of 28 , and opens with a scene of repeated attack / ravishment .
Disturbing and engrossing in equal measure .

Apparently Holiday used to break down every time after singing ' Strange Fruit ' .
Seeing her perform it here ( five months before her death ) , with that agonising , cracked voice of hers , you understand why .
She invests so much in it .
Based on a poem about the lynching of two black men in the American South ( ' strange fruit hangin ' from the poplar trees ...' ) the song , which she originally recorded in 1939 , went on to become her biggest hit .

Supposedly drawn by a group of animators for a private party in honour of fellow animator Winsor McCay ( an inspiration to Walt Disney ) .

The Seashell and the Clergyman , 1928
Less well known than that other surreal benchmark Un Chien Andalou , which followed a year later , this work based on a screenplay by French auteur Antonin Artaud is nonetheless considered the first surrealistic film .
The story covers the erotic fantasies of a priest lusting after a general 's wife .

Marlene Dietrich 's screen test , 1929
In this screen test for the role of cabaret singer Lola Lola in The Blue Angel , Dietrich steps on to a piano , kicks out a leg , rolls up a flesh - coloured stocking and jauntily wends her way through a rendition of ' Wer wird denn Weinen , Wenn Man Auseinandergeht ? '
( ' Why Cry at Parting ? ' ) the toe - tapping title song from a popular German musical comedy .
Pure showmanship .

Film by Samuel Beckett , 1965
Shot in black and white , Beckett "s only cinematic project ( supervised by him but directed by Alan Schneider ) stars the aged Buster Keaton .
Entirely silent ( apart from an extended ' shh ' near the start ) , it 's a creepy tale about voyeurism in which Keaton tries to avoid being seen by an all - seeing eye .
So acutely unnerving it could be a horror film .

Jackson Pollock drip paints outside his East Hampton home , 1951
Though German - born photographer Hans Namuth did n't much rate Pollock 's work , he was fascinated by the man .
Having taken over 500 photographs of him already , he turned to film .
His resulting documentary captures the artist dressed head to toe in black , a cigarette hanging from his lip , drip painting on to glass .
Best of all is Pollock 's curiously droning narration : ' The method of painting is a natural growth out of a need . '

Andy Warhol 's Blow Job , 1963
Titillating or just plain dull ?
Warhol 's original black and white silent film stretches to all of 35 minutes and frames the face of a pretty young man ( DeVeren Bookwalter , who just happened to be lolling round the Factory that day ) while he 's fellated off screen by person or persons unknown .
This version lasts an adequate eight minutes .
Honestly , who 's got the time ?

Francis Bacon interviewed , 1985
About half way through this excellent South Bank Show on Francis Bacon , the interviewer Melvin Bragg and artist sit down to lunch .
In Bacon 's case that 's really a liquid lunch through which he proceeds to slur his way .
' Cheerio , ' he clamours , presumably meaning cheers , while topping himself up .
Then it's off to the Colony Room for more .
( ' I 'm not one of those made - up poofs ...' he toots at another punter ) .
Priceless .

Jean - Michel Basquiat interviewed by Glenn O'Brien , 1978
Basquiat , aka SAMO , was about to become a New York art sensation and all - round celebrity thanks in no small part to his regular appearances on this live public access show called TV Party .
Slapdash and piss - takingly earnest , it ran until 1982 and was hosted by Glenn O'Brien , also rock critic for Andy Warhol 's Interview magazine .
In 1981 O'Brien scripted a thinly veiled biopic ( about Basquiat ) starring Basquiat called Downtown 81 , a trailer for which is also on YouTube .

Marcel Duchamp's Anemic Cinema , 1926
Shot in Man Ray 's studio and officially the brainchild of Duchamp 's female alter ego Rrose Sélavy ( a pun on ' Eros , c'est la vie ' and my , how convincing Duchamp was in drag ) this hypnotic short film features a rapidly spinning disc on which a series of punning phrases appear .
As much spiritual meditation as work of Dadaist anti-art .
Man Ray 's dotty Le Retour à la Raison makes an interesting companion piece .

Bill Viola's The Reflecting Pool , 1977 - 1979
American video - artist Viola has carved out a very definite niche : ultra slow - motion films , imbued with an almost painterly quality , and often tackling twin issues of mortality and spirituality .
This early film fixes on a woodland pool and a man frozen mid-air over it .
With intimations of birth and death , it 's ultimately both creepy and moving .

Maria Callas in Zeffirelli's Tosca , 1964
First staged at the Royal Opera House in 1964 , Franco Zeffirelli 's production of Puccini's Tosca became a benchmark .
It 's rousing stuff , particularly with its original cast , Callas near perfection in the title role ( it was her last stage role before she retired in 1965 ) and good friend Tito Gobbi as Scarpio .
Callas used to say she had a ' love affair ' with the London public ; from the rapturous post - show applause you can tell it 's mutual .

Karajan conducts Beethoven 's Fifth , 1966
Of all the recordings made by the notoriously demanding Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan during his 35 - year tenure at the Berlin Philharmonic , you 'd be hard - pushed to plump for just one .
His renditions of Brahms , Bruckner , Strauss and Wagner amply show off his skill for extracting that agonisingly beautiful ' Karajan sound ' .
But for sheer edge - of - seat showmanship , Beethoven 's Fifth gets top billing .

Bernstein conducts West Side Story , 1985
When Deutsche Grammophon asked Leonard Bernstein to conduct a new version of his West Side Story , with every member of the orchestra and chorus hand - picked , it 's a shame he settled on opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa and Jose Carreras for the leads .
Maria and Tony ?
Not really .
This documentary about the recording still gives us plenty of Bernstein - jaunty , emotional and brilliant .

Glenn Gould 's The Art of the Fugue , 1980
Gould was one of classical music 's standout eccentrics and in this studio - based performance and commentary given by him ( aged 48 ) on the works of Bach , you see every bit of his strangeness ( and genius ) as a performer , with him hunched over his Steinway , muttering who knows what to himself .
Among the pieces he plays are Bach 's Fugue in E Major , Partita No 4 and Art of Fugue .

Stravinksy conducts the Firebird Lullaby Suite , 1965
The premiere of Stravinsky 's Russian folk ballet was performed by Diaghilev 's Ballet Russes in Paris in 1910 .
Young Igor was just 28 and Firebird was his breakthrough .
( Over the next three years Stravinsky , in collaboration with Diaghilev , came up with Petrushka and his masterpiece The Rite of Spring . )
Here he is at 82 , looking every bit his age , conducting the New Philharmonia Orchestra in London .
Marvellous .

According to the latest research , the popular energy drink Red Bull can increase the risk of heart damage .
The participants of the study were university students aged between 20 and 24 .
Researchers found that just one sugar free can of Red Bull raised the level of stickiness of the blood and could lead to the formation of blood clots .
The target market of the caffeinated drink is Austrian students .
After drinking a can of Red Bull scientists noticed that Austrian students had nearly the same cardiovascular profile as someone who has heart disease .
The company producing the drink denied the negative effect of Red Bull , which is , by the way , marketed in 143 countries around the world .
According to the company 's officials the drink passed several scientific tests that proved its safeness .
They noted that the drink was not banned in any country where it had been introduced .
But according to Dr. Scott Willoughby , of the Cardiovascular Research Center at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and Adelaide University , the results of the study were alarming .
" After one can it seemed to turn the young individual into one with more of the type of profile you would expect to see with someone with cardiovascular disease .
People who already have existing cardiovascular disease may want to talk to their physician before they drink Red Bull in future , " the scientist said .
The 30 students who passed the test were shocked by the results .
Previously some of them drank up to 8 can per night in order to stay awake to study .
Most of these students are now refusing to drink Red Bull , saying they will never consume it again .

But sometimes Hollywood slips one past us , giving us a supposed happy ending that is actually depressing as hell once you give it a little thought .
For instance :
6 Return of the Jedi
The " Happy " Ending :
The evil Emperor Palpatine hatches a plan to defeat the Rebellion once and for all by telling them the location of his unfinished superweapon and then telling them how to defeat it .
This plan goes about exactly as well as you would expect , and our heroes destroy the evil scourge with the help of some genocidal teddy bears .

Wait a Minute ...
That epic battle at the end there ?
That only destroyed one base and a fraction of the troops the Empire had at its disposal .
Sure , Vader and the Emperor were both blown up , but that would n't destroy the Empire any more than blowing up the Pentagon would dissolve the USA .
What it does do is create a horrific power vacuum , in an empire with fleets of Star Destroyers and millions of pissed - off troops roving around the galaxy ( even more pissed off if the payroll office and all of their checks were in the Death Star ) .
" So ... should we just keep being Stormtroopers , or what ? "
Soon these power - hungry military officers would no doubt form factions and destroy entire planets in their brutal attempts to seize power .
Eventually Palpatine would simply be replaced by a new Emperor , possibly even one competent enough to devise a plan that can't be foiled by developmentally stunted bears throwing rocks .

Sure , the Death Star was taken out , but that did n't exactly stop them last time .
Not to mention that by the time they reach phase twenty - six of their patented " Let 's just throw Death Stars at the problem until it goes away " strategy , [ below ] someone 's probably going to decide that maybe the ship does n't really need an unguarded , torpedo - shaped hole on the outside , thus allowing the Empire to swiftly conquer the entire universe .
The FBI 's " evidence " that Dr. Bruce Ivins was the anthrax killer is not very impressive .
Specifically :
" Authorities say that days before the 2001 anthrax attacks , Army scientist Bruce Ivins wrote an e-mail warning that Osama bin Laden had anthrax and had declared war on the United States and Israel .
Postal inspectors say the language in e-mails by scientist Bruce Ivins was similar to the words used in the anthrax letters that terrorized the nation in 2001 . "
- Ivins alleged communication was an e-mail , while the anthrax letters were hand - written , so it is impossible to match handwriting
- E-mails are notoriously easy to fake .
We 've all gotten spam which seems to be sent form our own address , since our email address has been " spoofed " .
Has the government authenticated the emails by subpoenaing his internet service provider 's records and by having independent experts authenticate that Ivins in fact sent them ?
- Bin Laden supposedly declared war on the U.S. and Israel in 1998 , years before Ivins ' alleged email , so his statement is not very incriminating
- Even if the language in the emails is similar to that in the anthrax letters ( I have n't seen the text from the e-mail ) , someone could have simply copied the style to frame Ivins .
the style to frame Ivins .
If Ivins were still alive , a good criminal defense lawyer would have a field day demolishing this kind of case .
Under fire for being a technophobe , John McCain will unveil a technology agenda that bundles previously announced pro-business proposals with continued support for a hands - off approach to regulation .
The plan , dubbed " John McCain and American Innovation , " is set to be released Thursday on the Republican presidential candidate 's campaign Web site .
It will call for a 10 % tax credit on wages paid to all research - and - development employees .
At the same time , it will reiterate Sen. McCain 's opposition to Internet taxes and new laws ...
Introducing our national nightmare
June 30 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
Via Maureen Dowd , writing for the New York Times on June 29 , 2008 :
Afterward , Carmella got her idol to autograph her sign , telling the smiling Hillary , “ You ’re going to be the next president . ”
She told The Times that she and her friends were all voting for John McCain and that Hillary was just doing what she had to do .
“ But I have a gut feeling , ” she said with macabre faith , “ that something ’s going to happen so that she becomes the nominee . ” [ emphasis added ]
Somebody PLEASE get the Secret Service and the FBI on this … it is her certainty that really seems to qualify her as the kind of psychopath to keep an eye on .
The op - ed ’s introduction of this lady was chilling enough :
Carmella Lewis , with her Hillary T - shirt and Hillary placard , came all the way from Denver to make sure there would be plenty of ambiguity , duality and ferocity in Unity .
Just as Hillary was testing out the unfamiliar familiarity “ Barack and me ” Friday and talking about “ his grace and his grit , ” Carmella began loudly booing and waving her sign .
“ We want Hillary ! ” screamed the 57 - year - old retired ad saleswoman and Clinton delegate .
… Carmella and her friends continued to cry , “ Nobama ! ” “ We love you , Hillary ! ” and “ We need Hillary ! ” as Barack Obama sat onstage … …
When it was Obama ’s turn to speak , Carmella announced loudly , “ I wish I had ear plugs . ”
Then , as Obama tried to ingratiate himself with the Hillary partisans in the crowd by saying that because of the New York senator , his daughters “ can take for granted that women can do anything that the boys can do and do it better and do it in heels , ” Carmella put her fingers in her ears .
As Obama tried to curry favor with Hillary , looking over at her sensible , sturdy shoes and marveling , “ I still do n’t know how she does it in heels , ” Carmella tore up a tissue and stuffed it in her ears .
When Obama pandered with a line about how he would n’t “ perpetuate a system in which women are paid less for the same work as men , ” she put her hands over her tissue - stuffed ears .
The twit is n’t impressed with Obama ’s comments about us gals and those heels we wear , but sees the comments as pathetic attempts to cater to a hostile audience that is determined to be swayed by nothing he could possibly say .
It seems a testament to the aggressively divisive campaign run by Hillary Clinton that her most rabid supporters now speak in vague terms of how they believe Hillary could still claim the Democratic nomination .
The Clinton campaign created a monster out of the rhetoric of victimhood , one that has apparently turned into something of a bloodlust for the destruction of our democratic process and a rabid anticipation of the kind of brutality enjoyed only by the most vicious of dictatorships .
CNN reporter criticizes TSA , finds self on terror watch list David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday July 16 , 2008

The post -9/11 airline watch list that is supposed to keep terrorists off of airplanes has swelled to more than 1 million names , including at least one investigative reporter who had been critical of the Transportation Security Agency , which maintains the watch list .
CNN 's Drew Griffin reported on the bloating of the watch list , which an ACLU count pegged at 1,001,308 names Wednesday afternoon .
Griffin's is one of those names , he says .
" Coincidentally , this all began in May , shortly after I began a series of investigative reports critical of the TSA .
Eleven flights now since May 19 .
On different airlines , my name pops up forcing me to go to the counter , show my identification , sometimes the agent has to make a call before I get my ticket , " Griffin reported .
" What does the TSA say ?
Nothing , at least nothing on camera .
Over the phone a public affairs worker told me again I 'm not on the watch list , and do n't even think that someone in the TSA or anyone else is trying to get even . "
The TSA , which is a part of the Department of Homeland Security , said Griffin 's name was n't even on the watch list , and the agency blamed the airlines for the delays the reporter experienced .
The airlines , on the other hand , said they were simply following a list provided by TSA .
While it would n't be much of a stretch for plenty of people to believe the TSA would exercise its revenge via watch - list meddling , an agency spokesman insists that just is n't the case .
" So if there 's any thought or shadow of a thought that TSA somehow put you on a watch list because of your reporting , " spokesman Christopher White said , " it is absolutely fabricated . "

Like much of the futuristic green building designs and great green architecture of today , the ugly redheaded stepchildren of the animal kingdom do n’t get much attention compared to the perennial favorite endangered animals like pandas , polar bears , and owls .
These are the cute , majestic , and otherwise emblematic creatures of the endangered species list .
But there are hundreds more animal species on our wondrous planet that are critically threatened and need both publicity and support .
From bats the size of bees to poison - slinging mammals , lizards that do n’t eat for a decade to seals with giant inflatable faces , here are the 25 strangest , most bizarre , unusual and important endangered species living on the “ EDGE ” ( Evolutionarily Distinct & Globally Endangered ) – and these are n’t even counting mind - controlling animal marvels or strange and amazing ancient animals now extinct !
1. Solenodon
No , it ’s not an ROUS .
The strange solenodon is a mammal found primarily in Cuba and Hispanola .
Sure , it looks cute and manageable enough – sort of like an over - sized hedgehog .
Too bad the solenodon injects rattlesnake - like venom through its teeth , the only mammal to do so .
Easily annoyed , the solenodon bites at the drop of a banana leaf .
Still , being both a carrion feeder and insectivore , it is a vital species in its ecosystem .
It was thought to be extinct until scientists found a few still alive in 2003 .
It is in grave danger of extinction .
2. Kakapo
This is not only the rarest , but the strangest parrot in the world .
Imagine a rather portly nocturnal bird that never flies , preferring to hike through hilly forest for miles every night .
It weighs in as the heaviest parrot in the world at 8 pounds .
Imagine this and you have the very real ( but virtually extinct ) kakapo .
A resident of New Zealand , which is home to a number of rare birds , there are only 62 kakapos remaining on earth .
( Bonus fact : New Zealand is full of unusual creatures .
It originally had no native land mammals , so its many unique birds evolved in unusual ways – which unfortunately has made them very vulnerable to mammals that were brought in during European colonization . )
3. Angler Fish
Some guys just ca n’t catch a break .
The male angler fish is 1/20th the size of the female angler fish .
The huge , traumatizingly ugly spiny fish with the glowing “ fishing rod ” lure you saw in Finding Nemo ?
That ’s the female .
The male is that tiny little blob attached to his horrific goddess that you never noticed .
He burrows in with his teeth and she “ feeds ” him ex-utero style until he eventually loses his eyeballs , then internal organs and finally his life .
By then , she ’s got his sperm so it does n’t matter .
Anglers are deep - sea fish , but that does n’t mean they ’re safe from threat .
Go on , have another look at these lovely ladies of the deep :
4. Leaping Lesbian Lizards !
Officially named Cnemidophorus uniparens , these American desert lizards reproduce despite the fact that they ’re all female .
Interestingly , some of them simulate sexual acts ( above , left ) with each other just like male and female lizards , and it ’s been discovered that when they do they reproduce more successfully than their abstemious sisters .
5 . The Kiwi
Everyone knows the beloved endangered kiwi is a flightless bird .
As if to make up for its winged impotence , the kiwi is actually a violent , temperamental little bird .
But its quirks do n’t stop there .
The only bird with whiskers is also distinctly dog - like in its ability to sniff out food and threats .
In fact , it has the most highly developed sense of smell of any bird , lifting its “ nose ” ( beak ) into the breeze to determine its surroundings , just like a dog would .
That ’s probably because kiwis are also the only bird to have prominent nostrils .
Contrary to popular belief , the kiwi does have wings , but they are tiny and difficult to detect under the loose , fluffy , hair - like feathers .
The kiwi has many other unusual characteristics : the eggs are relatively huge , being one - fifth the bird ’s weight ; kiwi pairs mate for life – as long as 30 years – but tend to have feisty relationships ; the females are larger and more dominant than the males .
In fact , daddy kiwis incubate the young while mom hunts – for an unheard - of 80 days , no less .
Did you know that kiwis are the smallest ratites on earth ?
Other ratites include ostrich and emu .
6. Olm
This unusual amphibian is blind , lives to 100 , and goes ten years at a stretch without food .
It lives in the subterranean waters of Italy , Croatia and Herzegovenia , where it skeeves out the locals with its strange , human - like skin .
Its nickname , in fact , is the “ human fish ” .
Unlike most amphibians , the olm lives in the water for its whole life .
Another oddity of the olm : its neotenic ( larval ) gills .
7. Bumblebee Bat
Winning the cutest .
bat. ever . award is the Bumblebee bat , which at its largest measures 1 inch .
These tiny mammals hover like hummingbirds and like all bats prefer caves and love feasting on insects .
They can easily perch on the tip of your thumb .
This tiny bat dwells in Thailand and is considered one of the 12 most endangered species .
There are fewer than 200 remaining .
8. Aye Aye
Sharing something in common with bats , aye ayes are the only primates of the mammal world to rely on echolocation for hunting .
The aye aye is a rather unusual cousin of us humans .
It lives in spherical nests with a small hole for entry and exit .
It uses its long , slender middle finger to tap on trees in order to find tasty insects – and it uses this same finger to scoop them out .
Perhaps it is due to its unusually - large eyes and ears that this unique , sensitive primate is believed to be a demon or a bad luck omen .
A native of Madagascar , it is often killed at first notice by the island ’s superstitious residents .
9. Hooded Seal
Males of this arctic seal species have both an inflatable skull hood and nasal balloon .
When aroused , angered or simply showing off , male hooded seals can inflate their sacs that are a foot or more in diameter .
The nasal balloon can be inflated through one or both nostrils and is bright red .
Unfortunately , due to global warming affecting the arctic environment , hooded seals are now considered by many scientists to be endangered .
10 . Echidna
The echidna is one of two egg - laying mammals in the world ( the other is the famous duck - billed platypus ) .
Though it looks a big hedgehog - like , this spiky creature is shy and non-confrontational .
The echidna has a long , moist snout and an even longer tongue which it uses to feast on termites .
It has no teeth , so it has to “ chew ” termites by crushing them between its tongue and mouth cavity .
There are actually 4 species of echidna , and along with the platypus , they are the only monotremes .
More on that in a moment .
11 . Monito Del Monte
The “ little mountain monkey ” of South America is not a monkey , but rather a marsupial , thought to have arrived from Australia long ago .
It ’s tiny – only about 5 ″ full grown .
They are nocturnal and carnivorous , and famous ( well , among scientists ) for their unusual tail , which can store enough fat to make this little pipsqueak double in size .
This allows them to go for long periods without food .
Sadly , the always - prepared monito del monte is in danger of extinction .
12 . The penguin with glowing yellow eyes
The yellow - eyed penguin , also native to New Zealand , is the rarest and strangest penguin in the world .
It can dive to an astounding depth of 400 feet , likes to feed 20 miles from shore , and prefers to nest in the forest rather than on the beach .
Penguin families tend to keep to themselves rather than congregate as most penguins do .
Because of shoreline deforestation , these unusual - looking penguins are at great risk .
13 . Duck - Billed Platypus
It ’s venomous .
It ’s got a duck ’s bill , and otter ’s feet and a mammal ’s body .
Oh , and it lays eggs .
No wonder Western naturalists were confused by the platypus when it was first introduced .
The platypus , along with the echidna , is a monotreme ( egg- laying mammal ) .
It ’s native to Australia and Tasmania where it was hunted to near - extinction during the 1800s for its fur , but has been protected since the turn of the 20th century .
Thought officially a protected species , the platypus is at risk because of poaching .
( In future posts we will explore the varying classifications of “ endangered ” and some of the associated controversy and disputes . )
14 . Ghost Frog
The flat - bodied ghost frog has special adaptations to allow it to inhabit rapid streams in South Africa ( as well as Skeleton Gorge , likely the reason for its spooky moniker ) .
The young have disc - like mouths to for a suction - like grip and adults have specialized disc - like toe pads to cling to rocks in the rushing water .
15 . Purple Frog
The purple frog is really purple .
But its brilliant hue is not the strange thing about it .
The purple frog spends much of the year living 13 feet below ground .
Also called the pignose for its snubbed nose , this western Indian - dwelling frog was only discovered in 2003 , in Kerala .
Locals had known about the purple frog for years , but scientists were skeptical .
Part of the reason purple frogs were difficult to find was simply due to the fact that they only come up for air for two weeks during monsoon season in order to mate .
16 . Dugong
The dugong is a cousin of the manatee and is closely related to the elephant .
The dugong is unique in that it has a split ( whale - like ) tail and will “ perch ” underwater on its tail in order to keep its head above water .
The dugong is thought to have inspired ancient myths about mermaids .
The dugong is threatened by poachers who hunt the animal for its meat , oil , skin and bones .
It is extremely endangered .
17 . Spring Hare
The bizarre spring hare had taxonomists scratching their heads for years .
It ’s been classified with jerboas ( jumping rodents ) , squirrels and even porcupines .
It ’s now classified on its own , and it resembles both a kangaroo and hare .
It has specialized short limbs with claws for digging as well as flexible ear flaps that can be used to seal off the ear canal to protect against the elements and debris .
It ’s also got a funny resting position that looks a lot like the yoga Dolphin post : it stretches its long hind legs forward and then rests its head and arms directly on the ground
18 . Sumatran Rabbit
That ’s not really its name ; it does n’t have one .
Meet the rarest rabbit in the world , which has only been seen twice in the last century at least .
Locals did n’t even know it existed .
The “ Sumatran rabbit ” is thought to be nearly extinct .
( Note : there are very few available images of this incredibly rare animal , and most are grainy at best – click here to view . )
19 . Sloth
The sloth belongs to the edentate family , which also includes anteaters , armadillos , and echidnas .
Most edentates are either threatened or endangered species .
There are a number of unusual facts about the sloth .
All sloths have three toes , but “ two - toed ” sloths only have 2 claws .
Sloths often hunt in packs .
They can actually move quickly and will slash with their large claws – the slow - moving behavior is to avoid predators like hawks .
They actually hang most of their lives .
Sloths typically have over 600 species of bacteria , plants and animals living on them at any given time , and will often feed on themselves when they are hungry .
( Algae is the main snack . )
Famously , these unusual creatures can rotate their heads 270 degrees .
Lore has it that sloths adore beer and are able to “ hold their liquor ” amazingly well .
20 . Choose
There are so many endangered and threatened animal species in the world it is hard to just pick twenty .
So , go ahead and read through lists of more and decide for yourself what the strangest is then drop back by and leave a comment with your thoughts .
Who knows , maybe the semi-aquatic hairless ape should make the list .

Advertisement Iran has test - fired nine missiles , including a new version of the Shahab - 3 , which is capable of reaching its main regional enemy Israel .
The Shahab - 3 , with a range of 2,000 km ( 1,240 miles ) , was armed with a conventional warhead , state media said .
Iran has tested the missile before , but the latest launch comes amid rising tensions with the US and Israel over the country 's nuclear programme .
The early morning launch at a remote desert site sent oil prices climbing .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe called on Iran to " refrain from further missile tests if they truly seek to gain the trust of the world " .
' Under surveillance '
Two other types of missile with shorter ranges were also fired as part of the Great Prophet III war games being staged by Iran 's military .
Brig Gen Hoseyn Salami , commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards ' air force , said : " Our missiles are ready for shooting at any place and any time , quickly and with accuracy .
" The enemy must not repeat its mistakes .
The enemy targets are under surveillance . "
The tests are intended to deter any Israeli or US strike against Tehran 's nuclear installations , says BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus .
Our correspondent - who is in Israel - says the country has a fully operational anti-ballistic missile system , which Israeli military experts believe can counter any Iranian threat .
But there is no room for complacency , he adds .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Why is it ok for Israel , the US and the UK to have WMDs or nuclear weapons but not for any other country ?
Mike , London , UK On Monday , an adviser to Iran 's Supreme Leader said it would retaliate to any military attack by hitting the Israeli city of Tel Aviv .
Other commanders have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz , through which a large part of the world 's oil flows , and to target the US and its allies around the world if Iran comes under attack .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the test justified Washington 's plan to base a missile shield plan in Eastern Europe - which is strongly opposed by Russia .
' Joke '
Her point was backed by the Republican US presidential candidate , John McCain .
His Democratic rival , Barack Obama , told ABC's Good Morning America Iran was " a great threat " .
Iran insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes The French , German and Italian governments also expressed concern at the missile tests .
But Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has insisted his country had no intention to attack Israel .
Speaking on a visit to Malaysia on Tuesday , Mr Ahmadinejad said Iran did not fear an attack by the US or Israel over its nuclear activities , dismissing the possibility as a " joke " .
Western leaders have been attempting to convince Tehran to stop enriching uranium , which it has continued despite the imposition of sanctions by the UN and the European Union .
Iran insists its nuclear research is for a civilian energy programme .

Calabasas - based Countrywide nearly collapsed under the weight of defaulting mortgage loans last year , and its acquisition by Bank of America Corp. was completed last month .
Under his exit deal with BofA , the 48 - year - old Sambol will be paid a severance package valued at $ 28 million in cash and stock , plus a host of fringe benefits , including access to the company jet for both business and personal travel as long as he is employed .
Sambol said he was leaving the company shortly .
Bank of America declined to comment .
In a regulatory filing , the bank said Sambol ’s personal use of the company jet “ would be limited , ” but it did n’t say to what degree .
Sambol ’s reported use of the jet for a family vacation to Africa was described to The Times by a person with knowledge of Countrywide ’s flight operations , who was not authorized to speak and requested anonymity .

BofA will also pay Sambol ’s country club dues and foot the bills for financial consulting services he uses through the end of 2009 , according to a regulatory filing .
Sambol earned $ 10.3 million in 2007 -- his last full year as president and chief operating officer of Countrywide -- including $ 113,629 in perquisites and personal benefits .
About $ 62,000 of that was for personal use of the company plane .
Paul Hodgson , research associate at the Corporate Library , a corporate governance research firm , criticized Bank of America for agreeing to the terms of Sambol ’s exit deal .
“ What we need to have , ” Hodgson said , “ is someone on the other side of the table willing to say , ‘ No . ’ ”

There has been an interesting discussion between Steve Saville and Paul van Eeden over the monetary aggregates M3 and TMS .
For those not familiar with TMS it stands for True Money Supply and it is a monetary measure based on Austrian economic principles .
I will come back to the description of TMS in a moment but let 's listen to a couple of discussion points from Steve Saville and Paul van Eeden first .
From Steve Saville in TMS or M3 ?
A few weeks ago Paul van Eeden ( PVE ) posted an extremely bearish outlook on bonds that he justified , in large part , by the rapid expansion of M3 money supply .
We responded that while we are long - term bearish on bonds ( we expect bond yields to move much higher over the coming 5 years ) , we thought that PVE 's premise was wrong .
Our reasoning : M3 is a poor indicator of monetary inflation , whereas a vastly superior monetary aggregate , namely the True Money Supply ( TMS ) developed by Murray Rothbard and Joseph Salerno , reveals a relatively slow rate of monetary inflation .

True Money Supply
The True Money Supply ( TMS ) was formulated by Murray Rothbard and represents the amount of money in the economy that is available for immediate use in exchange .
It has been referred to in the past as the Austrian Money Supply , the Rothbard Money Supply and the True Money Supply .
For a detailed description and explanation of the TMS aggregate , see Salerno ( 1987 ) and Shostak The Mystery Of The Money Supply Definition ( 2000 ) .
The TMS consists of the following : Currency Component of M1 , Total Checkable Deposits , Savings Deposits , U.S. Government Demand Deposits and Note Balances , Demand Deposits Due to Foreign Commercial Banks , and Demand Deposits Due to Foreign Official Institutions .
Note the above definition of what TMS consists of carefully .
Chart of TMS as of 2008-07-12
Incorporating all the above arguments , the money supply is defined as follows : Cash + demand deposits with commercial banks and thrift institutions + government deposits with banks and the central bank .

Synopsis
The lengthy set opened with Big Empty from The Crow soundtrack .
Dressed in a grey suit Weiland stumbled around the stage and fell into drummer Eric Kretz ’s drum kit which confirmed he is now officially the Amy Winehouse of rock ‘ n ’ roll .
When he did sing he often forgot words or changed them .
“ Conversations Kill ” quickly became “ Masturbation Kill . ”
The singer ’s incoherent rants in between songs were cut off by his band members starting the next song to stop the bleeding .
Guitarist Dean DeLeo and his brother bassist Robert DeLeo looked humiliated as they ripped through classics like Wicked Garden , Big Bang Baby and Vasoline .
It ’s been a while since we heard of any disasters on the Stone Temple Pilots reunion tour , but last week ’s concert in Phoenix brought Scott Weiland and his bandmates back on the trainwreck path .
It got off to an unfortunate start , as you can see from the above video , with Weiland mumbling an introduction to “ Big Empty ” before being propelled backwards and into the drum kit of Eric Kretz , no doubt because of the power of his inebriated yarl .
( The fall comes at around the 1:23 mark , although the intro really helps contextualize things . )
And the mishap must have jumbled things up in his brain even more , because he then went on to forget and alter the lyrics to the track .
A description from an Arizona Republic writer who saw the whole thing go down in non-pixellated form follows :
“ Masturbation kill ” ?
Something must be wrong .
Anyway , at this point , I ’m less surprised by this all going down than I am by the fact that the following bit is not on YouTube yet :
The crowd was really thrown for a loop when the singer busted out an a cappella cover of Bob Marley ’s Redemption Song which felt like it went on for an hour because it was hard to understand anything he was saying .
Well , that ’s what happens when you emancipate yourself from mental slavery !

Few millionaires decorate their mansions with extremely rare paintings .
Richard Moriarty decorated with a 1974 Lamborghini its wall from a Newport Beach estate early Friday .
Because Home Depot does n’t sell kits to hang cars as artwork , Moriarty hired a 70 - ton crane to lower the Italian sports car through a skylight in his living room .
Earlier , the car ’s engine was removed and transformed into a “ 200 - mph coffee table ” for guests who prefer their drinks “ shaken not stirred , ” said Moriarty , an heir to the family that developed South Coast Plaza .
Lamborghini on the Wall
Getting the Lamborghini into the house took about an hour , but the project was done months ago , when architect Fleetwood Joiner began designing Moriarty ’s new home , $ 2 million worth of steel - and - concrete that will overlook Newport ’s Back Bay when construction finishes later this year .

How much booze will $ 8,204 buy ?
The Chamber finds out the hard way
Missed spring break this year ?
Get a job at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
Roughly 100 employees of the business association ran up an $ 8,204 tab this week at The Exchange , a sports bar just blocks away from its prime real estate opposite the White House .
The party was to celebrate the end of the " Chamber Bowl , " the association ’s internal softball tournament .
It was certainly not a victory for the Chamber 's top brass .
Chamber COO David Chavern sent out an email chiding the partiers for their spending spree .
" Fundamentally , this shows a lack of responsibility on a number of people ’s part including Chamber personnel and management at The Exchange , ” Chavern wrote in an e-mail to more 50 employees , including softball players and top managers .
” I will have to reevaluate a post - Chamber Bowl celebration next year . ”
Chavern detailed where the money went : 155 pitchers of beer , 37 bottles of beer , 208 mixed drinks , 111 shots , 43 margaritas and 11 open bottles of liquor .
Sources who attended the party described it as something akin to a Cancun booze cruise .
They reported that drinkers ordered multiple pitchers of vodka and Red Bull and full bottles that they drunkenly left behind at the end of the night .
The Chamber , they said , had set no limits on the open bar .
The bill , attached to Chavern 's e-mail , was reportedly several pages long .
Party - goers put some of the blame on the bar , saying that the waiters who served them had — among other things – slapped an 18 percent gratuity on the bill .
While we ’re waiting for a response from management at The Exchange , we ’ll note that the saloon ’s online menu clearly states that an 18 percent tip will be added to checks for parties of six or more — and that even without any tip , the total tab for the party still would have been almost $ 7,000 .
The Chamber can certainly afford to pick up the check .
It has spent more on lobbying than any other association or company over the past decade , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Last year , the Chamber ’s lobbying total neared $ 52.8 million .
But it appears that The Exchange wo n’t be getting a cut of the Chamber ’s budget in the future .
In his e-mail , Chavern asked staffers to contact The Exchange to say that the Chamber will not be patronizing the establishment for the foreseeable future .
Chavern downplayed the flap Thursday night , describing it as a silly internal matter .
“ It was n’t a terribly huge amount of money , ” he said .
“ One of the things people in the office do is complain about bills . ”
Our only advice :
Next year , do n't forget your friends at Politico !

If you have been following Michael Phelps in the Olympics , you have probably read stories about his insane 12000 calorie a day diet and how he eats utter garbage yet manages to perform at the level he does .
I can pretty much guarantee he does NOT eat this way on a daily basis , and definitely does not eat this way when competing .
If you have not read the article outlining what Michael Phelps ' Allegedly eats ' , I will outline it below :
At first glance of this diet , I am honestly not even sure if a morbidly obese person could fit all of that breakfast in their stomach , let alone a 194lb , 6 ' 4 bone rack of a human being like Michael Phelps .
I can already hear the ' but Michael Phelps is a Freak ' argument from a mile away , but humor me and read over my reasons why there is no way he eats this way , at least on any day where he practices or competes .
The first reason is quite obvious ; humans have limitations associated with digestion .
That first meal is easily 4000 calories and no matter how much of a freak you are , we all have to digest .
That amount of food would take bare minimum two hours for your body to digest ; provided it even could digest all of it .
Hell , it could take even longer to digest .
If you are unfamiliar with the human body , digestion diverts blood to your stomach and intestines as part of the digestion process .
This is going to limit the amount of red blood cells available to transport nutrients and oxygen to your muscles , ultimately resulting in a lower VO2 Max .
VO2 max is the maximum capacity of an individual 's body to transport and utilize oxygen during incremental exercise .
Since Michael
Phelps is a performance athlete , eating this volume of food in one sitting will surely reduce his VO2 max while digesting , greatly reducing his ability to perform at his peak ability .
Not to mention the fact that he would probably land some amazing cramps .
Do n't you remember when your mom used to tell you not to go swimming for an hour after eating ?
Same principal applies here .
What is the solution to the digestion issue ?
Any athlete will tell you that they will eat many times throughout the day .
Phelps most likely eats 8 smaller meals over the course of the day which are all easily digestible .
Not 3 mammoth meals that would put the average human into a coma for hours .
Next , there is no trainer in their right mind who would tell their performance athlete to eat so many unhealthy fats .
Maybe he eats a bunch of crap on his off days , or parts of the year when he is not prepping for a major event , but in order to perform at his best he is probably eating much healthier alternatives to what are listed above .
If Phelps was to eat the diet outlined above for ten years he would probably be a very large candidate for coronary problems .
Hell , if this diet was truly real , I 'm surprised his heart did n't stop amidst one of his events in Beijing .
This diet could easily be modified to replace the saturated and trans fats with healthy fats , and the garbage white bread with a healthier carbohydrate .
The other argument I hear is that if he did n't eat all these fats and simple sugars , he would n't be able to get enough calories .
This is another total ridiculous suggestion .
A gram of flax seed oil contains just as much calories as a gram of hydrogenated Trans fat .
A multigrain flax bread actually contains substantially more calories ( as well as nutrients ) than a piece of useless empty calorie white bread .
All the simple sugars Phelps is allegedly taking in from the sugar coated French toast , chocolate chips in the pancakes , white bread and energy drinks is also a joke .
These are all high glycemic carbohydrates which are only good for an athlete to ingest after a grueling workout to replenish glycogen stores in his muscles .
Simple sugars supply short term energy when an athlete such as Phelps needs carbohydrates that are low glycemic that provides long term energy .
If you do n't know what the glycemic index is , it is basically the measure of the effects carbohydrates have on blood sugar levels .
Lower glycemic carbohydrates break down into glucose in your blood stream at a lower rate which aids in controlling blood insulin levels as well as creating longer term energy sources .
Higher glycemic index foods break down into glucose very rapidly and generally cause an elevation in insulin in your blood stream which eventually leads to crashes in energy levels .
There are probably other reasons why this diet is garbage , but I feel the reason 's I 've outlined are more than adequate to support my argument .
These are the biggest reasons Phelps ' alleged diet is fake , hopefully this prevents a few 12 year old swimmers from jumping on the Michael Phelps diet bandwagon and punishing their bodies with horrible nutrition .
What , pray , is all the fuss about ?
Since August 9 last year , we have ( according to the sages at the International Monetary Fund ) been in " the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression " .
Aditya Chakrabortty , in these pages last week , was the latest to claim that the past year 's " financial drama " has produced " a bonfire of capitalist certainties " .
Phooey .
If this is the worst crisis since the Great Depression then we must have all been living pretty cushy , gilded lives since the 1930s .
If this is all it takes to destroy capitalism ( or at least its certainties ) , then it is a wonder why the Soviet Union failed to do so during its seven decades of existence .
For the past year has actually not been very bad at all - unless you are a banker , a bank shareholder or Gordon Brown ; and few will shed tears for any of those .
Unemployment , that traditional begetter of rebellions against capitalism , has n't risen at all .
In fact it has dropped from 5.4 % to 5.2 % of the workforce .
The economy grew in the year to the second quarter by , oh my gosh , just 1.6 % .
Earnings have been rising by - yikes !
- 3.8 % a year .
Let 's all head for the hills .
The only statistics that point strongly in a downward direction are those for bank shares , house prices and mortgage lending .
So far this has really been a crisis just for the Daily Mail and the Financial Times .
Oh , and the IMF .
Most ordinary people have been affected more by inflation , in the form of rising petrol and food prices , than by anything connected to the supposed crisis of capitalism .
Anyone who can remember the unemployment of the early 1980s or the early 90s , or the inflation of the 70s and 80s , ought to be shaking their heads in disbelief at all the kerfuffle over what is just a mild slowdown .
That is surely the real reason why the left has " gone awol " , as Chakrabortty suggested .
The sort of people the left are most concerned about have not been affected very much , at least not since they felt a twinge of worry about their savings in Northern Rock last autumn .
And since the basic reason why petrol and food prices have been rising is that a lot of poor people in China and India have been getting wealthier and that their central banks have not been clamping down on monetary growth , inflation is not going to provide much traction for anti-capitalist campaigners .
This is not intended to make light of 5.2 % unemployment , which amounts to 1.6 million people , nor of the issues of poverty and inequality .
But those issues have not changed in the past year : they were there during the prosperous years and they are there now .
They have not been altered for better or for worse by the credit crunch .
Of course , these sanguine views may just be akin to the judgment of the proverbial building - jumper who remarks when halfway to the ground that so far the fall has n't been too bad .
Perhaps we will soon hit the ground with a thud .
We might : there are reasons to think that things could indeed get worse .
But they still do n't amount to anything that justifies the hyperbole .
In the past month the price of oil has fallen by more than 20 % and food prices have also been falling .
Partly , this is because more oil is being pumped and more food is being grown .
But also this good news has happened for the bad reason that global economic growth is slowing and hence demand for energy and food .
Much of that slowdown has happened in America and western Europe .
More critical , though , could be the slowing of demand in China and India .
The first year since the credit crunch began has been a mild affair chiefly because exports from America and even Britain have been growing , partly thanks to demand from Asia .
If China and India now deal with their inflation problem by cutting their economic growth quite sharply , that support from exports will fade .
If that happens , then some of the doom - laden predictions about the credit crunch could begin to come true .
Rather than just being a matter of banks writing off loan losses for sub - prime mortgages and complex derivative securities , a much weaker economy could make the loan defaults spread into corporate and consumer borrowing , adding to the banks ' losses and making them even less willing to lend .
That sort of downward spiral is what a true credit crunch would consist of , and if it were to last a long time it could even bring some sort of crisis for capitalism .
Essentially , that is what happened in Japan during the 1990s : loan defaults gradually accumulated , forcing banks to cut lending , which produced more loan defaults , and an even weaker economy .
Yet it is not at all clear that this is what is going to happen .
If petrol and food carry on getting cheaper , the Bank of England will start to cut interest rates .
China , India and other emerging markets will grow more slowly if their central banks do start to take inflation seriously , but by " slowly " is meant 8 % and 6 % respectively , and there is no reason to expect their slowdown to last very long .
Globally , there is no credit crunch : money is abundant .
" Crisis , what crisis ? " , as a Labour prime minister once did n't quite say , in rather worse times than today's .

Editor ’s Note :
We at TGR get a lot of chances to talk with people within the industry , but few of such occasions excited us as much as our interview with BioWare ’s CEO , Dr. Ray Muzyka .
TGR : How did you get to be where you are ?
Ray Muzyka : I believe that if you work hard and you get good people to work with you , if you remain humble and you take feedback and integrate that into your process , if you are ambitious and are always striving to figure what you are about and what your fans want and build the games for them , then you can achieve amazing things .
But it takes time .
The other week , or last month I guess , we built a new video for our new partners at EA , just kind of showing them what some of the sales folks are like and where we have come from as a studio .
We combined all the past products together in this one video that was about 15 minutes long , and it was amazing to see that because you see the evolution .
We did not have any footage of Shattered Steel , our very first game ; however , we did have Baldur ’s Gate and the Baldur ’s Gate franchise , Knights of the Old Republic , Jade Empire , Mass Effect , and Vindicate 2 .
This really helped show off our evolution as a studio , and our focus on characters and narrative and story - driven gameplay , as well as striving for emotion in games .
That is what our vision as a studio is , to really have an emotional connection with our players .
We believe this is an art form , and we are part of that .
Our industry is an emerging art form .
The big part of that is the human connection and the emotional mind with your fans .
You can do that in many different ways , whether it is a sense of awe and excitement because you are going to travel new worlds or to instill fear as you are in combat .
It causes you to really care about the people that are part of your company and take pride in your accomplishments and achievements .
These are all emotionally valid expressions of the art .
I think games have this ability to make you both the actor and the director of the experience at the same time .
TGR : What do you think about some of the critiques concerning games saying that they are almost too immersive , specifically when it comes to violence ?
RM : I think , like all media in art forms , there is a range of expression .
You look at movies , and it is very hard to categorize movies into one small bucket because they are such a diversity of expression .
When you think about the story threads in a movie , there is one main one typically , maybe a few are interwoven , but they are also very linear .
You watch it in a certain order .
Most movies are like that and books are the same way .
They are linear media , but they are powerful expressions of art .
Games are too .
I think you are starting to see a nexus of change , where there is a rapid change in the industry , as you are seeing a lot of things come together .
Games are so diverse now , that it is hard to categorize them in one way .
Is it this or is it that ?
I mean with the Wii , those are games , but they are toys as well .
I think it is as much about the social interaction of the people playing the game together , as it is about the interaction of the game .
That is new , right ?
The same with the DS , it is the interactive view , the touch screen and the various other things you can do .
It ’s the same with console gaming and PC gaming , it is no longer as simple as saying , “ That is the shooter .
That is a RTS .
That is an action game .
That is RPG . ”
There is a lot more nuance .
Mass Effect is a story driven game with combat and exploration .
You are going to explore , and you tip the sphere on humanity on a galactic stage .
You are fighting off a threat from aliens .
It has artificial intelligence versus organics .
There are a lot of themes that go through the games .
There are a thousand stories interwoven , where you have an infinite amount of possibilities .
Non-linear media can a lot of different things .
So I think to answer your question , you really have to first answer the question , which game are you talking about and which specific aspect of that game ?
Because not only are there so many different types of games out there for all ages , but there are different types of gameplay , different ways of telling a narrative and story , different platforms and different ways of playing the games now , too .
The control systems and interfaces are becoming so innovative that I think it is just like movies , and it is becoming a more mature industry .
And with this , you are seeing a lot of nuances that you did n’t see with games like Asteroids or Pong .
That was a long time ago , and games have moved well past that point .
They are really in a market , and they are an emerging art form .
It is a commercial art form , but definitely an art form .
To me , it almost feels like the technology and entertainment fuses together and shapes the industry .
And it is an exciting time to be part of all this .
It is really exciting , because every year you see something and say " Wow . "
You ca n’t imagine that they have done that , but they did .
Where are we going to go in five years ?
We allow people to fulfill inspirational fantasy worlds .
All these things are role - playing , in a sense .
I am kind of biased , but I believe everything involved in role playing , because it is all about what role you are fulfilling , and what inspirational fantasy you would enable .
With the technology , you use a tool that allows you to convey a story or a narrative and emotion more clearly and more concisely and more precisely every time that you release a game .
If the evolution of the technology enables that , then you can just rush people in to more and more credible compelling worlds .
TGR : Do you see yourself moving down that path with the external type of devices ?
RM : I always look at it .
They had this question a few times during the week on the panel I was on about how do you approach the design ?
You need to know who you are , and what your innovation points are .
You know who you are selling to , what they want , and what you are building .
And all together , the business mold falls into that as well , so does the technology and whatever apparatus or however you are delivering it .
It all has to be congruent , so you have to know who wants to buy it , and why and what do they want to play .
Why and what are you building , and why and what are you really good at , something you are better at than anybody else in the world .
Everything else you are doing should flow out of that .
If these things enable us to do it , yes , it is great , but we are not going to do them just for the sake of doing them .
We would n’t want to do them unless they will make our games better than anything else .
It is commercial art .
It is a healthy process because it means people are pulling it , you are not pushing it .
It is not just sitting there empty .
It is actively being consumed .
I think that it is really neat to think that your game is being played by millions of people .
And that it may be affecting people the same way it did when I was a kid .
I have really positive memories of that .
It was really fun , and if I could help my teams to help reach people in that way with things that we are developing , I mean I am really excited about that idea .
TGR : Well , I know I played your games growing up .
Are you trying to attract different audiences today than you did early on ?
RM :
When we showed the video of all our outtakes and videos of gameplay from all our past games , people asked , “ Well , where are you going ? ”
Watch this and then you will see , because there is a very clear path of where the characters are going in the story and exploration .
And even though every game is quite different , if you look at our portfolio now , both of the announced and the unannounced stuff , it is actually all over the place in terms of different audiences we are targeting .
Yet there is probably a group of people who play everything we ever make , and we do n’t want to lose them .
We are always trying to extend that and reach a new audience with every game , as can be seen with Sonic Chronicles on DS .
It is a new audience for us .
But it is still going to feel like a regular game , but it is also going to be kind of different .
TGR : So how far ahead internally do you plan when it comes to games ?
RM : We look at it in different levels of detail .
So we plan the next two to three years in quite a bit of detail , while the next five years are in more moderate detail , and the ten years is maybe in more of a theoretical type of planning , where would we see ourselves going .
Really then , there is no end point on these .
The great thing about our industry is there is no point where you are done .
It can always get better , right ?
Because even when the technology has reached the level where it is just seamless , and everyone has access to the same tools and tech , there is still a division .
Have you made something that will touch people and create that emotional connection ?
That is what I am most excited about .
We are reaching that point now , where visual fidelity is not really the barrier anymore .
It is up to us now to make the mocap , the animation , the textures , and the facial expressions all across the uncanny valley to reach something that actually touches people .
With cinema , you could watch a horse walk in , or a train coming into the station and it was so cool because it was just like events .
There is a non-emotional event which then progressed into silent film , BO , color , and then special effects .
But now , it is all about what is the story and the narrative , and the characters and whether you care about them .
It has probably taken 100 years of cinema to get to that level .
Games are maybe 30 years old , depending on what exactly you count as a game .
But what is the next 30 years of games going to be like ?
It feels to me like we are kind of somewhere in there right ?
So if that is the past , what could be achieved in the future is almost unimaginable .
And you also want to go to science fiction or fantasy , to try and guess what possibilities there are .
TGR : Where did your career start , and what would you recommend to people who want to get into the industry or even want to start a studio .
RM : Well I am from a Medical Doctor background , as is Greg .
We loved games , but we never even talked much about forming a studio .
We just had lunch one day , and we have been playing games all of our life and all through med school .
Well , we both were practicing at that point .
I did emergency for a while , and he did geriatric stuff .
We always kind of talked about our favorite games .
It was like , " Why do n’t we just take whatever money we have made as doctors and put it all into a studio and just start it up . "
So within an hour basically it was like , “ Yes , that is a good idea . ”
We did n’t think about it much actually , which is probably good in retrospect .
We went with our passion , and actually , the great thing is that we hired great people .
And a lot of the people stayed with us over years , and with our first two games , not a single person on the team had ever made a game before Litchi Steel and Motorskate .
We had 60 people , and not one had ever worked on any game , and some of the guys had never even used computers before .
Our lead designer was at a comic book store , he was the best DM in his hometown for D&D .
We had heard , “ Hey he is a sharp mind , he has a lot of promise . ”
Another guy was a tech artist that carved ducks that had never used a computer before , and we figured that he had 3D skills , maybe he can translate that .
So a lot of inferring about the quality of the people .
I think the key is that if you want to start out and be successful , you have to recognize it is a team effort .
If you get good people around you , and you treat them with respect , they will do amazing things .
Let them do their craft , do not micro-manage them .
Give them goals and broad ambitions , and then let them fulfill those , because they are always going to exceed every expectation you give them .
I think if you give them the freedom and the runway to do some amazing things , they can .
And you know , if you have to have the fun in the process and play all of your own games before the ship to find the bugs and give some feedback and see some of that stuff actually make it into the game , well that is fine too .
That ’s the fun part of the day for me , when I actually attend a triage or something and just kind of sit in the corner and maybe once every 20 minutes , I say something .
It might get used or maybe it wo n’t .
It is a matter of talking through the ideas , so if it is not a good idea , then it will not get used , basically .
TGR : What is your favorite game of all time ?
RM : Well , there are five .
It is probably System Shock 1 .
It came in 1993 or 1994 , and it was a very hard game to play .
It was a looking glass , and some of the stuff you have seen in BioShock and with Ken Levine ’s team , which is actually in my top favorite 10 games as well .
So it is like a cluster of some of them .
Ultimate Underworld is up there .
Woodrick 1 is probably my second or third favorite game .
It was released in 1981 or 1982 or something like that on the Apple 2 .
But System Shock came in 1993 or 1994 , I think .
I played it four times start to finish .
It is not a game I necessarily recommend people copy , as it is actually really hard to play , but its depth was groundbreaking .
Full 3D world , with this nuanced kind of storyline , and this incredible villain that you empathized with , even though you did not like the villain .
There was a lot of complexity and depth in that universe , and you are always on this trail of voice recordings .
I am one step behind , and I have to save them .
If you are one step behind , you have to save them .
Great progression systems , great music , and very great example of a craft I think .

Track and Field athletes will probably roll their eyes at me for this one , but still I have to say I was amazed to see this little four - wheeled RC car scurrying across the field last night during the men's 5,000 meter race carrying javelins , and dammit , I wanted to write about it .
After a little digging , I discovered a photographer who had documented the little cars ( there are two at the Beijing games ) , and how they 're a first for the Olympic summer games .

Eric Seals , a photojournalist with the Detroit Free Press , was photographing Detroit area Olympians when he saw the little red cars shooting across the field part of Track and Field .
Watching the cars in action sounds almost as fun as driving them :
Two kids who look to be in their mid teens sit in chairs with large remote controls driving these cars ( that look like something from that Speed Racer movie ) back and forth from the field of play where the hammer throw competition is happening .
Usually after an athlete throws the hammer someone is there to take it from the official back to the start for the next athlete to throw .
Not here , not at these Olympics .
Instead the official takes the heavy hammer and places it into the car , which is then driven back to where the kids are sitting .
They have two of them so as one is coming back to the start the other is on they way to the end .
I 'm told the cars are also used to transport the discus and javelin as well .

This could easily be a new Olympic sport in and of itself .
BMX racing ?
Football ?
Please .
RC racing with shot puts and javelins in tow ?

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The primary purpose of a 1999 clinical study that Merck & Co Inc said was done to test side effects of Vioxx was actually to support a marketing campaign before the now - withdrawn painkiller ’s launch , according to U.S. researchers .

The real aim of the study , called Advantage , was to promote prescription of the new medicine when it became available -- a so - called “ seeding ” project -- the researchers said on Tuesday .
The research team based its conclusions on an extensive trawl of Merck internal and external documents collected by plaintiffs ’ lawyers preparing for Vioxx lawsuits .
“ Documentary evidence shows that Advantage is an example of marketing framed as science , ” they wrote in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine .
Kevin Hill , a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Belmont , Massachusetts , and colleagues said the findings showed how studies masquerading as clinical science could be used to bolster marketing plans .
“ Failure to disclose the primary purpose of a trial has ethical ramifications for patients , physicians and the design of clinical trials , ” they said .
“ Seeding trials like Advantage , in which the study medication has yet to receive ( U.S. Food and Drug Administration ) approval , may cause patient injury for marketing purposes . ”
Merck denied that Advantage was a seeding study .
It said the clinical trial had a legitimate scientific purpose in testing the gastrointestinal tolerability of Vioxx compared to the commonly used pain medicine , naproxen .
The drug maker also said the journal article contained “ numerous inaccuracies ” and that its conclusions were based on a limited selection of documents produced in the Vioxx litigation .
“ We believe we acted appropriately with respect to the Advantage trial , and stand behind our strong beliefs in the principles of scientific integrity , ” Merck said in an open letter to the editors of the medical journal .
Vioxx generated annual sales of $ 2.5 billion before the arthritis and chronic pain pill was withdrawn from U.S. drugstores nearly four years ago , when a Merck study showed that long - term users had twice the risk of heart attack and stroke .
Last year the company took a pretax charge of $ 4.85 billion for a proposed settlement with U.S. patients or their survivors who had filed Vioxx product liability lawsuits against it .
CINCINNATI -- One in three U.S. public schools are in the " air pollution danger zone , " according to new research from the University of Cincinnati ( UC ) .
UC researchers have found that more than 30 percent of American public schools are within 400 meters , or a quarter mile , of major highways that consistently serve as main truck and traffic routes .
Research has shown that proximity to major highways -- and thus environmental pollutants , such as aerosolizing diesel exhaust particles -- can leave school - age children more susceptible to respiratory diseases later in life .
" This is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development , transportation planning and environmental policies , " says Sergey Grinshpun , PhD , principal investigator of the study and professor of environmental health at UC .
To protect the health of young children with developing lungs , he says new schools should be built further from major highways .
" Health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning , but that does n't erase the immediate risk to school - age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now , " he adds .
" Existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students ' exposure to traffic pollutants . "
The UC - led team reports its findings in the September 2008 issue of the Journal of Environmental Planning and Management , an international scientific journal .
This is believed to be the first national study of school proximity and health risks associated with major roadways .
For this study , Grinshpun 's team conducted a survey of major metropolitan areas representative of all geographical regions of the United States : Atlanta , Boston , Cincinnati , Denver , Philadelphia , Los Angeles , Memphis , Minneapolis and San Antonio .
More than 8,800 schools representing 6 million students were included in the survey .
Primary data was collected through the U.S. Department of Education 's National Center for Education Statistics .
Schools within this data set were then geocoded to accurately calculate distance to the nearest interstate , U.S. highway or state highway .
Past research on highway - related air pollution exposure has focused on residences located close to major roads .
Grinshpun points out , however , that school - age children spend more than 30 percent of their day on school grounds -- in classrooms , after - school care or extracurricular activities .
" For many years , our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution .
School attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that -- until now -- have been completely overlooked , " he adds .
These past studies suggest this proximity to highway traffic puts school - age children at an increased risk for asthma and respiratory problems later in life from air pollutants and aeroallergens .
This includes research from the UC Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study ( CCAAPS ) which has reported that exposure to traffic pollutants in close proximity to main roads has been associated with increased risk for asthma and other chronic respiratory problems during childhood .
Grinshpun 's team found that public school students were more likely to attend schools near major highways compared to the general population .
Researchers say the rapid expansion of metropolitan areas in recent years -- deemed " urban sprawl " -- seems to be associated with the consistent building of schools near highways .
" Major roads play an important role in the economy , but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas , " says Alexandra Appatova , the study 's first author .
" Policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure , particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones . "
The state of California , for example , has passed a law prohibiting the building of new schools within 500 feet ( 168 meters ) of a busy road .
New Jersey is moving a bill through the legislature to require highway entrance and exit ramps to be at least 1,000 feet from schools .
###
This study was funded in part by grants from UC's Center for Sustainable Urban Engineering and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences .
UC's Patrick Ryan , PhD , and Grace LeMasters , PhD , also participated in this study .
Appatova was an intern in UC 's department of environmental health when the study was being conducted .

Although their skin is pale and they are very sensitive to sun burns , the ladies in the northern countries have found the way to have skin without wrinkles .
What is the secret ?
Basically – fish and a lot of fresh air .
The consumption of fish in Norway , Denmark and Sweden is very high and the fish is one of the main components of the Scandinavian cooking .
The most preferred fish is salmon .
The fish is source of anti-oxidants , and helps to postpone the aging of the cells .
In Norway and other northern countries the fish is always at the table , it is a perfect food for such cold areas of the world and is very rich of proteins .
The proteins are pure food for the muscles , and the stronger muscles we have , the better skin .
The consumption of fish is recommended as frequent as possible .
Salomon , tuna , mackerel etc .
The skin also needs fresh and clean air .
Walk in the nature will also help for better skin .
Mountain air can do miracles .
The olive oil is also an addition to the recipe for a perfect skin .
Salad with olive oil is very useful for the stomach , liver and skin .
Be active – in Denmark the people use their bicycles frequently and in Norway and Sweden skiing is a national sport .
DRIVERS were last night urged to go apeshit crazy , as everything went tits up .
With petrol stations poised on the brink of an abyss , the government was forced to issue an emergency statement stressing the need to completely freak out .
The statement continued : " Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh !
HOLY FUCKING SHIT !
" Why are you all just standing there ?
Oh my God , I see what 's going on here – you 've all gone mad !
All of you !
And I 'm the only sane one left !
Aaaaaaaargh ! "
Ministers said the panic should not be restricted to fuel supplies , urging drivers to completely lose it over anything , including terrorism , rabid animal attacks and Fern Britton 's extended sabbatical from This Morning .
A spokesman for the department of transport said : " Oh , it 's you , thank God for that .
I thought it might have been ….
no… no… .
NOOOOOOO !
He added : " AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH ! "
Schools secretary Ed Balls appealed for chaos by stealing a police horse and galloping down Whitehall , shouting : " Them 's a comin ' , run for yer lives ! "
Meanwhile chancellor Alistair Darling appeared on Channel 4

Who does n’t feel better after a yoga class ?
Yoga is the union of the body , mind and spirit .
It stabilizes the nervous system , decreases blood pressure , increases flexibility and endurance , and opens you up in ways that you may not have imagined .
Simran used to be a yoga teacher .
She loves the practice even though she has n’t spent much time on her mat lately .
( “ Yoga on the inside , baby ! ” )
Sarah gets her yoga on every week and knows it does her body good .
But , as any student knows , the real practice starts when you walk out the door .
That ’s also where the rubber hits the road and your practice takes its toll on the environment .
Oh brother , that again ?
Yes , my dear yogin , that .
The majority of yoga mats are manufactured in Taiwan and made of poly - vinyl chloride , or PVC .
PVC makes a great mat due to its grip , durability and price point .
But , unfortunately , there is no safe way to create , use or destroy these mats .
PVC is n’t just in yoga mats .
It ’s in kids toys ( which may soon change ) , sex toys , shower curtains , fake Christmas trees , IV bags and more .
That new car ( or new yoga mat ) smell is the scent of plastic softened with pthalates and stabilized with lead and cadmium .
PVC became the plastic of choice because it ’s cheap , but considering the impacts on environmental and human health , it ’s actually priceless .
PVC ca n’t be recycled due to the toxins embedded within it , and when it ’s incinerated or buried in landfills it releases dioxin , a known carcinogen .
Pthalates have been known to impact boy bits in utero and swimmers once the boys become men , and lead and cadmium damage our brains and never break down .
Not exactly the impermanence we ’re after in yoga .

PLEASE NOTE : DUE TO TIGHTENING DEMAND , INCREASED COST AND DECREASING / LIMITED SUPPLY ON THIS CANNED BACON , THIS ITEM WILL NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY DISCOUNT / PROMOTION CODE
I ’d like to share something that will be old news to readers of CSS : The Definitive Guide and all of my other books , but nonetheless needs to be said out loud , in public , for everyone to hear .
The property line - height can accept unitless number values .
You can also give line - height united values , though generally you should n’t .
But unitless numbers are just fine for this property .
So what ’s the difference ?
When you define a united value , like 1em , you ’re setting things up to pass along the computed result to any descendants .
For example , suppose the following CSS is applied to a document containing the following markup fragment :
ul {font - size : 15 px ; line - height : 1 em ; } li { font - size : 10 px ; } small { font - size : 80 % ;} < ul > < li >I 'm a list item with < small > small text </ small >.</li > </ul >
The ul element has its line - height computed to be 15 px because for line - height , em - based values are calculated using the computed font - size of the element itself .
I declared the font - size directly , so we know its computed size in pixels .
( Yes , yes , I know , pixel - sized text is evil and wrong , but it makes explaining how all this works a lot simpler . )
So that computed value of 15 px is what ’s passed on to the descendent elements .
The li and small elements will inherit a line - height value of 15 px .
End of story .
They do n’t change it based on their own font sizes ; in fact , they do n’t change it at all .
They just take that 15 px and use it , exactly the same as if I ’d said :
ul {font - size : 15 px ; line - height : 1 em ; } li { font - size : 10 px ; line - height : 15 px ; } small { font - size : 80 % ; line - height : 15 px ; }
Okay , now suppose I take the em off that line - height value , so that the styles now read :
ul {font - size : 15 px ; line - height : 1 ; } li { font - size : 10 px ; } small { font - size : 80%;}
Now what ’s passed on is that raw number , which is used by descendent elements as a scaling factor — a multiplier , if you will–and not the computed result .
Thus every element that inherits that value of 1 will take that value and multiply it with their computed font - size s.
The list item , with its declared font - size : 10 px , will have a computed line - height of 10 px .
Then it will pass that 1 on to the small element , which will multiply it with its computed font - size .
That ’s 8 pixels ; therefore , its line - height will also be 8 pixels .
The end result is exactly the same as if I ’d written :
ul {font - size : 15 px ; line - height : 1 ; } li { font - size : 10 px ; line - height : 10 px ; } small { font - size : 80 % ; line - height : 8 px ; }
That ’s a pretty major difference .
This is why it ’s always strongly recommended that you use unitless numbers if you ’re going to set a line - height on something like the html or body elements , or indeed on any element that is going to have descendant elements .
The fact that the CSS validator has a bug that causes it to generate parse errors on unitless number values for line - height ( see report # 2307 ) rather confuses things ; we get an occasional jeering e-mail over at A List Apart as a result , since running CSS validation on the site gets an error due to my use of line - height : 1 ; . Jeffrey points the correspondents to that bug report , and usually we never hear anything back .
And if anyone reading this feels motivated to fix the validator , please do .
As it says in the bug report , all they really need is a patch for review .
I might do it myself when I have some free time .
That ’ll be in , oh , 2009 or so .
Again : the property line - height can accept unitless number values , and they ’re a better choice than united values in 99 out of 100 cases anyway .
Okay ?
Thank you .
One of the papers presented at the Black Hat USA 2008 security conference was an analysis a number of the protection mechanisms built into Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 that are designed to make it harder to convert software bugs into security flaws .
How to Impress Girls with Browser Memory Protection Bypasses , authored by security researchers Mark Dowd at IBM and Alexander Sotirov at VMware , presented a number of attacks against Vista 's various security features in isolation , and then attacks that could disable multiple protections all together .
Put together , the result is that Vista 's mitigation mechanisms are circumvented , making buggy software exploitable .
The security features being bypassed are all intended to minimize the impact of buffer overflows .
Buffer overflows are a particular kind of programming error that occur when a program attempts to store too much data in the buffer allocated for the data .
This causes anything following the buffer to be overwritten .
Buffer overflows are exploitable when it 's possible to insert arbitrary executable code into a process and then make that code run .
If an attacker can do this then the attacker has gained the ability to do whatever he likes to the victim 's computer .
Mitigating against buffer overflows
This kind of flaw is quite a common one , especially in the programming languages C and C ++.
Many high - profile software flaws have been of this type , from the Morris worm of the 1980s to the Code Red worm of 2001 , and more recently the animated cursor vulnerability .
Although there are languages that make such flaws impossible — Java and .NET are both immune to such flaws — the unfortunate reality is that a large proportion of the software that we run ( including our operating systems , web browsers , and browser plugins ) do n't use these safe languages , and so are susceptible to this ancient problem .
This is why Microsoft included a number of protection schemes in Vista to try to reduce the exploitability of buffer overflows .
Although the operating system cannot prohibit such flaws ( except by mandating the use of Java and . NET ) , it can make it less likely that an overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution .
One of these protections was introduced in Windows XP Service Pack 2 ; Microsoft calls it Data Execution Protection , DEP .
With DEP enabled each block of memory in a process must be explicitly marked " executable " before the processor can run any instructions stored in that block .
This means that even if an attacker can write arbitrary code into a process , the processor is n't able to run that code .
This effectively prevents any easy exploitation of buffer overflows .
Unfortunately , security researchers are a clever lot ; they discovered ways by which DEP could be defeated , for example by passing control not to their own executable code , but instead to one of the system DLLs loaded into the process and getting that to do their dirty work .
Vista therefore introduced several mechanisms to try to reduce the impact of these DEP bypasses .
One of these is Address Space Layout Randomization , which randomly organizes the location of the system DLLs so that an attacker no longer knows where they are .
Vista also inserts extra checks into the operating system code to detect that certain kinds of overflow have occurred and crash the program ( although crashing might seem a bad thing to do , it 's safer than continuing to run after a buffer overflow ) .
It is these extra mechanisms that the paper at Black Hat attacks .
Dowd and Sotirov describe several different techniques for bypassing Windows ' protections that can be used to reinstate the exploitability of buffer overflows .
One of the key mechanisms used is the fact that the protections are not always applied .
Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2 both opt out of DEP , and many third - party libraries such as the Flash plugin opt out of ASLR ( and other protection mechanisms ) .
Plugins can also do things that can deliberately defeat the OS 's countermeasures ; Java , for example , marks all of its memory as executable , meaning that a Java applet can place into memory executable code that 's immune to DEP protection .
The final trick is to use scripting or plugins to file large amounts of memory with the malicious executable code , so that even when ASLR is in effect , an attacker can still be sure that the malicious code is where he needs it to be .
Together , these techniques allow all of the protections found in Vista to be defeated .
Chicken Little runs amok
This is certainly unfortunate .
The great thing about these protection mechanisms is that they provided a degree of safety even when applications contained bugs .
That will no longer be the case , at least for web browsers ( programs that do not support third - party plugins ( or apply more stringent checks to those plugins ) might continue to benefit from the protections ) .
Unfortunate , yes , but not — as was reported in the immediate aftermath of the presentation — evidence that Vista 's security is useless , nor does this work constitute a major security issue .
And it 's not game over , either .
Sensationalism sells , and there 's no news like bad news , but sometimes — particularly when covering security issues — it would be nice to see accuracy and level - headedness instead .
Alarmism helps no one .
Responsible vulnerability disclosure is a big concern in the security industry ; it would be good to see it coupled with responsible reporting .
The work done by Dowd and Sotirov focuses on making buffer overflows that were previously not exploitable on Vista exploitable .
These are buffer overflows that would be exploitable on Windows XP anyway ; after all , there 's no need to defeat ASLR if an OS does not have ASLR at all .
Furthermore , these attacks are specifically on the buffer overflow protections ; they do not circumvent the IE Protected Mode sandbox , nor Vista 's ( in ) famous UAC restrictions .
DEP , ASLR , and the other mitigation features in Vista are unlikely to ever be unbreakable , especially in an application like a web browser that can run both scripts and plugins of an attacker 's choosing .
Rather , their purpose is to make exploitation more difficult .
Microsoft has a solution for those wanting to make it impossible — use .
NET .
These protections are there for when that 's not an option , to reduce — but not eliminate — the vulnerability caused by such programming errors .
Even with DEP and ASLR , the coding errors that result in buffer overflows still ought to be fixed ; it is only through fixing the errors that the flaws can truly be eliminated .
Even with the attacks described in the paper , Vista has many worthwhile security improvements compared to XP .
Internet Explorer on Vista runs in a highly restricted environment , so that even when it is running malicious code it cannot harm the system .
Stories suggesting that Vista 's security is now irredeemably broken are far off the mark ; the truth is merely that some of its automatic security protection is less effective than it was before .
What Microsoft will do in response remains to be seen .
Some of the specific featurs of the attacks can be resolved by Microsoft itself — preventing IE plugins from opting out of the protection schemes , by improving the way that .NET interacts with the protection , and by making Windows default to enabling all the protection schemes — and others can be minimized by third parties — by writing plugins that enable with all the security mechanisms , by being more careful with executable memory , and so on .
Longer term , a switch to 64 - bit programs might allow considerably more randomization to be applied ; while making large allocations is enough to fill up a 32 - bit program 's memory ( which allows attackers to defeat randomization ) the same is not true of 64 - bit processes — they 're simply too big .
Perhaps a session of waterboarding is the correct sentence for a California man convicted of selling more than $ 1 million worth of counterfeited " access cards " that allowed customers unlawful access to DirectTV 's digital satellite feed .
Jay Bybee , a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals who as an assistant U.S. attorney general signed the infamous " torture memo , " ( .pdf ) is n't saying what would be an appropriate sentence .
But on Monday , he blasted two of his colleagues who sat with him on the DirectTV case :
They signed off on a lower court judge 's rendering of five - years ' probation , a $ 50,000 fine and community service .
" This sentence is substantively unreasonable for someone who was convicted of stealing over $ 1 million in profits from DirectTV and who bragged to have personally made over $ 400,000 from the theft , " Bybee wrote ( .pdf ) Monday .
Bybee , in 2002 , signed off on the torture memo after the CIA requested legal advice on how aggressively it could interrogate suspected terrorists detained outside the United States while comporting with the Convention Against Torture .
Among other things , the memo said , " physical pain amounting to torture must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function , or even death . "
( Translation :
As long as the detainee is n't killed while being interrogated , there 's no torture . )
For mental anguish to equal torture , the memo said , it " must result in significant psychological harm of significant duration . "
That said , Bybee was concerned Monday that the majority decision was undermining the power of the appellate courts in the wake of a string of recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions giving sentencing judges the right to set aside sentencing guidelines .
The two other circuit judges on the DirectTV case wrote defendant Thomas Whitehead 's sentence was appropriate .
The lower court judge deemed it as such when it was issued in 2005 , the majority wrote .
The defendant faced up to 51 months behind bars .
The government appealed .
Whitehead was convicted of breaking the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , which forbids the sale of devices that are designed to circumvent a " technological measure " designed to protect copyrighted works .
Chief Judge Alex Kozinski , and Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain , wrote there was no " abuse of discretion in the district court 's conclusion . "
The majority pointed out that it was a white - collar crime ; the defendant has repented , is devoting himself to his house - painting business and to his young daughter , and is " building an honorable life . "
Bybee wrote that the non-prison sentence " was not an exercise of discretion as much as an abdication of responsibility . "
But the majority concluded that the sentencing judge was " intimately familiar with the nature of the crime and defendant 's role in it , as we are not . "
Bybee countered .
Deferring to a sentencing judge 's discretion , he wrote , " does not mean rubber - stamping the court 's actions . "
The " challenge , " Bybee wrote , " is to determine the boundaries of a reasonable sentence for a given conviction and set of individualized circumstances and then decide whether the sentence imposed by the district court sits within these boundaries . "
At least we know what torture is .

Obama ad portrays McCain as clueless
Barack Obama 's campaign on Saturday released an ad echoing the line from his acceptance speech that John McCain " does n’t get it . ”
The ad will air on national cable , the campaign said .

The wording suggests that John McCain is bumbling and out of touch — underscoring Obama ’s generational appeal and hinting obliquely at McCain ’s age — 72 as of Friday .
The ad was billed as a response to McCain ’s selection Friday of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate .
But mainly , it ’s another chance to show McCain with President Bush — twice in 30 seconds .
The ad is called “ No Change . "
An Obama release says it shows “ how John McCain ’s choice will not change the fact that he still desires to just offer four more years of the same failed Bush policies . ”
Here ’s the script :
Female narrator , over dreary music : “ Well , he ’s made his choice .
But , for the rest of us , … there ’s still no change .
McCain does n’t get it , calling this broken economy ‘ strong . ’
Wants to keep spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq . ”
Then it shows McCain walking with Bush in the Rose Garden : “ And votes with George [ Bush ] 90 percent of the time . ”
And McCain presenting Palin at their Ohio rally : “ So , while this may be his running mate … ”
And Bush hugging McCain : “… America knows this is John McCain ’s agenda . ”
And a photo of the White House : “ And we ca n’t afford four more years of the same . ”
Then Obama says : “ I ’m Barack Obama .
And I approve this message . ”
Obama drew cheers and applause when he said in his acceptance speech at Invesco Field at Mile High in Denver : “ It 's not because John McCain does n't care .
It 's because John McCain does n't get it . ”

The rare albino tadpoles found in garden pond that have astonished scientists
Experts on amphibians have been caught on the hop by a rare batch of albino tadpoles living in a garden pond .
Tiny pale globules of frog spawn and tadpoles are now under observation at a secret and closely guarded address in Carmarthenshire , west Wales .
Experts from Froglife were called in after at least four separate blobs of albino spawn were found deposited in the pond .
They believe the " highly unusual " discovery could point to a significant frog population carrying the rare recessive gene for albinism .
All white : the discovery could point to a significant frog population carrying the rare recessive gene for albinism
No adult albino frogs have so far been discovered but their frog spawn and tadpoles have the characteristic pink eyes and off - white skin colour .
" Albino individuals of adult frogs , toads and newts have been reported in the past , though sightings are considered very rare , " a spokesman said .
" Cases of multiple albinistic individuals in a breeding population are even rarer . "
The sighting was reported to Froglife 's Wildlife Information Service - a public advice service encouraging people to get involved with amphibian and reptile conservation .
Details of the unusual find , and a YouTube link to a short video of the albino frog spawn and tadpoles , appear on the group 's website .
" This is certainly one of the stranger inquiries we 've had recently , " said Lucy Benyon , Froglife 's wildlife information officer .
" What 's unusual about this is that the batches of white tadpoles suggest that a number of adults that carry genes for albinism possibly exist in the area , not just one . "
" Usually though albino amphibians fail to live to a breeding age - their white colour makes them a blindingly conspicuous beacon for the various animals that depend on frogs for food . " she added .
She said that further research into the multiple cases of albino tadpoles will be looked into over coming months .
DENVER —
A month after whipping the crowd at Lollapalooza into a near - riotous frenzy , a strange thing happened during the protest show on Wednesday ( August 27 ) in support of Iraq Veterans Against the War :
Things were downright ... peaceful .
And , as of 7 p.m. Mountain
Time , they stayed that way as several thousand protesters gathered in the shadow of the Pepsi Center , where President Bill Clinton was about to address the Democratic National Convention .
After a more than 2 - mile march across Denver that at one point included a police - estimated 4,500 - 6,000 people , a crowd of several thousand anxiously awaited word from the campaign of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama , to whom they had submitted a list of demands that included an immediate withdrawal from Iraq and reparations for the Iraqi people .
With more than 700 police in full riot gear looking on , the protesters defiantly refused to enter the designated 50,000 - square - foot protest zone , dubbed the " Freedom Cage , " saying that as veterans , they deserved more from their country .
With chants of " Whose streets ?
Our streets ! " and " We believe in freedom and will not rest , will not rest until it comes , " the marchers were led by a phalanx of soldiers from Iraq Veterans Against the War and a front line that included Rage 's Zack de la Rocha and Tom Morello , as well as the Coup 's Boots Riley .
They amassed outside the Freedom Cage and let out a whoop as word came down around 6:30 p.m. Mountain
Time that the Obama camp had agreed to enter into negotiations with the group .
Hours earlier , Tent State University leader Adam Jung vowed from the stage of the Coliseum that the marchers would make the Democrats " sh -- their pants " as the mile - long protest snaked through town .
Before taking off , Rage played an hour 's worth of incendiary , bomb - throwing anthems from their catalog , and lead singer
De la Rocha egged on the near - capacity crowd at the Denver Coliseum into a froth , but several hours ' worth of warnings from the concert 's organizers to keep the post - show protest nonconfrontational appeared to soak in as fans mostly danced in place with their fists in the air , spinning out the occasional mosh pit .
Among those helping to spread the message of peaceful resistance at the show — which also included sets from the Coup and Denver natives the — was Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic , whose story was the basis for the movie
His fist raised in the air , the wheelchair — bound Kovic told the crowd that " the whole world is watching . "
Rage said little during their set , playing hits such as " Testify , " " Bulls on Parade " and " Killing in the Name . "
With assistance from former MC5 guitarist and 1968 Democratic National Convention protest veteran Wayne Kramer — decked out in all white and sporting a guitar painted with an American flag —
Rage ripped through a punk - edged take on the MC5's scorched - earth manifesto " Kick Out the Jams . "
De la Rocha kept the polemics to a minimum during the show but gave a stern warning that " revolutionary change begins with a crime of betrayal , " and said that any politician who continues to support the United States ' current policies " is in harm 's way . "
A short time later , voluntary parade marshal Wesley Flowers , 31 , put on his helmet and brightly colored vest and began the long march to the Pepsi Center , keeping the marchers in line while warily eyeing the hundreds of police on bicycle and on foot shadowing the march from across the street .
" I 'm wearing a flak jacket because I 'm allergic to tasers , " he said , showing off his body armor and explaining that with his heart murmur , a blast of the taser could cause him to go into cardiac arrest .
Flowers , an advocate for the homeless , said he hitchhiked eight days from Portland , Oregon , to take part in the protest and hoped that the Obama campaign — which he had written a letter to three weeks prior — would listen to the veterans ' demands when they made their way to the Pepsi Center .
An hour before the marchers arrived , hundreds of police began massing and forming long , foreboding lines , in order to funnel the march toward the protest zone and away from the delegate entrance to the Pepsi Center .
Checking their mace canisters , dropping their face shields , standing at attention with their five - foot batons at the ready and strapping on leg armor , the squadrons of storm trooper - like officers marched into the fray with orders to be prepared for potential violent action .
The protesters marched past the gathering delegates and into a long concrete and barbed - wire corridor , stopping several times to coordinate actions with police , remaining orderly and respectful along the way .
In another bit of Big Brother irony , the procession was led by a police officer in a heavily armored golf cart with a digital message board on it that flashed the instructions , " Welcome to Denver ... Follow us . "
Nearly three hours into the protest , frustration began to ripple through the crowd as it stalled out just outside the desolate Freedom Cage , with some marchers sitting down to play dice , start impromptu dance circles , smoke marijuana and , eventually , wander away until police estimated that just a few thousand remained .
Then , a buzz rippled through the mass as the word was passed on from the front that something was happening .
" We are entering negotiations with Senator Obama , " one of the march 's Iraq - vet leaders announced .
" The Democratic Party is scared sh - - less of us right now ! "
A spokesperson for IVAW could not be reached for comment on the negotiations at press time , but judging by the roar of approval from inside the convention center for President Clinton 's speech a short time later — which likely could not be heard by the far - flung protesters — fear was likely not the on the minds of party supporters as they finally got the healing message between the Clinton and Obama camps they 'd been looking for all week .

Miscreants are actively exploiting a gaping hole in the internet 's address lookup system that can cause millions of web surfers to receive counterfeit pages when they try to access online banking services and other types of websites .
The first confirmed instance came on Tuesday , when security researcher H D Moore discovered a domain - name service server operated by AT&T had been compromised .
The attack caused Moore and other AT&T subscribers to be redirected to a fake Google page that tried to push affiliate advertising sites .
According to Dan Kaminsky , the researcher who first warned of the DNS vulnerability , " there are definitely other confirmed attacks , " but non-disclosure agreements prevent him from giving details .
Equally concerning , Kaminsky said , is the sophistication the AT&T attackers showed in carrying out their attack .
Rather than use exploit code added last week to Metasploit , a penetration testing kit that just happens to be maintained by Moore , the miscreants fashioned their own program that stealthily redirected users trying to visit Google to an impostor site .
" That was a wildly mature attack , " Kaminsky told The Register .
" Someone had an entire infrastructure built to attack Google 's click - fraud system .
That 's a significant amount of code . "
For more than a week , other researchers pointed to an increase in queries to DNS servers and other evidence suggesting attacks , but the AT&T exploit is the first to be documented .
As we reported last week , AT&T was one of the many laggard internet service providers reported to be dragging their feet in applying patches that fix the devastating DNS flaw .
Kaminsky says more ISPs appear to be getting the message .
Last week , about 51 per cent of unique name servers tested on his site ( see the " check my DNS " button to the right ) showed up as vulnerable .
Now , he says it 's closer to 35 percent .
In most cases , installing the patch is a straight - forward affair , but not always .
Paul Vixie , head of the organization that maintains Berkeley Internet Name Domain , the net 's most popular DNS server software , recently said updates patching the flaw could cut performance under heavy loads .
Vixie said he believed fixing the flaw was more important than suffering slower performance .
An update improving performance is in the works .
Even still , it 's been more than three weeks since Kaminsky , Vixie and a choir of other influential net figures began imploring organizations to run the patch .
Now that attacks have been confirmed in the wild , it 's hard to imagine a justification for not doing so .
To test whether your ISP is an offender , please run the tests here or here , and report the results in the comments section .
Be sure to include the name server 's IP address and the name of the ISP . ®
' Wrong ' woman given abortion after nurse mixed up patients
Mix - up : Ann Downer allegedly gave the drugs to a woman who had only arrived for a consultation
A woman was given a chemical abortion tablet by mistake after a nurse mixed up two patients with the same first name , a misconduct hearing has heard .
Ann Downer gave the drug to a woman who had gone into the clinic for an initial consultation .
When staff realised what had happened the distraught woman , named only as patient A , was called back to the clinic in pain and doctors subsequently advised her to undergo a surgical abortion .
Miss Downer , 44 , should have administered the drug to a second woman , patient B , who was in the later stages of a chemical termination , the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told .
The first woman attended the Calthorpe Clinic in Edgbaston , Birmingham - which offers abortion , sterilisation and vasectomy - in October , 2006 .
Another patient with the same name was due to have the drugs for the second stage of her medical abortion , only undertaken on women who have been pregnant for less than nine weeks .
The clinic 's usual practice was to only call out first names of patients to protect their confidentiality while in the waiting room .
Once the patient was in a private room , other details such as full name , date of birth and address , were checked to make sure they were the person the nurse expected .
Miss Downer failed to carry out the identity checks and gave the drug to a patient who was only due to have an initial visit .
That would have involved a consultation with a doctor , blood tests and a scan .
Patients at the first stage after the initial consultation are given a tablet of Mifepristone to swallow , which stops the growth of the foetus .
At the second stage , women are given Misoprostol to complete the abortion .
The second stage - in which Misoprostol was administered - should only follow if the patient and doctor give consent .
Nailah Mears , for the council , told the London hearing Miss Downer was in charge of treating patients at the second stage when the mixup was made .
After taking the drug , the woman commented on how quick the whole process had been and left the clinic .
She said : ' Patient A was attending the clinic for an initial consultation at 9.45 am .
At that stage , no part of the early medical abortion treatment is given .
' Patient B , who had the same first name , was at the clinic for her second visit at 10.45 am .
' During the course of the morning , it was discovered Miss Downer had mistakenly administered the visit treatment to patient A instead of patient B .
' The registrant failed to carry out proper identity checks , and as such did not realise the treatment was being given to the wrong patient . '
Miss Mears said patient A was over the nine - week gestation period , and should not have had the early medical abortion tablets .
' Once the mistake came to light , patient A was asked to return to the clinic and was later transferred to Birmingham Women 's Hospital .
' She was given an ultrasound , and that ultrasound showed that patient A was over the nine - week gestation period .
' That is very significant in determining whether the early medical abortion was appropriate .
It was not appropriate in this case . '
Nurse manager Evlyn Mike told the hearing patient A was ' in pain ' as she returned to the clinic .
She said : ' Apparently patient B turned up and the administration staff could not find her notes .
' They then went to Miss Downer , and at that point they realised that the wrong woman was treated with the second part of the treatment .
' They telephoned patient A and asked her to return to the clinic .
She did return .
' Apparently she was in pain , and obviously very upset . '
Miss Downer , from Browns Green , Birmingham , who was not present at the hearing , had admitted mistaking one patient for another but denied not obtaining patient A's consent before doing so .
Miss Mears added : ' The council 's case is that the registrant did not seek patient A's informed consent before carrying out the procedure .
' The matter for you is if there was informed and recorded consent . '
The misconduct panel ruled that Miss Downer did not obtain the woman 's consent to give her the abortion drug but the nurse was allowed to carry on practising as a nurse with a three - year caution order after it was found to be an ' isolated incident ' .
Panel chairman Pat Kelly said Miss Downer had expressed regret and came forward to admit her error as soon as she realised it .
US ambassador to Iraq admits Qaeda graver threat in Afghanistan David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Tuesday April 8 , 2008
|
Print This Email This US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker conceded during Senate hearings today that Afghanistan , and not Iraq , is the main front in the fight against al - Qaeda .
Evading a direct answer to a question from Sen. Joe Biden ( D - DE ) as to whether the focus of the war against the terror network is in Iraq or Afghanistan , Crocker finally said , " I would ... pick al - Qaeda in the Pakistan - Afghanistan border area . "
Biden first discussed progress that has been made in Iraq and the potential for troop draw downs with Gen. David Petraeus , commander of coalition forces in Iraq .
He then turned to Crocker and the following exchange occurred : Biden : Mr. Ambassador , is al - Qaeda a greater threat to U.S. interests in Iraq , or in the Afghan - Pakistan border region ?
Crocker : Mr. Chairman , al - Qaeda is a strategic threat to the United States wherever it is , in my judgment --
Biden :
Where is most of it ?
If you could take it out , get a choice ... [ If ] the Lord Almighty came down , sat in the middle of the table there and said , ' Mr. Ambassador , you can eliminate every al - Qaeda source in Afghanistan and Pakistan or every al - Qaeda personnel in Iraq , ' which would you pick ?
Crocker :
Well , given the progress that has been made against al - Qaeda in Iraq , the significant decrease in its capabalities , the fact that it is solidly on the defensive and not in a position , as far as I can judge --
Biden :
Which would you pick , Mr. Ambassador ?
Crocker : I would therefore pick al - Qaeda in the Pakistan - Afghanistan border area .
Biden :
That would be a smart choice .
Biden had begun his time with a statement to Crocker tantamount to a scolding : " I would not presume that if the security agreement with Iraq goes beyond a status - of - forces agreement , that you need only inform the Congress .
You need to do much more than inform the Congress , you need the permission of the Congress if you 're going to bind the next president of the United States in anything you agree to . "

Medical consultants teach basic physiology to help retail sales reps fit customers to the right bike .
Afternoons are spent cycling through the area ’s foothills so that dealers can learn about the latest models and give feedback on them .
Tap into a mentor
As his company grew to more than 100 employees and many product lines , Sinyard struggled to keep workers focused on the same goal .
He turned to Peter Moore , CEO of Adidas .
Hoping to land an in - person meeting , Sinyard shipped the amateur cyclist a helmet and wrote him letters .
Eventually Sinyard flew to Portland , where Moore gave him tips on how to create a clear vision for the company .
Get the right advice
After competitors started rolling out their own all - terrain bikes in the 1980s , Sinyard hired the world ’s first mountain bike champion to help create better designs .
A few years later , Sinyard says , he made the mistake of replacing himself as president with a professional manager who neglected the advice of core customers and steered the firm off track .
( FORTUNE Small Business ) --
When Mike Sinyard started importing Italian bike parts in 1974 , his toughest challenge was finding space to store them inside his eight - by 30 - foot trailer .
That turned out to be the least of his problems .
Over the next 30 year he battled bankruptcy and monster competitors and competed for customers among finicky , demanding cyclists .
Today Specialized , whose products sell in 1,200 of the nation 's high - end bike shops , is a profitable $ 500 - million - a - year company that will relaunch 150 of its models by the end of the year , including one designed specifically for women .
Sinyard 's secret ?
Specialized has fostered a culture of innovation that has generated a long line of bike industry firsts - its 1981 Stumpjumper is enshrined in the Smithsonian Institution as the first mass - produced mountain bike .
From the shop floor at his headquarters in Morgan Hill , Calif. , Sinyard , 58 , tells FSB his story .
I have always loved bikes .
My dad was a machinist , and we worked on them together when I was a kid .
Later on I used to ride my bike seven or eight miles a day to campus when I was taking classes at San Jose State University .
To support myself , I bought old bikes at flea markets and fixed them up , then put ads in the paper to sell them .
I started out as an aviation major but quit soon after I realized I was a terrible pilot .
I decided to enroll in business school .
I thought there might be an opportunity importing high - end bike parts from Europe .
Back in those days I had to search high and low for well - made components for my own bike , and I knew my friends wanted them too .
While quality bikes were huge in Europe , over here most folks were riding basic Huffys .
But there was a small contingent piecing together cool Italian bikes .
After graduation in 1972 , I decided to take a bike tour through Europe .
To finance the trip , I sold my old Volkswagen bus for $ 1,500 .
Three months into the tour , after riding from Amsterdam to Milan , I met a Swiss woman at a hostel and started talking to her about biking .
She knew a few Italian cyclists and said she would help me land a meeting with key staff at Campagnolo and Cinelli , two big Italian bicycle manufacturers .
Up to that point , I had been traveling in a pair of jeans and a sweater I had n't washed in a couple of months , so I spent some of my remaining money on a suit so I would n't look like a bum .
Sitting with legendary component maker Cino Cinelli , I exaggerated a little and told him I was connected with all the top riders in the U.S.
He seemed taken with my appreciation and enthusiasm for his products , and I used my remaining $ 1,200 to buy as many handlebars and stems as I could - exotic parts not readily available in the U.S.
When I returned to San Jose I had no money left .
I stored the products under my trailer so they would n't get wet .
In Italy the artisans who craft lugs , frames , and tubing are considered specialists .
I named the company Specialized Bicycle Components after them because I wanted to have a connection to that European passion and quality , something that would distinguish my products from the mainstream bikes popular at the time .
I did n't have a car , so I came up with an efficient way to market the components : I outfitted my bike with the parts and rode to nearby stores .
The first few dealers were skeptical ; they had no idea who I was and did n't know if they could trust me to deliver additional inventory .
But they bought the products and waited to see if I could deliver more .
I sold out the first shipment but did n't make money .
My bank would n't give me a loan , so I tried another tactic : I went to the bike shops and told them that if they gave me a cash advance for additional parts , I 'd sell to them at a lower price than if they insisted on buying from my inventory .
For the shops that agreed , I used a markup price of about 15 % more than what I paid wholesale .
For stores that waited until they saw products , I 'd tack on an additional 10 % .
That is how I financed the company for the next year and a half .
It was n't always easy .
I insisted that the stores pay COD , because I did n't have extra money .
One time a $ 1,000 check from a store near San Francisco bounced .
When I called the owner about it , he gave me some big story about how he 'd eventually get around to paying it .
I knew he was lying , and he refused to return the merchandise .
I sent my roommate up there with a check to buy the shipment I had just sold to the store and then had him cancel my check .
I called the owner and said , " That great sale you made ?
Well , that was my roommate , and now my check has the same value as the one you gave me . "
At that time I was selling to about 25 bike shops , most of them in the Bay Area .
In exchange for the pink slip to my trailer , the bank finally gave me my first loan , for $ 1,500 .
When I paid that back a few months later , they gave me an additional $ 10,000 .
I lived without a car for five years after I started Specialized , which gave me a lot of time to think and observe how folks ride bikes .
I was selling parts to a lot of independent bike - frame builders on the West Coast , and I started to notice their dissatisfaction with tires .
The ones we were importing from Italy were n't very good .
They'd have bubbles along the treads and did n't last .
I remember calling the factory to tell them about it , but they told me I was crazy .
One of my friends , Jim Merz , was a framemaker based in Portland , Ore. , who cycled from Oregon to Panama every year .
I started researching rubber compounds so that I could develop my own tires .
When I finally had something that worked for me , I sent it to Merz to test ; he must have worn through about 40 tires .
After a year of experimenting , I launched our first product : the Specialized Touring Tire .
At first only a couple of my most loyal bike shops bought them .
But eventually the tires hit a chord with our customers - they told us the tires rode better than the imported ones .
The tire was a breakthrough for us , brandwise .
Suddenly we were more than just importers .
We were innovators .
Our next big turning point came a few years later , in 1981 .
I was selling a lot of crank sets and tubing to Marin County framemakers such as Tom Richey , and I noticed that these guys were building bikes that were equipped to handle the rugged trails of Northern California 's foothills .
I had never seen anything like them .
Intuitively , I knew this mountain bike was going to be the next big thing , a product of a West Coast culture not unlike surfing .
Old folks and young kids who watched men ride these bikes had the same reaction - they wanted to try it .
We designed a bike with features that could withstand off - road trails .
We named it the Stumpjumper , and it was the first mountain cycle that you could buy in bike stores .
It turned out to be a niche - oriented product .
Only about five or six of our stores wanted anything to do with it .
The rest asked us , " What are you doing with this big kid 's BMX bike ?
Customers will get hurt on that thing . "
Sales were slow until mountain biking finally took off in the mid-1980s .
We continued to launch new tires and bikes .
In the early 1990s we had 115 employees and were selling to some 1,500 stores nationwide .
But I remember thinking how I did n't really know what I was doing .
I had never had another job and figured the time had come to hire a boss , someone from outside the cycling world who could lead us into the future .
I hired three full - time executives , experts with excellent track records in the consumer products industry .
They told me that selling bicycles was no different from marketing basketballs or toothpaste .
Rather than focusing on our core customers , Specialized started slapping its name on anything - hastily made bike helmets , water bottles , etc .
We spun off a cheaper brand called Full Force , which sold at places such as Costco ( COST , Fortune 500 ) .
It felt as if we were becoming more of a distributor than a group of artisans .
This sent a horrible message to our customers .
By the end of 1996 we had lost about 30 % of the bike store business and came within a few hundred dollars of declaring bankruptcy .
The new executives left as things got worse , and I was stuck writing mea culpa letters to all the bike dealers , telling them how badly we blew it and outlining the steps we would take to fix our problems .
It took about three years to get back on track and regain the business we had lost .
Sales started to stall again a few years later , so I approached someone within the industry whom I admired - Peter Moore , the former creative director at Nike ( NKE , Fortune 500 ) and CEO of Adidas .
He was an amateur cyclist , so I mailed him a bike helmet and asked if we could meet .
I flew to Portland , and he told me that I should n't run my company as a salesman .
He advised me to compile a small book emphasizing Specialized 's mission and pass it out to each employee .
Of all the things I 've done in my 33 years at the company , this has been the most valuable .
I feel that if I got run over while riding my bike tomorrow , the company would continue in a clear direction .
For example , in 2003 we created a line of suspension bikes that sold for about $ 5,000 each .
We heard that two or three of the frames had cracked when customers were riding them in extreme conditions .
We could have dealt with the cases one by one , but instead , I recalled the entire line , about 1,500 bikes , because they did n't meet our standards as defined by the brand book .
We 're still trying to be the best cycling brand in the world .
I love what I do , and I will run this company as long as I am able .
I want Specialized to be here forever , and we have a plan to accomplish that .

Stock Market Diversification Works !
The Proof
To make money in the stock market , all you need is a proper asset allocation and time .
If you ’re nervous about the stock market recently , you ’re not alone .
Your anxieties over your investments may be attributed to several reasons .
Could you be overexposed to the stock market ?
Is your portfolio too concentrated in just a few asset classes ?
Have you been investing for only a short period of time ?
If you agreed with any of these points , then your concerns may be justified .
But fear not !
By reviewing past stock market performance and by appreciating the evidence put forth by long - standing investment principles , we should be able to develop portfolios that are less vulnerable to market swings and which can afford better returns over time .
I know some people who will never put their money in the stock market , arguing that “ it ’s just like gambling . ”
I get into some in depth debates with them about this , but to no avail — some people just equate stock market risk — or maybe any investment risk for that matter — to gambling risk , which is the worst kind of risk since the odds are set against you .
True , there is risk with participating in the stock market , but this is something you can easily control and manage when you take a few strategies into consideration .
You wo n’t need a doctorate in economics to become convinced that these strategies work : the historical performance of market portfolios can speak for themselves .
From my studies and experience , I discovered that I ’d do well with the stock market if :
# 1 My investments are well - diversified and have a reasonable asset allocation .
( Diversification )
# 2 My investments are subject to a long enough time horizon .
( Time )
Let ’s check out some numbers behind these statements made available to us by the Motley Fool .
How Diversification and Asset Allocation Affect Your Investment Returns
Over the last 35 years , here were the annual returns and standard deviations ( among other measures ) for 4 different asset classes : U.S. stocks , foreign stocks , REITs and Commodities .
If you had placed all your funds in any one of these asset classes , it ’s clear that you would n’t have done as well as you would have if you had instead divided your money into four equal parts and placed each 25 % portion into each of the asset classes to create a mixed portfolio comprised of all 4 asset classes .
1972 – 2007 U.S. Stocks International Stocks Real Estate Investment Trusts Commodities Four - Asset Portfolio Return * 11.19 % 11.75 % 13.01 % 11.65 % 13.22 % $ 1 turned into … $ 45.50 $ 54.53 $ 81.79 $ 52.81 $ 87.31 Standard deviation 17.02 21.66 17.37 24.52 11.00 Sharpe ratio 0.39 0.35 0.48 0.34 0.68 Worst 1 - year return - 26.45 % - 23.20 % - 21.42 % - 35.75 % - 12.77 % Worst 3 - year return * - 14.56 % - 17.00 % - 10.49 % - 9.58 % - 0.56 % Worst 5 - year return * - 2.31 % - 2.61 % 3.29 % - 4.53 % 3.34 % Worst 10 - year return * 5.91 % 4.30 % 9.14 % 2.11 % 8.74 %
* Compound annual total return .

Large caps from S&P 500 ; REITs from NAREIT Index ; international from Europe , Australasia , and Far East Index ; commodities from Goldman Sachs Commodity Index .
Through this example , we see that the use of asset allocation to produce a diversified portfolio has improved returns over time , as well as limited the portfolio ’s downside .
This 4 asset portfolio gives us :
A decrease in volatility ( as evidenced by a lower standard deviation ) ,
A higher risk - adjusted return ( represented by the higher Sharpe ratio ) ,
Much better returns across the board for the worst case scenarios ( worst 1 year , 3 year , 5 year and 10 year returns ) .
You can see fairly similar results when you review this table , which swaps out commodities for U.S. small stocks in the asset class comparisons :
1972 – 2007 Large Cap U.S. Stocks International Stocks Real Estate Investment Trusts Small Cap U.S. Stocks Equal parts of 4 asset classes , occasionally rebalanced Annual Return 11.19 % 11.7 % 12.9 % 14.3 % 13.1 % Standard deviation 17.02 21.66 17.4 22.5 15.7 Worst 1 - year return ( 26.45 % ) ( 23.2 % ) ( 21.4 % ) ( 30.9 % ) ( 22.5 % ) Worst 3 - year return ( 14.56 % ) ( 17.00 % ) ( 10.49 % ) ( 16.7 % ) ( 9.5 % ) Worst 5 - year return ( 2.31 % ) ( 2.61 % ) 3.29 % 0.6 % 4.8 %
We ’re seeing similar conclusions here as those put forth in my previous article on foreign stock allocations as well as this article on the seven - asset portfolio ( at Seeking Alpha ) , that concludes that you ’ll get the best diversification benefits by incorporating asset classes that have low correlations to each other .
Some highlights from the Seven - Asset Portfolio article by professor Craig Israelsen :
# 1 Diversification works ( surprise surprise ) !
When additional asset classes are added to a portfolio , you improve returns and limit the worst one - year drawdown of the total portfolio .
# 2 The major changes to a portfolio occur when commodities and REITs are added to it because these asset classes have low correlations to core equity asset classes .
When people buy foreign stocks , they think they are diversified .
But the three main equity asset classes have correlations of 0.7 to 0.9 .
You do n’t get a lot of correlation benefit from adding more equities to an equity portfolio .
Cash is a good diversifier , and so are bonds .
But they do n’t have a very attractive long - term return .
The real benefit comes when you add REITs and commodities .
They have equity - like returns , but low correlations … and in one important way , they have lower risk than equities .
# 3 An investment portfolio can be improved by being a bit more exotic .
# 4 Commodities are n’t as radical as you may think since they recover much more quickly than stocks , which tend to ride on trends and momentum for longer periods of time .
This means that though commodities may generally have a higher standard deviation ( overall volatility ) , they also tend to snap away from a losing streak faster than equities do , so their worst periods tend to be less significant than the worst case scenarios presented by equities .
At this time , our portfolio does not yet carry REITs nor commodities , but my research has convinced me to incorporate these types of investments in our portfolio .
I ’ve actually set the stage for this by writing out my recommendations in this post : Beat The Average Investor ’s Returns With The Simplest Investment Portfolio , which I consider to be one of the most important investment posts I ’ve written to date .
I ’ll be reorienting our current portfolio to improve on our allocations based on diversification concepts I ’ve learned .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
If Michael Phelps were to melt down the eight gold medals he won at the Beijing Olympics Games and sell the gold , he could probably only make about $ 1,225 .
The famed gold medals are mostly made of silver , not gold .
Only six grams , or 0.19 ounce , of gold is required to coat the medal .
With gold futures closing at $ 806 an ounce on Monday , an Olympic gold medalist could n't ask much more for the precious metal -- but the value of the precious medal would be much higher .
" I wish these hard - working athletes got ' the real thing ' , " said Jon Nadler , a senior analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers .
" But the medals are worth more than their weight in gold anyway . "
In 2004 , Polish swimmer Otylia Jedrzejczak auctioned off her gold medal from the Athens Olympics for $ 82,599 and donated the money to a Polish charity helping children with leukemia .
The Polish Mint made her a replica of her medal .
Currently available on Internet auction site eBay is a silver medal from the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
According to the listing , it 's from a member of the Cuban baseball team , and carries a starting bid of $ 7,999.99 .
Each Beijing Olympics gold medal weighs about 150 grams .
The medal contains mostly silver , according to the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad .
Also for the first time , jade is being used for the Olympic medals .
Jade is n't traded in an open market so it is difficult to evaluate its price .
Assuming a gold medal contains 146 grams of silver and six grams of gold , the metals in each medal would be worth a bit more than $ 215 based on Monday 's closing prices .
The International Olympic Committee requires the gold medal to contain a minimum of six grams of gold .
Huang Ping , vice president of Shanghai - based China Banknote Printing and Minting Corp. , the producer of the medals , said in an interview with China Business News that the amount of gold in each medal was strictly controlled at 6.0 to 6.1 grams .
Despite an effort to reduce costs , record - high metals prices have meant that producing 6,000 gold , silver and bronze metals for the 2008 Olympics and the Paralympics is costing China millions of dollars .
Gold prices have more than doubled since the Athens Olympics of 2004 .
Ironically , China itself was blamed as one of the biggest contributors to the rise in commodity prices .
Producing the medals turned out to be very time consuming .
One employee could only make 10 medals in one day when the company started the manufacturing process in October , Huang said .
The medals , with a diameter of 70 millimeters ( 2.76 inches ) and a thickness of 6 millimeters , have a design inspired by China 's traditional bi disk -- in principle , a flat disk with an opening in the center , historically made of jade and often inscribed with dragon patterns .
The medals have the standard design prescribed by the IOC on one side -- depicting the winged goddess of victory Nike and the Panathinaikos Arena .
On the reverse side , the medals are inlaid with a disk of jade , which represents ethics and honor in China .
BHP Billiton BHP , - 2.16 % , the world 's largest mining company , provided raw materials for medal production .
The company 's Cannington mine in northwest Queensland , Australia , supplied silver used in the production of both the gold and silver medals .
The Escondida mine in Chile supplied copper concentrate that contains gold for the gold medals , and the bronze was from Spence mine , also in Chile .
Sure , it looks easy enough .
Post a video of yourself wiggling your butt on Wii Fit , dancing your way across the globe , or practicing your Jedi Knight moves , and -- presto !
You 're the next Web sensation , swept along by the viral nature of the Internet .
But corporations , politicians , and others who have attempted to manipulate the Net to their own ends have discovered that it is n't as easy as it appears .
True viralness can't be manufactured , no matter how many phony blogs and tasteless videos you generate .
Whether you 're selling Chevys , shilling for Cheetos , or simply trying to rise above the noise , certain rules apply :
Do n't fake it .
Do n't pretend to be cool when you 're not .
And never underestimate the intelligence of the crowd or its sheer delight in exposing you as a fraud .
The following ten campaigns did n't follow these rules , earning them a permanent spot in the Marketing Hall of Lame .
10 . Mike Gravel : ' Rock '
Mike who ?
A 78 - year - old former senator from Alaska running for president on the Cranky Old Guy platform was a long shot at best .
Gravel hoped to overcome the odds using viral video , of which the most notable is titled simply " Rock . "
The video shows Gravel standing in front of a pond ; he glares at the camera for 71 seconds , walks over to a rock the size of a soccer ball , heaves it into the water , and then walks slowly off into the distance as ripples spread across the water .
Is he angry at the camera , the rock , or the fact that only 47 people voted for him ?
We 'll never know .
Needless to say , the words " President Mike Gravel " wo n't be escaping anyone 's lips any time soon .
Lame : Hoping that YouTube would make people vote for you despite your not having held public office since 1981 .
Lamer : Gravel 's Shatneresque rendition of " Helter Skelter . "
Look out !
He 's coming down fast .
Yes , he is .
9. Chevy Tahoe : Roll Your Own Commercial
When General Motors teamed up with NBC's The Apprentice to promote the Chevy Tahoe SUV in March 2006 , somebody had a brilliant idea .
Why not let viewers build their own commercials on the Web ?
Promotional spots on the show directed viewers to ChevyApprentice.com , where viewers could build ads using GM - supplied video and music and adding their own creative text .
( That URL now just redirects you to the Tahoe site . )
But instead of loving paeans to urban assault vehicles , hundreds of videos appeared portraying the Tahoe as a gas guzzling , safety - challenged ego enhancement for environmentally irresponsible dorks with diminutive sexual organs .
After a couple weeks of abuse , GM scrubbed the videos from its site , but many live on at YouTube .
We do n't know who came up with this brilliant idea , but we can guess what happened next .
To quote Apprentice - master Donald Trump : " You 're fired ! "
Lame : Allowing people to create their own marketing messages , and then being surprised when they do .
Lamer : Donald Trump 's hair .
Have a candidate to nominate for this list ?
Disagree with us ?

Last week , Tattooed Zune Boy decided he was annoyed with Microsoft 's apparent lack of Zune updates and information , and said he was going to cover up his three Zune tattoos .
He said he would still be purchasing Zunes but that he was gonna go out and look at the alternatives .
Soon after , in a post on the Zune Scene forums entitled " Bought my new PMP today .... " , mszunefan announced what he ended up buying :
And low and behold it 's a black iPod Classic 80gb .
When I was in Best Buy I looked around at the other players , the sold no creatives in the store , the only choices with iPods , Zunes , Insignas , Samsung and Sony .
So when looking at which had everything available in store ( I despise UPS ) I went with the iPod .
I more than likely will regret this decision but I will let you all know down the road .
I do like the weight and feel of the device thus far .
I may still not be able to wrap my head around how someone can get a tattoo based on their love for a product , let alone three , and then decide to get rid of them , but I find it even more ironic the Zune has just lost arguably its most loyal fan to Apple .
Just like when you choose a Mac over a Windows - based computer , when you buy a Zune , are n't you buying it because you prefer to the iPod ?
The Zune does offer a few features that the iPod line does not , but this latest cry for attention from mszunefan only further shows how much more work Microsoft has to do .
There still has n't been any news ( not even a rumor ) about the third generation Zune nor on expansion beyond the US and Canada .
“ What we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions , ” said Brian Roehrkasse , a spokesman for the Justice Department .
“ None of that serves the victims , their families or the public .
Likewise , we will not discuss reports or details on the timing of briefings to the public or victims and their families .
We will provide such details to the press at the appropriate time , and not before . ”
Dr. Ivins , who worked on anthrax vaccines for 18 years at the military research facility at Fort Detrick in Frederick , Md. , took a fatal overdose of Tylenol and codeine last week at his home near the base .
He had been under investigation for more than a year in the anthrax killings and had recently been told that the Justice Department was on the verge of seeking an indictment against him on capital murder charges .
Federal officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity because the case remains under seal , said they were confident that Dr. Ivins was the anthrax killer and that he had acted alone .
They said that new scientific methods had allowed the F.B.I. to trace the genetic makeup of the anthrax sample to Dr. Ivins and a pool of about 10 other people who had access to a particular supply of anthrax at Fort Detrick .
Other evidence , much of it still undisclosed , amounted to a strong circumstantial case against him , the officials said .
Perhaps the most provocative piece of evidence to emerge publicly is the testimony of a therapist who treated Dr. Ivins in recent months and described him as homicidal .
But Dr. Ivins ’s lawyer has asserted his innocence , and a number of colleagues at Fort Detrick have defended him , saying that his recent mental state and his suicide were the result of many months of near - constant surveillance and scrutiny by the F.B.I. , not a reflection of his guilt .
Some government officials have also questioned the strength of the bureau ’s case and said they were eager to see the grand jury documents .
One Congressional official briefed on the case said he was not persuaded that the F.B.I. had made a credible case in singling out Dr. Ivins in the group of people at Fort Detrick who had access to anthrax samples linked to the 2001 attacks .
The F.B.I. may be able to point to odd behavior on the part of Dr. Ivins , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case is under seal .
But he said the attention the bureau focused on Dr. Ivins was reminiscent of a past misstep : “ It looks like what they did to Hatfill .
Ivins was the weirdest one . ”
Will We Ever Pay for an Album Again ?
The latest trend to hit the music industry : artists giving away their songs .
May 9 , 2008  --
Has the music industry reached a tipping point ?
Unless you 're a fan of industrial grunge , you may not have read this week that the group Nine Inch Nails — which these days is basically musical prodigy Trent Reznor with a whole lot of time in the recording studio — has just released its new album , The Slip , for free off the NIN website .
" As a thank you to our fans for your continued support , we are giving away the new Nine Inch Nails album one hundred percent free , exclusively via nin.com , " Reznor wrote on the site to his millions of fans .
He has also reportedly said : " This one 's on me . "
Just as interesting , on the same page , Reznor tells the downloaders : " We encourage you to remix it , share it with your friends , post it on your blog , play it on your podcast , give it to strangers , etc . "
In other words , Reznor is not only giving the album to his fans , but also giving them carte blanche to pass it around , cut it up , mash it … heck , even sell it if they can figure out a way .
I 'm not a NIN fanatic , but I have been a big admirer of Reznor 's work ( and the videos even more ) for many years .
And I know that he has long railed against the record industry , and has had more than his share of disputes with his record company .
So , it 's good to see him stepping up and literally putting his money where his mouth is .
Better yet , the early reviews suggest that The Slip is a very good album — maybe not Pretty Hate Machine , but perhaps as good as Broken … which is pretty impressive , and easily makes the case that Reznor is giving away the very best he can do at this point in his career .
And that too says something important .
Late last year , when Radiohead set this new wave in motion by giving away In Rainbows , I used this column to cheer their move as the arrival of Web 2.0 thinking to music .
But at the same time , after listening to album a few times , I was n't sure Radiohead had really given us its " A " game .
Several months of listening have changed my mind :
In Rainbows is n't The Bends ( or , heaven knows , OK Computer ) but its rhythm - driven tracks are both mesmerizing and addictive .
Radiohead , like Nine Inch Nails , not only gave away a record , but some of its best stuff .
Now , add to that the news last week that Coldplay was offering a free downloadable track , " Violet Hill , " from its upcoming album Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends .
So great was the demand by downloaders that Coldplay 's Web site temporarily crashed .
Nevertheless , this Wednesday the band announced that two million downloads of the track had already taken place — its spokesperson proudly announcing that " It would have outsold the whole of last week 's top 40 [ singles ] four times over . "
In other words , in the last six months , the world 's greatest band , the world 's most admired cult band , and the world 's most popular band have all decided to give their creations — worth tens of millions of dollars — away to their fans .
That 's the trifecta folks : popular music will never again be the same .
You might have dismissed Radiohead 's move as just the latest of leader Thom Yorke 's wacky anti-capitalist crusades , and Coldplay 's move as just clever PR for its new album and tour ( and , somehow , Chris Martin's own Fair Trade crusade ) — but with NIN now in the game , its hard to argue that this is anything but a harbinger of the future .
Had only Mariah Carey given away part of her new album E=MC2 — yeah , like that would happen — this wave would have become instant tsunami .
Still and all , I now think there is no going back .
With bands this big now pursuing a whole new " open source " business model with their music , it 's going to be very difficult for any group to try to market their new albums through traditional distribution channels using standard retail pricing schemes .
And that , in turn , means that the death of the established music industry , which until now seemed like a long slide to oblivion , is now much more imminent .
The simple fact is that you can't compete with free , especially if you are locked ( through heavy capital investment in facilities and recording and manufacturing equipment , as well as traditional hierarchal corporate models ) into the old way of doing business .
If you can't sell your core product — i.e. , recorded music — then you have to make money from secondary sources .
In the music world , that secondary business includes tours , promotional items and specialty packaging … all of which are owned by the bands themselves .
The record industry thought that it was the core business and the musicians were merely replaceable content .
It was the same mistake made by the newspaper industry … and both have discovered to their dismay that , caught between the bands and Steve Jobs ( or the journalist and the reader ) they were in fact merely the middlemen .
And technology has rendered their role obsolete .
Who 's next ?
Probably magazines .
Just look at how Time magazine is now recapitulating the mistakes made by the newspaper industry : getting rid of its best talent , bleeding advertisers , and reverting to shock covers and increasingly biased coverage to hold onto its core readership ( and thus compromising its core competency ) .
If you think Time and Newsweek are shockingly thin now , just wait .
Meanwhile , back in the music industry , it 's interesting to speculate who will be next to adopt the free download model .
Wilco is all but doing it now with its live recordings , as are a number of other indy bands .
But if we really are at the tipping point in the story of the music industry , then some really huge pop act will take the plunge next .
Perhaps it will be a teen act , such as Miley Cyrus or the Jonas Brothers .
I 'd go with Cyrus — in part because she 's already made a ton of money , but mostly because she now needs to cement her connection to her adolescent audience as she ( and they ) transition into adulthood .
And , the Vanity Fair shoot aside , dad Billy Ray has been a pretty shrewd manager of her career so far .
Hillary Duff should be doing the same .
And Britney Spears should have done it with her last album ( though she probably needed the bucks ) .
It 's a long ways from Trent Reznor to Miley Cyrus — but then again , it was a long ways too from LPs to MP3 .
If the music industry has indeed reached its tipping point — and I think it has with this week 's news — things will only accelerate as we race into the new , free , music world .

Hezbollah Brigades ’ logo is nearly identical to that of Lebanese Hezbollah .
Coalition special forces teams , likely the terrorist hunter - killer teams of Task Force 88 , have captured a Hezbollah Brigades propaganda specialist during a raid in New Baghdad .
The propaganda specialist was positively identified by his wife after the raid , and he later admitted to his role in seeding websites with attack videos .
“ The man uploads web sites with imagery and video taken from attacks on Iraqi Security and Coalition forces , ” Multinational Forces Iraq reported in a press release .
“ Reports indicate this is part of a propaganda effort in order to earn money and support from their Iranian financiers . ”
Little information is publicly available on the Hezbollah Brigades , or the Kata’ib Hezbollah .
Multinational Forces Iraq indicates the group receives support from Iran and is an “ offshoot of Iranian - trained Special Groups . ”
The logo used by the Hezbollah Brigades is nearly an exact match of the one used by Lebanese Hezbollah , which is directly supported by Iran .
The logo shows an arm extended vertically , with the fist grasping an AK - 47 assault rifle .
US forces captured Ali Mussa Daqduq inside Iraq in early 2007 .
Daqduq is a senior Hezbollah commander who was tasked with setting up the Mahdi Army Special Groups along the same lines as the Lebanese terror group .
The Hezbollah Brigades began uploading videos of attacks on US and Iraqi forces this year .
The group has claimed responsibility for the July 8 improvised rocket - assisted mortar , or IRAM , attack on Joint Security Station Ur in northeastern Baghdad [ see video ] .
One US soldier and one interpreter were wounded after eight of the makeshift “ flying IEDs ” detonated near the outpost .
Shia terror groups have launched a handful of IRAM attacks on US and Iraqi outposts in Baghdad .
Hezbollah Brigades also posted video of an attack on a US patrol with an Iranian - supplied , armor - piercing , explosively formed projectile , or EFP .
The capture of the Hezbollah Brigades propaganda expert is the latest in a series of raids against Shia terrorists .
Scores of Special Groups operatives have been captured over the past month , including senior leaders , weapons smugglers , financiers , trainers , and cell leaders .

Intel ’s next generation of desktop and mobile processors will retain the chip giant ’s Core brand , the company said this morning .
No great surprise there , but they wo n’t be ‘ Core 3 ’ parts .
Nehalem architecture chips will be marked ‘ i7 ’ , instead , though Intel further muddied the waters by telling us to expect other such codes for different next - gen CPUs as the roll - out continues through 2009 .
The logos Intel published today suggest that while it will continue to offer Extreme - class CPUs , aimed at gamers , they ’ll be distinguished visually simply by a black version of the blue logo to be attached to boxes and machines containing regular desktop Core i7s .
There ’s logic to the use of ‘ i7 ’ : just as Pentium was Intel ’s fifth - generation processor architecture , so the new Cores will be its seventh major x86 CPU design .
The fourth quarter will see the introduction of a pair of mainstream desktop quad - core parts and a single Extreme chip .
All three processors are codenamed ‘ Bloomfield ’ .
The Extreme part is set to clock at 3.2GHz and connects directly to 1333MHz DDR 3 memory .
The other two Bloomfields will run at 2.93MHz and 2.66GHz , respectively , and connect to 1066MHz DDR 3 .
All three chips can link to three channels of memory .
Brain researchers for the first time claim to have found a method for improving the general problem - solving ability scientists call fluid intelligence , otherwise known as " smarts . "
Fluid intelligence was previously thought to be genetically hard - wired , but the finding suggests that with about 25 minutes of rigorous mental training a day , healthy adults could improve their mental capacities .
The method , if commercialized , could be a boon to the growing , multimillion - dollar market for " brain fitness " software like Nintendo's Brain Age .
" The most important point of our work is that we can show that it is possible to improve fluid intelligence , " said Martin Buschkuehl , a psychology researcher based at the University of Bern , Switzerland .
" It was assumed that fluid intelligence was immutable . "
Fluid intelligence measures how people adapt to new situations and solve problems they 've never seen before .
Fluid intelligence differs from crystallized intelligence , which takes into account skills and knowledge that have been acquired – like vocabulary , grammar and math .
It 's not hard , for example , for students to improve their IQ scores by taking lots of IQ tests .
Trouble is , learning how to take IQ tests does n't improve the underlying smarts .
The students just get better at taking tests .
In practical terms , people can get better at taking tests , but in daily life , do n’t have a blazingly quick new brain .
And that 's where Buschkuehl 's research , which appears today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , claims to be groundbreaking .
In a limited trial , he and his team were able to make 34 test subjects significantly better at answering IQ test questions after training them on a completely separate memory task .
David Geary , a professor at the University of Missouri and author of The Origin of Mind , who was not involved with the study , said training in one test generally does n’t generate gains on a different test .
" Transfer is tough to get , " Geary said .
" Training in task A does n’t typically improve performance on task B . "
But in this case , subjects trained on a complex version of the so - called " n- back task " – a difficult visual / auditory memory test – improved their scores on a set of IQ questions drawn from a German intelligence measure called the Bochumer Matrizen - Test .
( The Bochumer Matrizen - Test is a harder version of the well - known Ravens Progressive Matrices ) .
Initially , the test subjects scored an average of 10 questions correctly on the IQ test .
But after the group trained on the n-back task for 25 minutes a day for 19 days , they averaged 14.7 correct answers , an increase of more than 40 percent .
( A control group that was not trained showed only a very slight performance increase . )
Buschkuehl 's team postulates that the n-back task improves working memory – how many pieces of information subjects can keep in their head – as well as the ability to control the brain 's attention .
Fluid intelligence tests require those types of thinking , and the training improved performance in these underlying skills .
" These are intriguing results , " Geary said .
However , Geary noted that to claim actual increases in fluid intelligence , the subjects would have to show the performance gains over a long - term period – or even permanently .
The Michigan researchers are now engaged in studying the long - term effects of training .
They are also working to increase the amount of training that users undergo .
In the experiment reported in PNAS , the researchers did not find the upper - limit for improvement , suggesting that more training could yield even better mental performance gains .
" The improvement seems to be dosage dependent , " Buschkuehl said .
" We saw a linear increase in performance with increase in training time . "
In the simplest version of the n-back task , a sequence of images is presented every few seconds and subjects are asked to match a picture to an identical one that came previously , say two pictures before it .
( For example , in the picture above , the blue square should be in the same location . )
Buschkuehl 's subjects , however , also heard a second stream of letters and had to match the sounds at the same time as they matched the visuals .
This makes the task very challenging .
And as the subjects got better , the gap between matching pictures and letters got bigger , making the task progressively more difficult .
The team has developed a new n-back computer program called Brain Twister , which they have translated into English , but is not available online .
They do not plan to commercialize the software , but with mental gyms like Vibrant Brains in San Francisco springing up , and brain training software companies like Posit Science drawing big - name investors , you can bet you 'll be seeing the n-back task on sale sooner rather than later .
In fact , revenue from " brain - fitness software " reached $ 225 million in 2007 , according to SharpBrains , a market - research firm .
In the meantime , a very simplified , DIY version of the n-back is described here .
Neurobehavioral Sciences also offers a 45 - day free trial of their neuroscience stimuli program presentation , which is primarily a research tool , and only available for the PC .

Algebra .
The very word can twist the stomachs of otherwise well - adjusted adults , dredging up memories of nonsensical X's and Y's and a lifelong loathing of math .
For many , the math course was the educational equivalent of castor oil , forced down the throats of teenagers who questioned when they would ever encounter that train leaving Boston at 60 mph .
In July , the state Board of Education decided every eighth - grader must have a healthy dose of algebra - a decision critics attacked as failing to recognize the lack of qualified math teachers and the high failure rate for the middle school students already taking it .
Supporters , however , argued algebra improves critical thinking , is the gateway to college and puts all kids , regardless of income or ethnicity , on the path to a good career .
Lost in the debate was , well , algebra .
" I doubt if the politicians promoting this have any idea what they 're promoting , " said Keith Devlin , Stanford University researcher and mathematics professor , as well as the " Math Guy " on National Public Radio .
" Few people know what algebra is . "
Algebra , says Devlin , is a language , a very precise language written in symbols , and it 's everywhere : in nearly all electronic devices , every statistic and each Internet search engine - and , indeed , in every train leaving Boston .
" You can store information using it .
You can communicate information using it , " Devlin said .
" Google has made billions capitalizing on algebra . "
Yet our schools do n't always do a very good job teaching it , Devlin said .
Instead of showing students the possibilities and beauty algebra offers , they ultimately steer frustrated and bored students away from math and the 21st century careers that use it - the opposite of the intended result .
' We 're turning kids off '
" Most of us who become mathematicians do so not because of our education but in spite of it , " Devlin said .
" We 're turning kids off a subject that is useful and incredibly interesting and beautiful if taught correctly . "
Too often , algebra is taught as a set of rules and procedures - the equivalent of teaching a foreign language through vocabulary lists and repetitive conjugation of verbs , the students never understanding they could use the information to order a meal in Madrid or make a friend in China .
In short , the teacher matters .
A lot .
Just ask Alameda artist Alana Dill .
" I first took algebra in eighth grade from a bilious , creepy teacher who called all the girls ' hon ' and all the boys ' son , ' " said Dill , 46 , in an e-mail .
" He talked like Foghorn Leghorn .
I learned nothing . "
Devlin would like to see " mathematicians in residence " - in the tradition of artists in residence - at middle schools and high schools .
They could visit schools , he suggested , and show students the cool side of math - like how an iPod uses algebra to play music .
" At any age , we will take the drudgery as long as we see a reason to do it , " Devlin said .
Algebra , by the dictionary 's definition , is essentially abstract arithmetic , letters and symbols representing relationships between groups , sets , matrices or fields .
It 's a way to find a piece to a puzzle using the pieces you already have in place .
It comes in very handy for engineers , financial analysts and sociologists , not to mention World of Warcraft video game players , some of whom use algebraic formulas to decide which weapon is more effective under certain circumstances - perhaps another hook to lure unsuspecting teens into seeing the useful side of algebra .
" It takes the arithmetic you 've learned and lets you answer questions , not just 5 + 4 = what .
It lets you ( change the unknown ) to 5 + what = 20 , " said Brett Wingeier , a biomedical engineer working on brain implants to treat epilepsy .
While that example is simple enough , algebra requires a mental leap from the solid ground of arithmetic into a shifting world of shapes and symbols .
Among the first folks to use algebraic ideas were the Babylonians , who created math puzzles - a 1600 B.C. sudoku , if you will .
Those ancient civilizations did algebra because it was fun .
Former UC Santa Cruz mathematician Paul Lockhart believes today 's schools have killed the fun part .
" In fact , if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a child 's natural curiosity and love of pattern - making , I could n't possibly do as good a job as is currently being done , " he wrote in a 2002 essay that traveled the digital world .
" I simply would n't have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless , soul - crushing ideas that constitute contemporary mathematics education . "
In schools , math is something students are supposed to be afraid of , something that 's supposed to be hard , Lockhart said in a telephone interview from the East Coast , where he now teaches at a private school in Brooklyn .
From art to artillery
Algebra is actually an art , a beautiful leap of the imagination that schools have turned into a field artillery manual , the mathematician said .
Lockhart favors self - discovery in math , letting students explore the hows and the whys themselves , unraveling problems like a fun puzzle rather than learning and solving equations for no apparent reason .
But his vision does n't always translate well to the high - stakes realm of standardized testing , which quite literally requires students to solve for X on the eighth - grade exam .
That can create a conundrum for time - strapped teachers who must teach the straightforward math skills needed for the state 's multiple - choice test .
" I believe everybody can learn algebra , " said San Francisco schools Superintendent Carlos Garcia .
" I 'm just not sure everyone can teach algebra so that the kids understand it and make it fun . "
Garcia has some experience with this .
While he personally did n't like algebra as a kid , he aggressively enrolled eighth - graders in algebra when he was the superintendent in Clark County , Nevada .
He acknowledges that many students failed it , but they were failing basic math anyway .
A local decision
But he disagreed with California 's mandate , saying it should be a local decision based on resources , including the number of qualified teachers .
The Santa Cruz - based Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning slapped a strongly worded warning label on the state 's new algebra requirement , saying the state does n't have nearly enough qualified teachers to do the job .
" Scant attention has been paid to this critical issue , and California 's approach to math instruction still does n't add up , " according to the center 's July report on the issue .
About a third of those teaching Algebra I in state middle schools do not have a credential in math , the center found .
That will get worse with the new requirement , said state Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell .
" My fear is it 's going to turn kids off and contribute to the dropout rate , " warned O'Connell , who recently estimated that it will cost $ 3.1 billion to train and recruit teachers while boosting student proficiency in pre-algebra and arithmetic before the requirement goes into effect in 2011 .
Many teachers say the middle - schoolers wo n't be ready , either .
Understanding algebra requires not only a solid foundation of arithmetic ( fractions , division and decimals , for example ) , but also the maturity to focus on abstract concepts .
" Our plea is , ' Algebra when ready , ' " said Hank Kepner president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics .
" We would not want to put an age level on it . "
Recently retired high school algebra teacher David Goldman called the state board 's decision " farcical . "
" Some kids are not ready for algebra in the eighth grade , " said Goldman , who taught at Redwood High School in Larkspur .
" We 've seen over the years if you try to accelerate that , it just does n't work .
...
At Redwood we saw a lot of kids that came in and then had to repeat it again in the ninth grade . "
Teach it over two years
He supports possibly starting algebra in eighth grade , but slowing it down to a two - year course for some .
Last year , 42 percent of the 250,000 eighth - graders - about half the class - who took algebra scored as proficient or above on the state test .
Business leader Jim Lanich , who applauds the state board 's decision , said schools should get students up to speed in the academic standards at each grade level .
Algebra is eighth - grade math , said Lanich , president of California Business for Education Excellence .
It 's the job of teachers and state schools to get them there - without spending $ 3.1 billion on top of the $ 50 billion the state already spends on its schools .
" The kids are leaving fourth grade now that will be required systemwide to take the eighth - grade Algebra 1 test , " he said .
" We have three years to get them to grade level . "
Laptop computer .
The computer is just an implementation in electrical circuits of a special form of algebra ( called Boolean algebra ) invented in the 19th century .
Ordinary algebra is used to design and manufacture computers , and is at the heart of how to program them .
Cell phone .
A cell phone is a particular kind of computer .
An important feature of cell phones is that your phone receives all the signals sent to every cell phone in the region , but only responds to signals sent to your phone .
This is achieved by using signal coding systems built on algebra .
Parking cop .
Today 's parking enforcement officers may carry equipment connecting them directly to a central vehicle database that registers your parking fine before you get back to the car and see the ticket on the windshield .
Without algebra , such a system could not exist .
Hybrid car .
Modern cars often come equipped with GPS , a highly sophisticated system that is designed using enormous amounts of mathematics that builds on algebra .
Delivery truck .
Large retail chains use mathematical methods to determine the routing and scheduling of their delivery trucks ; algebra is fundamental to those methods .
Stoplight .
These days , stoplights are centrally controlled by computers , so there is even algebra involved in turning the light from red to green .
IPod .
This is a math device in your hand .
The iPod stores music using sophisticated mathematics built on algebra .
And the iPod shuffle mechanism uses regular school algebra to order your songs randomly .
" Stand firm in your refusal to remain conscious during algebra .
In real life , I assure you , there is no such thing as algebra . "
Fran Lebowitz " Algebra ... the intensive study of the last three letters of the alphabet . "
Source unknown " The fact is that there is nothing as dreamy and poetic , nothing as radical , subversive and psychedelic , as mathematics . "
Paul Lockhart , mathematician " I do n't know anybody who uses algebra .
But I 'm not hanging out with architects and engineers . "
Carlos Garcia , San Francisco Unified School District superintendent " Algebra was my three best years of high school . "
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell , joking " Algebra is the gateway to critical thinking , pivotal for success in science , engineering and technology . "
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in a July letter to state school board President Theodore Mitchell
In school " I was more interested in solving the mystery of the Maidenform bra than I was in alge - bra , but the teachers got through to me . "
Chandler
White , 62 , insurance claims adjuster , San Francisco " Algebra definitely set me on a path to study the humanities .
... Literature and philosophy hold many complex concepts that lead to better critical thinking . "
John Koetzner , 53 , community college instructor , Healdsburg " At the risk of perpetuating the stereotype of librarians ...
I 'd be glad to state , on the record , that algebra is uniquely useless in life , and that the only good number is a call number . "
Nadine Walas , 39 , librarian , Pacific Heights " I am 77 years old , a retired priest of the Episcopal Church .
I nearly died trying to do algebra in 1946 . "
Robert Warren Cromey , San Francisco
" What is always to be hoped is that the instructor will reach the kids ' natural curiosity .
Math is actually fun , and it is easy . "

Once upon a time ...
For more than 4,000 years , people have been using algebra to understand time and the heavens , and to build civilizations .
Ever -more - complex technology is the result .
ca. 2000 B.C. Ancient Babylonians first use algebra in building and astronomy .
They construct an accurate calendar and are able to predict eclipses of the sun and moon .
They discover what later becomes known as the Pythagorean theorem , and apparently form a knotted rope into a 3,4,5 right triangle to measure out right angles when constructing buildings .
800 B.C. - A.D. 200 The Greeks , Indians and Chinese all independently develop elementary algebra , apparently viewing it more as an intellectual pursuit than something with practical application .
Like the Babylonians , however , they do use it in building and astronomy .
A.D. 200-700
The Indians develop the subject further , along with the decimal number system we use today .
1202 Leonardo of Pisa writes a book , " Liber abaci , " describing how the algebraic methods developed in India can be used in business , commerce and trade , for buying and selling , distributing profits , exchanging currencies and the like .
ca. 1600 Galileo and others show how to use algebra to understand the world we live in .
This is the birth of modern science , and soon thereafter of technology .
It all starts with the basics From then on , there is a steadily increasing use of algebra - or , more precisely , the sophisticated systems that build on it ( calculus , scheduling , inventory control , network theory ) to design technologies and create greater efficiencies in business and commerce .
For almost all the applications from the 17th century onward , the mathematics used is more advanced than algebra .
But the work builds directly on the algebra learned in school - and , to an outsider , even looks much the same as school algebra , with x's and y's , equations and the like .
Just as the child who learns to pick out " Three Blind Mice " on a piano with one finger can build on that to become a great pianist , so too a child who learns algebra can go on and master more complicated , algebra - based math to do all kinds of cool things .
In both cases , it 's just a matter of learning how to do more complicated versions of the same thing .
Everyone has to start as a beginner .
School algebra is the " Three Blind Mice " of modern science and technology and of many business techniques .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers have transformed ordinary cells into insulin - producing cells in a living mouse , improving symptoms of diabetes in a major step towards regenerative medicine .

The technique , called direct reprogramming , bypasses the need for stem cells -- the body ’s master cells which , until now , have been indispensable to efforts to custom - make tissue and organ transplants .
The researchers used three genes carried by an ordinary virus to transform mouse exocrine cells , which make up about 95 percent of the pancreas , into the scarce insulin - producing beta cells that are destroyed in type 1 or juvenile diabetes .
In theory , the same is possible using abundant human cells such as liver , skin or fat cells , Dr. Douglas Melton and colleagues at Harvard Medical School and Children ’s Hospital in Boston reported .
“ It was easier than one might have thought , ” Melton , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher and one of the world ’s top stem cell experts , said in a telephone interview .
“ These cells are very stable and live for the life of the mouse . ”
Scientists had been counting on stem cells to show them how to regenerate tissues and organs -- in the case of juvenile diabetes , to regenerate the pancreatic cells that are mistakenly destroyed by the body ’s immune system .
“ I wake up every day thinking about how to make beta cells , ” said Melton , whose two children have type 1 diabetes .
The most malleable and promising stem cells have been embryonic stem cells , taken from days - old embryos .
But U.S. federal law strictly limits funding for such research and they are not easy to create .
CELL REPROGRAMMING
Last year , researchers discovered how to reprogram ordinary skin cells by taking them back to an embryonic - like state .
These induced pluripotent stem cells can be used to study disease and might one day make tailor - made transplants .
But now Melton and his team -- using knowledge gained from these earlier studies -- have skipped both steps .
“ What this shows is that you can go directly from one type of adult cell to another , without going back to the beginning , ” said Melton .
Reporting in the journal Nature , the team said they did it in living mice , not in lab dishes .
They worked with diabetic mice that do not have the insulin - producing cells needed by the pancreas to help the body turn food into energy .
Melton ’s team had to find which genes were needed to make cells function as the precious beta-cells .
While every cell carries the full genetic code , only certain genes in any cell are working at any given time .
The researchers had to find out which genes are “ on ” as an embryo grows its pancreas .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Out of more than 1,000 genes , they found just three were needed -- Ngn3 , Pdx1 , and Mafa .
Then an ordinary cold virus called an adenovirus carried these three genes into the digestive - juice - making exocrine cells of the pancreas .
This converted about 20 percent of the exocrine cells to beta cells that produced insulin , in turn lowering the soaring blood sugar levels in the mice .
The method might work first in people with severe type 2 diabetes , whose bodies no longer make insulin , Melton said .
“ For type 1 diabetes we are still faced with the annoying problem of autoimmune attack , ” he said .
Any transformed cells in type 1 diabetes would be destroyed by the same mistaken immune response that caused the disease in the first place .
Before experiments begin in people , Melton wants to find a way to transform cells without using a virus .
Using viruses to treat people , he noted , is risky and makes Food and Drug Administration experts nervous .
Picasso's work was some of the 20th Century 's most famous
Police in Brazil have recovered an engraving by Pablo Picasso that was stolen from a museum in Sao Paulo .
The Painter and the Model was taken in a daylight robbery in June from the state - owned Estacao Pinacoteca museum .
Police said an arrested suspect had led them to the engraving , wrapped in a plastic bag and hidden in an attic , apparently in perfect condition .
Another Picasso and two paintings by Brazilian artists stolen in the same robbery have not yet been recovered .
The man arrested was held on suspicion of trying to steal a cash machine , but instead led police to the stolen Picasso .
" We were taken by surprise , " Inspector Cesar Carlos Dias told the Associated Press .
" We were keeping an eye on [ the suspect ] and two other men because we had information they were planning to steal automatic teller machines and rob banks .
" In a tapped phone conversation , the Picasso print was mentioned . "
The man , a 30 - year - old Sao Paulo resident , was arrested on charges of robbery , police said .
The two Picasso engravings and the other works stolen in June have a combined estimated value of 1 million Brazilian reals ( US $ 630,000 ) , museum officials have said .
Sao Paulo has a history of art thefts : a painting by Picasso was among two works stolen from the city 's Museum of Art that were recovered in January .
A new survey carried out by the BBC has revealed that 33 per cent of Christians in the UK think that the way they are portrayed in the media amounts to discrimination .
And 25 % said they also experienced discrimination from colleagues in the workplace when their faith was known or talked about .
The poll was carried out for the BBC ’s Heaven and Earth programme , based on a representative sample of 604 people .
Another 22 % said they thought Christians faced discrimination in their local community .
19 per cent said they would be passed over for promotion .
A third thought the media distorted Christian issues .
Matters like the British Airways prohibition on costume jewellery , which prevented an employee from wearing a cross , and suspicion towards Christian service organizations by funding bodies , were cited as examples .
Conservative MP
Anne Widdecombe , an Anglican who became a Catholic , said : “ It ’s now entirely a matter for Christians whether we fight back or take it .
My own belief is that we should stand together and fight this discrimination . ”
But the UK Christian think - tank Ekklesia , which said that the findings confirmed the discoveries of its own research over the past four years , argued that “ retreating into a persecution mentality ” is bad for Christianity and bad for society .
“ Christians are also privileged – for example there are 26 unelected bishops in the house of Lords , and a quarter of state - funded primary schools are run by churches selecting on the basis of people 's faith ” , said Ekklesia co-director Jonathan Bartley on The Heaven and Earth Show this morning .
He also said that when Muslims and Jews faced attacks and desecration of their cemeteries , talk of “ persecution ” needed to be put into context .
“ The reason a sizable minority of Christians , especially more conservative ones , are feeling ‘ got at ’ is because the historic privilege and influence of the churches is being eroded in the public sphere ” commented Ekklesia co-director Simon Barrow after the show .
“ But this demonstrates how easy it has been , during the era of Christendom , for Christians to mistake their own power for the gospel message – which involves Jesus embodying God ’s special concern for those at the margins , not demanding special treatment for religion ” he added .
Ekklesia argues that loss of automatic privileges , the challenges of pluralism in public life , and the criticism churches face over discrimination in schools and services is “ a historic opportunity for them to recover a vision of the Christian message as rooted in justice and equality .
Self - interest and trying to grab power back is an unhelpful response - a counter - witness , even . ”
The think - tank has also warned about the dangers of " the politics of competitive grievance " , where Christians , secularists , Muslims and others try to out - do each others with claims of discrimination , rather than looking at how to work together .
A BBC researcher on the Heaven and Earth show team spoke to four other Christian agencies , which made similar claims to those demonstrated in their survey .
A spokesperson for one charity in London said it was told to ‘ de - Christianize ’ if it had any chance of getting funding .
Another was told it needed to take all mention of Christianity off its website ; otherwise it was at risk of not receiving any money .
A Reading - based Christian homeless group also complained that it was no longer able to employ only Christians .
However Ekklesia ’s Jonathan Bartley said this was not discrimination , but equal opportunities which Christians , alongside others , were rightly expected to uphold when public money was involved .
And the Anglican Bishop of Bolton , David Gillett , responded : “ Religion is big news these days , so people have become more conscious of faith issues .
That means Christians are now finding decisions going against them in a more high - profile way .
But it ’s a case of those issues getting more attention , rather than there being more discrimination . ”
Meanwhile former PR guru Lynne Franks told the BBC's Heaven and Earth show that claims of discrimination against Christians , defended by outspoken Catholic journalist Joanna Bogle , were " off the mark " .
The National Secular Society 's news monitoring service dubbed them " crackpot " and said Christians were " over- privileged " .

Polite Fiction
What 's a " polite fiction " ?
Daily human interaction is based on polite " lies " - culturally sanctioned beliefs in how people should relate to each other .
What we think of as " good manners " is based on our culture 's ideals about human relations .
Whether or not these ideals are true in a given interaction , we usually act on the basis of these " polite fictions . "
Understanding these basic beliefs can help you to guess what action will be considered courteous in a new situation .
Popular " Polite Fictions " in the U.S.
Here are some beliefs that inform " good manners " in the mainstream United States , with some Asian contrasts to illustrate alternative " polite fictions " .
We 're all equals .
When two people meet , they shake hands or both wave " hi " .
One says , " How are you ? " and the other responds , " Fine , and you ? "
Since equality is the ideal , it does not matter who starts the conversation even if there is a distinct status difference .
In contrast , in Thailand , the junior person comes to the senior , puts hands together and bows slightly .
The polite fiction is " I 'm honoring you " ( honoring seniority ) .
Acting as equals would be rude .
Equality is demonstrated by eye - to - eye contact .
In contrast , in Japan , especially when you meet someone for the first time , adults are less likely to look at someone directly unless they are equal or below you in status .
Americans , even in conserative environments , demonstrate equality by the use of first names , even in hierarchical settings .
The CEO will say , " Call me Dave . "
Thus the " I respect authority " fiction is gradually being pushed aside by the " We 're all equal and friends " polite fiction .
In a gathering of people with different levels of social status , we may make a point of treating everyone evenhandedly .
Relax !
When someone comes to visit you tell them to " make themselves at home " and to " help themselves " to a beer in the fridge , " take off their tie " etc .
It is courteous to treat someone with the same casual intimacy you would give a friend or family member .
In contrast , In many other countries there is a different polite fiction of " I 'm being attentive to you . "
The body posture is alert , you show you are listening closely .
As host , your actions towards the other person are solicitious rather than permissive .
You and I are close friends .
( or at least : I like you . )
Even if you do n't like someone or have just met them , polite fiction requires that you act friendly and pleasant as you would towards a friend .
Formality is generally associated with coldness , so personal warmth is signaled through informal language and behavior .
You are interesting .
Americans use questions to indicate the polite fiction " I am interested in you . "
To listen quietly with no response would be rude , as would contradicting the speaker 's facts or opinions without offering some praise or soft language first .
In contrast , in Japan , curiosity is less valued .
Asking " why " can be considered childish .
If an adult asks a question , it is considered to be of great importance , and people make significant efforts to supply an answer .
To listen quietly with no response would be rude , as would contradicting the speaker 's facts or opinions without offering some praise or soft language first .
An American tour group bombards a guide with questions .
In contrast , the Japanese listen appreciately to whatever the guide knows is important to tell them .
What a great idea !
- You are original .
We compliment others on their " new " ideas and inventions .
We may try to say something new or unique that will set us apart and not " bore " the other person with things they know already .
Ideas belong to the person who had them , and must be treated with the same respect you would show to the person .
A criticism of someone 's statement = a criticism of them as a person .
You and I are individuals .
Politeness means giving the other person a choice , recognizing their individual preferences .
Take coffee , for example .
You have a choice of whether you want it or not , whether you want one lump or two , milk or no milk , etc .
It would be considered rude if a host just gave you a cup of coffee without asking how you liked it .
In contrast , in East Asian countries , the highest status person often orders for the whole group .
The polite fiction is " We are all part of the same group " and therefore eating the same food , or as humble host : " As honored guest , I give you the best I have to offer even though it is n't very good . "
You and I are independent .
It is polite to be as self - sufficient as possible , trying not to ask people for help or for emotional support .
We 're having fun .
Although Americans complain rather freely in public , it is polite to act as if you are enjoying yourself , and to devote yourself to helping the people around you be " happy . "
Hence the increasingly frequent greeting , " Have a nice day . "
We assume that everyone is happy or is trying to be .
You and I are very busy people .
Your time is valuable ; I will take care not to waste it .
People display their importance by appearing busier than others .
Many people are overworked and overscheduled .
To help them uphold their sense of importance , and not to stress someone who is already overloaded , it is polite to be careful of " taking " another person 's time .
Most polite interactions make some reference to time ( " I 'll just be a moment . "
" I know you 're busy , but … " " Thank you for your time . " )
It might not come as a surprise when we tell you that the RIAA wants to turn the Internet into a virtual police state .
Still , it 's quite scary to see what their " future Internet " would look like .
Let 's take a closer look at the RIAA 's suggestions for the Anti-Piracy Trade Agreement Wishlist ( ACTA ) .
ACTA is a big deal , and the entertainment industry is doing all it can to get it implemented as soon as possible .
Thus far , they have managed to convince the G8 to push the agreement , and encourage member states to get the agreement ready for implementation by the end of the year .
One of the crucial questions is how “ bad ” the agreement will turn out to be .
We reported earlier that ACTA might allow “ competent authorities ” to “ search iPods ” without the need for a complaint from a rights holder .
The most absurd ACTA suggestions we ’ve seen so far come from the RIAA , with a strong focus on the liability of ISPs .
The RIAA ’s wishlist was published several weeks ago , but has n’t received much press ( thanks Brokep ) .
There are several scary suggestions in there though , and if the RIAA could have its way , the Internet would be turned into a virtual police state immediately .
Let ’s highlight some of the RIAA ’s suggestions regarding online copyright infringement , mostly targeted at ISPs .
You can read the document in full at Keionline .
Require internet service providers and other intermediaries to employ readily available measures to inhibit infringement in instances where both legitimate and illegitimate uses were facilitated by their services , including filtering out infringing materials …
The RIAA wants Internet providers to spy on the files that are transferred by their customers and check them against a reference database of “ fingerprints ” to check whether the files are infringing copyright .
The IFPI , RIAA ’s international counterpart tried to convince European lawmakers to do the same a few months ago .
Require Internet service providers or other intermediaries to restrict or terminate access to their systems with respect to repeat infringers .
Many countries have looked into the possibility of disconnecting file - sharers from the Internet , often gently pushed by anti-piracy lobbyists .
France was the first to present their idiotic “ 3 - strikes ” law earlier this year , allowing anti-piracy outfits to police the Internet .
The RIAA wants to see such legislation implemented worldwide of course .
“ Establish , adequately fund and provide training for a computer crimes investigatory unit . ”
A crime unit to track down and bust pirates , sounds like a great idea .
The RIAA is vague about what such a unit is supposed to do as they already send thousands of takedown notices a year themselves , even to network printers .
Perhaps they will use the funding and education to come up with harvesting techniques that actually work ?
Establish liability against internet service providers who , upon receiving notices of infringement from content provides via eÂ­mail , or by telephone in cases of pre-release materials or in other exigent circumstances , fail to remove the infringing content …
It gets even worse for ISPs .
The RIAA wants to hold them responsible for the alleged copyright infringements of their customers .
They even came up with a 24hour deadline .
It ’s interesting to see that they focus on pre-release material , the same strategy the IFPI and BPI used to take down OiNK .
… in the absence of proof to the contrary , an Internet service provider shall be considered as knowing that the content it stores is infringing or illegal , and thus subject to liability for copyright infringement …
Guilty until proven innocent , that makes sense .
Of course , ISPs should know what files their customers store .
The RIAA wants to ditch the “ safe harbor ” the DCMA created , making them responsible for the copyright infringement of their customers .
There is much more , but we suggest everyone reads the entire list of suggestions , it is entertaining and scary at the same time .
Let ’s hope that the politicians who are drafting the agreement will use their brains , instead of blindly accepting such proposals .

Green tea is high in the antioxidant EGCG ( epigallocatechin - 3- gallate ) which helps prevent the body ’s cells from becoming damaged and prematurely aged .
Studies have suggested that the combination of green tea and EGCG may also be beneficial by providing protection against certain types of cancers , including breast cancer .
A new study conducted by researchers at the University of Mississippi researchers now finds that consuming EGCG significantly inhibits breast tumor growth in female mice .
These results bring us one step closer to better understanding the disease and potentially new and naturally occurring therapies .
The Study
Epidemiological studies suggest that green tea and its major constituent , EGCG , can provide some protection against cancer .
Because these studies were very limited , the anti-cancer mechanism of green tea and EGCG was not clear .
As a result , the researchers examined whether drinking EGCG ( just the antioxidant infused in water ) inhibited the following : expression of VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor , which is found in a variety of breast cancer types ) ; tumor angiogenesis ( thought to help tumors expand by supplying them with nutrients ) ; and the growth of breast cancer in female mice .
Seven week old female mice were given EGCG ( 25 mg /50 ml ) in drinking water for five weeks ( approximately 50- 100 mg/kg/day . )
The control mice received regular drinking water .
In the second week of the study mouse breast cancer cells were injected in the left fourth mammary glands of the mice .
Tumor size was monitored by measuring the tumor cross section area ( TCSA ) .
Tumors were eventually isolated and measured for tumor weight , intratumoral microvessel ( IM ) density ( using staining ) , and VEGF protein levels ( using ELISA ) .
At the end of the five week period the researchers found that oral consumption of EGCG caused significant decreases in TCSA ( 66 % ) , tumor weight ( 68 % ) , IM density 155±6 vs.111±20 IM # mm ^2 ) and VEGF protein levels ( 59.0±3.7 vs. 45.7±1.4 pg/mg ) in the breast tumors vs. the control mice , respectively ( N=8 ; P < 0.01 ) .
Further , VEGF plasma levels were lower in EGCG mice than in control mice ( 40.8±3.5 vs. 26.5±3.8 pg/ml P< 0.01 ) .
The study was conducted by Jian - Wei Gu , Emily Young , Jordan Covington , James Wes Johnson , and Wei Tan , all of the Department of Physiology & Biophysics , University of Mississippi Medical Center , Jackson , MS .
Dr. Gu will present his team ’s findings , entitled , Oral Administration of EGCG , an Antioxidant Found in Green Tea , Inhibits Tumor Angiogenesis and Growth of Breast Cancer in Female Mice , at the 121st Annual Meeting of the American Physiological Society , part of the Experimental Biology 2008 scientific conference .
Dr. Gu , the senior researcher for the study , hypothesized that the reason for the link between EGCG and the reductions in the cancer data was because EGCG directly targets both tumor blood vessels and tumor cells of breast cancer for suppressing the new blood vessels formation in breast tumor , the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells .
Gu concluded by saying , “ In this study we have demonstrated that the frequent ingestion of EGCG significantly inhibits breast tumor growth , VEGF expression and tumor angiogenesis in mice .
We believe our findings will help lead to new therapies for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer in women . ”
Firstly , you ’ll have to excuse the somewhat ‘ in house ’ nature of this post , as it ’s me writing about Christian writing about Tom .
It ’s an account of Tom giving an address to the Association for the Teaching of Psychology where he conducted a fantastic demonstration of how you can test out whether your brain adapts to certain visual conditions ‘ locally ’ on an eye - by - eye basis , or ‘ centrally ’ in eye independent perceptual brain areas .
Moments into the keynote talk , the teachers and I found ourselves blinded by darkness .
As our eyes adjusted , we were told to cover one eye with our hands before the lights were raised again .
A little wait for our open eyes to become light - adjusted and then the lights re-dimmed .
What would happen to our vision this time ?
The answer depends on whether adaptation to light levels occurs centrally , in the brain , or locally in each eye .
The audience tested this , looking through each eye one at a time and discovering the strange experience of having one eye adapted to the light and one to the dark , thus showing that light adaptation occurs locally .
Both eyes open led to a strange , grey , grainy , effect .
‚ Äú Whoever said psychology is n’t useful is wrong , ‚Äù Stafford said .

A huge video of a waterfall filled the screen .
After a minute staring at the cascading water , the video was stopped and the audience experienced the well - known illusion of the water appearing to flow upwards .
But what if the flowing water was watched with just one eye ( with the other covered ) , with the paused video then observed through the previously covered eye ?
The illusion was still experienced , thus showing that in this case , adaptation to motion had occurred centrally , in the brain .
If you do n’t have a waterfall handy , you may be interested to know it ’s a form of ‘ motion after effect ‘ illusion and there ’s a similar demonstration online that you can try .

25 Most Controversial Movies Ever
Mel Gibson ’s The Passion Of The Christ has topped a new online poll from Entertainment Weekly of the top 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever .
Gibson ’s intention , born of his deep Catholic faith , was to produce an unflinching depiction of Christ ’s suffering on behalf of mankind .
What he succeeded at best , however , was igniting a culture - war firestorm unrivaled in Hollywood history .
For months prior to its release , The Passion was both denounced and defended sight unseen amid reports that the film was n’t just brutal , but compromised by dubious biblical interpretation and anti-Semitic sentiment .
Gibson refused to let concerned parties view and vet his self - financed film , even as he was giving Passion previews to Christians as part of an unprecedented church - targeting promo push .
Ultimately , moviegoers pretty much got the experience they were expecting , while Gibson got a $ 370 million gross — plus a provocative new reputation .
Below is the rest of the top 25 :
2. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE ( 1971 )
THE CONTROVERSY
You mean besides its irreverent use of Gene Kelly ’s ” Singin ’ in the Rain ” ?
That the movie first landed an X rating and was deemed pornographic across the U.S. was nothing compared with its reception in the U.K. : Social uproar and reports of copycat crimes led Kubrick to withdraw Clockwork from distribution in his adopted country .
It was n’t officially available there again — in theaters or on video — until 2000 , a year after his death .
3. FAHRENHEIT 9/11 ( 2004 )
THE CONTROVERSY
The documentary lit the fuse of right - wing America , detonating protests and hate campaigns to ban it ( no dice ) .
Moore was the first to break the post - 9/11 moratorium on Bush bashing and set off a season of brutal smack - downs among the Bill O’Reillys and Keith Olbermanns of the world .
4. DEEP THROAT ( 1972 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Intellectuals championed the film for striking a blow for First Amendment rights , while conservative leaders got it banned in many places and put Reems on trial for obscenity charges .
Lovelace herself later denounced the film , claiming that while filming ” there was a gun to my head . ”
5. JFK ( 1991 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Some saw Stone ’s documentary - on - steroids - like interpretation of those theories as lending them a certain patina of truth — raising fears that moviegoers would construe it as bona fide history .
One result : a 1992 congressional act to release classified documents ( which revealed nothing ) .
6. THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST ( 1988 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Religious fundamentalists picketed and threatened boycotts weeks before its release .
One group offered to buy the $ 6.5 million film from Universal to destroy it ; some theaters , and later Blockbuster , refused to carry it .
Oh , and the French rioted .
7. THE BIRTH OF A NATION ( 1915 )
THE CONTROVERSY
The film ’s depiction of African Americans as childlike , conniving , or rabid sex fiends , and the Ku Klux Klan as heroic saviors , sparked nationwide protests by the nascent NAACP .
( It also became a KKK recruiting tool . )
Censorship debates and protests have dogged the film in subsequent re-releases and when it was added to the National Film Registry in 1993 .
8. NATURAL BORN KILLERS ( 1994 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Though intended as a satire on the media , the film actually inspired several copycat killers to seek their own 15 minutes of fame , some even using imagery and dialogue from the film .
Over 12 murders in the U.S. and abroad have been linked to Killers .
One victim ’s family tried to sue Stone and Warner Bros .
9. LAST TANGO IN PARIS ( 1972 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Critics and audiences were sharply divided over this X - rated erotic psychodrama .
The film ’s stark ( as in naked ) depiction of loveless , animalistic carnality horrified some — and landed its director and stars in an Italian court on obscenity charges .
10 . BABY DOLL ( 1956 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Written by Tennessee Williams , the film struck Catholic leaders as lewd .
( A similar flap greeted 1943 ’s The Outlaw over Jane Russell ’s bust . )
New York ’s Cardinal Spellman forbade the faithful to see it ” under pain of sin . ”
Some theaters pulled it , but it eventually earned four Oscar nominations .
11 . THE MESSAGE ( 1977 )
THE CONTROVERSY
The movie rankled Muslims and sparked riots , and that was just during production .
Post - release , in March 1977 , Hanafi terrorists took more than 100 people hostage in Washington , D.C. — killing a reporter and shooting the city ’s future mayor Marion Barry in the two - day siege — demanding in part that The Message be banned .
( It was n’t . )
In a cruelly ironic coda , the Syrian - born Akkad died amid al - Qaeda ’s coordinated hotel bombings last fall in Amman , Jordan .
12 . THE DEER HUNTER ( 1978 )
THE CONTROVERSY
By the time it won the Best Picture Oscar , Deer Hunter had ignited major debate over its shocking POW - camp scenes , in which American soldiers are forced to play Russian roulette .
War historians argued there was no record of such atrocities , and others called the Vietcong depiction racist .
Cimino called the criticisms ” beside the point . ”
13 . THE DA VINCI CODE ( 2006 )
THE CONTROVERSY
It did n’t end up drawing mass pickets or boycotts , but there was much debate while the film was being made .
Westminster Abbey would n’t allow Howard to shoot inside its halls , and some 200 protesters mobbed the set in Lincolnshire , England ( although Howard says most were merely ” trying to get autographs ” ) .
14 . THE WARRIORS ( 1979 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Hill ’s lurid nightmare of urban warfare was widely condemned for glorifying violence .
Reports of criminal incidents where the film was shown — including the stabbing of a teenager in Massachusetts — fueled the outrage , forcing Paramount to temporarily pull its print and TV advertising for the film .
15 . TRIUMPH OF THE WILL ( 1935 )
THE CONTROVERSY
While intellectuals still ponder the ethics of admiring so malevolent a masterpiece , others have had more visceral reactions .
In the early ’ 40s , director George Stevens was so disturbed by the film that he joined the Army the next day .
Protests greeted Riefenstahl ( who never shook her Nazi- tainted past ) at a 1974 Telluride Film Festival tribute , and the Anti-Defamation League decried a 1975 screening in Atlanta as ” morally insensitive . ”
16 . UNITED 93 ( 2006 )
THE CONTROVERSY Greengrass ’ virtually - there experience may have been a little too close for comfort for some moviegoers .
Even the trailer ’s suggestion of the movie ’s content prompted audiences to shout Too soon !
One New York City theater pulled the footage from its preview reel after many viewers ( one left sobbing ) complained .
17 . FREAKS ( 1932 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Audiences fled preview screenings in droves .
( One patron claimed the film caused her to miscarry . )
Even with a castration scene cut , the National Association of Women found the film ” offensive ” and urged boycotts .
It was banned in Atlanta and pulled from distribution ; it was forbidden in the U.K. until the early ’60s .
18 . I AM CURIOUS ( YELLOW ) ( 1969 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Before the 1967 Swedish film could open in the U.S. , it was seized by customs officials concerned that scenes containing full frontal nudity and simulated sex acts were pornographic .
The courts initially deemed the movie obscene , but the verdict was overturned .
19 . BASIC INSTINCT ( 1992 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Gay - rights activists objected to the portrayal of man-hating lesbians before a frame of film was shot and protested through the film ’s opening .
Then there was the film ’s eye - popping sex , including Sharon Stone ’s notorious leg - crossing , which contributed to Basic ’s initial NC - 17 rating .
20 . CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST ( 1985 )
THE CONTROVERSY
After its 1980 Milan premiere , the film ’s print was confiscated by the city ’s magistrate .
Later , Deodato faced life in prison when Italian authorities believed the stars of his film were really killed .
The actors finally appeared on TV to prove otherwise .
21 . BONNIE AND CLYDE ( 1967 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Two years before Sam Peckinpah ’s The Wild Bunch , Penn ’s bloody , slo -mo bullet - riddled finale , where the young lovers bite the dust , sparked an outcry — even tough - guy actor James Garner , no stranger to shoot - outs , called it ” amoral . ”
22 . DO THE RIGHT THING ( 1989 )
THE CONTROVERSY
While the film was seen by some as a masterpiece ( and earned Lee a Best Original Screenplay Oscar nom ) , others blasted the director as irresponsible , predicting that the film ’s shocking climax — in which Mookie ( Lee ) hurls a trashcan through a storefront window , inciting a riot — would evoke similar reactions from urban moviegoers .
Thankfully , the film proved to be more of a catalyst for heated debate than a flashpoint for actual violence .
23 . KIDS ( 1995 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Clark ’s disturbing vision of promiscuous , borderline - sociopathic teens was heralded by some as a much - needed wake - up call about the nation ’s youth .
Others saw prurient exploitation .
As a buffer against the furor , Miramax created a new entity , Excalibur Films , to release the pic .
24 . CALIGULA ( 1980 )
THE CONTROVERSY
Described as a ” moral holocaust ” by Variety , the film was first given a very limited theatrical release for fear of prosecution on obscenity grounds .
25 . Aladdin ( 1992 )
THE CONTROVERSY : The American - Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee balked at a lyric describing the film ’s Arabian setting as a land ” where they cut off your ear if they do n’t like your face . ”
Result ?
The studio dubbed out the lyric for subsequent releases .

While everyone is debating the pros and cons of Obama ’s pick of Joe Biden for VP , a small scandal is erupting in Montana surrounding Governor Schweitzer .
The scandal wo n’t make the national headlines , but the issue underlying it is at the heart of Obama ’s message : American politics are in dire need of change .
When what is right for the American people takes a backseat to political one - upmanship , there is something very wrong .
In April , the Montana Republican State party filed a complaint against Brian Schweitzer for distributing a Public Service Announcement for Ag Week , a week of recognition and thanks for Montana ’s farmers and ranchers .
Montana law bans the use of state funds to produce PSAs featuring an officeholder who has officially declared his candidacy and the GOP alleges that Schweitzer did just that .
The Governor ’s office argued that no state money was used to buy advertising time and stated :
“ The governor believes it ’s important to tout Montana , and one way he does that is by communicating .
( The law ) was not designed to stop the governor from asking the people of Montana to thank farmers and ranchers . ”
University of Montana Law Professor William Corbett , who was appointed as hearings examiner for the case , recommended this week that Governor Schweitzer pay a fine of $ 750 for violating the state law .
The official ruling will be made at a later date by Commissioner of Political Practices Dennis Unsworth .
Corbett allowed that part of the state ethics law is ambiguous , but he found that using state employees and facilities to produce the PSA constituted the use of state funds and that Governor Schweitzer should be found guilty and fined .
If found guilty , what will this mean for Montana and its Governor ?
In Idaho , Governor Butch Otter is a great promoter of the Idaho Meth Project .
In Wyoming , Governor Dave Freudenthal is promoting the Wyoming Energy Council .
According to the Helena Independent Record :
“ Since the complaint was filed , Schweitzer has turned down requests to do PSAs to promote the Butte Folk Festival , to be in a video production greeting Montana troops in Iraq , to congratulate Montana high school graduates and to appear with the U.S. surgeon general to discourage under - age drinking . ”
Is that what the Republicans want ?
A technicality to prevent our Governor from greeting our troops in Iraq ?
To keep him from making TV ads that discourage teens from drinking alcohol ?
In light of this case , it can be easy to forget which party has made such an issue of supporting the troops .
And which party was it again that claimed to be the party that represents “ family values ? ”
" It 's not enough to change the political party in the White House , " Obama said .
" We need to change how politics are done and open it up to the American people . "
Let us put an end to political competition overwhelming public service .
It ’s time that we select leaders who can lead by example , leaders who value ethics above personal gain .
Obama speaks of change , and the above story exemplifies exactly why change is so sorely needed in Washington , Montana and America .

My husband and I went to Stoneware Enterprise inc. to look for granite to replace our kitchen countertop .
We were greeted by Salman , who was very patient in showing us their magnificent collection of granite slabs .
We were so impressed that we decided to come back .
This time Salman was not there but Mohamad was extremely helpful and nice .
We picked one of the granite slabs , and , after that , in a few days , my countertop was replaced and now looks beautiful .
I ’m extremely happy with their services and the price we paid .
Thank you Salman and Mohammad for your perfect customer - service skills .
I thank also the whole crew for the perfect installation .
Fantastic job !!
I also highly recommend this place .
The comet - like object SQ372 changes positions as it moves in its orbit , while the positions of the stars that are much farther away stay fixed .
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey showed the object on October 21 ( top ) , 23 ( middle ) and 28 ( bottom ) .
Ahuge comet - like object has been spotted inside the orbit of Neptune .
Theobject , at least 30 miles wide , is on the return leg of a 22,500 - year journeyaround the sun , astronomers announced today .
Cataloguedas 2006 SQ372 , the interloper is just over two billion miles ( 3.2 billion km ) fromEarth , though its elongated trek takes it to a distance of 150 billion miles ( 241 billion km ) , or nearly 1,600 times the distance from the Earth to the sun .
Theonly known object with a comparable orbit is Sedna ? a distant , Pluto - like dwarf planet discovered in 2003 .
But 2006 SQ372 's travelstake it more than 1.5 times farther from the sun .
Its diameter is estimated at 30to 60 miles ( 50 to 100 km ) .
" It 'sbasically a comet , but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long , bright tail ofevaporated gas and dust , " said Andrew Becker of the University ofWashington .
Comet tails form when solar energy boils material off a comet .
Theobject is not a threat to Earth , which is good .
A comet that size would causeglobal devastation .
The space rock that contributed to the demiseof dinosaurs 65 million years ago was about 6 miles ( 10 km ) wide .
The cometHale - Bopp , which put on a spectacular display in the late 1990s , is about 31 miles ( 50 km ) in diameter .
Yet many comets are just a mile or two wide .
Becker 'steam found 2006 SQ372 by applying a computer searching algorithm to data taken fromthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey II ( SDSS II ) , which is tasked with finding supernovaexplosions billions of light - years away to measure the expansion of theuniverse .
In the survey , the Apache Point Observatory telescope scanned thesame long stripe of sky , an area 1,000 times larger than the full moon in thesky , every clear night in the fall of 2005 , 2006 and 2007 .
Asto how 2006 SQ372 got its unusual orbit , University of Washington graduatestudent Nathan Kaib , another member of the discovery team , has some ideas basedon his computer simulations of the object .
" Itcould have formed , like Pluto , in the belt of icy debris beyond Neptune , then been kicked to largedistance by a gravitational encounter with Neptune or Uranus , " Kaib said .
" However , we think it is more probable that SQ372 comes from the inneredge of the Oort Cloud . "
The Oort Cloud is a huge spherical cloud surrounding the solar system .
It extends about18 trillion miles ( 30 trillion kilometers ) from the sun and was first proposedin 1950 by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort .
Thediscovery was reported today in Chicago , at an international symposium titled " The Sloan Digital Sky Survey : Asteroids to Cosmology . "
The researchers plan tosubmit details of the finding for publication in the Astrophysical Journal .
Are Matthew McConaughey and Camila Alves Getting Married ?
Despite recent rumors thathas popped the question to girlfriend , McConaughey 's rep says it ai n't so
The Brazilian supermodel is pregnant with the couple 's first child , and recent reports claimed the two would be walking down the aisle soon , with Lance Armstrong as Matthew 's best man .
Also not true .
According to earlier reports , McConaughey is perfectly content maintaining the status quo and has no intention of marrying Alves now - or ever .
McConaughey introduced Armstrong to his current romantic interest , Kate Hudson .
In part one of our look into the anti-piracy efforts at universities , we saw that Missouri S&T used a simple home grown system , ignoring the favorites of the entertainment industry .
In part two , we look at Ohio University , Texas A&M University , Tulane University and others that do use one of the methods preferred by the RIAA and MPAA .
Ohio University ( OU ) and 7 other universities decided that blocking the many legitimate uses for P2P is not the best idea .
Instead they have decided to go the high - tech route instead .
They went for the method touted by the music industry , and paraded by the RIAA around Capitol Hill in 2004 .
A ‘ fingerprint ’ recognition service called ‘ Copysense ‘ .
Copysense works by listening in on ALL network traffic , and looking for data patterns that match signatures , or ‘ fingerprints ’ loaded on it .
If it detects data packets matching one of its signatures , it terminates the connection by sending forged RST packets to both sides of the connection ( Comcast anyone ? ) .
Piracy detection services like Copysense are not cheap .
Ohio University paid around $ 60,000 in 2007 for the system , and an additional $ 15,500 a year for updates and support .
For this , they got a network monitoring box , and some questionable results that prompt more questions than answers , but we will discuss these another time .
There are more issues though , a system working in promiscuous mode is also a big security risk .
Passwords , and user names , if transmitted unencrypted , are observable , as is any other traffic sent in the clear .
When J. Brice Bible , the CIO at Ohio University , took up his post , it was in the wake of data security breaches .
Now he has paid tens of thousands of dollars for a box that can potentially cause a similar breach .
Of course , potentially any network client can do this , but only on their local network , not the entire university network .
Ohio University seems to be happy with the entertainment industry ’s favorite anti-piracy system .
Of course , the less skeptical amongst us would think that outgoing head of the WIPO being an alumni is pure coincidence , as is the CEO of Fox News .
People with a strong pro-copyright agenda having contact with an early adopter of a technology pushed heavily by the MPAA and RIAA , is something that rose some eyebrows at the Torrent Freak office though .
Regardless , Ohio University claims the program has been a success .
Speaking in the student newspaper , Bible said , “ It works very well for today , ( but ) I do n’t know if it will work well tomorrow or the next day or the year after .
I want to hear from students â€¦ I think students should be engaged in this discussionâ€ ” and faculty , too . ”
If you ’re a student at Ohio University , or one of the other universities that use Copysense , why not let him know , and get involved .
This " once - sleepy institution in the hills of North Carolina " is now evidently thrumming with vitality , thanks to the efforts of its president , Nido R. Qubein , a Lebanese - born High Point alumnus and author of the books " How to Get Whatever You Want " and " Close Like a Pro : Selling Strategies for Success . "
Does the idea of treating college students like customers -- striving never to disrupt their sense of contentment -- give you the willies ?
Then welcome to your nightmare : High Point University , profiled this month in the Chronicle of Higher Education .
Among Qubein 's innovations since arriving three years ago are an ice - cream truck that circles the campus , dispensing free treats ( 500 choices ! ) ; valet parking ; a concierge ( who will handle your dry cleaning ) ; and the hiring of a " director of WOW ! , " whose sole mission is to keep up the spirits of the university 's charges .
Does that not sound sufficiently coddling ?
On every student 's birthday , he or she gets a birthday card and balloons from the president , plus a Starbucks gift certificate -- plus a slice of cake and a " Happy Birthday " serenade , should he or she set foot in the cafeteria .
( The staff gets an alert via the student 's i.d. card . )
Birthdays aside , the administration likes to surprise students with random gifts and snacks ; careful records are kept of each student 's preferences on this crucial front .
The Chronicle reports that Mr. Qubein , who is also chairman of the board of the Great Harvest Bread Company , has raised $ 100 million for the school by tapping his wealthy acquaintances and the new money has permitted significant expansion of the campus 's facilities .
The president regularly fends off recruiting feelers from other colleges .
One puzzling detail : President Feelgood has decreed that classical music be piped onto the campus 's main lawn .
Note to the director of WOW ! : you might want to focus - group that one .
Why else Yoo 's cockamamie assertions of presidential authority to violate all laws and ignore all treaties ?
Why else the fantastic secrecy and bureaucratic end -runs ?
Why else the cover-ups - like actual destruction of critical evidence of torture like the waterboarding tapes ?
Why else the ludicrous euphemisms ?
And Cheney , to his credit , I suppose , proudly declared his intent to go where no previous administration had ever gone .
On the Sunday after the attacks he blurted out the following immortal words :
" We 'll have to work sort of the dark side , if you will .
We 've got to spend time in the shadows in the intelligence world .
A lot of what needs to be done will have to be done quietly , wihout any discussion , using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies - if we are going to be successful .
That 's the world these folks operate in .
And , uh , so it 's vital for us to use any means at our disposal basically to achieve our objectives . "
Cheney all but told us , if we had only been able to hear him at the time , that he was going off the legal grid , off any zone of public accountability , able to deploy " any means at our disposal " to do what he believed had to be done .
Now , you may want to defend this act of radical executive power as a necessary , temporary breach in the aftermath of 9/11 , but you cannot , I think , credibly argue that Cheney was unaware of what he was doing .
Or that he insisted on retaining this kind of illegality and torture long after the immediate crisis passed .
As late as 2005 , Cheney was getting Bybee to write legal memos for any combination of any number of torture techniques , long categorically recognized as such by everyone in the field .
From a former CIA official in Mayer 's book : " They were torturing people .
No question .
They did disgusting things to people .
Their attitude was , ' Laws ? like who the fuck cares ? ' "
When you have the highest officials in a constitutional democracy with that view of the world , and with the appalling human rights record of these people , the case for war crime prosecutions is overwhelming - if we are to uphold the basic rule of law .
Remember that ?
We impeached a president for perjury in a civil lawsuit .
We 're going to proactively pardon a president who authorized torture ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
" Why are we talking about this in the White House ? " John Ashcroft nervously asked his fellow members of the National Security Council 's Principals Committee .
( The Principals were Vice President Dick Cheney , National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell , CIA Director George Tenet and Attorney General Ashcroft . )
" History will not judge this kindly , " Ashcroft predicted .
" This " is torture .
Against innocent people .
Conducted by CIA agents and American soldiers and marines .
Sanctioned by legal opinions issued by Ashcroft 's Justice Department .
Directly ordered by George W. Bush .
An April 11th report by ABC News describes how CIA agents , asked by previous presidents to carry out illegal " black ops " actions ( torture and killings ) , had become tired of getting hung out to dry whenever their dirty deeds were revealed by the press .
When the Bush Administration asked the CIA to work over prisoners captured in Afghanistan , Pakistan and elsewhere , Director George Tenet demanded legal cover .
The Justice Department complied by issuing a classified 2002 memo , the so - called " Golden Shield , " authored by Office of Legal Counsel Jay Bybee .
" Enhanced interrogation techniques " -- i.e. , torture -- were legal , Bybee assured the CIA .
Tenet was a good boss , a CYA type .
He wanted to protect his agents .
So he got the Principals to personally sign off on each act of torture .
" According to a former CIA official involved in the process , " ABC reported , " CIA headquarters would receive cables from operatives in the field asking for authorization for specific techniques . "
Can we beat up this guy ?
Can we waterboard him ?
The Bushies were n't otherwise known for dwelling on details .
Osama was in Pakistan ; they invaded Afghanistan instead .
Two years later , he was still in Pakistan .
They invaded Iraq .
Bush and his top officials still found time to walk through every step of torment a detainee would suffer in some CIA dungeon halfway around the world .
" The high - level discussions about these ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' were so detailed , [ Bush Administration ] sources said , some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed -- down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic .
These top advisers signed off on how the CIA would interrogate top Al Qaeda suspects -- whether they would be slapped , pushed , deprived of sleep or subjected to simulated drowning , called waterboarding , sources told ABC news . "
Bush knew .
Not only did he know , he personally approved it .
He likes torture .
" Yes , I 'm aware our national security team met on this issue , " he confirmed .
" And I approved . "
When the U.S. signs a treaty , its provisions carry the full force of U.S. law .
One such treaty is the U.N. Convention Against Torture , of which the U.S. is a core signatory .
As Philippe Sands writes in his new book " Torture Team : " Parties to the ...
Convention are required to investigate any person who is alleged to have committed torture .
If appropriate , they must then prosecute -- or extradite the person to a place where he will be prosecuted .
The Torture Convention ... criminalizes any act that constitutes complicity or participation in torture .
Complicity or participation could certainly be extended not only to the politicians and but also the lawyers involved ... "
George W. Bush has publicly confessed that he ordered torture , thus violating the Convention Against Torture .
He , Cheney , Rumseld , Rice and the other Principals must therefore be arrested and , unlike the thousands of detainees kidnapped by the U.S. since 9/11 , arraigned and placed on trial .

Because the torture ordered by Bush and his cabinet directly resulted in death , they must additionally be charged with several counts of murder .
Fifteen U.S. soldiers have been charged with the murders of two detainees at the U.S. airbase at Bagram , Afghanistan in 2002 .
They were following orders issued by their Commander - in - Chief and his Principals .
One of the Bagram victims was Dilawar , a 22 - year - old Afghan taxi driver .
" On the day of his death , " reported The New York Times on May 22 , 2005 , " Dilawar had been chained by the wrists to the top of his cell for much of the previous four days .
A guard tried to force the young man to his knees .
But his legs , which had been pummeled by guards for several days , could no longer bend ...
Several hours passed before an emergency room doctor finally saw Mr. Dilawar .
By then he was dead , his body beginning to stiffen .
It would be many months before Army investigators learned a final horrific detail : Most of the interrogators had believed Mr. Dilawar was an innocent man who simply drove his taxi past the American base at the wrong time . "
At least four detainees have committed suicide at the torture camp created by George W. Bush after 9/11 at Guantánamo Bay .
Twenty - five more made 41 unsuccessful attempts to kill themselves .
The conditions of their confinement -- ordered by Bush and his Principals -- constitutes torture .
It no doubt prompted their deaths .
If George W. Bush were an ordinary citizen , there can be little doubt that he would face a long prison sentence for the scores of acts of torture he authorized both specifically and generally .
Four of the seven white hillbillies charged with the kidnap - torture of a black woman in Logan County , West Virginia are now in jail for at least the next ten years .
If Bush were n't president , he would face murder charges .
The maximum sentence in a federal murder case is death .
If Bush and his co-conspirators are not above the law , if the United States remains a nation where all citizens are equal , they must be arrested and indicted .
But by whom ?
The Supreme Court has never resolved the question of whether a sitting president can be arrested by civilian authorities .
Even if he were charged and convicted , many legal experts say he could issue himself a pardon .
However , leaving the presidency in the hands of an self - admitted torture killer is unacceptable .
Congress could ask a U.S. Marshal to arrest Bush as part of impeachment charges .
But the ultimate outcome -- removing him from office a few months before the end of his term -- seems woefully inadequate given the nature of the charges .
In any case , Democrats have already said that impeachment is " off the table . "
Bush could be extradited to one of the countries where the torture and murders were committed -- such as Afghanistan or Cuba .
But he could claim immunity as a head of state .
There is , however , a person who could begin holding Bush and the others accountable for their crimes .
She is Cathy L. Lanier , the 39 - year - old chief of D.C. 's Metropolitan Police Department .
Chief Lanier , take note : you have probable cause to arrest a self - confessed serial torturer and mass murderer within the borders of the District of Columbia .
He resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
Go get him .
History is calling , Chief Lanier .
Your city , and your country , needs you .

DENVER -- Fears of confrontation between police and protesters outside the Democratic National Convention seem to have been overblown .
As Democrats gathered for their convention 's first night at the Pepsi Center , there were no protesters to be seen in the fenced in free speech zone a few hundred yards away .
Dubbed the " freedom cage " by activists , the police - sanctioned protest area seems to have been largely abandoned .
Across town though , hundreds of protesters clashed with police .
" I do n't think anyone would come here because it 's kind of ridiculous , " said William Aanstoos , a 19 - year - old from Asheville , NC , who came to Denver to participate in the protests .
He said other events were happening elsewhere in the city .
Later Monday night , protesters were pepper sprayed and arrested in front of the Denver City and County Building , about 1.5 miles from the Pepsi Center .
It 's believed to be the first time police used any kind of force against protesters .
Authorities say police were trying to disperse a crowd of about 300 that had disrupted traffic .
Police have led at least two people away as the crowd chanted " Let them go ! "
Some of the protesters threw bags containing a colored liquid at police .
Police Lt. Ron Saunier says he did not immediately know whether there had been arrests .
He said , " The situation is still very fluid and active . "
On Sunday , the day before the convention 's start , an anti-war protest snaked past the Pepsi Center , but by Monday the security perimeter had been expanded so that no one without a credential could get within two city blocks of the convention site .
The " freedom cage " was just outside the security perimeter on the southwest corner of the Pepsi Center Complex , but there was no entrance to the perimeter anywhere near the protest zone .
Even if protesters had bothered to show up , it 's unlikely any Democratic delegates or reporters would have seen them .
A police officer stationed near the protest zone told RAW STORY that members of the anti-war group Code Pink had staged a demonstration there earlier Monday , but that it had been mostly empty the rest of the day .
Around 5 p.m. local time , there were a few scattered reporters but no protests .
An empty microphone was set up in one corner of the fenced in parking lot with a sign up sheet for speakers .
Some pranksters apparently filled out most of the sheet with mock entries .
For example , " MLK 'I have a dream , that one day , all free speech will be done in cages . ' "
The ACLU had expressed concern that police would be over - zealous in cracking down on protesters .
Denver police had previously been told to be on high alert for " stockpiles " of such innocuous items as maps and bicycles .
A spokesman for the organization said earlier Monday night , before the arrests across town , that things had been pretty " quiet . "
The police had been certainly making their presence known throughout the weekend .
Hundreds of officers were deployed throughout the city on foot , bike and horseback .
Police SUVs also were driving through downtown Denver Sunday and Monday with up to a dozen officers each riding on platforms attached to the sides of the vehicles .
There was a constant whir of helicopters overhead throughout the city during the convention .
Most of the officers assigned to the empty protest zone were milling around looking bored Monday evening .
Aanstoos , who spoke to RAW STORY in the abandoned " freedom cage " said most of his encounters with police officers had been friendly .

A vulnerability described as ' critical ' has been discovered in versions of uTorrent and the official BitTorrent client .
The ' buffer overflow ' vulnerability can be exploited to compromise a user 's computer for the execution of arbitrary code .
It is suggested that users should immediately update to uTorrent version 1.8 RC7 or higher .
There is currently no fix for the official client .
Secunia has issued two urgent security alerts , one for uTorrent and the other for the mainline BitTorrent client .
Both clients are being developed by BitTorrent Inc .
The vulnerability was found in uTorrent and can be maliciously exploited to compromise a user ’s computer , however , it also affects the mainline BitTorrent client , since it ’s based on the uTorrent code .
According to Secunia , “ the vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the processing of . torrent files .
This can be exploited to cause a stack - based buffer overflow by tricking the user into opening a . torrent file containing an overly long ‘ created by ’ field ” .
A successful execution of the exploit would allow the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim ’s machine .
The vulnerability exists in uTorrent version 1.7.7 ( Build 8179 ) and may well affect earlier versions too , although this is n’t yet confirmed .
The flaw is also present in the official BitTorrent client , versions 6.xx .
The solution for uTorrent users is to immediately upgrade to version 1.8 .
Currently there is no solution for those using the mainline client .
However , an update will be available soon , Torrent Freak was told .
For now , caution is advised when using unverified torrents .

Advertisement Archaeologists carrying out an excavation at Stonehenge say they have broken through to a layer that may finally explain why the site was built .
The team has reached sockets that once held bluestones - smaller stones , most now missing or uprooted , which formed the site 's original structure .
The researchers believe that the bluestones could reveal that Stonehenge was once a place of healing .
The dig is the first to take place at Stonehenge for more than 40 years .
The team now needs to extract organic material from these holes to date when the stones first arrived .

Professor Tim Darvill , of Bournemouth University , who is leading the work with Professor Geoff Wainwright , president of the Society of Antiquaries , said : " The first week has gone really well .
We have broken through to these key features .
" It is a slow process but at the moment everything is going exactly to plan . "
The two - week excavation is being funded by the BBC and filmed for a special Timewatch programme to be broadcast in the autumn .
Professors Darvill and Wainwright say that finding out more about the history of the bluestones could be key to solving the mystery of why the 4,500 - year - old landmark was erected .
They believe that the bluestones , which were transported 250 km ( 150 miles ) from the Preseli Hills in Wales to the Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire , were brought to the site because the ancient people believed they had healing properties .
Professor Geoffrey Wainwright said the site could have been a " Neolithic Lourdes " .
The giant sarsen " goal posts " , which came from about 20 km ( 12 miles ) away , were thought to have arrived much later .
As well as reaching the bluestone sockets , the archaeologists have also unearthed a whole host of other finds as they have peeled back the layers of the 2.5 m - by - 3.5 m ( 8.2 ft - by - 11.5 ft ) trench .
These include a beaker pottery fragment , Roman ceramics and ancient stone hammers .

What are these ?
Update :
The app has been removed from Apple 's store - but not before the developer sold 8 copies and netted $ 6,000 .
More here .
While many of the apps in Apple 's ( AAPL ) iPhone App Store are useful , some are utter crap .
And the latest , spotted by John Gruber , is an insult to all the well - meaning developers that Apple made wait / are still waiting to get into the iPhone developer program .
Behold : " I Am Rich , " a $ 999.99 app from Armin Heinrich , which just displays a red gem on the phone 's screen -- nothing else .
" The red icon on your iPhone or iPod touch always reminds you ( and others when you show it to them ) that you were rich enough to afford this , " the app 's information page says in iTunes .
" It 's a work of art with no hidden function at all . "
The upside for Apple : $ 300 , or 30 % , of all purchases .
The downside : Good luck enforcing that " all sales final " policy on this scam .

If you live on an isolated island and want to see the world , you 're going to need to fly to get there .
No one knows this better than Australians , who are considered some of the most well - traveled people on the planet .
But there 's one Australian who says her fellow citizens must squash their travel bug for the sake of the environment .
Adele Horin , writing in The Sydney Morning Herald , says her countrymen ( and women ) are addicted to travel and that all the thermostat adjusting in the world wo n't mean anything if they continue hopping flights to visit family , attend conferences and explore the world .
It 's a assessment that 's not likely to be well received .
For decades , travel has been a major part of life in Oz .
After college , young Aussies take a year off to wait tables in
London or backpack through South America .
Stop at any youth hostel in Europe and you 're bound to find at least one person from Down Under .
Retirees flush with retirement cash hop a plane to visit the children and grandchildren spread out around the world .
Executives and entrepreneurs travel frequently to stay connected in an interconnected global economy .
No wonder some of the best guidebooks in the world – the Lonely Planet series – are cranked out in Melbourne .
Horin says it all has to stop .
Every time an Australian boards one of those big Qantas 747s ( she calls them " toxic flying machines " ) , she argues , they 're doing enormous damage to the environment .
She estimates that a round trip from Sydney to London emits the equivalent of nine tons of CO2 per passengers , twice as much as each person on the planet generates annually through eating , driving , and heating or cooling their homes .
Yikes .
But does she , or anyone else , have the right to lecture Australians about their travel habits ?
It 's not that easy , Adele .
First off , Australia is not only an island , it 's an island in the middle of nowhere .
London is 10,000 miles away from Sydney .
Tokyo and Shanghai are 5,000 miles away .
Singapore , an important financial hub for Australia , is 4,000 miles away .
And the country is not exactly a Martha 's Vineyard - size island – a coast to coast drive , much of it through the desert , takes days .
All that air travel accounts for just 1 percent of Australia 's total greenhouse gas emissions .
Compare that to 1.5 percent worldwide and 3.5 percent in the U.S. and you wonder if Aussies are doing that much damage .
And flying is still less polluting , overall , than driving - 10 percent of Australia 's GHG emissions come from cars ; that figure is 14 percent worldwide .
Australians are some of the most environmentally conscious people I 've met ( not surprising , considering that the Great Barrier Reef is dying and part of the country is suffering through a massive drought ) , but Horin suggests their propensity for travel make them hypocrites .
In much of the world , cities , forests , beaches and mountains can be reached by train or car .
Is it fair to punish Australians because they do n't have this luxury ?
Yes , emissions are a huge concern , and if travel - junkie Australians are contributing disproportionately , then this needs to be taken into account .
But is it fair to ask residents of an isolated island nation to suck it up while the rest of us travel freely ?

' Obama the Antichrist ? ' CNN actually asks David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday August 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Just so we 're clear : Barack Obama is in fact not the Anti-Christ , sent here to feed on the souls of the innocent , resume Satan 's reign over earth and bring about the apocalypse as foretold in Revelation .
Not. The. Anti-Christ .
That such a subject is even speculated about in any but the most backwards , unreconstructed segments of American society -- let alone on a 24 - hour cable network -- is a testament ( no pun intended ) to the depths to which political debate has fallen .
But there was the caption on CNN Friday in big bold letters : " OBAMA THE ANTICHRIST ? "
Apparently a not - insignificant number of Americans , after viewing John McCain 's Web ad The One , with its Messianic overtones -- come away thinking that Barack Obama has been sent from Hell to Earth to turn its citizens against God .
For inspiration , some of these people seem to be drawing from the fictional Left Behind series , which posits a dystopian future where the Anti-Christ comes to Earth as a charismatic politician .
The book 's author 's , Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins , have insisted they do n't believe Obama is the Anti-Christ , although they can't resist taking a dig at the candidate in the process .
" I can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist , " adds LaHaye , " but from my reading of scripture , he does n't meet the criteria .
There is no indication in the Bible that the antichrist will be an American . "
McCain 's campaign of course insists that convincing Evangelicals that Obama was the Anti-Christ was never their intention .
CNN notes that regardless of its intent , though , the ad seems to have spurred increased interest in the baseless speculation .
At least one entire blog is devoted to the question and a Google search for " Obama Antichrist " returns nearly 1 million results .
This video is from CNN's Newsroom , broadcast August 15 , 2008 .

Astronomers using NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope have confirmed the presence of two new moons around the distant planet Pluto .
The moons were first discovered by Hubble in May 2005 , but the Pluto Companion Search team probed even deeper into the Pluto system with Hubble on Feb. 15 to look for additional satellites and to characterize the orbits of the moons .
In the image , Pluto is in the center and Charon is just below it .
The moons , provisionally designated S/2005 P 1 and S/2005 P 2 , are located to the right of Pluto and Charon .

In a recent article on rain barrels , I made mention that a few local councils had previously banned rainwater collection for various reasons unknown ; but they ’d finally woken up to themselves .
One of the commenters on the article pointed out that in some states in the USA , it ’s still illegal to collect rainwater , even a measly rain barrel ’s worth as .. get this .. someone else owns it !
One of the commenters , George , quoted Colorado law which says :
“ Colorado Water Law requires that precipitation fall to the ground , run off and into the river of the watershed where it fell .
Because rights to water are legally allocated in this state , an individual may not capture and use water to which he / she does not have a right . ”
This quote was sourced from the Denver government ’s Denver Water site
**** UPDATE : As of July 1 2009 , new law will become active in Colorado that allows the collection of rooftop rainwater from residential buildings ( rain barrels ) , for use in watering landscapes and fire protection .
More info here
I thought the Australian councils who banned water collection were a little nuts , but Colorado ’s approach is beyond total and utter insanity , not to mention Draconian .
I like to think of myself as a law abiding citizen for the most part , but in regards to something like this , I think mass civil disobedience is well and truly called for .
At the very least , I ’d urge residents of states that have such laws to contact their local representative to draw their attention to the issue in order to have the silly law reversed .
Our governments have demonstrated they can’t secure water supplies properly yet , so we need to do it ourselves – a little independence and self - sufficiency should n’t be illegal – particularly when it eases stress on mains water supplies and for such a basic human need .
As another commenter stated in the article , with this law in place ; if their property is affected by floods , surely they should be able to sue all the parties who have rights to that water collectively .
What are your thoughts ?
Marte è il quarto pianeta del nostro sistema solare dal sole , in orbita attorno al sole in orbita tra quello della Terra e quello di Giove .
Il pianeta è più piccolo della Terra e con una magnitudine ( massima ) di - 2,9 meno brillante di Venere e di solito meno luminosa di Giove .
Marte viene talvolta chiamato il pianeta rosso , ma in realtà è di colore piuttosto ocra .
Il pianeta prende il nome dal dio romano della guerra .
Marte è facile da individuare ad occhio nudo , specialmente nei mesi che circondano un’opposizione .
Di notte , Marte può quindi essere visto come una “ stella ” rossastra brillante , che , tuttavia , non è una fonte puntuale ma una fetta a causa della sua relativa vicinanza .
Ecco perché
Marte non brilla come , ad esempio , la lontana stella gigante rossa Aldebaran .
Marte è un pianeta terrestre con un’atmosfera sottile .
La superficie è punteggiata da crateri da impatto in alcuni punti , proprio come quello della Luna , mentre in altri punti , proprio come sulla Terra , si verificano vulcani , valli , dune di sabbia e calotte polari .
Inoltre , anche il periodo di rotazione ( 24 ore ) e i cambiamenti delle stagioni su Marte si avvicinano a quello della Terra .
Prima del tempo del viaggio nello spazio , si pensava che esistessero vita e acqua liquida su Marte .
Dopo che l’astronave Mariner 4 volò su Marte nel 1965 , si credeva che nessuno dei due potesse essere il caso .
Nel 2003 , la sonda Mars Express dell ’ESA ha scoperto l’acqua sotto forma di vapore acqueo e ghiaccio su Marte .
Nel 2008 , i campioni di ghiaccio sono stati esaminati direttamente dalla sonda spaziale Phoenix .
Le osservazioni dell ’
Orbiter per la ricognizione di Marte potrebbero aver rilevato acqua corrente durante i mesi più caldi su Marte .
Nel 2015 , la NASA ha annunciato che sono state trovate prove di acqua corrente .
Tuttavia , tale ferma accusa è stata ritirata nel 2017 .
Marte ha due lune ; Phobos e Deimos .
Entrambi sono piccoli oggetti di forma irregolare .
Queste due lune potrebbero essere state asteroidi catturati dalla gravità di Marte .
Caratteristiche
Marte ha circa la metà del diametro della Terra e circa un decimo della massa .
La superficie totale del pianeta ha circa le stesse dimensioni dell ’area totale terrestre sulla Terra .
Sebbene Marte abbia una massa e un volume maggiori rispetto a Mercurio , ha una densità inferiore rispetto a Mercurio e Terra .
Di conseguenza , la gravità superficiale su Mercurio è leggermente maggiore rispetto a Marte .
Il colore rossastro della superficie marziana è causato dall ’ossido di ferro ( III ) sotto forma di ematite minerale o ruggine .
Atmosfera
Poiché Marte manca di una magnetosfera a causa della mancanza di un campo magnetico , la ionosfera del pianeta è esposta a un bombardamento di particelle cariche dal vento solare .
Di conseguenza , l’atmosfera marziana perde continuamente molecole , rendendola sottile e sottile .
Le sonde spaziali Mars Global Surveyor e Mars Express hanno rilevato particelle ionizzate che si spostano dall ’atmosfera verso lo spazio .
L’atmosfera marziana è stata probabilmente più spessa in passato .
La pressione dell ’aria in superficie varia tra circa 30 Pa su Olympus Mons e 1155 Pa su Hellas Planitia , con una media di circa 750 Pa ( pressione di mercurio 6 mm ) .
Questo è inferiore all ’1 % della pressione media dell ’aria sulla superficie terrestre ( 101.325 Pa ) .
La pressione dell ’aria sulla superficie di Marte è quindi pari a 35 km sopra la superficie terrestre .
A causa della minore gravità , l’altezza della scala ( altezza alla quale la pressione è diminuita di un fattore e ) su Marte ( circa 11 km ) è maggiore rispetto alla Terra ( circa 6 km ) .
La composizione è molto simile all ’atmosfera esistente sulla Terra circa 4 miliardi di anni fa : principalmente biossido di carbonio ( 95 % ) , integrato con azoto ( 3 % ) , argon gassoso nobile ( 1,6 % ) e ulteriori tracce di ossigeno , metano e acqua .
Il metano arriva in una concentrazione di circa 10 ppb .
Poiché il metano viene scomposto nelle parti più alte dell ’atmosfera sotto l’influenza del vento solare , ha un tempo di permanenza di 340 anni .
Quindi ci deve essere una fonte ( o almeno diverse centinaia di anni fa ) che produce metano .
Vulcanismo , scioperi di comete o microrganismi metanogenici sono considerati possibili come fonti .
La spiegazione più logica , tuttavia , è la serpentinizzazione , una reazione alle intemperie della roccia ricca di olivina ( questo è comune su Marte ) , dove viene rilasciato metano .
L’atmosfera marziana contiene anche molta polvere fine con particelle di polvere con una media di circa 1,5 µm di diametro .
La polvere assicura che l’aria dalla superficie abbia un colore marrone - arancio .
Le stagioni su Marte , causate dall ’inclinazione dell ’asse di rotazione , significano che ai poli c’è una notte continua per mezzo anno Marte .
Il raffreddamento della superficie provoca la condensazione di strati spessi di anidride carbonica nel ghiaccio secco .
Quando arriva la primavera e la piscina si illumina di nuovo , il ghiaccio secco si sublima di nuovo .
L’anidride carbonica rilasciata provoca forti venti dal polo .
Questi venti stagionali trasportano grandi quantità di polvere e vapore acqueo , causando gelo sulla superficie e grandi cirri nell ’atmosfera .
Clima
Di tutti i pianeti , il clima su Marte assomiglia molto a quello della Terra , anche se a causa dell ’ orbita più lunga attorno al sole , le stagioni su Marte durano circa il doppio della Terra .
La temperatura superficiale su Marte può variare tra - 140 ° C ( in inverno artico ) a 20 ° C ( in estate ) .
L’enorme variazione di temperatura è il risultato diretto della sottile atmosfera e della bassa capacità di calore della superficie in marcia .
Tuttavia , le stagioni su Marte non sono determinate solo dalla posizione dell ’asse di rotazione , ma anche dall ’eccentricità dell ’orbita marziana .
La Terra ha un’orbita molto meno eccentrica , quindi questo effetto sulla Terra gioca un ruolo meno importante .
Quando è estate nell ’emisfero meridionale di Marte , il pianeta è al perielio della sua orbita ( vicino al sole ) , mentre durante l’estate nell ’emisfero settentrionale , il pianeta è all ’afelio ( lontano dal sole ) .
Nell ’emisfero meridionale , la differenza tra le stagioni è quindi maggiore rispetto all ’emisfero settentrionale e la temperatura estiva nell ’emisfero meridionale può essere di 30 gradi più elevata rispetto all ’emisfero settentrionale .
Le tempeste di polvere sono un sorprendente fenomeno climatico stagionale su Marte .
Queste tempeste possono essere fenomeni minori , ma possono anche coprire l’intero pianeta .
Si verificano quando
Marte è il più vicino al sole e l’estate si trova nell ’emisfero australe , causando un aumento della temperatura in tutto il pianeta .
Le tempeste di polvere che cambiano il colore della superficie sono probabilmente la causa di osservazioni storiche contrastanti con i telescopi terrestri .
Tempeste di polvere , cicloni e piccoli tornado ( diavoli di polvere ) sono stati osservati da un’orbita attorno a Marte e con i carri su Marte .
Superficie
Le funzioni di superficie su Marte sono identificate in vari modi .
La maggior parte delle aree dell ’ albedo alto ( di colore chiaro ) hanno nomi più antichi , dati da astronomi del XIX secolo .
In molti casi , quei vecchi nomi sono leggermente cambiati a causa della migliore comprensione che esiste oggi nella natura di queste aree .
Ad esempio , Nix Olympia ( snow of Olympus ) è ora Olympus Mons ( Monte Olimpo ) .
L’equatore e i poli di Marte sono determinati dalla rotazione del pianeta .
Non è un caso che il meridiano principale su Marte attraversi il cratere Airy - 0 , dal nome dell ’astronomo inglese George Biddell Airy , nella regione del Sinus Meridiani .
Dato che Marte non ha oceani e quindi nessun livello del mare , è stato necessario selezionare un livello zero arbitrario per le misurazioni dell ’altezza .
Questo livello è definito su Marte come l’altezza alla quale la pressione dell ’aria è di 610,5 Pa. Questa pressione corrisponde al triplo punto d’acqua ( H2O ) ed è approssimativamente uguale allo 0,6 % della pressione dell ’aria a livello del mare sulla Terra .
Calotte polari
Sulle aste si formano calotte di ghiaccio con acqua ghiacciata e anidride carbonica ( ghiaccio secco ) .
Le calotte polari crescono e si sciolgono nel corso delle stagioni .
Ogni inverno uno strato di ghiaccio secco spesso 1 m cresce al Polo Nord , al Polo Sud lo strato di ghiaccio è più spesso ( 8 m ) e permanentemente presente .
La calotta polare artica ha un diametro di circa 1000 km in estate [ 30 ] e contiene circa 1,6 milioni di km³ di ghiaccio ( circa due terzi della calotta glaciale della Groenlandia ) .
Se il ghiaccio fosse distribuito uniformemente sulla cappa , l’intera cappa avrebbe uno spessore di 2 km .
La calotta di ghiaccio antartica ha un diametro di 350 km e uno spessore medio di 3 km .
Il volume totale di ghiaccio nella calotta del Polo Sud insieme al ghiaccio nei sedimenti vicini corrisponde al volume della calotta polare del Polo Nord .
Entrambi i cappucci polari hanno depressioni a spirale .
Si ritiene che queste strutture siano formate da differenze nel riscaldamento e nella sublimazione del ghiaccio secco e dell ’acqua .
L’area in cui si trova la calotta glaciale settentrionale si chiama Planum Boreum , l’area della calotta glaciale meridionale Planum Australe .
Plains
La topografia di Marte mostra una chiara dicotomia ( dicotomia ) : le pianure vulcaniche più basse dell ’emisfero settentrionale rispetto agli altopiani ricoperti di crateri dell ’emisfero meridionale .
Vista dallo spazio , la superficie marziana può quindi essere divisa in due tipi di aree con differenti albedos .
Le pianure più leggere , ricoperte di polvere e sabbia ricca di ossido di ferro rosso , un tempo erano pensate come “ continenti ” e avevano nomi simili , ad esempio Arabia Terra ( terra di Arabia ) o Amazonis Planitia ( pianura dell ’ Amazzonia ) .
Le aree scure sono state viste come mari e hanno ricevuto nomi come Mare Erythraeum , Mare Sirenum e Aurorae Sinus .
La più grande area scura è Syrtis Major ; questo è anche chiaramente visibile dalla Terra .
Crateri da impatto
Esistono molti crateri da impatto su Marte .
Circa 43.000 di questi hanno un diametro maggiore di 5 km .
Il più grande cratere da impatto , in realtà un bacino di impatto , è Hellas Planitia , una regione leggera visibile dalla Terra nell ’emisfero meridionale di Marte .
Ha una profondità di 8 km e un diametro di 2300 km .
A causa della sua massa più piccola e della corrispondente bassa gravità , la probabilità che un meteorite colpisca Marte è circa la metà di quella della Terra , sebbene la vicinanza della fascia di asteroidi aumenti questa probabilità .
Marte è anche più vicino alle orbite di molte comete di breve periodo , cioè comete con orbite all ’interno dell ’orbita di Giove .
Tuttavia , Marte ha relativamente pochi crateri rispetto alla Luna , perché l’atmosfera marziana brucia oggetti più piccoli prima che abbiano la possibilità di colpire .
Alcuni crateri hanno una forma che suggerisce che la superficie era bagnata al momento dell ’impatto .
Una catena di crateri ( una catena ) può formarsi quando un meteorite da impatto si rompe in frammenti , ciascuno dei quali provoca un cratere .
Valli
Le centinaia di valli brevi e talvolta lunghe come Ares Vallis , che sembrano essere causate da liquidi fluenti , colpiscono .
Vulcani e montagne
Intorno all ’equatore si trova l’area di Tharsis , che è punteggiata da enormi vulcani a scudo .
Per quanto è noto , il vulcano spento Olympus Mons è la montagna più alta del nostro sistema solare .
Altri vulcani alti nella regione di Tharsis sono Ascraeus Mons , Pavonis Mons e Arsia Mons .
Grotte sono state trovate nei fianchi di Arsia Mons .
Gorge Valles Marineris
Più a est si trova Valles Marineris , una doppia gola lunga 4000 km con una larghezza fino a 250 km e una profondità di 7 km .
Questa gola continua lungo l’equatore fino a Noctis Labyrinthus ( latino : labirinto della notte ) .
Questa è un’area in cui tutti i tipi di valli profonde e con pareti scoscese sono caotiche .
Valles Marineris occupa circa un quinto della circonferenza di Marte .
Il Grand Canyon sulla Terra è molto più piccolo in confronto : 450 km di lunghezza e 2 km di profondità .
Un’altra grande gola è Ma’adim Vallis , lunga 700 km , larga 20 km e profonda 2 km .
È possibile che questo vuoto sia stato colmato con acqua liquida in un lontano passato .
Acqua
L’acqua liquida può verificarsi solo per un breve periodo nei punti più bassi della superficie di Marte ; altrove evapora o congela immediatamente .
Tuttavia , allo stato solido e gassoso , su Marte può verificarsi acqua .
Ghiaccio e permafrost
Il ghiaccio d’acqua è presente in grandi quantità , in particolare sulle due calotte polari .
La quantità di acqua immagazzinata nella calotta di ghiaccio sul polo sud di Marte è sufficiente a coprire l’intera superficie marziana con uno strato d’acqua spesso 11 m quando viene sciolta .
La quantità di ghiaccio nell ’Antartico di Marte è pari a due terzi del ghiaccio della Groenlandia .
Le calotte polari di Marte si stanno sciogliendo e diminuendo di dimensioni .
Una possibile spiegazione è che il tessuto sdraiato ha un colore chiaro e quindi riflette più luce solare della superficie scura e nuda marziana sottostante .
Nel vento , la polvere marziana esplode , a seguito della quale la superficie marziana si riscalda di più e quindi più vento soffia , e così via .
Questi effetti si rafforzano a vicenda .
Oltre ad essere immagazzinato nelle calotte polari , nel suolo marziano è presente una grande quantità di acqua sotto forma di permafrost .
La zona di permafrost si estende dai poli al 60 ° parallelo .
Nel 2016 , il radar SHARAD di MRO ha scoperto una vasta distesa di ghiaccio sotto la superficie dell ’ Utopia Planitia .
Lo strato di ghiaccio ha uno spessore da 80 a 170 metri ; oltre a polvere e rocce , è costituito dal 50 all ’ 85 % di ghiaccio d’acqua .
Il ghiaccio non sublima perché è coperto da uno strato di terreno spesso da uno a dieci metri .
Nel giugno 2008 , la sonda Mars su Phoenix ha scoperto pezzi di ghiaccio delle dimensioni di dadi in un buco scavato dalla sonda .
Inizialmente si pensava che fosse sale , ma pochi giorni dopo i blocchi erano spariti , apparentemente sublimati .
Anche la neve è stata scoperta .
Acqua corrente
Ci sono molte strutture sulla superficie marziana , come enormi letti di fiumi asciutti e canali fluviali , che possono essere formati dall ’acqua corrente .
Tuttavia , alcune di queste strutture sono contestate sul fatto che ciò possa effettivamente essere attribuito all ’acqua .
Anche il vento , i flussi di lava e lo scioglimento del ghiaccio secco possono aver formato tali strutture .
Tuttavia , l’acqua liquida che scorre sembra essere responsabile di gran parte delle strutture .
È probabile che vi siano grandi quantità di acque sotterranee liquide sotto lo spesso strato di permafrost , che in passato è stato portato in superficie durante brevi periodi di attività vulcanica .
La più grande eruzione deve essere avvenuta durante la creazione delle Valles Marineris , con abbastanza acqua che fuoriesce per creare fiumi in tutto il pianeta .
Grazie alle foto ad alta risoluzione della superficie marziana , realizzate dal Mars Global Surveyor tra il 1996 e il 2006 , questi canali , come Nirgal Vallis e Nanedi Vallis , sono stati mappati in dettaglio .
I giganteschi letti del torrente prosciugato e i loro rami laterali non sono stati trovati e potrebbero essere scomparsi a causa dell ’erosione .
I flussi devono quindi essere strutture più vecchie .
Nell ’emisfero australe sono state trovate strutture al di sopra della latitudine del cratere nelle pareti del cratere e del canyon , al di sopra del trentesimo parallelo , che assomigliano a canali di scorrimento dove l’acqua è filata dal muro .
Finora , non sono state trovate tracce di agenti atmosferici in questi canali più piccoli o canali di flusso che sono parzialmente scomparsi attraverso crateri da impatto , dimostrando che si tratta di strutture relativamente giovani .
In un caso , si possono vedere chiari cambiamenti nelle foto della stessa trincea prese a distanza di sei anni .
Sembra che nel frattempo nuovi strati di sedimenti siano stati depositati dalle frane .
Questo è difficile da spiegare senza acqua liquida .
Non è chiaro se l’acqua provenga dalle precipitazioni , dal sottosuolo o da un altro processo .
Ci sono anche spiegazioni alternative per questi canali , come spostare la polvere dal vento e scongelare il ghiaccio secco .
Nel 2013 , i ricercatori delle foto di Marte hanno scoperto una possibile causa per la presenza di canali sulle dune di polvere .
Questi hanno bordi rialzati , hanno una lunghezza massima di due chilometri , una larghezza inferiore a dieci metri e una cavità è spesso visibile sotto .
Questi erano già stati notati nelle foto di Mars Global Surveyor , ma non era chiaro come fossero avvenute .
È improbabile che l’acqua abbia causato questi canali , quando si chiudono improvvisamente , senza materiale eroso visibile .
Fotografie più recenti dell ’
Orbiter per la ricognizione di Marte hanno mostrato che questi canali si formano durante la primavera marziana su dune di polvere su cui si deposita ghiaccio di biossido di carbonio durante l’inverno .
Questi pezzi di ghiaccio si rompono e rotolano giù , dove poi evaporano .
Per mezzo di esperimenti con ghiaccio secco CO2 sulle dune della Terra , è diventato chiaro che in queste condizioni questo ghiaccio si sublima a tal punto che uno strato di gas si forma sotto il blocco di ghiaccio e solleva il ghiaccio , dopo di che rotola giù per il pendio .
Il gas spinge anche verso l’alto i bordi della trincea .
Questo processo si svolge su pendii ripidi e deboli .
Alcuni minerali sulla superficie marziana sono stati utilizzati anche per indicare la presenza di acqua liquida .
Ematite e goethite , ad esempio , si formano spesso in prossimità dell ’acqua .
Il 28 settembre 2015 , la NASA ha annunciato in una conferenza stampa che erano state trovate prove di acqua corrente usando una combinazione di foto e dati spettrometrici provenienti dalla curiosità .
Le foto mostrano pendenze con strisce scure , la cosiddetta linea di pendenza ricorrente .
La lunghezza delle strisce cresce nei mesi caldi e diminuisce nei mesi freddi .
Uno studio spettrometrico ha dimostrato , secondo la NASA , che su queste pendenze c’è sale solubile , che può essere depositato solo con acqua corrente .
Nel novembre 2017 , i ricercatori del JPL e del US Geological Survey hanno annunciato che i fenomeni osservati potrebbero avere una causa diversa rispetto all ’acqua corrente : le linee di pendenza ricorrenti potrebbero anche essere un flusso granulare , un fenomeno che è conosciuto sulla terra da dune attive ; i depositi di sale osservati potrebbero sorgere se i cristalli di sale sono idratati dal vapore acqueo atmosferico .

Aspirin makes it harder for blood clots to form Men and women over a certain age should take aspirin daily to prevent heart attacks , experts say in Heart journal .
Nottingham and Sheffield universities ' analysis of almost 12,000 patients found men from the age of 48 and women from 57 would benefit from the drug .
Heart attacks occur when a blood vessel is blocked by a clot , but aspirin makes it harder for blood clots to form .
The British Heart Foundation said more research was needed before " blanket prescribing " could be recommended .
We would encourage everyone to examine their own individual risk and take steps to reduce it by adjusting their lifestyle
Dr Mike Knapton
British Heart Foundation
Under existing recommendations , a GP will prescribe the drug if a person has already suffered a heart attack or a stroke .
It is also prescribed if factors such as high blood pressure put a patient at high risk of having such an " event " in the next few years .
But the researchers said , in reality , many people are not treated .
Some have speculated it may be easier to treat everyone over a specific age threshold such as 50 years .
Risks
An analysis of almost 12,000 patients aged between 30 and 75 showed that by the age of 47 in men and 58 in women , the 10 - year coronary heart disease risk is 10 % - a risk worth treating , the researchers said .
At that point , unless someone is at risk of dangerous side effects because they have a condition such as a stomach ulcer , the benefits outweigh the disadvantages , they concluded .
But this did not apply to people with diabetes or those at high risk of bleeding , the researchers said .
Although diabetics are likely to benefit from aspirin treatment because of their high heart disease risk , the evidence is not yet quite clear , they added .
And in anyone over the age of 75 years , the decision whether or not to take aspirin must be made on an individual basis , because they are more likely to suffer bleeding complications .
Study leader Dr Iskandar Idris , an honorary senior lecturer at Sheffield University , said routinely prescribing aspirin in these age groups was a feasible option .
But he added : " The final decision about use of aspirin must eventually be made after discussion with a healthcare provider . "
Dr Mike Knapton , director of prevention and care at the British Heart Foundation , said : " Currently the recommendations in the UK are that aspirin is prescribed after a full risk assessment under medical supervision to those who have established cardiovascular disease .
" Further robust research is needed before aspirin should be considered as a blanket primary prevention measure in the UK .
" We would encourage everyone to examine their own individual risk and take steps to reduce it by adjusting their lifestyle . "

While the gold price long has been at least " managed " by Western central banks -- as with the gold standard itself , and then the London Gold Pool of the 1960s -- the current arrangement , largely surreptitious , may have originated with an academic paper co-written in 1988 by Lawrence Summers , then a professor at Harvard , later deputy to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and then his successor .
The paper was titled " Gibson 's Paradox and the Gold Standard " and was published in the Journal of Political Economy .
You can find it here : http://www.gata.org/files/gibson.pdf
It 's very dense but GATA consultant Reginald H. Howe , a lawyer and gold mining company investor in Massachusetts , the first litigator against the gold price suppression scheme and a Harvard grad himself , put it in context in 2001 with his essay " Gibson 's Paradox Revisited : Professor Summers Analyzes Gold Prices , " which you can find in the " Essays " section on the home page at Howe 's Internet site here : http://www.goldensextant.com/
Essentially , the scheme as implied by Summers ' paper is to keep interest rates down and government bond prices up by rigging the gold market , gold and interest rates ordinarily being inversely correlated .
I 've long had a hunch that the scheme became U.S. government policy because of President Clinton 's resentment upon being told , soon after taking office , that the foremost objective of his administration should be to placate the bond market .
There is a famous quotation about this in Bob Woodward 's book about the Clinton administration 's early days , " The Agenda . "
The full book is n't available on the Internet but the quotation appears in several reviews of the book that have been posted .
Clinton says : " We 're Eisenhower Republicans here .
We stand for lower deficits , free trade , and the bond market .
Is n't that great ? ...
We help the bond market and we hurt the people who voted us in . "
Here 's a link to one such review : http://www.counterpunch.org/pollin10182003.html
My hunch is that not long after Clinton expressed this resentment of the bond market , Rubin told Clinton how the bond market could be deceived by rigging the gold market , and Clinton gave his approval .
While this scenario is admittedly speculation , the gold - carry trade , on which the gold price suppression scheme was based -- the lending of Western central bank gold reserves to investment houses at an only nominal interest rate , the investment houses ' sale of those reserves , and their use of the proceeds to purchase government bonds for a risk - free income of 5 percent or so -- is a matter of public record .
Even if it was n't the intent , this had the effect of suppressing the gold price , supporting government bond prices , and lowering interest rates .
Further , a gold mining company executive , a longtime GATA supporter , who worked with Rubin at Goldman Sachs prior to Rubin 's appointment as treasury secretary , witnessed Rubin 's involvement in the gold carry trade at Goldman .
While the people who formed GATA sensed as early as 1998 that something was wrong technically in the gold market , it took us a couple of years to figure out that the culprits were not the visible players in the futures markets -- the New York investment banking houses -- but rather the Western central banks , and that the investment houses were just their agents , their cover .
A British economist , Peter Warburton , may have been the first to put it together comprehensively , with his 2001 essay , " The Debasement of World Currency : It Is Inflation , But Not as We Know It , " which you can find here : http://www.gold-eagle.com/gold_digest_01/warburton041801.html
Warburton argued that the Western central banks meant to deprive the world of any standard by which their enormously inflationary policies could be quantified .
While the gold price suppression scheme is seldom raised in polite company and even less often acknowledged in the mainstream financial press , enough public documentation of it has been discovered to allow me to make a stump speech out of it .
Here is the stump speech 's most recent version , as presented at GATA 's conference in Washington in April : http://www.gata.org/node/6242
The speech contains Internet links to most of the documentation it cites .
An indication that maybe GATA is not just another conspiracy group came out of the blue in June 2004 , when Oleg Mozhaiskov , the deputy chairman of the Bank of Russia , that country 's central bank , gave a speech to the London Bullion Market Association 's Bullion Market Forum in Moscow .
Up to that point GATA had not knowingly had contact with anyone in Russia , and yet the only words in Mozhaiskov 's speech that were in English were " Gold Anti- Trust Action Committee . "
We heard something about the Mozhaiskov speech soon afterward but the LBMA refused to provide us a copy of its English translation .
So I got in touch with Mozhaiskov by fax in Moscow and he agreed to provide a translation through an intermediary , Moscow Narodny Bank in London .
( I told Mozhaiskov that I 'd be glad just to get the Russian text , since at that time my newspaper employed a reporter who was fluent in Russia and had studied at length there , but Mozhaiskov was insistent on controlling the translation . )
It took a couple of months but Mozhaiskov came through .
His remarks about GATA were less than a complete endorsement of our work but his meaning seemed plain enough : that the gold market was not free - trading and that it was subject to surreptitious influences .
Of course there was no need for Mozhaiskov to mention GATA if he did n't want to call attention to our work .
And of course he thereby signified that the Russian central bank had been watching GATA for a long time , quite without our knowledge .
You can find Mozhaiskov 's speech here : http://www.gata.org/node/4235
A year later , in August 2005 , Andrey Bykov , an economics adviser to the Russian president , Vladimir Putin , attended GATA 's international conference in Dawson City , Yukon Territory , at which the gold carry trade was a primary subject .
We can't prove it but we suspect that it was at this point that the Russians understood that most of their central bank 's gold had been deposited in London and leased out as part of the gold price suppression scheme , which served to suppress commodity prices generally and cheat commodity countries like Russia : http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gata/message/3502
In any case immediately after GATA 's conference in Dawson City , President Putin announced that the Bank of Russia would be adding to its gold reserves and buying gold on all markets , and gold 's ascent quickened dramatically .
We doubt that this was a coincidence .
Frank Veneroso , whose credentials in international finance are as good as anyone 's , gave his analysis of the gold carry trade at a conference in Lima , Peru , in 2002 .
You can find Veneroso 's presentation here : http://www.gata.org/node/4249
And Antal Fekete , an economist dedicated to the gold standard , wrote a year ago what struck me as an excellent essay on the underlying purpose of derivatives , which are heavily involved in the gold price suppression scheme as well as the interest rate suppression scheme : to siphon away from real goods the vast increase in the world money supply .
To a great extent Fekete 's thoughts seem to echo Warburton's : http://news.goldseek.com/GoldSeek/1187190300.php
I would summarize all this with the title of my stump speech : " There are no markets anymore , just interventions . "
Because government interventions in markets are now so pervasive , I do n't think we have much of an idea of how anything would be fairly priced .
The only thing I think we know is that Western central bank gold reserves , the crucial mechanism for market rigging , will be exhausted , likely within our lifetimes , at which point we may begin to discover market prices again -- as if commodity prices recently have n't been shocking enough .

Previous Articles by Bill Murphy
The absence of hope Today 's popular frustrations over flat - lining living standards have been building for years .
The recent boom , felt only by the already well - off , has done little to change that discontent .
Labor unrest has been growing for months ; violent protests erupted ... corporate taxes will be raised and gasoline subsidies cut ...
The move was designed to take the steam out of boiling anti-government sentiment .
In case you doubted , here is today 's front page of USAToday : Economy 's stuck , but business is booming at therapists ' offices .
If that was the end of the story -- if people had social troubles and turned to psychiatry for help , it would be a good thing .
Get help where you can .
But the larger problem is that in going to psychiatry , their socioeconomic issues get demoted to " factors " and the feelings become pathologized .
Psychiatry does n't explain , it identifies .
You 're not depressed because you lost your house ; you have depression , and one of the triggers is losing your house .
See the difference ?
You 'll say this does n't happen all the time , maybe not even the majority of the time .
But even if it does n't happen to a specific individual , it still happens to enough people that it bolsters psychiatry 's role as the necessary player in managing suffering of any kind .
A 20 % increase in therapy visits will be interpreted by psychiatry as a 20 % increase in depression and anxiety .
It will say depression has a prevalence of X , it will say it is underdiagnosed and undertreated , etc .
And it will creep into the social consciousness that these are pre-existing diseases with triggers , not the consequences of external events .
Society needs that illusion , it needs that lie , because it has created unrealistic expectations in people and no way of fulfilling them .
Here 's what a society looks like under the similar economic conditions , but without psychiatry :
The above article , also from USAToday , has a slightly different title : Egypt 's economy soars ; so does misery .
Bush , Cheney and Rice ; Hitler , Himmler and Goebbels
With what moral authority do these mainstays of the neoconservative , corporate elitist , greedy , self - interested Washington regime speak , when in their own closet there are skeletons labelled Abu Ghraib , Iraq , Guantanamo , mass murder , war crimes , illegal invasion , torture , illegal detention , disrespect for international law , denial of due process , rape ...?
Bush , Cheney and Rice ; Hitler , Himmler and Goebbels
That Bush and Rice are wholly incompetent to hold their jobs has been patently obvious from the beginning , when Rice started off by making insulting and derogatory remarks whenever she mentioned Russia , yet while as National Security Advisor prior to 9/11 failed to provide any national security whatsoever .
Talk about being downright abrasive and rude , hardly the behaviour required for a lady diplomat , but then again , nobody ever expected any better because she is not a diplomat , never was , never will be .
She is a cheap , dimwitted guttersnipe , an apology for a lady and a human being and wholly unfit to hold the office and serve her country , both of which her very presence insults .
As regards Bush , well , one has only to go to the Bushisms website and the man comes across as a vapid and abject joke .
True , he looks pretty good holding a plastic turkey and does appear to have the ability to improvise with kids on the White House lawn when left alone with them , appearing to be on the same intellectual level .
Kind of like a retarded uncle who hangs around the ranch saying inanities but who nobody ever takes seriously .
As for Cheney , this eminence grise learned a long time ago to shut the f. up and do his evil deeds behind closed doors .
Nice man .
After all , here is the man with all the contacts among his neocon friends , the corporate elitists whose policies dictate what Washington does and how many people its foreign policies kill .
Nice man .
Rumour has it that not even his own family speak to him .
And how clever he was when all those contracts were allocated without tender after the US military forces targeted civilian structures in Iraq .
Nice man .
If this pig - headed trio of crypto- fascists was to focus on its own country ’s deeds , then nobody would have anything to say .
It is , after all , up to the people of the USA to vote for whoever they wish to lead them , deceive them , act against their interests , get the country hated in the international community , screw up its economy ... whatever turns you on .
However , the constant intrusion into Russia ’s sphere of interests , the barrage of lies they sell to the corporate media parading them as the truth , and the stream of insults and provocations that come from these legions of Baal cannot and will not go unanswered .
Just who do Bush and Rice think they are , considering they can tell Russia when to take its troops out of Georgia ?
Has the USA taken its troops from Iraq ?
Has Russia got concentration camps like Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo Bay ?
Did Russia go after Saakashvili and hang him ?
Have Georgian soldiers been forced into human pyramids , had dogs set upon them , been raped , water - boarded , their food peed into or forced to eat disgusting things which go against their culture ?
Did Saakashvili not declare a ceasefire and while he was doing so mass his troops , savagely attack Tskhinvali , destroy 85 % of the city ’s structures with military hardware and slaughter 2.000 civilians on 7/8 August ?
In their failure to mention the cause of the current conflict once , Bush , Rice and the entire odious regime give their tacit approval to Georgia ’s war crimes , just as they gave their tacit approval to the war crimes perpetrated in Iraq and elsewhere ( CIA torture flights and ships , and Guantanamo Bay concentration camp ) .
Just how involved were the US military adviors that night when Georgian peacekeeping troops fired on their Russian colleagues and when the barrage of bombs and missiles killed 2.000 civilians , when Georgian tanks ran down old ladies , when Georgian US - trained troops threw grenades into basements full of huddled and terrified women and children ?
Was this what the US forces trained them for ?
And if yes , would anyone be surprised ?
So , here it is , loud and clear , for Bush , Cheney and Rice to understand .
If they think that like Goebbels , they can repeat the same lie time and time again until it becomes the truth , they are wholly wrong , as wrong as the miscalculated act of aggression against Russia , which led to the military forces they support being thrashed .
If they think that like Himmler , they can win hearts and minds through concentration camps and torture , history taught the Soviet Union ( which lost 26 million of its sons and daughters freeing Europe from Fascist tyrrany ) and the rest of the world a solemn lesson which forced the enlightened among us to vow never to allow the story to be repeated again .
Yet like Hitler , these three try .
And they do not give up .
And they keep on provoking time and time and time again .
Russia made a limited response to an act of provocation , its right under international law , in which 2.000 of its citizens were killed by US - trained Georgian troops in one night .
Quite what this trio were thinking they would achieve that night , only they know .
What they lost must have been big , given the soreness and arrogance in their voices today , and the attempts at self - justification .
And once again , Russia rules the roost , Russia calls the shots these days , Russia stands for respect for the law whereas Washington flouts it , Russia stands for peace whereas Washington stands for war , Russia defends debate , dialogue and disscussion while Washington favours antagonism , arrogance , bullying , belligerence , back - stabbing , chauvinism and skulduggery as its diplomatic tools , and Condoleeza Rice as its mouthpiece .
What a sorry - looking business card .
The female is sooooooooo 1980s ...
For two weeks now , they have been telling Russia what to do .
Two weeks on , Russia is doing what it understands it must do and will leave Georgia as and when it sees fit .
If Bush and Rice want to continue making fools of themselves by repeating the same thing over and over , it just proves their utter impotence to gain anything from yet another failed Washington policy .
Has there ever been a successful one ?

- Clifford Atiyeh , Boston.com Staff
This is n’t intended to be an exhaustive list .
It ’s no more than a quick , random trawl through one personal memory tank .
A comparative Wikipedia - based list has almost 100 entries from A to Z , but it was easy enough to think up a dozen important examples left out from that .
Qualifications : there is no obligation for the listed persons to have invented or created the object or process concerned .
This is in any case frequently unrecorded , or impossible to verify .
So far as is known , none of those listed have had their names immortalized as a result of deliberate theft of another ’s work .
The objects or processes included must be tangible or tangible processes involved in the creation of objects .
A clerihew or spoonerism are abstract word manipulations and so do n’t count .
The same applies to Morse code and the Farenheit scale .
A Caesarian operation might be said to have a product , a baby , but those born in that way do not then have ‘ Caesarean ’ attached to their names .
Finally , and most difficult to assess , the name must have a general application , and not be restricted by sale or lease to one individual or company by patent or other restrictive practice .
This would appear to disqualify Doc Martens boots , the mighty Wurlitzer , Gatling , Thompson and Browning guns and the Colt revolver , for example .
A few non-starters were dismissed during research .
Sadly , it was found that no such persons as Herr Howitzer or Mistress Furbelow exist !
However , the compiler was delighted to find he had a very familiar object named for him : the Spanner .
10 Lázló Bíró 1899 -1985
Biro or ballpoint pen
Quick - drying newspaper ink gave Hungarian - born Bíró his primary inspiration for the uniquitous pen that bears his name .
He was working in journalism at the time .
On discovering the ink would not function in an ordinary fountain pen , he co-opted his brother Georg , a chemist , and between them they developed the now - famous ball - and - socket tip .
The invention was patented in 1938 .
During the Second World War they took up residence in Argentina and filed a second patent in 1943 .
The design was used effectively in high - altitude combat aircraft at the time , and took off commercially in the years immediately after peace was declared .
Ballpoint pens have evolved to become reliable , clean , disposable and amazingly cheap .
However , when my grandfather bought me one as a birthday present in 1949 , it was made like an expensive fountain pen , boxed like one , priced like one , had a retractable tip and replacement ink cartridges .
It also rapidly revealed the grave initial drawback of the design , smothering this particular schoolboy ’s fingers , clothes and classwork with proliferating smudges of semi-indelible blue ink !
9 Robert Wilhelm Eberhardt Bunsen 1811 - 1899
Bunsen burner
All who have willingly or under duress studied chemistry during their school years will be instantly aware of the piece of fundamental lab apparatus known as a Bunsen burner .
For the benefit of those who escaped ‘ stinks ’ , it consists of a round metal base with a vertical open - topped hollow tube connected by a rubber hose to a gas supply .
The metal tube has an adjustable air inlet and the gas flow is also adjustable .
When the gas is turned on and lit at the top of the tube , it provides a variable flame which can be brought to considerable heat as required for chemical experiments .
Well , here ’s the guy to blame for it , although you might prefer to hold the Englishman Michael Faraday responsible .
He produced the prototype on which the German , Bunsen , based his design .
Bunsen is also acclaimed for various other achievements in chemistry .
8 Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel 1858 -1913
Diesel engine
Nobody is going to deny the mainstream importance of this particular French - born inventor and mechanical engineer of German origin and subsequent German residence ; or deny they have ever heard of him .
After a glittering career in the refrigeration industry was blighted by patent problems , Diesel turned his attention to the production of a more efficient motor than the steam engine and existing combustion engine .
His excellent academic trajectory had left him with a keen knowledge of thermodynamics , from which , in 1892 , emerged his first compression - ignition engine .
With some trepidation as an Englishman , I have to report here that a tyke ( Yorkshireman ) , Herbert Akroyd Stuart , is in fact considered to have invented the compression - ignition engine before Diesel .
Apparently he even filed his patent two years earlier .
So , all together now everybody , “ the Stuart engine ” .
But , to the victor the spoils , as English football knows , having won the soccer World Cup from the Germans in 1966 by a goal that was not a goal .
Diesel disappeared at sea while on his way by steamship to a company meeting in London .
Considering the triumph of his system over steam , he might perhaps be said finally to have poured his oil on troubled waters ( or was it Stuart ’s revenge ? ) .
As a curiously modern tailpiece for those becoming more concerned with biofuels in this day and age , Diesel ’s original motors ran on … peanut oil !
Nothing new under the sun .
7 George Washington Gale Ferris , Jr. 1859-1896
Ferris wheel or observation wheel
The name Ferris wheel is given to a large , slowly rotating upright wheel of open metal
structure with passenger seats or observation gondolas suspended at regular intervals around it .
Modest sized examples are found at local travelling or fixed fairgrounds , larger ones have been created as showpieces for national or international exhibitions .
The largest , such as the London Eye , form permanent fixtures on the urban landscape , and carry large numbers of visitors to considerable heights , from where sweeping vistas can be appreciated .
As with so many widespread inventions , earlier precursors existed at a local level , the first recorded examples being constructed of wood and perhaps carrying eight or so passengers .
These existed in the Ottoman Empire , at least from the 17th century onwards .
Ferris , an American railway and bridge engineer , invented and gave his name to his metal wheel ( and to all others subsequently ) for the 1893 World ’s Columbian Exposition .
The original was 80 m high and had a capacity of 2160 passengers in 36 cars .
It was powered by two steam engines and ran until 1906 .
Given his full name , what a wonder it did n’t get called the Washington wheel !
As it was , Ferris claimed that the Exhibition organisers had cheated him and the investors out of most of the profits .
Like other inventors , he was driven to waste time , money and energy in the courts attepting to claim what was rightfully his by contract .
As a rule successful inventors tend to live to a ripe old age .
Ferris was one of the unfortunate exceptions .
Typhoid fever claimed him early , at 37 , a mere three years after his fame was sealed .
As a boy I used to holiday every summer with my parents at Folkestone , Kent , and was always drawn to the attraction of a summer fairground there .
It had a tower some 30 - 35 m high , from which a daring stuntman would dive into a ridiculously small container of water , after the manner of Duncan the horse in the Simpsons .
I often took trips on its Ferris wheel .
Our family has also experienced the spectacular views across London from the Millenium Wheel , or Eye , including as far as the pitch of the professional soccer team we support .
What a shame the eponymous Ferris Bueller did n’t joy - ride on one during his cinematic Day Off .
6 Dr Joseph - Ignace Guillotin 1738 - 1814
Guillotine
Oh , dear .
Poor Dr. G. What a terrible object to be immortalised in .
Although given her sex , and above all the sobriquet of ‘ Madame Guillotine ’ , perhaps the bloody beheader might better be regarded as the good doctor ’s wife !
Guillotin , a French medic and politician , did not actually invent the gadget .
Unlikely as it might seem too , the impulse that induced it was humanitarian .
Up until then a principle object of capital punishment had often been to inflict the maximum pain by breaking the sentenced person ’s body as slowly and agonisingly as possible before merciful release by the ending of life .
At least once , this so incensed onlookers that they overcame the executioner and released the prisoner .
With need for reform in the air , Guillotin proposed a system that would behead instantly and painlessly .
Ironically , he was in fact opposed to capital punishment and hoped this would lead eventually to abolition .
Happily , he passed away naturally , and did not fall victim to his eponymous death machine .
We actually have a tame guillotine in our house .
Provided we are careful to keep fingers out of harm ’s way , it does nothing more sinister than trim paper to our needs .
5 W. H. “ Boss ” Hoover fl. 1908
Hoover or vacuum cleaner
One of the bigger surprises while researching for this list was how little information is readily available for the person whose name is most associated with the vacuum cleaner .
In fact no personal details at all .
The main reason is clear .
He was little more than an early corporate figure who began manufacturing someone else ’s particular design in 1908 once the invention was already well - established .
It would make about as much sense to call a computer a Gates .
Another quaint twist .
Hoover was American .
Yet it is the British who turned ‘ the hoover ’ into an eponymous generic word .
It ’s rather as if Brits said ‘ hovercraft ’ while Americans referred to the same machine as a ‘ cockerell ’ ( after it ’s English inventor ) .
From an outside perspective , one supposes ‘ the Hoover ’ for Americans might refer to the 31st pres .
or a rather shady figure caught up in events such as the aftermath of JFK ’s assassination .
For the records , the vacuum cleaner was invented ( as a manual machine ) in 1868 .
The actual Hoover prototype with its unique rotating brush was the design of one James Murray Spangler .
In fact a classic case of Stigler ’s Law of Eponymy , of which numerous examples abound : “ No discovery is named after its original discoverer . ”
4 John Loudon McAdam 1756 - 1836
Macadam road surface , tar Macadam or tarmac
Our present high - speed motorways and interstates can trace their origin back to the aristocratic second son of the Scottish Baron of Waterhead , sometime resident in the United States .
His was one of the first serious advances in major national highway engineering since the excellent initial advances by the Romans .
He became involved in this branch of civil engineering due to being an estate owner and turnpike trustee .
McAdam ’s three essential innovations were to create a solid , compacted , well - drained foundation of rock and gravel ; to raise the road surface above the surrounding ground - level , and to incorporate a camber for surface drainage .
The major later development was the addition of a sealed , tarred surface .
As with so many important inventors or innovators , he scarcely benefited personally from his system , which was rapidly and widely adopted throughout western civilisation .
One might even perhaps aptly consider that he was steamrollered politically .
3 John Montagu , 4th Earl of Sandwich 1718 - 1792
Sandwich , as bread or similar outside with filling between
The placing of a filling between bread had a long and partly accidental history before it was identified and named .
Its earliest known example is considered to have been consumed during the Passover feasts of the ancient Hebrews , when unleavened bread similar to Indian chupattis or Mexican tortillas would have been used .
The noble Earl himself held various high diplomatic and military posts as was typical for English aristocrats of the time .
In public life he was noted for his incompetence and corruption .
Sandwich was nevertheless buttered on the clean - cut side too , notably in his laudable and wholehearted support for Captain Cook ’s maritime explorations , which landed him the even more solid honour of having the Sandwich Islands named for him .
However , when those were renamed the Hawaiian Islands his memory was stuck with the edible double - decker .
Various explanations are offered as to how he became associated with this early convenience food .
One possibility is that being such a busy man , he preferred to take his meals in that cleaner form at his desk .
Another suggestion has it that the dry bread on both sides kept his fingers clean during long gambling sessions of cards without him having to leave the table and wash them at intervals .
The bread - based type has in turn led to a few culinary variations such as the sponge sandwich .
Philological spin - offs include the sandwich course and being sandwiched between people in a crowd .
2 Henry Shrapnel 1761 - 1842
Shrapnel shell
Common logic seems to suggest some eponymous names were inspired by their products , not vice versa .
One that comes immediately to mind is Crapper .
Surely Thomas Crapper ’s name must have been derived from second - hand allusion ?
Perhaps he was a lavatory cleaner or attendant ?
Not a bit of it .
The unfortunate fellow is forever down among the ordure as a result of his own ‘ full - flush ’ inventive mind !
The same would seem to hold true for another Englishman , Henry Shrapnel .
So well - known are the shards of shells called shrapnel , that his family surely acquired its name from them .
Not at all .
Shrapnel , an active - service army officer , was the inventor .
His original design , a spherical cannon shell , exploded in mid-air , showering the enemy with lethal metal .
It was the birth of a concept which ultimately led to the infamous cluster - bomb .
The system became used early - on to counter the deployment of aircraft in wartime .
Allied pilots of WW1 call it ‘ Archie ’ .
German shell - smoke was black , allied white .
We used to hear A.A. shrapnel showering down on our roof during the Nazi blitz raids of the 1940s , and as small boys would collect the fascinatingly - shaped shiny stuff from the streets next morning .
Shrapnel himself was one of the luckier inventors .
He received a princely annual award of over $ 125,000 ( today ’s equivalent ) for life from a grateful British Government .
1 Luigi Galvani 1737 -1798
Galvanised ( as iron )
Italy enters the list with the scientist Galvani .
A famous experiment with frogs ’ legs led him to make the first connection between electricity and the movement of animate life .
Thanks to a genial technical dispute with the better - known Volta about the essence and origin of organic electricty , he received from Volta the compliment of a direct current of electricity produced by chemical action being called ‘ galvanism ’ .
The dispute also led to Volta producing the first battery , and of course Volta also reaped his share of eponymous fame .
‘ Galvanism ’ became an outmoded term , but was modified to the words ‘ galvanisation ’ and ‘ galvanised ’ .
These have become a permanent part of our vocabulary for metal plated by electrical process .
They have also bequeathed us the figurative phrase ‘ galvanised into action ’ !
Contributor : Spanner - In - The - Works
In September , rental agent Lynne Hubbard sat in a cafe across from Dr. John Getzow , whom she was considering as a potential tenant for a room above O'Reilly 's Holy Grail restaurant and bar on Polk Street .
He was clean - cut and well dressed .
He was a doctor , after all , and he seemed eager to find a place to live .
But there was something faintly odd about him .
Getzow , 55 , had arranged to meet Hubbard at the Crepe House on Polk .
Once he sat down at the table , he told her about his technical consulting firm that helped hospitals with billing software .
He went on to say he was active in city politics ; he had worked on Mayor Gavin Newsom 's campaign , and was currently involved in fund - raising for Senator Barack Obama 's bid for the presidency .
At one point Getzow moved aside the coffee mugs on the small table and placed a leather - bound portfolio in front of Hubbard .
He flipped through pages of references from former landlords , invoices addressed to hospitals for huge sums — even a letter of recommendation from Newsom 's former campaign manager .
" I thought the portfolio presentation was a bit much for a room over O'Reilly 's Holy Grail , " Hubbard says .
" He was trying too hard to impress me , but I was n't sure why .
I thought maybe it was because I 'm female . "
Considering Getzow 's glowing credentials , Hubbard never would have guessed that when she accepted his application for the apartment in Myles O'Reilly 's building , his tenancy would eventually cost the landlord thousands of dollars and climax in Getzow 's arrest for assault .
As it turned out , Getzow was not a licensed doctor in California , although he did work sporadically as a medical software consultant .
He also was not as integral to the political campaigns he had volunteered for .
In fact , he was one of the most successful " serial evictees " in San Francisco , a select group of tenants who take advantage of the city 's lenient courts and tenant - support nonprofits to tie up landlords in court for months while they live practically rent - free in one of the most expensive cities in the country .
Depending on the vigilance of the landlord , a seasoned serial evictee like Getzow can get away with a minimum of 45 days and sometimes up to a year of free rent .
The actual number of serial evictees operating in San Francisco is difficult to track , but some attorneys who specialize in representing landlords estimate there are between 20 and 100 .
Landlord attorney Clifford Fried of Wiegel and Fried says these types of tenants know they 're unlikely to be punished for withholding rent .
" You can go into a store and steal a loaf of bread and do a year in jail , " he says , " but you can steal months of rent from a landlord and never do any time in jail .
It 's a great crime to commit because there are no penalties . "
Getzow has a string of evictions going back to 1992 in San Diego .
He has also been evicted in Los Angeles and Walnut Creek .
But it is in San Francisco where he has been most prolific :
According to court records , he has been evicted from seven residences in the city since 2002 .
These do n't include the landlords who did n't take legal action against him , such the owners of the Swiss House on O'Farrell , where Getzow lived rent - free for months before moving on , according to former owner Hans Selhorn .
Steven Williams of Wiegel and Fried represented a landlord who evicted Getzow in 2006 .
When the attorney recently saw Getzow during a break in yet another eviction proceeding , he recognized the man , but was n't sure from where .
" At first I thought he was an attorney I had worked with , " Williams says .
" It took me a while to remember who he was , but that 's how he comes across , a smooth - talking gentleman in a nice blue blazer and khakis ... like a Harvard man . "
But it takes more than a suit and a haircut to be a successful serial evictee .
You have to be well versed in city and state rent laws in order to live rent - free , and Getzow apparently knows all the tricks , which he used on his new landlord O'Reilly last fall .
O'Reilly has a reputation for being a generous boss who goes out of his way to help employees and regular customers .
In September , he was still new to being a landlord when Hubbard approved Getzow for a room , and saw no reason to be concerned .
O'Reilly liked the idea of helping out a politically active doctor who might be a little down on his luck .
He made his new tenant feel welcome , even giving him some free meals in the restaurant , according to Hubbard .
But some of O'Reilly 's employees and other tenants wondered why a doctor would want to live above a restaurant and bar on Polk .
It was n't long before they all realized Getzow was going to be trouble , according to Brett Bennett , another tenant in the building .
Getzow was quiet at first , but soon he was overly interested in making friends with the other tenants , says Bennett , who works as a registered nurse .
" He told me he was a doctor and that he could get me a job with a ' real company , ' " Bennett says .
" I 'm a gay man , so I know a lot of people who work it real hard , and I work with recovering addicts who are always looking for an angle .
I could tell that Getzow was a snake . "
Bennett says Getzow was continually talking about his political connections .
He 'd hosted fund - raisers for Assemblywoman Fiona Ma and for Obama .
He also implied to Bennett that he was a health - care adviser to Newsom .
Getzow did volunteer for Newsom 's 2003 mayoral campaign , but he was not an official adviser .
Newsom 's campaign manager , Alex Tourk , who wrote a letter of recommendation for Getzow , and consultant Johnny Wang say he was a dedicated volunteer who was at campaign headquarters every day , but after the election he played little part , if any , in the administration .
Bennett says Getzow was soon trying to get the other tenants to join in a lawsuit against O'Reilly over noise from the bar downstairs .
Then Getzow changed the locks on his door .
" He was laughing about it , like he was doing it out of spite , " Bennett says .
" It was very strange ... he takes this joy out of it . "
Getzow 's stay above the Grail was right out of the serial evictee 's playbook .
He moved into room six in late September and failed to pay October 's rent , court records indicate .
O'Reilly soon realized Getzow had no intention of paying , and moved to serve him with a three - day notice to pay or move out .
Serving such a notice begins a tricky legal process that is fraught with pitfalls .
The slightest misstep can set the process back by weeks or even months , during which time the tenant lives rent - free and the landlord loses money .
For example , the notice does n't count if the landlord slips it under the tenant 's door or leaves it on the floor outside the apartment .
Furthermore , if the landlord tapes it on the unit door instead of personally serving the tenant , state law requires the notice also has to be sent by certified mail .
Even if the landlord serves the notice according to the letter of the law , the serial evictee usually challenges the service , which automatically adds two weeks or more to the process .
In Getzow 's case , Hubbard says , after the tenant received the three - day notice , he stopped answering his door or his phone to avoid being served with the complaint and summons , the second document in the eviction process .
This is more difficult to serve because it has to be given directly to the tenant .
" Myles had to hire someone to sit in the hallway for up to 10 hours a day , waiting for Getzow to come out , " Hubbard says .
" I 'm pretty sure the person had waited there for , like , five days , and they knew he was in the room because they could hear the radio and shower . "
The summons was finally served on Dec. 19 , according to court records .
But that was only the beginning .
It would take O'Reilly another five months of wrangling with the court system and thousands of dollars in lost rent and attorney fees .
The number of serial evictees operating in San Francisco is hard to add up because they are good at covering their tracks .
They have a number of tricks , such as changing their names to dodge background checks , or using phony landlord and work references .
Also benefiting them is a state law that requires eviction actions to be masked from the public for 60 days after their initial filing .
But most landlord attorneys can rattle off two or three names without thinking .
One legendary serial evictee used a series of aliases .
" I evicted him once in 45 days ; it was a record , " Fried says .
" He was a character .
One time he was being evicted under a different name , and when he walked into the courtroom and realized the judge knew him , he turned and ran out . "
Another serial evictee , who claims he has a disability , has been successful in persuading judges to have all records refer to him as " John Doe . "
One evictee is so litigious that two seasoned attorneys refused to utter his name , though legend has it that he occupied an upscale home in Presidio Heights for years without ever paying the $ 5,000 monthly rent .
With so much at stake , it 's a riddle how serial evictees are able to trick one landlord after another when credit reports , court records , and job histories are readily available .
But landlord attorney Daniel Bornstein says it 's not as difficult as it might seem .
There are many landlords in San Francisco who simply do n't do thorough background checks , either because they are trusting or they are in a hurry to start collecting rent , Bornstein explains .
" Believe it or not , a lot of landlords are struggling , and they can be in a hurry to fill an empty unit , " he says .
" And some guy with charisma comes along and the landlord is willing to take a chance . "
But once a serial evictee occupies a unit , a host of state laws kicks in to guarantee a minimum 45 - day free stay .
In San Francisco , which has some of the most progressive rental policies in the state , there are numerous free services and programs for tenants .
These include the San Francisco Tenants Union , Bay Area Legal Aid , the city - run San Francisco Residential Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Board , and several nonprofits that are largely city - funded , such as the Bar Association of San Francisco and the Eviction Defense Collaborative , the latter of which receives about $ 800,000 annually from the city .
The city 's rental ordinance also requires the three - day notice to include a sentence telling tenants where they can get legal advice on eviction proceedings , Bornstein says .
And San Francisco is one of the only cities in the country in which the courts require that evictees should be represented by an attorney .
Defense Collaborative executive director Miguel Wooding says his nonprofit , which has advised Getzow in at least four eviction cases , helps about 2,000 tenants each year .
The collaborative primarily provides information and legal strategies to tenants who are representing themselves against landlords in court .
The vast majority of cases , he says , involve tenants who have fallen on hard times or are being wrongfully evicted by landlords for reasons such as living in rent - controlled apartments the landlords would like to rent at market value .
Wooding says the serial evictee problem in San Francisco is smaller than landlord attorneys claim .
" It 's very difficult to track something like that , but I would say of the 2,000 people we help every year , less than 1 percent are trying to take advantage of the system , " he says .
" In any case , it 's not our role to judge the people who come to us for help .
Tenants have a right to present their case in court . "
And San Francisco has its share of heartless landlords .
One extreme example is the terror tactics allegedly employed by property owners Kip and Nicole Macy , who were charged with numerous felonies earlier this year for , among other things , cutting the support beams from one tenant 's floor , burglarizing another 's apartment , and cutting off utilities to another .
Carolyn Gold directs the San Francisco Volunteer Legal Services Program , which manages a group of 10 volunteer attorneys who help tenants in the 30 or so eviction cases that come through Superior Court each week .
She says she sees very few serial evictees like Getzow .
" In fact , what we see more of is serial evictors , landlords who continually come up with ruses for one eviction after another , " she says .
" There are lots of tenants who have gotten themselves into a tight spot for one reason or another — they 're elderly , they have medical conditions , lost jobs — things that are beyond their control .
I see it every day , and it's very , very sad . "
While this may be the case , small landlords are also susceptible to savvy tenants like Getzow who know how to work the system .
" There can be a series of ' gotcha ' moments , such as the landlord accepting money from a tenant , that can set the whole process back , " Bornstein says .
" There 's a morass of litigation that can cause delays , and remember the landlord is paying for an attorney the entire time in addition to losing rent . "
In May , Getzow and O'Reilly , along with other litigants locked in eviction battles , were jammed into a small courtroom on the second floor of the Civic Center Courthouse on McAllister .
Getzow , who was being represented by a volunteer attorney from the Eviction Defense Collaborative , had requested a trial , claiming he should n't have to pay rent because O'Reilly 's building was substandard .
Getzow 's written habitability complaint listed 20 alleged defects including dangerous stairways , poor security , mold , and drafty windows .
But his complaint was highly suspect , given that it was word - for - word identical to complaints he had filed in four previous evictions .
The presiding judge authorized Getzow and O'Reilly 's dispute to enter the settlement phase , where tenant and landlord both have the incentive to reach a settlement and avoid trial .
In fact , only about 5 percent of evictions end up being tried , according to Borstein .
For landlords , legal fees can be between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 , depending on the complexity of the case .
For serial evictees , the settlement conference is where they can get all sorts of perks if they play their cards right .
Some negotiate two additional months or longer of free rent before they move out , plus moving costs and a good reference to use for future landlords .
The terms may seem outrageous , but landlords often agree to them to avoid the cost of going to trial .
Plus San Francisco is a political town , and landlord attorneys say judges and juries are wildcards in eviction cases .
A landlord may win an eviction action , but the judge will turn around and give the tenant occupancy provided he or she pays the rent , by an action known as a relief from forfeiture motion .
While some renters play hardball during the settlement conference and try to squeeze the landlords for as much as they can get , Getzow was apologetic in at least one case .
James Babcock , who spent five months evicting him in 2006 , says Getzow poured on the charm , and continued to make promises .
Babcock , who rented Getzow an apartment in his building at 1137 Bush , says , " Even after I received a judgment against him for $ 11,000 , which I know I 'll never see , he came up to me in court and vowed to pay me back as though it were all some kind of misunderstanding . "
Getzow , who declined to be interviewed for this story , did not sit in on the May settlement conference , as he normally would have .
Instead , he waited outside in the hall while his court - appointed attorney negotiated on his behalf .
Getzow may have avoided direct negotiations with O'Reilly because of an argument the two had last winter that erupted in violence .
According to police , Getzow came into the Holy Grail on Feb. 10 at about 1:30 a.m. complaining about noise and attempting to goad O'Reilly into a fight .
O'Reilly refused and tried to get Getzow to leave .
Bartender Patricia Herlihy was so alarmed at Getzow 's behavior that she began taking photographs of him with a digital camera .
Getzow approached her and shoved or pushed the camera into her face , SFPD Sergeant Neville Gittens says .
Herlihy was taken to the hospital , Gittens says , though the police report contains no information about the extent of her injuries .
Getzow retreated to a nearby crepe restaurant , where he was still in such an agitated state when the police arrived that it took several officers to restrain him , the report says .
On July 25 , Getzow entered a plea of not guilty to two felony assault charges and one misdemeanor assault charge .
After Getzow had waited for half an hour outside the courthouse conference room , his attorney finally emerged .
While it is unknown what tenant and landlord settled on , this much is clear :
Up until that point , Getzow had lived for seven months in his apartment without paying rent , and ten days later , he finally moved out of O'Reilly 's building .
Getzow is getting pretty well known along the Polk Street corridor .
Unlike other serial evictees , who move among different neighborhoods , all of his eight evictions in San Francisco have occurred in a 20 - block area known as Lower Nob Hill .
It includes lower Polk Street between California and McAllister , where a mishmash of businesses seem to defy traditional neighborhood classification .
There are a lot of marginal residence hotels and older apartment buildings whose managers ask few questions of prospective tenants .
It 's a place where someone like Getzow can blend into the social spectrum that includes young professionals walking briskly between the upscale restaurants and wine bars , old bohemians sipping cappuccinos at cafes , and teenage street hustlers trolling the street for tricks .
Lynne Hubbard , the rental agent who screened Getzow , says the problems he caused put a heavy strain on her dealings with O'Reilly , and they eventually severed their business relationship .
Hubbard has seen Getzow walking along Polk , and heard that he moved into another building nearby .
" Why does he have to stay in this neighborhood ? "
Hubbard says as she watches the bustling foot traffic from the Crepe House restaurant .
" He 's ripped off so many people here , and he continues to eat and drink and hang out in this neighborhood .
And we have to watch him . "
Babcock , who got to know Getzow fairly well while they lived in the same building , says Getzow has a lot of potential , and it's a shame that it goes to waste .
" If he just put the same energy into a profession that he puts into not paying rent and spending time in court , he would probably be a very successful man , " he says .
On a windy afternoon in late May , Getzow was moving his belongings out of his room above the Holy Grail .
O'Reilly stood stone - faced at the corner , watching the man who cost him thousands of dollars in lost rent and legal fees load his possessions into a vehicle .
He was overheard telling one of his employees in a heavy Irish brogue , " I 'm just glad to be rid of the bastard . "
A couple of other residents could n't help but laugh when they recognized the man helping Getzow as the manager of a small apartment building at 1470 California , just a few blocks away .
" He 's a real operator , " one of them says .
" I feel sorry for his new landlord .
He 's going to find out soon enough . "

Olympic officials are hoping pollution will not hamper the Games
Beijing 's main Olympic stadium was barely visible under the city 's murky sky on Monday , just four days before the Games are due to begin .
An Olympic official said the low visibility was due to high humidity , a natural phenomenon , state media said .
But he was optimistic that athletes , officials and spectators would enjoy good air quality during the Games .
The spokesman for the organisers , Sun Weide , said pollution control measures over the past decade would work .
According to data from Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau , air quality on Monday was still considered a " blue sky day " .
But the BBCs own test found one major pollutant , particulate matter , was almost six times higher than the recommended level .
The World Health Organizations target is 50 micrograms per cubic metre .
But we recorded levels in Beijing at 292 micrograms on Monday .
The test was done at a time of day when many Olympic events will take place .
The International Olympic Committee has said endurance events lasting more than one hour could be delayed if the pollution is too bad .
But it remains unclear how bad the pollution has to be before an event is postponed .
Beijing has taken some drastic measures to improve the air quality for the Games .
Almost a third of Beijings 3.3 million cars have been taken off the citys roads .
A new report released by marketing research firm Emerging Energy Research ( EER ) highlights the US ' booming wind energy market .
According to their report , the US is on track to be generating 150 gigawatts of energy from wind power alone by 2020 .
While this would be an astonishing rate of growth , it still falls well short — by nearly 50 percent — of having 20 percent of the grid fed by wind , which both the Department of Energy and oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens believe the US can achieve .
In 2007 , the United States ' energy demands were met primarily by petroleum , coal , and natural gas ; renewable energy sources accounted for only seven percent .
Of the renewable energy sources , hydroelectric power generates the lion 's share of electricity .
At the end of March 2008 , the US had an installed wind power capacity of 18,302 MW , accounting for only about one percent of the total usage in the country .
However , times are a changin ' .
Image credit : Emerging Energy Research
Installed wind power grew a staggering 45 percent in 2007 , and that growth seems poised to continue .
In a recent report , the Department of Energy said if a series of challenges are met , then the US should be able to derive a full 20 percent of its electric demand from wind power alone by 2030 .
Given the pace of construction — farms capable of generating eight gigawatts are under construction and expected to be on - line by the end of the year — a new report claims that the US will be generating over 150 gigawatts by 2020 , short of the 20 percent goal , but an incredible amount of clean power .
Research and investments are being poured into this technology , which is helping fuel its rapid growth .
In a recent research paper in the International Journal of Global Energy Issues , engineers in Greece examined the total cost of various " green " technologies to see how they stacked up to fossil fuels once construction , maintenance , and disposal were taken into account .
They found that wind , along with geothermal , were the greenest alternatives to fossil fuels , so the boom in wind power is not only good for the US ' energy independence , but it is good for the planet as well .
With the recent surge in wind power demand , there has been a similar surge in demand for the equipment needed for capturing the wind .
In April , turbine manufacturer General Electric confirmed that a wind turbine shortage existed , and is growing .
In a conference call to analysts , GE reported that they currently had a $ 12 billion backlog of orders booked but not shipped ; over double that of just one year prior .
This may be just the beginning , as marketing firm EER predicts that the market for turbines will grow to $ 16 billion by the end of 2015 .
Not to be outdone by wind power , solar is making large leaps in terms of installed projects .
In California , companies are in the middle of building a pair of massive solar plants that together will generate over 800 megawatts of power — over 12 times more power than the next largest plant currently in operation .
The plants , when completed , will cover over 12.5 square miles in sunny central California .
The scale of these plants is significant , as a previous study has shown that small solar installations are not actually an efficient alternative to other power sources .
It 's only once the scales became large enough that solar is a cleaner and greener alternative to fossil fuels .
While the latest available data shows that the United States has a long way to go before it will reach some of the lofty goals put forth for renewable energy , the surge in wind interest alone suggests that significant changes are underway .
As the graphic accompanying this article shows , there are many states that have large amounts of wind energy production facilities in the construction pipeline .
Once the planned projects are built , four states are set to be producing more wind power than the entirety of the country did in 2007 .

Tom Feeley , owner and editor of InformationClearingHouse.info , has endured public harassment , home invasions , death threats and threats to his family simply for running a website .
The operator of a leading alternative news and strongly anti-war website has become the target of nefarious thugs apparently in the employ of the U.S. government who have continually harassed him and ordered him to shut down his website .
Tom Feeley , owner and editor of Information Clearing House .info , has endured public harassment , home invasions , death threats and threats to his family simply for running a website .
Counterpunch writer Mike Whitney has circulated an e mail describing what happened to Feeley in an attempt to draw attention to the matter .
Whitney writes that earlier this week Feeley ’s wife was startled to suddenly discover three well dressed men standing in her kitchen who told her that Tom must “ Stop what he is doing on the Internet , NOW ! ”
To emphasize the point , the thug pulled back his jacket to reveal a gun while barking out the warning .
Tom ’s wife was hysterical and refuses to go back to the house .
She contacted the FBI but was told there was nothing they could do .
According to Whitney , “ The well - dressed man told Tom ’s wife that he knew where her son lived , what line of work he was in , and how many children he had . ”
Subsequently , two men in a parked car a block from Tom ’s mother ’s house were spotted using laptops and sped off when they were approached by Tom ’s son .
A similar incident had happened four years previously , when Feeley was approached by a stranger in the parking lot of Long ’s Drug store in Southern California , after being forced to remain in his car by an accomplice who blocked him from opening the car door .
The man told him , “ You need to stop what you are doing on the web ” .
Tom said the man was overweight and had his shirt untucked .
Tom was taken aback , but ( after collecting himself said ) “ What the fuck ?
Who do you think you are telling me what I can do ? ”
The man answered , “ Tom , I ’m just giving you some good advice .
You should take my advice , Tom . ”
I ’ll tell you this about Tom Feeley ; he is no bullshitter , ” writes Whitney , “ He is the “ real deal ” and completely committed to exposing the mob that is presently running our country .
He does not understand why , ( as he says ) “ They are reaching down SO far to get someone who just runs web site ” .
But , the truth is , they are .
Someone wants him to “ shut up ” and they apparently have the muscle to do it .
He knows he is in danger . ”
Feeley is ditching his cellphone and maintaining a low profile but to his credit , refuses to cave in to the threats and will continue to publish his website .
Drawing attention to Feeley ’s situation is of paramount importance to ensure his protection and also to combat head on attempts to create a chilling atmosphere and intimidate journalists and website publishers .

Kirk Dillard served with Obama in the Illinois state Senate , as in this file photo from July 23 , 2004 .
Barack Obama ’s accidental surrogate
If you ’ve read enough profiles of Barack Obama , chances are you ’re familiar with the name Kirk Dillard .
An accomplished and articulate legislator who served with Obama in the Illinois state Senate , he is frequently called on by the national media to shed light on the presumptive Democratic nominee ’s early days in politics .
Dillard is an unabashed admirer , one whose high praise for Obama led the campaign to feature him in Obama ’s first biographical television ad .

All of that would n’t be so unusual except for the fact that Dillard is a Republican .
And a delegate for John McCain .
Now , as a result of his willingness to regularly offer an unvarnished take on Obama ’s Springfield years , Dillard is facing some serious blowback within his own party .
Much of the resentment stems from Dillard ’s starring role in the Obama commercial , which aired long into the primary season and burnished Obama ’s bipartisan credentials in six states , including Iowa .
“ Sen . Obama worked on some of the deepest issues we had , and he was successful in a bipartisan way , ” said Dillard in the ad .
“ Republican legislators respected Sen. Obama .
His negotiation skills and an ability to understand both sides would serve the country very well . ”
Dillard was not yet a McCain delegate when the spot was filmed , but his appearance nevertheless rubbed GOP colleagues the wrong way .
“ There was some obvious concern about Sen .
Dillard and the fact that he was in an ad , and the comments he ’s made , ” said Frank Watson , the Senate Republican leader .
“ I just had to say I was disappointed that he was in a commercial for the candidate .
That was over the top .
He did n’t just hear from me .
Colleagues , Republicans in general throughout the state , were very disappointed in his participation . ”
Andy McKenna , the state party chairman , also raised the issue with Dillard .
“ I echoed what I ’d heard from many people that they were disappointed and found it counterproductive , ” he said .
But it was n’t just the commercial that landed Dillard in hot water .
It was the stream of laudatory remarks in the media , including some made in a 2007 Obama conference call he participated in .
As soon as it seemed likely that Obama would be the Democratic nominee , other Republican state Senate colleagues privately complained to Dillard that anything positive he said about Obama would hurt McCain .
Besides , as they recalled things , Obama had much more modest achievements and a far less dramatic presence .
“ Kirk ’s enthusiasm for Sen . Obama is clearly an outlier , ” said GOP state Sen. Christine Radogno .
“ Everyone agrees Barack ’s an intelligent guy , but in terms of being a stupendous standout , that ’s a unique view . ”
“ In fairness , [ Dillard ] served with Obama longer than I did , ” said Dale Righter , the Illinois Senate Republican Caucus chairman .
“ But I ’ve seen him refer to Obama as having done really yeoman ’s work in the Illinois state Senate .
I do n’t know that I ’d agree with that from my two years with him . ”
Dillard contends he was punished by Watson for his pro-Obama remarks .
Dillard , who serves in the unpaid position of party whip , said that he had been assured by Watson that he would get the next opening among the paid leadership positions , namely assistant leader .
But , when an opening came , he was passed over .
Dillard believes it was , at least in part , payback .
“ The partisans want to punish me , ” he said .
“ They ’ve done it through pocketbook and position . ”
Watson was unavailable to return a follow - up request for comment on that claim .
But his spokesperson , Patty Schuh , denied that any specific position had been promised .
She did not rule out the possibility that Dillard ’s comments on Obama might have contributed to him not getting the job but said it could not have been the sole reason .
Dillard also appeared , to some colleagues , to be dragging his feet on a matter of importance to his colleagues — a request from McCain ’s Illinois campaign chairman , state Rep. Jim Durkin , that Dillard formally ask the Obama campaign to remove the ad from the air .
Durkin says that Dillard delayed for months until finally , in May , Durkin himself offered to draft a formal letter for Dillard to sign and send to the Obama campaign .
“ He walked the letter over to my desk on the Senate floor and stuck it under my nose and asked me if I ’d sign it , ” recalled Dillard .
Durkin says that Dillard was not taken by surprise and that Dillard revised the letter himself .
“ I had talked to Kirk and I had suggested to him that I would draft the letter , ” said Durkin .
“ I did not just show up on the Senate floor .
He was pleased and relieved .
I came over with a draft , and he marked it up . ”
Durkin added that Dillard had said he was glad to bring the matter to a close .
“ Kirk has received a lot of flak in Illinois .
I was doing this to protect Kirk , and he was thankful that I did this , ” he said .
Durkin said the letter was his idea and that it did not originate from within the McCain campaign .
When presented with the request in June , the Obama campaign agreed to stop airing the ad .
“ Sen . Obama appreciates that Sen .
Dillard worked with him in a bipartisan way in the Illinois Legislature to take on the special interests and pass campaign finance and ethics reform , ” said Obama spokesman Hari Sevugan .
“ But he understands that Sen .
Dillard feels obligated to support his party ’s nominee . ”
Dillard attributes some of the GOP pushback to reflexive partisanship .
“ Some of the totally partisan , more conservative legislators from Day One were not understanding of my cameo appearance in a Sen. Obama ad in Iowa , ” he said .
“ The only people I received negative feedback from initially were the partisan leaders . ”
Kent Redfield , a professor of political science at the University of Illinois - Springfield and an expert on state politics , said that Dillard may have been surprised by the controversy his comments caused , because state politics in Illinois are generally isolated from national partisan rancor .
“ Politics tends to be not very nationally or ideologically focused on the state level in Illinois , ” said Redfield .
But Dillard ’s comments also may have touched a raw nerve by exacerbating preexisting intra-party tensions .
“ The Republican Party in Illinois has a huge ideological split between the moderate wing and the hard right , ” said Redfield .
“ Dillard is seen as part of the moderate suburban crowd , so there ’s a ‘ there he goes again ’ kind of reaction from the people who brought you Alan Keyes [ the conservative activist who Republicans nominated to run against Obama in 2004 ] . ”
Dillard said he will continue to speak up about Obama , though he favors McCain for president because he agrees with the presumptive GOP nominee on the issues .
He contends that there are other Republicans who hold Obama in high regard , though they will not say so publicly for partisan purposes .
“ None of my colleagues who admired Obama will return the reporters ’ phone calls , ” said Dillard .
“ And that ’s the problem with this country .
No one is willing to say something nice for 10 seconds about someone of a different race , party and location .
In this case , Barack is from Chicago and I ’m from the suburbs of Chicago . ”
“ Very few suburbanites would work closely with city of Chicago Democrats , ” he added .
“ Also , there ’s the racial component .
It ’s a testament to Sen .
Obama that he was able to work with people who were different than he . ”
But , he hastened to add , “ John McCain has those same qualities . ”
Yesterday , August 6 , the EIA published new International Petroleum Monthly data .
The new data revised downward previously published estimates , all the way back to 2002 , with the biggest revisions in 2007 and 2008 .
With the revisions , the latest month , May 2008 , shows new record - high oil production .
Other recent months which had previously set records are now 67,000 barrels per day to 417,000 barrels per day lower than reported just a month ago .
In this post , I offer a few thoughts on what the new data suggests .
Khebab did an analysis of EIA data revisions back in October 2006 .
His analysis showed that at that time , crude estimates on average were revised down by about 300,000 barrels from their initial estimate .
The downward revision took about three years .
Estimates of other liquids tended to get revised upward over time .
On a " total liquids " basis , one might expect some offset , since part is being adjusted upward and part downward .
Figure 2 . Khebab's Chart showing average EIA revisions , based on 2006 data
Khebab made these estimates of expected bias in 2006 .
It is likely that they will change over time .
One possible reason for such biases is the practice of estimating future production based on past production , if new numbers are not yet available .
If production is declining , as is often the case with crude and condensate , there would tend to be a bias toward over - estimation .
Also , if wells are taken off - line for maintenance , or because of a storm , using recent months production as an estimate will tend to miss these dips in production , also leading to overstatements .
Khebab 's analysis showed that for portions of " All Liquids " other than crude and condensate , estimates tend to be revised upward .
If we think about the matter , these liquids , such as ethanol , tend to be growing over time as a percentage of all liquids .
If the same method is used for estimating these ( using past months actuals to estimate the most recent month where production is unknown ) , it is not surprising that they will tend to be biased low , and show upward development over time .
Since the " other " items tend to move in the opposite direction of crude and condensate , it is likely that there will be less bias in total liquids estimate than in the pieces .
In this analysis , we are really concerned with the crude portion , not the other items Khebab analyzed .
If anything , we might expect crude estimates to be even more overstated in 2008 than 2006 , because more countries are experiencing production declines .
One thing we can learn from the recent revisions and from Khebab 's 2006 analysis is that we should n't put too much faith in the estimates for recent months .
The crude and condensate estimate of 74.481 million barrels per day appears to be new record , but this is only 215,000 barrels higher than the record of 74.266 set in May 2005 .
If we estimate the expected downward revision at 300,000 barrels per day based on Khebab 's analysis , the revised amount is expected to be less than the May 2005 record .
Saudi Arabia and Iraq
When we look at the data , the majority of the recent increase in production is from Saudi Arabia and Iraq .
I have graphed the EIA crude and condensate production for these two countries , in this stacked graph .
Figure 3 . Saudi Arabia and Iraq crude and condensate production , based on August 2008 EIA International Petroleum Monthly
One thing that a person notices about this data is that it is very irregular .
The reason that May 2008 looks high is because there were dips in production in 2007 for both countries .
The May 2008 numbers are close to the highest production each of these countries have reached , during the period graphed .
One thing ace pointed out to me is that while the May 2008 production estimate for Saudi Arabia is shown as 9.4 million barrels a day , both OPEC and IEA data show Saudi Arabia 's production for May as about 9.2 million barrels a day ( 9.18 million BPD for OPEC and 9.21 million BPD for IEA ) .
Since both of these sources agree with the EIA 's April production estimate of 9.1 million barrels per day , the differences in May production estimates raise questions as to whether EIA 's May estimate is correct .
The estimation of Saudi oil production is very politically charged at this time , with the election in November .
If the EIA gets its initial Saudi estimates from a third party , it might be that the third party allows political motivations to affect its estimates .
If the estimate is wrong on the high side , it might be pleasing to the current administration .
Who would notice an extra 200,000 downward revision , with all of the other revisions ?
This additional estimation issue adds further to the apparent bias in the May numbers .
Production Trends for Other Groupings
I thought it might be interesting to look at production trends for other groupings as well .
Figure 4 . OPEC other than Saudi Arabia and Iraq production of crude and condensate , based on August 2008 EIA International Petroleum Monthly
The graph shows that production now is at a level similar to that in late 2005 , when increased production was requested after Katrina hit .
Production for these countries also dipped in 2007 , similar to the pattern we saw for Iraq and Saudi Arabia .
Figure 5 . North American production of crude and condensate , based on August 2008 EIA International Petroleum Monthly
This graph shows the stacked production of the United States , Canada , and Mexico .
I have grouped these , since these are our closest trading partners .
The dip in 2005 shows the impact of hurricane Katrina and other 2005 hurricanes .
Oil production in United States has been declining since 1970 .
Mexican production began declining in 2005 .
Canadian conventional production is declining but tar sands production is increasing , providing a small overall increase .
One can see from the graph that in total , North American oil production seems now to be declining slightly ( about 300,000 BPD in the past year ) .
Figure 6 . North Sea production of crude and condensate , based on August 2008 EIA International Petroleum Monthly
This graph shows that North Sea production has been declining , since 2001 .
The various attempts to hold production up do not seem to have reversed the decline .
Figure 7 .
Other than OPEC , North American and North Sea production of crude and condensate , based on August 2008 EIA International Petroleum Monthly
This graph shows recent trend in oil production for the " all other " category .
The biggest countries in this grouping are Russia and China , which I have shown separately .
This grouping also includes all of the non-OPEC countries in South America ( including Brazil ) , the non-OPEC countries in Africa , the various Former Soviet Union countries , other than Russia , and Asian and Australian production .
One can see from the graph that the production for this grouping is still increasing slightly .
In the past year , production for this grouping has risen by about 200,000 barrels a day .
Observations
In looking back over the graphs , there is not really very much upward trend in oil production for any of the groupings shown .
OPEC production bounces around ; an upward trend is not clear .
North America and the North Sea both show declining production .
The " All other " group with Russia , China , Brazil , and the " stan " countries shows only a slight upward trend -- not enough to offset the declines elsewhere .
The Batmobile " race car " Courtesy Warner Bros . ; Photo : David James
Besides the test frame , the team manufactured four complete , street - ready race cars .
To do that , they built the steel frames and mounted the drive trains on each one .
Then the body shop manufactured the 65 carbon - fiber panels for each car .
These " race " versions of the Batmobile are the cars that careened through the streets of Chicago during filming .
From the outside , they look like Batmobiles .
Inside , however , they look like NASCAR race cars .

According to Nathan , when you get in the car , what you see is the steel frame of the car along with sheetmetal covering some of the surfaces , as in a NASCAR car .
The gauges are all exposed .
There is a Halon fire - suppression system along with other safety features to protect the drivers .
Visibility is terrible .
The driver can see out the front window fine , but there is no side or rear visibility .
So the team mounted side and rear video cameras , and the driver uses monitors to see outside .
Because of these extenuating circumstances , the drivers for these Batmobiles trained for six months before they started driving on the streets of Chicago .
So why'd they build four complete Batmobile race cars ?
There were two reasons .
First , the team expected there to be accidents and wanted to have multiple cars in case one or two wrecked .
Think about it :
These cars have the ability to go 100 mph but have hand levers to help turn corners .
They also are called on to jump 30 feet .
Accidents seemed likely .
The good news is that no accidents actually occurred ( if you ignore the incident in which a driver rear - ended one of the Batmobiles as the four cars were moving to a new location ) .
The six months of training and the drivers ' skill really paid off .
The other reason is that two of the four cars are special :
flap version .
It has all of the One is the .
It has all of the hydraulics and flaps to handle the close - up shots where the car is " flying . "
jet version .
Nathan did n't want to " add on " the jet flame with a computer -- he wanted a real jet The other is the .
Nathan did n't want to " add on " the jet flame with a computer -- he wanted a real jet flame .
The car has an actual jet engine fueled by six propane tanks located inside the car .
The team can mount and dismount the jet as needed for filming .
Each of these four cars cost about $ 250,000 to build .
These four cars worked great for the street scenes .
However , when you watch the movie and Batman gets in and out of the car , you obviously do not see him getting into a vehicle that has a bare frame with a Halon safety system and riveted sheet metal .
The interior of the Batmobile is cool .
Two other teams made the Batmobile 's interior possible ...
Replying to Thoma on Health Care By Arnold Kling
Mark Thoma writes ,
when I think about moving P to G , I also think about moving the revenue stream with it ( e.g. individuals would pay monthly premiums in taxes rather than to the insurance company ) .
Thus , if we move all of P to G , we also move all of the revenue with it .
Therefore I do n’t see why the budget problem has to get worse
So , as a first approximation , it ’s just a reshuffling .
Instead of paying a tax to health insurance companies , workers pay a tax to the government .
Their take - home pay is the same , and the government deficit is the same .
OK .
He goes on ,
Why do costs per unit fall ?
Because of all the administrative savings , savings from buying drugs in bulk , and the ability to manage care ( e.g. preventative measures , solving information problems that cause wasteful expenditures by doctors and consumers ) .
Put a number on the savings from “ buying drugs in bulk . ”
Considering that drug company profits are rounding error in the overall health budget , and assuming that you ca n’t force profits to be negative , it ’s pretty demagogic to suggest that you are going to salvage the health care budget that way .
The other savings are all hypothetical .
Suppose we were to abolish private health insurance tomorrow and put everybody on Medicare .
Here are the things that would happen .
1 . You could get rid of everybody in the private health insurance industry .
That would save at most 15 percent of health care spending .
2 . There would no longer be a private - sector benchmark for Medicare to use in pricing .
You would need to hire a lot of those former private health insurance folks to work for Medicare to figure out what every medical service is worth , to negotiate prices with doctors , hospitals , and so on .
3 . Medicare would have to process more claims , which means you would have to hire back some more of those former insurance workers .
After ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) , costs might be less than the existing system .
By a small amount .
For a short time .
But innovation in health care management and administration would slow to a crawl .
Health care providers would need permission from Washington to try anything new .
In the long run , administrative costs will be higher than they would have been under private health insurance .
In the short run , getting rid of competition and installing a monopoly lowers overhead .
In the long run , it ’s not so brilliant .
In any event , the cause of rising health care spending is not administrative costs .
It is the increasing use of medical procedures , including procedures with high costs and low benefits .
In that regard , Medicare as it exists today works no better than private health insurance .
What Thoma wants me to believe is that as soon as we get rid of that pesky private health insurance , Medicare will become expert at weeding out cost - ineffective procedures and paying for cost - effective care .
That would be wonderful , but I ’m from Missouri .
Show me that Medicare can do that for its existing customer base before you go out and shut down private health care .
I am reluctant to start toting up lots of savings that could occur in theory when we do not see those savings in practice .
Book says White House ordered forgery
A new book by the author Ron Suskind claims that the White House ordered the CIA to forge a back - dated , handwritten letter from the head of Iraqi intelligence to Saddam Hussein .
Suskind writes in “ The Way of the World , ” to be published Tuesday , that the alleged forgery – adamantly denied by the White House – was designed to portray a false link between Hussein ’s regime and al Qaeda as a justification for the Iraq war .

The author also claims that the Bush administration had information from a top Iraqi intelligence official “ that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq – intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion . ”
The letter ’s existence has been reported before , and it had been written about as if it were genuine .
It was passed in Baghdad to a reporter for The ( London ) Sunday Telegraph who wrote about it on the front page of Dec. 14 , 2003 , under the headline , “ Terrorist behind September 11 strike ‘ was trained by Saddam . ’ ”
The Telegraph story by Con Coughlin ( which , coincidentally , ran the day Hussein was captured in his “ spider hole ” ) was touted in the U.S. media by supporters of the war , and he was interviewed on NBC's " Meet the Press . "
" Over the next few days , the Habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the United States and across the globe , " Suskind writes .
" Fox 's Bill O'Reilly trumpeted the story Sunday night on ' The O'Reilly Factor , ' talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting , ' Now , if this is true , that blows the lid off al Qaeda — Saddam . ' "
According to Suskind , the administration had been in contact with the director of the Iraqi intelligence service in the last years of Hussein ’s regime , Tahir Jalil Habbush al - Tikriti .
“ The White House had concocted a fake letter from Habbush to Saddam , backdated to July 1 , 2001 , ” Suskind writes .
“ It said that 9/11 ringleader Mohammad Atta had actually trained for his mission in Iraq – thus showing , finally , that there was an operational link between Saddam and al Qaeda , something the Vice President ’s Office had been pressing CIA to prove since 9/11 as a justification to invade Iraq .
There is no link . ”
The White House flatly denied Suskind ’s account .
Tony Fratto , deputy White House press secretary , told Politico : “ The allegation that the White House directed anyone to forge a document from Habbush to Saddam is just absurd . ”
The White House plans to push back hard .
Fratto added : " Ron Suskind makes a living from gutter journalism .
He is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify , including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre-war intelligence . "
Before “ The Way of the World : A Story of Truth and Hope in an Age of Extremism , ” Suskind wrote two New York Times bestsellers critical of the Bush administration – “ The Price of Loyalty ” ( 2004 ) , which featured extensive comments by former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill , and “ The One Percent Doctrine ” ( 2006 ) .
Suskind writes in his new book that the order to create the letter was written on “ creamy White House stationery . ”
The book suggests that the letter was subsequently created by the CIA and delivered to Iraq , but does not say how .
The author claims that such an operation , part of “ false pretenses ” for war , would apparently constitute illegal White House use of the CIA to influence a domestic audience , an arguably impeachable offense .
Suskind writes that the White House had “ ignored the Iraq intelligence chief ’s accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq – intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion .
“ They secretly resettled him in Jordan , paid him $ 5 million – which one could argue was hush money – and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the era ’s most crushing truths : that America had gone to war under false pretenses , ” the book says .
Suskind writes that the forgery “ operation created by the White House and passed to the CIA seems inconsistent with ” a statute saying the CIA may not conduct covert operations “ intended to influence United States political processes , public opinion , policies or media . ”
“ It is not the sort of offense , such as assault or burglary , that carries specific penalties , for example , a fine or jail time , ” Suskind writes .
“ It is much broader than that .
It pertains to the White House ’s knowingly misusing an arm of government , the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings . ”
Habbush is still listed as wanted on a State Department website designed to help combat international terrorism , with the notation : “ Up to $ 1 Million Reward . ”
Former CIA Director George J. Tenet says about the supposed forgery , in a statement : “ There was no such order from the White House to me nor , to the best of my knowledge , was anyone from CIA ever involved in any such effort . ”
NBC ’s David Gregory reported on “ Today ” that Habbush passed his information in “ secret meetings with British intelligence . ”
Tenet says about Habbush in the statement : “ In fact , the source in question failed to persuade his British interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence , concessions , or negotiations with regard to the Iraq crisis and the British – on their own – elected to break off contact with him .
“ There were many Iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that Iraq had no WMD – but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the Ba’ath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack .
The particular source that Suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner . ”
Asked about Tenet 's statement by Meredith Vieira on “ Today , ” Suskind said it ’s “ part of George ’s memory issue . ”
“ [ B ]y placing so much on its secret ledger , ” Suskind writes in his final chapter , “ the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent . ”
The book ( HarperCollins , $ 27.95 ) was not supposed to be publicly available until Tuesday , but Politico purchased a copy Monday night at a Washington bookstore .
Suskind , an engaging and confident Washingtonian , writes that the book was “ one tough project . ”
He won the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing as a reporter for The Wall Street Journal , where he worked from 1993 to 2000 .
The White House said Suskind received no formal cooperation .
He writes in the acknowledgments section at the end of the book : “ It should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information .
None crossed the line . ”
Among the 415 - page book ’s other highlights :
-- John Maguire , one of two men who oversaw the CIA ’s Iraq Operations Group , was frustrated by what Suskind describes as the “ tendency of the White House to ignore advice it did n’t want to hear – advice that contradicted its willed certainty , political judgments , or rigid message strategies . ”
And Suskind writes that the administration “ did not want to hear the word insurgency . ”
-- In the first days of his presidency , Bush rejected advice from the CIA to wiretap Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2001 in Vienna , where he was staying in a hotel where the CIA had a listening device planted in the wall of the presidential suite , in need only of a battery change .
The CIA said that if the surveillance were discovered , Putin ’s respect for Bush would be heightened .
But Condoleezza Rice , Bush ’s national security adviser , advised that it was “ too risky , it might be discovered , ” Suskind writes .
Bush decided against if as “ a gut decision ” based on what he thought was a friendship based on several conversations , including during the presidential campaign .
The CIA had warned him that Putin “ was a trained KGB agent … [ who ] wants you to think he ’s your friend . ”
-- Suskind reports that Bush initially told Cheney he had to " ‘ step back ’ in large meetings when they were together , like those at the NSC [ National Security Council ] , because people were addressing and deferring to Cheney .
Cheney said he understood , that he ’d mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and Bush would meet privately , frequently , to discuss options and action . ”
-- Suskind contends Cheney established “ deniability ” for Bush as part of the vice president ’s “ complex strategies , developed over decades , for how to protect a president . ”
“ After the searing experience of being in the Nixon White House , Cheney developed a view that the failure of Watergate was not the break - in , or even the cover - up , but the way the president had , in essence , been over - briefed .
There were certain things a president should n’t know – things that could be illegal , disruptive to key foreign relationships , or humiliating to the executive .
“ They key was a signaling system , where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there .
If an investigation ensued , or a foreign leader cried foul , the president could shrug .
This was never something he 'd authorized .
The whole point of Cheney ’s model is to make a president less accountable for his action .
Cheney ’s view is that accountability – a bedrock feature of representative democracy – is not , in every case , a virtue . ”
-- Suskind is acidly derisive of Bush , saying that he initially lost his “ nerve ” on 9/11 , regaining it when he grabbed the Ground Zero bullhorn .
Suskind says Bush ’s 9 p.m. Oval Office address on the fifth anniversary was “ well along in petulance , seasoned by a touch of self - defensiveness . ”
“ Moving on its own natural arc , the country is in the process of leaving Bush – his bullying impulse fused , permanently , with satisfying vengeance – in the scattering ashes of 9/11 , ” Suskind writes .
“ The high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks , and in two elections since , is dissolving with each passing minute . ”
-- Suskind writes in the acknowledgments that his research assistant , Greg Jackson , “ was sent to New York on a project for the book ” in September 2007 and was “ detained by federal agents in Manhattan .
He was interrogated and his notes were confiscated , violations of his First and Fourth Amendment rights . ”

Cynthia McKinney .
Green Party presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney sums up her energy policy with a simple , memorable rhyme : “ Leave the oil in the soil . ”
“ Right now we ’ve got two energy policies in this country , ” McKinney told Grist .
“ One is war , the other is drilling .
And neither one of them works . ”
It ’s a message she hopes will win over voters who have tired of both the Democratic and Republican parties .
McKinney was a Democrat herself for years , representing Georgia ’s 4th district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1993 to 2003 , and again from 2005 to 2007 .
She was the first African - American woman to represent her state on the federal level .
During her time in the House , McKinney was active on environmental issues , particularly those related to human health .
Her legislative efforts included lead sponsorship of the National Forest Protection and Restoration Act , which would have eliminated commercial logging on federal public lands .
In 2001 , she introduced a bill that would have suspended use of depleted uranium munitions until their health effects could be studied further .
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2006 , McKinney was a vocal critic of the Bush administration ’s failure to help residents of New Orleans , and she pushed for comprehensive environmental testing of flooded areas .
McKinney lost her bid for reelection in 2006 , and in September 2007 announced that she was leaving the Democratic Party .
She soon launched a campaign to become the presidential nominee of the Green Party , and in July the Greens gave her the official nod at their convention in Chicago .
McKinney tapped hip - hop activist and indie journalist Rosa Clemente to run as her VP candidate .
Grist caught McKinney by phone at her current home in California , where she ’s pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley .
Why should voters consider you the strongest candidate on environmental issues ?
I have a record that includes authorship of the National Forest Protection and Restoration Act .
From that to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to my position on offshore drilling , I think my record is pretty clear .
And then there is the greatest need we have in this country , and that is for investment in infrastructure and a greening of our economy .
What sets your green platform apart from other candidates ’?
We ’ve taken nuclear off the table .
When you start talking about sustainable energy , nuclear is n’t it .
We need to take offshore drilling off the table , we need to take ANWR off the table .
We should also make sure that investment in solar and other types of heating and energy supply are made attractive to people , [ through ] tax schemes that decrease the price to the end user .
[ We need ] also an incentive so that when people are in the process of buying houses , a score is given for the energy consumption that that house represents .
Those are just a few things that could be done very easily .
Energy is a hot topic on the political scene right now .
Republicans are really driving home the drilling mantra .
What do you think should be done to counter that ?
My message is to “ leave the oil in the soil . ”
Right now we ’ve got two energy policies in this country .
One is war , the other is drilling .
And neither one of them works .
We ’ve got to do something different .
Another talking point on the Hill right now is that regulating greenhouse - gas emissions and shifting away from fossil fuels will be catastrophic for the economy and working families .
These scare tactics seem to work , especially in a period of economic downturn .
What ’s the message you ’re taking to voters on this ?
How do you talk about these issues when people are already upset about rising gas prices ?
I ’ve seen communities over in Europe that have no energy bills at all , and so if we ’re talking about hardship , the hardship occurs when the elected leadership is stuck in old ways and reticent to invest in new ways that make more sense .
And certainly sustainable living makes more sense .
Sustainable energy makes more sense .
And doing the same thing and getting a worse result is not something that makes more sense .
If we continue to do what we ’ve done in the past , on the horizon is nothing more than an extension of war , an extension of the military machine , and reliance on a resource that is not infinite .
You ’ve said that the United States could declare itself carbon - and nuclear - free .
How soon do you think that ’s possible ?
What do you propose to do to make that happen ?
What ’s on the table now is [ a goal of dramatically reducing carbon emissions by ] 2050 , but of course we do n’t have that kind of time .
Carbon - free communities are being built in other parts of the world , particularly in Europe .
There are oil - producing countries in the Middle East that are already at least moving in this direction .
We even had the king of Saudi Arabia say , “ We ’re going to leave some of our oil in our soil . ”
Do you believe we can achieve political consensus on a goal of 80 percent carbon reductions by 2050 ?
I think that public policy is supposed to reflect the values of the people .
To the extent that it does n’t , then it ’s up to the people to change the policymakers .
That ’s why we have to be engaged at every step of the process of voting — before we vote , during the vote , during the counting of the vote , and after the election is over — not only to make sure that the counting process is accountable , but also so that our elected officials remain true to the values that people voted .
That has not happened with the Democratic and Republican parties .
When people cast their vote for the Green Party , they ’re voting for green solutions .
They ’re voting for people who have the attitude that this is possible , that this is doable , and we represent the best alternative for the voting public .
How would you bring China and India to the table on a global climate treaty ?
I think the best way is to lead by example .
The United States is n’t doing that .
In fact , there ’s an effort to make it appear that China and India are enemies .
China and India are no more enemies than the United States ’ behavior toward them would lead them to be .
So first of all , the United States needs to do what it must do to reduce the greenhouse gases .
What should be done at a federal level about food issues — farming , genetically modified foods , etc . ?
There is an effort to store seeds in Norway .
And at the same time , there ’s this push to impose particular Monsanto - type seeds on farmers around the world .
That needs to stop , and it needs to stop right here in the United States .
I would prohibit it .
I would ask Congress to prohibit it and allow farmers to grow their crops in the best manner time - tested for thousands of years .
I used to be on the Agriculture Committee and represented farmers in Georgia .
I got to visit farmers in Europe , and they have really taken this to an entirely new level , where not only is there the organic farming , but also a level beyond organic .
Every aspect of the production is done in a way that has no toxins , no chemicals , nothing that would be harmful to man or any aspect of nature .
Those are the kinds of agricultural trends that ought to be supported , for example , in the Farm Bill .
What other environmental issues need more national attention ?
There was an effort that we tried to focus on with only limited success , and that was the cleanup of our military bases .
Cleanup of these installations would provide far more jobs than one would think , because of the egregious nature of the problem .
We ’ve also got this situation of environmental injustice that has n’t been taken care of .
Hurricanes Rita and Katrina coated every building , every item , every living and non-living thing in New Orleans with slime , and we ’ve got the toxic effects of that .
The legislation that I introduced was to provide for the testing of the environment — all of the land , soil , and air in New Orleans — and then making that known to people so they know what the potential health effects are .
That has not even been ascertained by any official governmental body .
Basically what was done in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was looking at the buildings — they were classified as habitable if they were structurally sound .
But nobody tested the mold and the slime and the toxicity of those structurally sound buildings .
And then of course in Louisiana we ’ve got Cancer Alley , which has been noted for a number of health effects .
We ’ve just got massive cleanup that needs to be done inside this country , and it receives very little attention even now as we all talk about environmental issues .
Are Democrats and their presidential candidate , Barack Obama , doing enough on environmental issues ?
I think that ’s a question that voters , those who are particularly interested in environmental issues , will have to sort out for themselves .
But there is a party , the Green Party , that is dedicated and founded for the purpose of extending social justice as well as ecological wisdom for people in this country and around the world .
And the Green Party is an international collection of parties that help to make policy on the national level in many other countries around the world , and it ’s about time that we had the influence and the impact of Green Party policies here at home in the U.S .
After Ralph Nader ran on the Green Party ticket in 2000 , there was a lot of anger from folks afterward that he tipped the presidency to George W. Bush .
Are you concerned about siphoning off votes from the Democrats this year , possibly changing the outcome of the election ?
It ’s a ludicrous assumption , and it ’s not based on the facts .
In 2000 , 1 million black people went to the polls and voted , but their votes were n’t counted .
So now who ’s responsible for that ?
Nine hundred thousand of those votes would have gone to the Democrats , but the Democrats conceded the election rather than demanding a recount or an investigation that would have found the guilty parties .
Unfortunately , those misconceptions that are put forward by the corporate press have nothing to do with the truth .
Seventy - eight thousand black people in Florida alone voted and their votes were n’t counted , and that does n’t even include the number of people who went to the polls and attempted to vote , who did n’t even get a chance to cast their votes .
It ’s ludicrous to think that George Bush won the election by 537 votes , but it ’s also ludicrous for the political party that actually won the election to give it away .
The question should be posed to them :
Why did they ?
What environmental achievement are you proudest of ?
The National Forest Protection and Restoration
Act was something that was near and dear to my heart .
After the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans , the piece of legislation that we introduced to ascertain and make public the environmental status of the area was also necessary , particularly given the situation with the first responders at the World Trade Center after Sept. 11 .
It was clear that there were going to be health effects [ after the Sept. 11 attacks ] , and yet the workers were sent in there anyway to rescue people as best they could and then to find as many bodies as they could .
They did that work , and the Bush administration lied to them , and to all of us , and now they truly are suffering the health effects .
The depleted uranium legislation that I introduced is also something that I am proud of .
My bill would have stopped the use of all depleted uranium ammunitions until we understood clearly what the health effects were .
Who is your environmental hero ?
My heroes are the people who strove for justice , and the ultimate environmental hero in my opinion would be someone who was working to make peace .
If we understand the sanctity of human life , then we are , I believe , less apt to destroy that which sustains our life .
So perhaps the people who struggle for human rights have to be the environmental heroes .
As I think about it , for example , it ’s the women ’s suffrage movement who are responsible for me and [ my running mate ]
Rosa being where we are right now with the Green Party ticket .
Then of course you ’ve got the abolitionists — Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman .
I certainly would n’t be where I am without them .
And so those are to me the ultimate heroes , because it ’s on their shoulders that I stand .
What have you done personally to lighten your environmental footprint ?
Well , I do n’t consume very much .
Where possible , I ’m changing my shopping habits , in terms of the food that I buy .
I choose to buy from the local folks as opposed to the mega folks .
Of course , you have to go to the supermarket every once in a while to get stuff .
I ’m trying to live within the 200 - mile rule of thumb in terms of my food consumption .
As a black person , there ’s a dearth of services generally and a lack of healthy food in the black community , so that ’s been a challenge .
Winnie the Pooh Arrested for Armed Robbery
What is Winnie the Pooh up to these days ?
According to Japanese police , it appears that our favorite winsome little bear is committing assault and armed robbery .
Unlike most fairy tales , this one does not have a happy ending .
Tokyo police have arrested Masayuki Ishikawa , a 20 year - old man who attacked and robbed two people because they had the nerve to stare at his Winnie - the - Pooh costume .
At the time of his arrest , he was in the company of two costumed friends ; one a panther and the other a mouse .
Apparently the threesome had donned the costumes because they ran out of clean clothes , ( which is , in all probability , worthy of another news story all by itself ) .
Once upon a time , Ishikawa told the police , he was standing on a street corner minding his own truculent business while wearing the cuddly costume when two passersby had the nerve to stare at him and he took offense .
( A grown man in such an outfit is worthy of at least one sideward glance , n’est ce pas ? )
Police told reporters that “ It ’s uncommon to see people dressed up like this , so the victims were watching them .
Then the perpetrator came up and said , ‘ What are you staring at ? ' ”
In true Winnie - the Unpooh - like fashion , Ishikawa and his two cohorts beat up the two unfortunates and stole 160 dollars from them .
All ’s well that did not end well , and Winnie has now become for all time , Winnie - The - Perp !
Here ’s to once upon another , better time and a rehabilitated Winnie !

The Centralia Center , converted from an old Wal - Mart store , in Wisconsin Rapids , now houses the Lowell Center for senior activities and dining .
Wal - Mart now operates a supercenter on the other side of the town .
Towns recycle abandoned stores Wisconsin Rapids , one of Wisconsin 's old paper - mill towns , had never fought to keep Wal - Marts and other big - box retailers out .
Quite the opposite .
The city was so welcoming that it got a state grant to meet Wal - Mart 's parking needs in the 1980s .
By the late 1990s , however , Wal - Mart outgrew the space and moved to the outskirts of town .
Downtown Wisconsin Rapids was left with a 120,000 - square - foot shell and a giant parking lot .
A neighboring shopping center suffered .
Today , the old Wal - Mart has new life as the Centralia Center for senior citizens .
" Had we not ( done so ) … today it would still be sitting there blighted , " says Mayor Mary Jo Carson .
America 's big - box experience is entering a new phase .
Some towns continue to block megastores because they object to their economic impact on local merchants and the traffic congestion they can create .
But thousands of other towns across the USA that welcomed them face a growing challenge :
What to do with the cavernous spaces left behind by retailers such as Home Depot , Wal - Mart and Kmart when they downsize or expand elsewhere .
Big - box stores leave huge spaces behind — many carry deed restrictions that prevent other retailers from moving in — and filling the space can be difficult .
So cities have become creative and some are turning these hubs of capitalism into centers of civic life .
A Kmart in Hastings , Neb. , is a Head Start Early Childhood Center .
Kmarts in Buffalo and Charlotte and a Wal - Mart in Laramie , Wyo. , are charter schools .
After Hurricane Katrina 's devastation in Louisiana , the St. Bernard Health Center opened in government trailers in the parking lot of a closed Wal - Mart .
Among the most unusual uses :
An old Kmart in Austin , Minn. , is the site of Hormel Foods offices and a museum dedicated to Hormel 's famed meat product , Spam ; the Peddlers Mall in Nicholasville , Ky. , is a flea market and antiques mall where a Wal - Mart once was .
Profting from abandoned spaces Julia Christensen spent six years documenting the trend in Big Box Reuse , a book to be published in November .
She details how 10 communities turned vacant big - box stores into schools , a courthouse , church , museum and other civic organizations .
" We have a bunch of empty buildings all over the country , " says Christensen , an artist who teaches at Oberlin College in Ohio .
Most cities do n't know what other cities are doing with abandoned big - box spaces , she says .
" I hope this project will give us a platform so that we can make informed decisions , " Christensen says .
An exhibit of Christensen 's photos that appear in the book opens this week at the Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh .
" Hopefully , we can raise awareness , " she says .
Wal - Mart owns more than 3,400 stores among its Supercenter versions , Sam's Clubs and others , says Jennifer Evans - Cowley , a city and regional planning professor at Ohio State University who has written about how communities can prepare for the short life span of mammoth stores .
" Every year , Wal - Mart closes stores , " she says .
" There are 15 major retailers .
Multiply that by 2,000 stores each with a 20 - to 25 - year life cycle .
It 's not unreasonable to expect that closure would happen during that time . "
Cities adopt new standards
More communities are introducing policies that require big - box retailers to help redevelop the spaces they leave behind .
Some require them to tear down the stores if they 're empty more than a year .
Others have introduced design standards that require landscaping and more than one main entrance so that the building can accommodate multiple tenants in the future .
A retailer the size of Wal - Mart can make or break a town like Wisconsin Rapids , which has about 18,000 residents .
" It changed us , " Wisconsin Rapids Mayor Carson says of Wal - Mart 's decision to leave downtown and build a superstore on the edge of town .
The move eventually helped , she says .
" We , as a city , now have a central location for our seniors that 's better than having it on the outskirts of town , " Carson says .
About 20,000 square feet of the old store were knocked down to make way for a community garden and benches .
Inside , seniors now enjoy a library , meeting rooms , a walking track , pool tables and state - of - the - art kitchen and computer center .
The center also holds aging and disability centers for two counties .
" Local officials today have to be problem - solvers to survive , " Carson says .
" It might help local public officials to think as far out of the box as they can . "

Report : Judiciary may hold hearings on impeachment RAW STORY
Published : Thursday July 10 , 2008
Print This Email This
After insisting for nearly two years that impeachment was strictly " off the table , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may be changing her tune .
The Democratic leader said Thursday that the House Judiciary Committee could be holding hearings on impeachment articles introduced by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) sometime in the near future .
After introducing 35 articles of impeachment against President Bush last month , Kucinich is planning to introduce another single article Thursday , accusing the president of misleading the country into war with Iraq .
Politico reports Kucinich 's efforts may be paying off : Pelosi has said previously that impeachment " was off the table , " so her comments this morning were surprising , and clearly signaled a new willingness to entertain the idea of ousting Bush , although no one in the Democratic leadership believes that is likely since the president has only six months left in this term .
" This is a Judiciary Committee matter , and I believe we will see some attention being paid to it by the Judiciary Committee , " Pelosi told reporters .
" Not necessarily taking up the articles of impeachment because that would have to be approved on the floor , but to have some hearings on the subject . "
Pelosi added : " My expectation is that there will be some review of that in the committee . "
Kucinich has scheduled a press conference on Capitol Hill for 2 p.m. Thursday .
RAW STORY will provide further details from there upon its conclusion .
DEVELOPING ...
Supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton cheer over her projected victory in West Virginia 's primary at Clinton 's primary party in Charleston , W. Va. on May 13 , 2008 .
Hillary wins - does anybody care ?
If a tree falls in the forest when everybody expects it to fall , does it make a sound ?
Yes , says Hillary Clinton .
It makes a deafening roar , says Hillary Clinton .
Advertisement
SHE WON THE WEST VIRGINIA PRIMARY BY A KAZILLION PERCENTAGE POINTS TUESDAY NIGHT , AND THAT , SHE SAYS , HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING !
Except the press does n’t think so .
The press is unimpressed .
This may be the first time in election history in which the press has withdrawn from a race before the candidate .
As John Harwood of the New York Times and CNBC said on MSNBC Tuesday several hours before the polls closed , “ The headline tomorrow will be : ‘ Hillary Clinton Wins Big in West Virginia ; Democratic Party Yawns . ’ ”
Wrong ! says the Clinton campaign .
The party is not yawning , the party is finally waking up to the fact that Barack Obama is a loser !
As Howard Wolfson , Clinton ’s communications director , said Tuesday : “ I think superdelegates who have been moving toward Barack Obama in the last week are going to wake up tomorrow and say , ‘ I ’m a little concerned about the fact that our nominee , presumptive nominee , ca n’t win West Virginia .
I ’m a little concerned that he ca n’t win Pennsylvania or Ohio , or Michigan , or Florida . ’ ”
To which the Obama campaign says : “ What , us worry ? ”
Obama , who made only two trips to West Virginia , is doing the equivalent of flicking dust from his shoulders .
He did n’t even bother making a concession speech Tuesday night .
He was campaigning in Missouri instead .
Missouri is a state he already won in the primaries , but that was the point :
He does n’t care about primaries anymore .
Actual voters casting ballots ?
That is so yesterday .
As everyone knows , the Democratic nomination is determined not by voters actually voting , but by superdelegates choosing whomever they please .
( They are the Democratic Party ’s equivalent of the Electoral College , a safeguard against too much democracy .
Unlike the Electoral College , however , superdelegates were not created in the 18th century but in 1984 . )
What counts to Obama is that since his victory in North Carolina and narrow loss in Indiana last week , he has picked up 27 superdelegates and Clinton has picked up one and a half .
Roy R. Romer , a former governor of Colorado , a former Democratic Party chairman and a superdelegate , endorsed Obama on Tuesday , saying : “ The math is controlling .
This race , I believe , is over . ”
Why did Romer decide to back Obama ?
Obama ’s health care plan or his policy on Iraq or his position on the Alternative Minimum Tax ?
Naw .
“ I watched all of these primaries and caucus states and decided Barack Obama was the most electable , ” Romer said .
Which is what superdelegates , the party insiders , were created to do : make cold calculations instead of giving their hearts away .
His calculations are wrong , says the Clinton campaign .
He does n’t realize that Obama has all these problems :
He ca n’t win working - class voters , he ca n’t win voters who lack college degrees , he can’t win all sorts of voting groups that Democrats need to win in this fall .
( And he has trouble with white voters in certain states :
An incredible 20 percent of white voters in West Virginia said race was a factor in their vote , according to exit polls , a percentage second only to that of Mississippi . )
The Obama campaign has three answers to this : First , just because Obama loses a voting bloc in a primary does not mean he will lose the same group in the general election .
The Democratic base is going to vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who it is .
And among general election voters , Obama aides say , Obama is doing just fine .
( And , besides , no Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson has won the white vote , anyway . )
“ Put your brains back in your head and look at the national polls instead of local , primary polls , ” a senior Obama aide told me Tuesday in a phone interview .
“ In national polls , we win every income group against John McCain except those people making $ 100,000 - plus , where we lose by one point , which is a tie .
“ Among white , non-college voters , McCain leads Obama 52 - 40 and he leads Clinton 52 - 44 .
A four - point difference between us and Clinton , well within the margin of error .
“ Overall in head - to - head matchups , we are beating McCain by more than she is .
And , most importantly , we are winning independents 51 - 42 against McCain , and Clinton loses independents 49 - 46 against McCain .
Se we are plus nine among independents and she is minus three . ”
Obama ’s second argument is that the slicing and dicing of the electorate into neat little groups misses what he is about :
He is unifying figure .
He represents change , he says , and he will attract the votes of people who want change , regardless of the neat boxes that pollsters put them in .
Third , Obama believes he is the victim of a dirty trick .
He used that phrase .
And all he needs to do , he believes , is get the truth out in order to build his numbers .
He was at Schultzie ’s Billiards in South Charleston , W. Va. , on Monday when a reporter asked , “ How problematic are those rumors ... that you do n’t pledge allegiance , that you ’re a Muslim ?
They are out there . ”
Obama replied , “ They ’ve been out there since the beginning of this campaign .
This is something that has been systematically fed into the bloodstream .
We notice these e-mails get sent out in each successive state that we were campaigning in , which indicates that it is not just a random sort of viral thing .
I think you know this is a dirty trick that folks are playing on voters . ”
As an antidote to dirty tricks , Obama stated -- once again -- that he is a Christian .
Given the long odds of actually defeating Obama , however , why does Clinton keep running ?
Because , she said , Tuesday night , “ I am more determined than ever to carry on this campaign until everyone has had a chance to make their voices heard . ”
She has no alternative .
Just as sharks swim in order to breathe , candidates run in order to exist .
Nonetheless , throughout 2006 and into 2007 there were positive developments ( although the Pentagon did not supply the helicopters to the D.E.A. until early 2008 ) .
The D.E.A. was training special Afghan narcotics units , while the Pentagon began to train Afghan pilots for drug operations .
We put together educational teams that convened effective antidrug meetings in the more stable northern provinces .
We used manual eradication to eliminate about 10 percent of the crop .
In some provinces with little insurgent activity , the eradication numbers reached the 20 percent threshold  a level that drug experts see as a tipping point in eradication  and poppy cultivation all but disappeared in those areas by 2007 .
And the Department of Justice got the counternarcotics tribunal to process hundreds of midlevel cases .
By late 2006 , however , we had startling new information : despite some successes , poppy cultivation over all would grow by about 17 percent in 2007 and would be increasingly concentrated in the south of the country , where the insurgency was the strongest and the farmers were the wealthiest .
The poorest farmers of Afghanistan  those who lived in the north , east and center of the country  were taking advantage of antidrug programs and turning away from poppy cultivation in large numbers .
The south was going in the opposite direction , and the Taliban were now financing the insurgency there with drug money  just as Patterson predicted .
In late January 2007 , there was an urgent U.S. cabinet meeting to discuss the situation .
The attendees agreed that the deputy secretary of state John Negroponte and John Walters , the drug czar , would oversee the development of the first interagency counternarcotics strategy for Afghanistan .
They asked me to coordinate the effort , and , after Patterson ’s intervention , I was promoted to ambassadorial rank .
We began the effort with a briefing for Negroponte , Walters , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and several senior Pentagon officials .
We displayed a map showing how poppy cultivation was becoming limited to the south , more associated with the insurgency and disassociated from poverty .
The Pentagon chafed at the briefing because it reflected a new reality : narcotics were becoming less a problem of humanitarian assistance and more a problem of insurgency and war .
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime was arriving at the same conclusion .
Later that year , they issued a report linking the drug trade to the insurgency and made a controversial statement : “ Opium cultivation in Afghanistan is no longer associated with poverty  quite the opposite . ”
The office convincingly demonstrated that poor farmers were abandoning the crop and that poppy growth was largely confined to some of the wealthiest parts of Afghanistan .
The report recommended that eradication efforts be pursued “ more honestly and more vigorously , ” along with stronger anticorruption measures .
Earlier this year , the U.N. published an even more detailed paper titled “ Is Poverty Driving the Afghan Opium Boom ? ”
It rejected the idea that farmers would starve without the poppy , concluding that “ poverty does not appear to have been the main driving factor in the expansion of opium poppy cultivation in recent years . ”
The U.N. reports shattered the myth that poppies are grown by destitute farmers who have no other source of income .
They demonstrated that approximately 80 percent of the land under poppy cultivation in the south had been planted with it only in the last two years .
It was not a matter of “ tradition , ” and these farmers did not need an alternative livelihood .
They had abandoned their previous livelihoods  mainly vegetables , cotton and wheat ( which was in severely short supply )  to take advantage of the security vacuum to grow a more profitable crop : opium .
Around the same time , the United States released photos of industrial - size poppy farms  many owned by pro-government opportunists , others owned by Taliban sympathizers .
Most of these narco - farms were near major southern cities .
Farmers were digging wells , surveying new land for poppy cultivation , diverting U.S. - built irrigation canals to poppy fields and starting expensive reclamation projects .
Yet Afghan officials continued to say that poppy cultivation was the only choice for its poor farmers .
My first indication of the insincerity of this position came at a lunch in Brussels in September 2006 attended by Habibullah Qaderi , who was then Afghanistan ’s minister for counternarcotics .
He gave a speech in which he said that poor Afghan farmers have no choice but to grow poppies , and asked for more money .
A top European diplomat challenged him , holding up a U.N. map showing the recent trend : poppy growth decreasing in the poorest areas and growing in the wealthier areas .
The minister , taken aback , simply reiterated his earlier point that Afghanistan needed more money for its destitute farmers .
After the lunch , however , Qaderi approached me and whispered : “ I know what you say is right .
Poverty is not the main reason people are growing poppy .
But this is what the president of Afghanistan tells me to tell others . ”
The government has launched a campaign to increase uptake of the MMR jab amid growing fears of a measles epidemic .
The Department of Health is making extra doses of the vaccine available and has asked NHS trusts in England to offer it to all children aged up to 18 who are not already fully protected against measles , mumps and rubella .
The chief medical officer for England , Professor Sir Liam Donaldson , has written to all local health trusts urging them to persuade parents to get their children immunised .
The number of cases of measles is on the rise across the country .
There were 1,726 confirmed cases in England and Wales in 2006 and 2007 - more than in the previous 10 years put together , when there were 1,621 cases .
Estimates by the Department of Health suggest a measles epidemic in Britain could affect between 30,000 and 100,000 children and young people .
Uptake of the MMR jab fell to an all - time low after medical journal the Lancet publication a controversial and now discredited study that suggested
the triple vaccine was linked to autism and bowel disease .
The lead author of the paper , Dr Andrew Wakefield , is currently appearing before the General Medical Council ( GMC ) on charges relating to the research .
MMR vaccination rates vary across England but remain particularly low in London .
Trusts in the capital will receive an extra £ 60,000 in the campaign , while those outside London will get £ 30,000 .
Estimates suggest around 3 million children and young people aged between 18 months and 18 years have missed either their first or second dose .
After the first dose , between 5 % and 10 % of children are not yet protected .
After two doses this falls below 1 % .
The first injection is given at around 13 months of age , with a booster before starting school , usually between the ages of three and five .
Professor David Salisbury , the director of immunisation at the Department of Health , said : " Parents who have not had their children vaccinated with the MMR vaccine should do so now .
The evidence on MMR is absolutely clear - there is no link between the vaccine and autism .
" The MMR vaccine coverage is not high enough to remove the threat of recurrence of measles outbreaks .
Measles is serious and in some cases it can be fatal .
Delaying immunisation puts children at risk . "
Dr Patricia Hamilton , the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health , said : " We can not stress too strongly that all children and young people should have the MMR vaccine .
Overwhelming scientific evidence shows that it is safe . "
A joint report published this year by the Health Protection Agency , Guys hospital and Manchester University found no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism .

A signature moment of Barack Obama 's primary campaign came last November in Des Moines , Iowa .
He gave a speech at the Jefferson - Jackson Dinner that electrified the crowd and gave his campaign a kick that helped win the Iowa caucuses -- a victory without which he would n't be the Democratic nominee .
Obama declared that " the same old Washington textbook campaigns just wo n't do . "
Deploring " triangulating and poll - driven positions , " he said that " telling the American people what we think they want to hear instead of telling the American people what they need to hear just wo n't do . "
The Democratic Party had been at its best , he told the crowd , when " we led , not by polls , but by principles ; not by calculation , but by conviction . "
" I run for the presidency of the United States of America because that 's the party America needs us to be right now , " he vowed , staking his candidacy on the achingly idealistic premises of a new , more forthright and uncalculating politics .
What makes Obama 's " textbook " dash to the center so extraordinary is not just its speed , but how it falsifies the very essence of his candidacy .
It 's as if Bill Clinton won the Democratic nomination in 1992 and announced suddenly that actually he was not a " new kind of Democrat " ; or if George W. Bush , after winning his party 's nomination in 2000 , forswore " compassionate conservatism " ; or if John McCain , after winning the GOP nomination this year , declared in favor of a hard deadline for withdrawal from Iraq .
In the past few weeks , Obama has broken two pledges ( to take public financing in the general election and to filibuster legal immunity for telecoms that cooperated with the government in terrorist surveillance ) ; has belittled his own rhetoric during the primary campaign ( saying it could get " overheated and amplified " on the issue of trade ) ; redefined his promise to meet without preconditions with the leaders of hostile states until it 's basically meaningless ; endorsed a Supreme Court decision striking down a Washington , D.C. , gun ban his campaign had previously said he supported ; and made muddy , centrist - sounding statements about his positions on Iraq and abortion that he had to go back and try to clarify .
Has there ever in recent political memory been so much calculation and bad faith by a politician who has made so much of eschewing both ?
We now know that Barack Obama is not naive , but his ardent supporters are .
Obama exhorted them to " believe " -- one of his favorite words -- in him and his virtue above all , and as soon as they gave him the nomination he wanted , he showed how foolishly credulous they had been .
When it comes to triangulating , he 's Hillary Clinton without the baggage .
Forget the debate about whether Obama is " American enough . "
He 's that great American archetype , the audacious salesman with an eye on the main chance .
Nothing in his utterly orthodox left - wing record ever suggested he was a transformationally unifying figure , but he sold himself as that to the audience he needed in the Democratic primaries .
Nothing in his record suggests he 's a sensible centrist , but he 's going to sell himself as one to the audience he needs in the general election , whatever contortions it takes .
In his current TV ad , he touts his support for welfare reform when he actually opposed it .
Obama is calculating shrewdly now -- just as shrewdly as back when he was attacking calculation .
His left - wing base wo n't abandon him , and all the dewy - eyed new voters attracted by him will stay that way , so long as he continues to look and sound good .
His task is to win over general - election voters in a center - right country who value hardheadedness and practicality in their presidents .
Barack Obama does n't need to be a messiah figure .
He need n't even be particularly admirable .
In a poisonous year for Republicans , he just needs to be a minimally acceptable Democrat , and so minimally acceptable he aims to be .
But we 're a long way from Des Moines .
Rich Lowry is the editor of National Review .
Ever wondered if doctors are frightened of catching what you 've got ?
What their notes really mean ?
Or how to get round their receptionist ?
We asked five doctors to spill the beans
Dr Everything General practice
Dr Child Paediatrics
Dr Cancer Oncology
Dr Gynae Women 's health
Dr Mind Psychiatry
When are the best and worst times to be admitted to hospital ?
Dr Cancer Worst time : junior doctor handover in the first weeks of February and August .
Dr Mind Worst time is Friday and Saturday night when the drunken kids are out beating themselves up , crashing cars and overloading hospitals .
Dr Child A&E is very unpredictable .
Urgent situations will be dealt with quickly , regardless of how busy the department is .
Dr Everything Best time is when there is no alternative .
Worst time is on Christmas Eve or Good Friday with an unknown condition .
Hospitals are understaffed over weekends and bank holidays .
Usually cover is arranged for junior staff , but consultant rounds are rare and haphazard .
If I go to a major teaching hospital , will I get a better doctor ?
Dr Everything
You will get more learned [ specialist ] consultants who can distinguish between dermatofibrosarcoma [ a potentially malignant skin tumour ] and a mole , but you might not get an experienced generalist who can quickly assure you that the dizzy spells , shortness of breath , tingling in your lips , hands and feet are the effects of a panic attack , as opposed to those of phaeochromocytoma [ adrenal gland tumour ] , without inserting certain probes .
Dr Cancer
You will generally get better junior doctors looking after you , which makes all the difference .
Dr Mind Many teaching - hospital doctors are preoccupied with research , publishing papers and advancing their academic careers .
Watch out for these .
People complain that hospitals are dehumanising .
Are they ?
Dr Gynae Lack of privacy and poor food are problems , but the real crisis is shortage of nurses .
Dr Cancer
When you see the effort that goes into some patients , you would say no .
However , parts of the NHS with high throughput are always going to be slightly dehumanising .
What 's the strangest thing you 've ever seen in a hospital ?
Dr Mind
In my first six months as a doctor , a young man on his honeymoon came in with a wedding ring trapped round the base of his penis .
In the end we got the dentist to drill it off and we saved the penis .
Dr Child
An unfortunate man who had managed to insert a whole jar of lubricant into his rectum .
Sadly , a major operation was required to remove it .
How can you speed up getting an appointment with a busy consultant ?
Dr Cancer
Phone up their private secretary and offer to see him / her as a private patient .
The patients who get seen the quickest are either the nice , friendly ones or the really aggressive ones ( who kick up a fuss until they are seen ) .
The former get the best care .
Dr Gynae Call their secretary , and say you will take a last - minute cancellation .
On a typical clinic list of 20 patients , three or four wo n't arrive , and some will cancel in advance .
Dr Child Choose and Book ( chooseandbook.nhs.uk ) should allow the patient to determine the approximate waiting lists of different consultants , and pick shorter ones .
Hassling the consultant 's secretary by telephone is unlikely to make you popular .
Dr Everything GPs are sympathetic to patients ' clinical needs - and specialists ' interests .
If an elderly , otherwise able lady is crippled with arthritis in her hips , her GP may try to expedite her appointment with an orthopaedic surgeon with an interest in hip - replacement surgery .
However , if a fit middle - aged gentleman has painful feet and is seeking assistance with the New York Marathon ...
Why do patients have to sit for so long in waiting rooms ?
Dr Everything
In general practice it may well have to do with a number of factors , such as the GP starting late or the GP dealing with emergencies .
And not all problems can be shoehorned into a 10 - minute consultation .
Many are complex - mental - health issues , grief , cancer and sick children to name but a few .
Some GPs teach their patients to book double appointments if their problems are tricky , while others may have queues of patients checking about the flu .
Dr Gynae Patients are often given appointment times of 15 minutes earlier than their actual appointment to compensate for parking problems at hospitals .
Dr Child Doctors often arrive late at clinic because of work commitments on the ward or elsewhere , or following a desperate bid to squeeze in lunch .
Some clinics have a crazy system whereby everyone arrives at once and is seen on a " first come , first served ' basis .
This is worth complaining about .
Dr Cancer Usually because someone has allocated too - small time slots , or because members of the team are away .
If you have had to wait , do n't berate the doctor as it only slows things down even more .
How can you ensure that a doctor takes you seriously ?
Dr Cancer Bringing someone with you can help .
Dr Mind
Be clear about what you want and do n't spend a long time telling him or her about irrelevant things .
Dr Gynae Everyone who sits in front of a doctor is nervous and vulnerable , and it is our job to take all patients seriously .
Of course , some are swinging the lead , and very busy doctors , GPs especially , will be less tolerant of time - wasting .
Dr Everything Write a note to your doctor ; tell them all your concerns and what impact the problem has had on your daily activities ; do n't get up from the chair until you 've had an answer to your concerns .
Is it a good idea to buy your doctor a thank - you present ?
Dr Everything I do n't feel comfortable with gifts .
A good way to tell your doctor how you feel is a note or card .
This also helps your doctor at their appraisal when they have to persuade other doctors that they do n't suck at their jobs .
Dr Child
There are strict guidelines as to what a doctor can accept , and anything of significant value should be declined .
Chocolates or biscuits go down well because they can be shared among the team .
Dr Mind I like gifts when they 're appropriate .
Medicine is very personal and it's great to be thanked for doing something good for a patient .
Dr Cancer Doctors will appreciate a token such as a card and a box of chocolates .
Dr Gynae I receive a lot of lovely cards , and it gives my day a lift to open one .
I get some chocolates and wine at Christmas , but gifts can actually be a nuisance - I 'm very busy and must find time to reply .
Have you ever had to fire a patient ?
Dr Gynae No .
Dr Everything Some longstanding GPs have , but so far I have not .
Patients get fired for repeatedly failing to attend appointments , violence , verbal abuse , drug misuse and deliberately misleading or manipulating staff .
Dr Mind Certainly
I have , particularly when patients become overattached or excessively demanding .
Dr Cancer
No , but I 've been tempted at times .
Are doctors unduly influenced by drug companies ?
Dr Everything
This one does n't believe she is .
Not all doctors have the time , knowledge or inclination to keep abreast of the latest research , and so we have Nice ( National Institute for Clinical Guidelines and Excellence ) and other protocols .
Also , many GPs ' surgeries write their own protocols to ensure their patients obtain uniform care in line with the best evidence and value for money .
Dr Mind Yes , sadly they are , more and more , and something must be done to stop it .
Dr Cancer
It is a two - way relationship in oncology .
Drug companies organise conferences , but most experienced consultants do not allow personal preference to overrule scientific data .
Have you made mistakes , and if so , how do you deal with them ?
Dr Gynae
We all make mistakes - we 're only human .
The crucial thing is to explain clearly what has happened .
We must also prepare for a possible investigation , which is why hospitals have such huge complaints departments .
Dr Everything I keep a spreadsheet of problems during the course of a day .
These can include failure to inform the nurse of the exact blood tests to take , failures of communication , letters not being written , missing a major diagnosis , or prescribing a medication to a patient known to be allergic .
We have quarterly clinical governance meetings where we discuss recurring and serious errors .
Dr Child
There is no doctor who has never made a mistake .
As a new doctor I was asked by nursing staff to prescribe some strong painkillers for a patient who was being looked after by another medical team .
Although I checked with the patient what painkillers he normally took , I did not read through his medical notes .
He subsequently had a reaction to the painkillers and ended up having a near respiratory arrest .
Luckily , he was fine .
I was devastated at the time but it was a valuable lesson .
Dr Cancer Yes .
I try to make it a learning exercise for the whole team .
Are most doctors good at what they do ?
Dr Everything I believe so .
After all , they all passed punishing tests .
Dr Child
There are very few " bad " doctors out there .
But obviously there is variation between individuals in terms of theoretical knowledge , practical abilities and bedside manner .
Dr Gynae
Most are better than good , and striving to be better .
Problems only tend to occur alongside personal difficulties such as depression , divorce or alcohol , at which point colleagues and partners must be aware and report .
What 's the most common mistake that doctors make ?
Dr Cancer
Not really listening to what their patients are saying .
Dr Mind Assuming that they 've summed up the patient early on - and then failing to review this .
Dr Everything
The insurance companies tell us it 's lack of communication .
Dr Child Probably either failing to wash their hands between patients or drug - prescribing errors .
The latter is a particular issue in paediatrics when doses are based on weight .
Are you annoyed when a patient wants a second opinion ?
Dr Mind I welcome second opinions .
Dr Gynae I am slightly irritated if it seems the patient has a lack of confidence in me .
Dr Cancer No. I think it is important for the patient to have complete trust in their doctor and their treatment .
Dr Child
If the request comes in the context of genuine concern , that 's fine .
Most patients here will be seen by more than one doctor anyway .
Dr Everything Definitely not .
If I am proved right , that can be an ego rush ; but the most valuable times are when I am wrong , and I can figure out how it could have gone better and what I did n't know .
Good patient relationships have come out of me replying honestly about where I think things went wrong and what I would do to improve the situation .
Are doctors arrogant ?
Dr Everything
Of course not !
Dr Cancer
A lot of doctors use a veneer of arrogance as a means of hiding their own feelings of inadequacy .
A bit of arrogance helps protect you from becoming roadkill , but when it seeps into how you handle your patients , it is dangerous .
Dr Gynae Doctors are used to making decisions , and decision - makers plough a different furrow to most people .
" Arrogant " is too derogatory a term for this .
Do men or women make better patients ?
Dr Mind
It is unfashionable to say so but I find men as good as women at being patients .
Dr Everything Women argue but take advice ; men accept advice but rarely follow it .
Dr Cancer I 've seen good and bad examples from both sexes .
Does the threat of malpractice suits make you a better or worse doctor ?
Dr Cancer Worse , because you can usually spot the potentially litigious patients .
You bring in witnesses whenever you see them and write copious notes afterwards .
At this point you are practising defensive medicine , which is overcautious and damages the patient .
Dr Mind Medicine practised to avoid malpractice suits damages the thrust of medical care , which should be to help the patient .
Dr Everything Both .
I keep an eye on myself more but it can mean you can waste time and resources overinvestigating someone .
Dr Gynae Better .
It makes doctors more particular when informing patients about things such as the side - effects of drugs .
It 's made the health service safer .
Is it annoying when patients have researched their symptoms online ?
Dr Gynae No .
It means we can discuss the situation at a more informed level .
That said , many patients get the wrong end of the stick , and think they have some rare complication .
Dr Cancer
When patients come in with cuttings from the Daily Mail or reams of paper from the internet , it is quite annoying , particularly if the content is some unscientifically proven herbal cure .
Dr Mind I am delighted when patients come with their own opinions , so long as they 're not based on ridiculous websites written by people who know nothing .
Do you believe there is a rational scientific explanation at the bottom of every ailment you see ?
Dr Child Yes , although obviously some " rational scientific explanations " will involve psychological or social factors .
Dr Everything
It depends if you believe that psychology constitutes a rational scientific explanation , and even if there are rational scientific arguments for every ailment , we do n't know them all yet .
Dr Cancer Yes , for most ailments .
It is not practical to seek to get to the bottom of every ailment expressed by a patient , unless that ailment is worsening despite therapeutic attempts to reverse it .
Do doctors worry more about their health than non-doctors ?
Dr Everything No , less .
Dr Cancer
It 's difficult to generalise .
Some doctors are complete hypochondriacs ; others think they are above poor health .
Generally , doctors are more likely to think that a simple symptom is a manifestation of something more sinister .
Also , if you are a doctor looking after a doctor , it is scary .
Not only do doctor - patients ask lots of annoying questions , but they invariably seem to have a more stormy course during their illness than non-doctors .
Dr Gynae
They do n't have time .
They 're more likely to drop dead because they never got round to being screened .
Dr Child I do n't think so .
Often doctors are blase .
They very rarely take sick leave , for example , since they know that this will leave colleagues in the lurch .
Doctors ought probably to take their own health and welfare more seriously than they do .
There is still a culture that doctors are invincible and do n't get ill .
Do stoic patients get worse treatment ?
Dr Mind I fear stoicism may work against them .
Dr Gynae
By the time they make an appointment , they have stopped being stoic .
Men are less likely to access healthcare early , though whether this is stoicism is moot .
Dr Everything Stoic patients may get fobbed off by overprotective receptionists .
The doctor is likely to take stoics seriously since they will not be saying , " The headaches , the headaches , I must have a brain tumour . "
Do you think that hospital staff are doing enough to fight superbugs ?
Dr Mind Definitely not .
The superbug epidemic is catastrophic , most of all because it is preventable .
I certainly fear for my patients .
Dr Gynae
The situation is taken seriously , and has hugely improved , in terms of hygiene and screening .
Dr Cancer Yes .
Hospital staff do a lot to fight superbugs , and I think the press has given almost hysterical coverage to the whole issue .
Many patients now think that contracting a superbug is inevitable if they are admitted , and are refusing to come in , even if they need to .
Do you ever worry about catching diseases and infections off your patients ?
Dr Cancer I had one virus after another when I worked in casualty .
I assume this has strengthened , not weakened , my immune system .
I would only worry about contracting a superbug if I had an open wound and was examining a patient with MRSA .
We are careful to wear gloves and gowns and liberally spray our hands with alcohol before seeing any patients at risk of MRSA or C.difficile
Dr Gynae Yes .
I 'm terrified of catching hepatitis C , for which there is no vaccination , and which would end my career .
Throughout history , thousands of doctors have died saving lives - take Dr Carlo Urbani , who identified Sars , and died of it .
Dr Child Generally , no , although almost everyone who starts in paediatrics goes through a period of catching minor viral illnesses .
I got impetigo .
Superbugs are not really a problem for healthcare workers - the main concern is the possibility of spreading infection to patients .
MRSA bacteria can live on your skin or up your nose without causing problems until they get into surgical wounds or affect immuno - compromised patients .
Do doctors have a healthier lifestyle than non-doctors ?
Dr Child I very much doubt it , judging by the number of doctors that smoke or drink to excess .
As we all know only too well , knowledge about the beneficial effects of lifestyle changes rarely ensures that those lifestyle changes actually happen .
Dr Cancer I think doctors drink more , which may be a legacy from medical school .
Different branches of medicine have different habits .
It is unusual to find an oncologist who smokes , or a dermatologist who sunbathes .
Dr Gynae Impossible to generalise .
Many drink , and a number take drugs because they have access , but on the whole , doctors ' lifestyles are n't better or worse than non-doctors ' .
Do you practise what you preach ?
Dr Mind Yes .
Dr Gynae Yes .
Dr Everything Well , I try not to preach .
I try to tell patients about current knowledge and possible consequences of their behaviour , but not to take it personally if they do n't change .
I have n't always taken my own advice about healthy behaviour , but have about psychological ideas .
Dr Cancer Mostly .
At one stage I smoked socially , and found myself telling patients off for doing the same .
What are the most important factors in someone 's health ?
Their family history , their diet , or the amount of exercise that they take ?
Dr Everything Still an evidential whirlpool .
However , in my opinion , it is family history , followed by smoking and alcohol , followed by diet , followed by exercise .
Dr Cancer
In oncology , the family history is pretty important , diet and exercise less so .
Dr Mind Genetics are enormously important in our health and we can't do much about it .
Dr Gynae Diet and exercise are hugely important , and they are the things to focus on .
Do you smoke or drink ?
Dr Gynae I do n't smoke , and I drink two units per day .
Dr Child No , and minimally ( most of the time ! ) .
Dr Cancer I gave up social smoking and I drink about 14 units a week .
Dr Everything I quit smoking 10 years ago and drink in moderation .
Would you suggest alternative therapies such as homeopathy or acupuncture to a patient and have you ever tried them yourself ?
Dr Mind Yes , I have recommended alternative therapies to patients .
Dr Child No , and I 'm unlikely to recommend them .
I 'm prepared to believe that acupuncture might benefit some chronic pain conditions , but find the pseudoscientific explanation for homeopathy completely nonsensical .
Dr Everything I have used reflexology often and refer patients routinely for acupuncture , which has some possibly weak evidence for use in chronic back pain .
I do n't refer for homeopathy as I believe there is no good evidence for it .
Dr Cancer I have not used them , but acupuncture and aromatherapy both seem to help with cancer symptoms .
I am less keen on faith healers and homeopathy .
With a disease such as cancer , about which there is so much we do not know , there seem to be a lot of " alternative health therapists " offering false hope , usually at a price .
It is heartbreaking to see patients put all their faith in a spiritualist , travel miles to see a psychic surgeon or spend a fortune online on a drug " used successfully on thousands of patients " , all to no avail .
I definitely think we should integrate complementary medicines into our routine clinical practice to address the spiritual welfare and morale of the patients undergoing often very gruelling therapy and facing their own mortality .
However , some alternative therapists give the patients the incorrect message that their disease is somehow controlled by them ( mind over matter ) , and so patients are left with a feeling of guilt if their disease advances despite therapies .
I think patients with cancer need more regulated spiritual , psychological and just plain moral support during therapy .
Will the proposed centralised database of people 's medical records ( ' The Spine ' ) compromise patient confidentiality ?
Dr Cancer Doctors do their best to maintain patient confidentiality .
The database raises the obvious concerns about hackers and viruses .
Overall , though , the centralisation of patient data can only be advantageous , as any patient who transfers from one hospital to another can tell you .
Dr Child
There are inevitably concerns but the notion of making medical records electronic is eminently sensible .
The amount of time wasted at the moment in trying to find notes is ridiculous .
It 's like when banks had paper ledgers for each customer account , and you could only withdraw money from your own branch .
There are big questions about who will be allowed to access this data .
Certainly for legitimate medical use it will be a huge advantage .
Inevitably , however , with the need for coding , invoicing and data analysis , lots of access will be for non-medical reasons and this will need to be tightly controlled .
What do you usually have for lunch ?
Dr Cancer Sandwich , diet coke , bag of crisps .
Dr Child Typically , an overpriced and unexciting sandwich from the hospital cafe .
Dr Everything Until recently , very little .
Lately though , homemade soup or chicken salad .
What 's your exercise regime ?
Dr Child
Do as little as possible .
Dr Everything Walking as much as I can .
Dr Cancer Yoga and brisk walks around the hospital .
Dr Mind Regular and energetic .
Dr Gynae I exercise three times a week on the treadmill , for 30 minutes each time .
Are you concerned about what your patients eat while in hospital ?
Dr Cancer
Yes , particularly as cancer patients have higher nutritional requirements than many others .
Hospital food is generally pretty bad so it's a good idea for relatives to bring in extra food .
We often refer at - risk patients to hospital dieticians to make sure they are given supplements .
Dr Mind I pay attention , but there is little to be done .
Systems are frequently archaic , designed to save money , and the patient suffers .
Do you buy so - called ' superfoods ' and organic food ?
Dr Everything I do n't buy much " superfood " , but I do believe , for example , that blueberries help avoid dementia and spinach helps avoid macular degeneration .
I suspect organic food does n't have transfats , which may be detrimental to health , as well as pesticides , though I do n't go out of my way to use organic exclusively .
Dr Cancer I am not convinced that organic food is more healthy and do not spend money on superfoods ( which usually have in common their ludicrous cost and revolting taste ) .
I think there is a massive industry out there catering to the neuroses of the " worried well " and I do n't want to partake in it .
Dr Child No .
Do you find conflicting health news stories saying that coffee / chocolate / red wine are good and bad for you as confusing as everybody else ?
Dr Cancer
The ones relating to cancer interest me , because that is my job .
But normally , these scary news bulletins are followed , a few years later , with a scientific study disproving them .
Unless the evidence is incontrovertible , I do n't change my eating habits on the basis of a news item .
Dr Everything I follow the studies as far as I can .
I try to see the original studies and critically appraise them .
Studying numbers , design and interpretation of results can have quite profound effects on what constitutes evidence .
If a definite trend is set , especially if endorsed by other experts , I start to recommend treatments .
Sometimes I have to do a U - turn , such as with HRT , which I stopped prescribing for a long while .
Now I have more information and can recommend more rationally .
Dr Child I tend to ignore such stories .
Do you take any nutritional supplements ?
Dr Cancer Not usually .
Dr Child Certainly not .
Dr Gynae
Not at all .
Dr Everything Yes , vitamin C and iron .
Dr Mind Yes .
Do you avoid chemicals in soaps or antiperspirants linked to cancer , such as sodium laureth sulphate ?
Dr Cancer No .
The data linking the two is scanty .
Dr Everything No .
Dr Child No .
How many glasses of water a day do you drink ?
Dr Cancer About three .
Dr Everything Three .
Dr Child Usually none - generally there is little time at work for tea breaks or drinking .
Do you sunbathe / use sunbeds ?
Dr Cancer I have fair skin that burns and then peels , so a tan developed over weeks lasts about one day once I get home .
I have given up sunbathing as a result .
Dr Everything No .
Dr Child No .
Do you do detoxes ?
Dr Cancer No .
Dr Everything No .
Dr Child
What 's that ?
No

The machine saved Millie 's life A baby dying from kidney failure was saved when her doctor designed and built her a dialysis machine from scratch in his garage .
Millie Kelly was too small for conventional NHS machines , so Dr Malcolm Coulthard and a colleague constructed a scaled - down version .
Two years later , her mother Rebecca says she is " fit as a fiddle " .
She , and Dr Coulthard , from Newcastle 's Royal Victoria Infirmary , now want the machine to be available to others .
I just can't thank him enough for saving my baby 's life
Rebecca Kelly
The job of the kidneys is to ' clean ' the blood , and if they fail , a dialysis machine can do this job instead .
Millie was born with a condition called gastroschisis , in which her bowels developed outside her body .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
During an operation to correct the problem , her kidneys started to fail , and her birthweight , at just over 6lb , meant existing NHS dialysis machines , even those designed for children , were too large to be used .
Rebecca was warned that Millie was unlikely to survive .
However , Dr Coulthard , together with senior children 's kidney nurse Jean Crosier , devised a smaller version , then built it away from the hospital .
Millie was connected to the machine over a seven day period , allowing her own kidneys to recover .
Metal box Rebecca , from Middlesbrough , said : " It was a green metal box with a few paint marks on it with quite a few wires coming out of it into my daughter - it did n't look like a normal NHS one .
Dr Coulthard designed the machine " But it was the only hope for her - even when she got hooked up to the dialysis machine , they said that every hour was a bonus .
" She 's fine now , a normal two - year - old - I just can't thank him enough for saving my baby 's life . "
She said that there was an opportunity for other babies to benefit from similar machines .
The machine is still in use , helping babies in similar circumstances to Millie , but Dr Coulthard told the Newcastle Journal newspaper that an official version was needed .
" This machine is only being used on the tiniest , earliest babies where there is nothing else that can be done .
" But if we had a machine that we could use much more freely , then we would be able to deal with many more babies and have a much greater chance of saving lives . "

Flexible circuits should lead to diverse imaging applications .
An eye - shaped camera made from a flexible mesh of silicon light - detectors marks a significant step towards creating a ' bionic ' eye , its inventors say .
A single lens , mounted on top of a transparent cap , focuses light onto the flexible electronic circuit beneath .
John Rogers / Nature
Conventional cameras use a curved lens to focus an image onto a flat surface where the light is captured either by film or by digital sensors .
However , focusing light from a curved lens onto a flat surface distorts the image , necessitating a series of other lenses that reduce the distortion but tend to increase the bulk and cost of a device .
By contrast , human eyes require only a single lens and avoid much of this distortion , because the image is focused onto the curved surface at the back of the eyeball .
John Rogers , a materials scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , and his colleagues have taken inspiration from our own eyes to create an electronic version1 .
“ It allows us to put electronics in places where we could n't before . ” John Rogers

It 's a problem that many researchers have worked on over the last few decades .
The key hurdle has been the rigidity of established electronic materials , which fracture when bent .
Flexible scaffold
The team 's solution was to use a series of silicon photodetectors ( pixels ) connected by thin metal wires .
This network is supported and encapsulated by a thin film of polyimide plastic , allowing the flexible scaffold to bend when compressed .
This scaffold takes up the mechanical stress and protects the pixels as the array takes its hemispherical shape .
The team made a hollow dome about 2 centimetres wide from a rubber - like material called poly ( dimethylsiloxane ) .
They flattened out the stretchy dome , and attached the electronic mesh .
Then , as the hollow dome snapped back into its original shape , it pulled the array with it , forming a hemisphere that could be attached to a lens ; the basis of the camera
“ The ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design , ” says Rogers .
" It allows us to put electronics in places where we could n't before . "
The research was described as a “ breakthrough ” by Dago de Leeuw , a research fellow with Philips Research Laboratories based in Eindhoven , the Netherlands .
The technique could work for any application where you would want to have stretchable electronics , and is limited only by what sensors you can add to the array .
Higher resolution
To improve the camera ’s resolution , the researchers have also experimented with another of nature 's designs .
The constant motion of the human eye means that we get many views of an object , which we automatically combine to give us a better picture of what we ’re looking at , explains Rogers .
So his team has done the same , taking several images with their camera at slightly different angles and then combining them with computer software to give a much sharper image .
Takao Someya of the University of Tokyo , Japan , who also works on stretchable electronics , says that the camera marks a great advance in the field of stretchable electronics , with potential applications including bionic implants , robotic sensory skins and biomedical monitoring devices2 .
At the moment , the camera is limited to 256 pixels , but this could be easily scaled up , says Rogers .
Advantageously , this electronic eye camera exploits technology that already exists , so facilities currently fabricating planar silicon devices should be able to adapt to making this new technology .

Japanese women were once again named the longest living people in the world in 2008 , showing the life expectancy of 86 years , Japan 's health ministry reported .
Japanese girls born in 2007 can expect to live to an age of 86 years old , ranking the first in the list of the world ' longevity for 23 years .
Japanese boys will have an average life expectancy of 79,2 , following Iceland and Hong Kong males .
The longer life expectancy of Japanese women is explained by such factors as healthier diets and close social ties .
The improvements of medical treatment of such diseases as cancer , heart disease and stroke also contribute to longer lifespan , a ministry spokesman said .
Japan also tops the world as the country with the lowest birth rates in the world .
This fact brings special concern to the government as Japan is ageing faster than other countries .
The statistics show that nearly tenth of the population today is 75 years or older .
The number of Japanese people aged over 65 is expected to double by the middle of the century .
Thus , Japan would have to deal with the increased pension funding and find new ways of maintaining productivity .
According to the last year statistics , Taiwanese women ranked the second in the list of longest lived , and Spanish and Swiss women on the third and forth place respectively .
The shortest male and female life expectancy with only 37 years is found among Swaziland people .

Is green U.S. mass transit a big myth ?
Is green U.S. mass transit a big myth ?
As part of my research for an article on robotic cars and how they change so much of the world , I 've been looking into the energy use of various forms of transportation .
What I learned about public transit in the USA shocked me .
I 've been a fan of public transit , taking it where it 's practical for me , and feeling green about it .
That transit is a significantly greener way to get around than private car travel almost goes without saying in our thoughts and discussions .
Disturbingly , this simply is n't true .
I started by pulling out various numbers on the energy used per passenger mile of various forms of transportation .
These numbers can be found in places like the U.S. government bureau of transportation statistics figures and the Dept. of Energy Transportation Energy Data Book ( Especially table 2 - 12 ) .
I 've also found tables broken down per city .
These studies express transit energy efficiency in terms of BTUs per passenger - mile .
The BTU is the English system unit of energy , and it 's equal to 1055 joules .
With perfect conversion , there are 3413 BTUs in a kw/h .
To turn BTUs / mile into miles per gallon , you divide into 125,000 , the number of BTUs you get from burning a gallon of gas .
Here 's a useful table .
A " passenger mile " is taking one passenger a mile .
If it takes 10,000 BTUs to take a vehicle with 10 passengers for one mile , that 's 10 passenger miles , and 1,000 BTUs / passenger - mile .
For solo vehicles , passenger miles are just miles .
The figures below are for the DoE 's average passenger loads over the entire USA , unless noted as solo or for a specific district .
( If you prefer to see this as MPG equivalents , check out the bottom of this page . )
The DoE figures describe the average car as using 5500 BTUs / mile ( 23 mpg ) or 3,500 BTUs / passenger mile with an average load of 1.57 passengers .
This is a " fuel to wheels " number based on burning the gasoline .
Putting the car at 3,500 I was disturbed to learn that city diesel buses and electric trolley buses are both worse than the car in energy efficiency .
Light capacity rail systems are much worse , on average , though it varies a lot from city to city .
Commuter rail and subway ( heavy capacity rail ) trains tend to be a bit better , though heavy rail has been getting worse .
( Non - hybrid cars are also better at long haul than they are short haul . )
I 've put a lot of the figures on this chart .
I 've thrown in some other interesting forms of transit , including electric cars , scooters , hybrid cars , jet airplanes and more .
Particularly disturbing were the numbers for some of the worst transit systems , notably light ( capacity ) rail .
While my local San Jose system no longer tops the chart , the Galveston , Texas system comes in using 8 times the energy of the average light truck / SUV .
( To be fair , the system there is a 7 mile long system used more by tourists than locals .
The other worst cities also have fairly short systems , though light rail boosters still support them .
The Pittsburg light rail , at around 8,500 has no such excuse for its worse - than - solo - SUV performance . )
It should be noted that the electric vehicles are much more efficient on a " tank to wheels " basis than shown here .
However , while 1 kWh of electricity is only 3400 BTUs on a theoretical conversion basis , most electricity is generated from heat , and 70 % is generated by burning fossil fuels , mostly coal .
So in fact each kWh of electricity consumes 10,339 BTUs using the DoE methodology .
That 's about a 2/3 loss mostly for generation inefficiency and some transmission loss .
See also EIA numbers .
The electric vehicles will generate a modestly smaller amount of greenhouse gasses per BTU than the fuel - burning vehicles , though this varies based on how much nuclear and hydro there is in the local area .
What 's not in these numbers
True " well to wheels " analysis includes more factors : Energy to make and recycle cars and transit vehicles .
For typical cars that 's 120 million BTUs , or about 15 % extra over a 150,000 mile life - cycle .
I do n't yet have figures for transit vehicles , however I expect them to do better than 15 % .
Even if it were zero , the results can't get worsened by more than 15 % .
Energy to build and maintain roads ( for cars and buses ) and tracks ( for trains ) or both for street cars .
This is significant though in many cases it is already expended .
Energy to extract , refine and ship fuel , both to cars and diesel transit , and to power plants making electricity for electric transit .
For gasoline , this is about a 22 % surcharge .
I do n't yet have figures for the energy cost of mining and shipping coal , or extracting and piping natural gas for electricity .
Again , this worsens the results at most 22 % for the cars , trucks and diesl buses , but the real penalty is going to be less .
Variations in the average passenger load of all the vehicles , including the cars , which make some systems highly efficient and others terrible .
Likewise , some cities have higher passenger / car figures and others lower .
These are , except where noted , national averages .
The fact that sometimes transit trips require more miles ( changing lines ) and sometimes fewer miles ( private right - of - way ) .
Data released this year which slows a slight improving trend for the buses , bringing them slightly ahead of the cars .
( This varies from year to year . )
These add - ons apply both to transit and cars , though in different ways .
The comparison between purely urban cars and purely urban transit is likely somewhat more favourable for transit -- but I would like to get authoritative numbers , and my instincts suggest it does not change the basic conclusion .
Likewise the figures for suburban ( highway ) cars vs. suburban transit will be less favourable for transit .
It 's been asserted that the 1.5 passengers per car average provided by the DoE is biased slightly , in that highway driving has higher loads and urban driving has lighter , but I would like to see real numbers on this .
A drop to 1.2 urban would make the car 's number 25 % worse .
While electric transit still burns fuel ( ~70 % fossil , 20 % nuke ) it is worth considering that its fuel is not imported like much of the oil cars burn .
Electric cars of course compare directly with electric transit .
Since I still see many wanting to dispute these numbers , here 's a sidebar on various ways to work these numbers .
If you 're comparing gasoline or diesel transit to electric transit , while the BTU figure compares the energy used , there are a lot of possible methodologies one might use for comparing these things , many of which score better for electricity .
I have a deeper analysis of this .
If you 're comparing car to bus , or electri car to electric train , the BTU number works fine .
How can this be ?
A full bus or trainload of people is more efficient than private cars , sometimes quite a bit more so .
But transit systems never consist of nothing but full vehicles .
They run most of their day with light loads .
The above calculations came from figures citing the average city bus holding 9 passengers , and the average train ( light or heavy ) holds 22 .
If that seems low , remember that every packed train at rush hour tends to mean a near empty train returning down the track .
Remember , by definition most passenger experiences are on the fuller vehicles , which is why you probably think the average loads are higher than they are .
Even in transit - loving places like Great Britain , the average local bus holds just 10 people .
( Much higher in London but lower outside . )
Transit vehicles also tend to stop and start a lot , which eats a lot of energy , even with regenerative braking .
And most transit vehicles are just plain heavy , and not very aerodynamic .
Indeed , you 'll see tables in the DoE reports that show that over the past 30 years , private cars have gotten 30 % more efficient , while buses have gotten 60 % less efficient and trains about 25 % worse .
The market and government regulations have driven efforts to make cars more efficient , while transit vehicles have actually worsened .
My figures suggest the city bus moves 3,000 lbs of bus for every passenger on average , and still 500 lbs per passenger when fully packed at rush hour -- starting and stopping all the time .
There is more analysis on my blog .
In order to get people to choose transit , you must offer frequent service , all day long .
They want to know they have the freedom to return at different times .
But that means emptier vehicles outside of rush hour .
You 've all seen those huge empty vehicles go by , you just have n't thought of how inefficient they were .
It would be better if off - hours transit was done by much smaller vehicles , but that implies too much capital cost -- no transit agency will buy enough equipment for peak times and then buy a second set of equipment for light demand periods .
Transit planning is also driven by different economies .
Often transit infrastructure ( including vehicles ) is paid for by state or federal money , while drivers ( but also fuel ) are paid from local city budgets .
This seems to push local city transit agencies to get bigger vehicles and fewer drivers where they can , since drivers tend to be hired full - time and can't be kept idling in low - demand periods .
Remember again , that these are averages .
Some cities ( see the charts ) do have efficient transit lines , and others have dreadful ones that should not have been built as they were .
However , even the most efficient cities do n't beat small electric cars .
Yes , you should still take transit Heavy Rail Energy Efficiency
There is a bit of a paradox within these numbers .
In spite of them , it is generally the green move for any individual to take existing mass transit over their car .
That 's because the transit is running anyway , so the incremental cost of carrying one more passenger is indeed less than just about any private vehicle .
It is similarly green to carpool in somebody else 's car that 's going your way .
As such , these numbers should not make you feel better about taking your car instead of the train .
Particularly solo , since solo drivers are what make the car 's average efficiency worse while carpoolers make it better .
These numbers instead are there to guide policy .
What sort of transportation infrastructure should we build to be efficient ?
And , to a more limited extent , what sort of transportation should you support ?
The math should influence your decisions , and those of city planners who work for you , on what new transit to build , and what to keep running .
Is this fair ?
As noted , these are averages .
It 's slightly fairer to compare city MPG with urban transit , and highway MPG with longer range transit and rail .
However , newer hybrid cars actually get better mileage on city streets , and this is how cars are trending .
Scooters , electric cars and other such vehicles are better by any standard .
( It is for this reason that I concluded that robot cars could solve our transportation energy problem , because by delivering and refueling themselves , they make marketable the use of lightweight , short - range electric vehicles that beat out cars or transit by large margins . )
The DoE uses national power grid averages ( 50 % coal , 20 % gas , 20 % nuke , 9 % Hyrdo , 1 % other renewable . )
Some of the power grids are much more renewable ( more hydro ) and others are much more fossil oriented .
In the renewable - heavy grids , the electric train / trolley bus figures are better , and involve less pollution .
In a comparison with electric cars and scooters to electric trains , the electricity source will be the same , and the scooters win handily .
However , again , arguments about 10 % there and 20 % here do n't alter the basic issue , which is we perceive transit as being much better than cars , several times better .
I 've seen no modifications of the numbers that make transit as efficient as we commonly perceived it to be .
Transit users , studies show , travel less than car users .
Some people decide to live nearer work on transit lines .
They shop somewhere close on the transit line , not a remote mall .
They tend to have a lower income demographic .
It may seem twisted , but because of transit 's convenience and speed issues , people are willing to , and do , drive further in cars .
Transit use , of course , is also concentrated naturally in areas of higher urban density , where trips can be shorter , and transit 's no - need - to - park benefit shines .
It is an interesting question as to whether the use of high efficiency lightweight vehicles ( electric or gas ) instead of transit would alter the equation .
It is also often advanced that the combination of high urband density together with good transit results in shorter trips , more walking and more riders on the transit .
This is indeed what happens in many of the cities where transit is more efficient , such as those of Asia and Europe .
Debate centers around whether this can be duplicated in younger areas like the USA , and how much urban planning fiat is workable or advisable .
This consideration does not modify the situation in today 's cities , but may affect planning decisions over decades .
So how to be green ?
It seems that often in transit there is a marked disconnect between views of what people should do and what they actually do .
U.S. transit systems show these terrible numbers because they have not been able to build the riderships that would make them green .
That 's a hard fact , though it may change somewhat as gas prices go through the roof .
Transit fares are highly subsidized .
It 's not uncommon for a $ 1.50 transit ticket to offer a ride that costs the agency 3 - 4 times as much to provide .
( In U.S. big cities , on average subsidies pay for 44 % of rail cost and 69 % of bus cost .
Suburban buses can see almost 90 % . )
Cars are also subsidized via roads ( which also provide subsidy to buses , trucks and street cars ) and via free parking and forced parking construction requirements .
To the extent that roads are funded by gasoline taxes -- which varies from place to place -- this is not a subsidy so much as a user fee .
I say this not to justify any of the subsidies , but to say it makes it hard to judge the true cost .
My first conclusion is that we would get more efficient by pushing small , fuel efficient vehicles instead of pushing transit , and at a lower cost .
Scooters , which are very popular almost everywhere outside the US where they pay much more for fuel , are much more efficient , and would beat transit just about every time .
They are not as safe , however .
Moving more people out of SUVs and trucks into highly efficient cars ( either hybrid or classic ) would also do much more for the environment than transit would .
Next we should do more to encourage carpooling , possibly promoting systems for computerized rideshare .
I 've seen proposals to replace bus lines with computerized systems to coordinate electronic - thumb hitchhiking , though safety remains a concern in some areas .
Every road has tons of spare capacity whizzing by all the time .
( Sadly , the taxi monopolies would fight this . )
Transit can be made greener , reversing the trend of poorer efficiency .
Unfortunately transit budgets are planned on decade scales , and vehicles are slow to be replaced .
Smaller , lighter vehicles with fewer stops would help .
Replacing large vehicles at off - peak times with computer coordinated jitney service could also help .
Unfortuantely , since transit is only 1 % of total USA transportation energy use , it does n't matter a great deal how efficient it is .
Making it twice as good , or twice as bad , would not significantly alter the energy total .
Getting rid of the most inefficient coal plants ( that take over 15,000 BTU / kwh ) would help everywhere , including transit .
Do n't Europe and Asia do better ?
Much better .
This Australian Study cites figures saying that Western Europeans use only 76 % of U.S. BTUs / pm in their private transport , and only 38 % in their transit -- 2.5 times more efficient .
Rich Asians do even better at transit -- they are almost 4 times as efficient in terms of energy / passenger - mile .
Their private transport is better because they own a lot more motorcycles and scooters , as well as smaller cars .
Asians do almost 10 x as many miles in motorcyles as Americans .
Their transit is better primarily because of ridership .
They take 5 to 7 times as many transit trips per person .
Asian transit actually attains a higher average speed than private travel , another big booster .
They also have much more efficient vehicles .
Note however that in spite of their much higher ridership , transit in Europe is still only 7 % of private vehicle energy use , and I would guess about 5 % of total compared to ~ 1 % of total for the USA .
Even they have the automobile bug pretty strongly .
Why the myth ?
I suspect that you , like me , were very surprised to see these numbers .
If they 're correct , why do we keep hearing transit advocated as the green solution ?
Light ( Capacity ) Rail Energy Efficiency
Not everybody is aware of these numbers , so not everybody is being disingenuous .
But some people do know them .
I doubt they are all malicious ; some just " want to believe " so much that they turn a blind eye to actual ridership and cost numbers .
They " know " that transit is greener and do n't even question it .
Some may simply hope that transit is on the verge of a breakthrough , to get riderships like those seen in foreign transit - oriented cities .
Some are the sort who think transit is the perfect choice for everybody else .
It should be noted that even New York , the most transit - using city in the USA , clocks in at 2,700 BTUs / p-m for its subway and 3,300 for the average of all its transit systems combined -- only slightly better than cars .
To be fair , some people dispute the numbers and promote different methodologies for calculation of energy efficiency .
I am always interested in unbiased sources for convincing new numbers .
You will also see that some transit -- typically the well run and high - use commuter rail systems -- are greener than cars .
But only modestly , and often not if considered together with " feeder " bus systems .
Not the major green win we 've come to believe in .
And none are as efficient as electric cars and hybrids with a 1.5 passenger average occupancy .
Indeed , I expect I 'll get some angry responses for saying that transit is n't green .
I 've seen others say this message and their motives are usually called into question , both when they have a bias and when they do n't .
Many have other reasons to boost transit beyond energy efficiency .
And transit does have many benefits , but in today 's CO 2 aware world , the green story has become the main story .
These numbers are debatable Certainly the exact calculation of fuel to wheels and well to wheels efficiency numbers always generates a lot of debate , and there is merit to the various arguments .
However , I want to step back from arguments which alter the numbers by modest factors like 20 % .
That 's because the common perception -- it was certainly mine -- was that transit was much greener than the car .
That while the Prius driver might be admired , transit was the real green answer .
Number tweaks are worth researching but do n't change the core premise here -- that the values of cars and transit in the USA are not far apart .
Since we need to cut energy use and emissions by severalfold , modest gains do n't cut it .
Transit does much more than ( not ) save energy
This issue is complex because we like transit for other reasons .
( Indeed , since it 's not green , these are its real sources of value . )
It provides cheap transportation to those who can't drive or can't afford to , like children , the elderly and the homeless .
It helps to reduce congestion at rush hour , if done right .
( Indeed , it may be argued that without transit , roads could never handle the commuter loads in many areas , and would get more inefficient due to heavier congestion . )
It reduces the need for parking and allows efficient one - way trips .
And it enforces certain patterns on our cities , reinforcing neighbourhoods in ways we both like and do n't like .
It 's generally safer ( against accidents ) than car travel , and more often electric , which moves pollution out of cities and over to power plants .
You can often get work done on trains , and reading done when a passenger in most vehicles .
As you 'll learn in my essay , I believe the future will offer " robocars " -- self driving cars -- which offer all the advantages we seek from transit , and then some .
Unlike transit , however , the robocars will be considerably greener than today 's ordinary cars .
This may even fortell an end for traditional transit .
Of course transit also has many downsides , and these keep people loving their cars .
Outside the USA , lower wealth , higher fuel costs and different ethics make transit more successful , but inside , this just is n't the case .
Transit also is n't cheap .
New transit lines , especially ones needing private right - of - way are hugely expensive , and need massive riderships to justify themselves .
One might argue that all this is moot .
Because transit is not a success in the USA , its effect on energy consumption is minor .
Mass transit ( not counting airlines ) consumes only about 1 % of the total transportation energy pie .
( That 's 1/ 3 of what is used simply running the pipelines that deliver fuel , mostly not for transit !
It 's similar to the number for recreational boating . )
Notes
Some people reading this have asked , " what 's my agenda ? "
Largely it 's energy efficient transportation that people actually want to take .
In 32 years since my first job , I 've only spent about 3 summers as a full time car commuter , 14 years work - at - home and the rest either train commute or mixed bike and car commute , though mostly car in the winter .
This article was originally written using the 2007 Data Book and has been updated to use figures from the 2009 Data Book .
Some numbers , notably light rail and bus ones , took major swings .
The rail numbers present some contradictory information , in that it cites a total rail average of 2600 , but a light rail average of 7600 and a heavy rail average of 3700 .
While commuter rail and Amtrak are better , this should not be enough to swing the average so far so I seek more source data .
Chart as Miles Per Gallon
While energy efficiency is best viewed in terms of fuel / mile , most Americans measure cars in terms of miles per gallon .
This chart shows the energy use of the various transit modes in passenger miles per gallon of gasoline , or rather the appropriate fuel equivalent of a gallon of gas .
( Note that electric vehicles really run on 50 % coal , 18 % natural gas , 20 % nuclear and some renewables , mostly hydro . )
U.S. Transit Energy in Passenger Miles per Gallon
The electric scooter or tricycle is off the chart , at a whopping 350 MPG .
Small , streamlined lightweight vehicles not meant to go much more than 30 - 40 mph can really be a lot more efficient that anything else .
Amazingly , only 1 % of the energy in a typical car goes to moving the driver , and transit is n't doing much better , so there 's a lot of room for improvement .
Note that this is based on one of the best electric trikes you can get today .
The average electric scooter , while still very good , is only about half as good as the best .

An ice avalanche on K - 2 , the world 's second highest mountain , may have claimed several climbers ' lives .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( AP ) 
At least nine mountaineers are feared to have died on the world 's second - highest mountain , K - 2 , including at least six who were struck by an avalanche as they were descending from the summit , officials said Sunday .
Three other climbers reportedly died in separate incidents over the weekend on K - 2 in northern Pakistan , which is regarded as more difficult to climb than Mount Everest , the world 's highest peak .
A total of 22 climbers , mostly foreigners , from eight different expeditions reached K - 2's summit on Saturday .
They were struck by an ice avalanche about 1,148 feet below the peak on their way down , said Nazir Sabir , whose Alpine Club of Pakistan organized a Serbian expedition on the mountain .
He said seven people are feared to have died and three others were missing in the avalanche .
However , Mohammed Akram , vice president of the Adventure Foundation of Pakistan , a nonprofit organization , said six climbers died when they were hit by the " ice cornice " crashing off an overhang , and that a South Korean climber had died a day earlier from an undetermined cause .
Sabir initially reported that nine people had died in the avalanche , but later said two climbers — a Pakistani and a Serbian , whose expedition he helped organize — had fallen to their deaths a day before .
It was not immediately possible to reconcile the differing tolls given by Akram and Sabir .
A military - run helicopter service , Askari Aviation , which helps rescue climbers at high altitudes , had no information on any deaths on K - 2 .
It said an Irish climber , who was not identified , was also missing on the mountain .
Akram said five climbers of a separate Dutch - led expedition were missing .
Agostino Da Polenza of Everest - K2 - CNR , an Italian - based high - altitude scientific research group , confirmed to Sky Tg24 TV that nine are feared dead and four remained missing .
K - 2 is 28,250 feet high , about 785 feet less than Mount Everest .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A top Russian general on Friday said Poland ’s deal with the United States to set up parts of a missile defense shield on Polish territory lays it open to a possible military strike , a Russian news agency reported .
Col - General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn , deputy chief of the general staff , told Interfax that Russian military doctrine would allow for a possible nuclear strike .
Poland agreed on Thursday to host elements of a U.S. global anti-missile system after Washington agreed to boost Poland ’s own military air defenses .
“ The USA is engaged in an anti-missile defense for its own government , and not for Poland .
And Poland , in deploying ( elements of the system ) opens itself to a military strike .
That is 100 percent , ” Interfax quoted Nogovitsyn as saying .
Nogovitsyn said Russia allows nuclear weapons to be used in circumstances defined by its current security doctrine .
The Russian government revamped its national security doctrine in 2000 , broadening the range of conflicts in which nuclear weapons could be used .
“ It is written clearly :
We will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons ; against allies of countries with nuclear weapons , if they somehow enable them , ” he said .

Washington says the missile system is aimed at protecting the United States and its allies from long - range missiles that could in the future be fired by Iran or groups such as al Qaeda .
The Kremlin has long said that was untrue , and has opposed the shield as a threat to Russia .
The 10 interceptor missiles to be based at a site in northern Poland compare with Russia ’s own nuclear arsenal of more than 5,000 ballistic warheads .
In agreeing to deploy elements of the U.S. missile shield , Poland “ becomes an actionable object .
Those targets are destroyed in the first order , ” Nogovitsyn said .
Tension between Moscow and Washington has risen in the past week , since Georgia ’s attempt to re-take its separatist region of South Ossetia by force provoked a massive counter - attack by Russia .

The mainstream American corporate press has once again proven itself to be no better than the state controlled media in places like Communist China or Zimbabwe , by steadfastly refusing to print even a mention of the huge story concerning veteran journalist Seymour Hersh ’s recent comments that the vice president wanted to carry out a false flag operation to provoke a war with Iran .
The outright complicity of the corporate media in blackballing this story reminds us how the neocon cabal in the White House has consistently been able to conspire , lie and twist the truth for its own ill gotten gains without facing any substantial public scrutiny .
As we reported Thursday , Pulitzer - Prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh revealed how the neocons convened around Dick Cheney and brainstormed ways to kick off World War IV .
“ There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war , ” Hersh explained .
“ The one that interested me the most was why do n’t we build — we in our shipyard — build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats .
Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms .
And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz , start a shoot - up . ”
Given that only a few weeks ago Hersh ’s exclusive story concerning the vamping up of covert U.S. military activity inside Iran made headlines everywhere , in every major publication and outlet , it begs the question where are they now for an even bigger story ?
The Financial Times even carries a story today about how Hersh is “ The Last Great American Reporter ” , yet the lengthy piece contains no mention of his latest revelations .
Furthermore , Hersh himself is not a wholly innocent party in the media blackout on this , given that he has admitted to having more details of similar incidents and meetings that have been leaked to him by White House insiders , and has opted to keep them out of print .
The corporate media has once again proven that it is loathe to divulge the key information that Cheney and many other Neo - Cons are in effect not just yearning for , but openly calling for more terror and more war and are willing to fake and engineer major events in order to see it happen – a point which is especially prescient when one accepts that 9/11 was a self - inflicted wound .
The attention and outrage that this story should have created could have been enough to stave off an attack on Iran and the ever increasing slide towards another unneccessary and illegal war , a war that would surely be the final catalyst in an already burgeoning domestic and global economic meltdown .
The outright complicity of the corporate media in blackballing this story reminds us how the neocon cabal in the White House has consistently been able to conspire , lie and twist the truth for its own ill gotten gains without facing any substantial public scrutiny .
We will not cease in our efforts to turn this into a massive story but we need your support .
Get the story and e mail it out to every newspaper , newswire and TV news station in existence .
The media ’s unwillingness to cover this issue only deepens the abyss that they find themselves in .
Their reaction speaks volumes about how they are conditioned and in many cases ordered to shy away from these kind of stories .
Newspaper readership and TV news viewership is plummeting as people flock to the alternative media because the mainstream ’s credibility lies in tatters as it repeatedly lies by omission and covers - up for its government handlers .

It was a croquette of pig's head that finally forced me to recognise the threat posed by the blogosphere .
It was served at the Westerly , a restaurant in Reigate , Surrey , in April last year .
I knew nothing of the place , or its chef , but I had a copy of the menu , and it was full of things I like to eat : Jerusalem artichokes and wild garlic , snails and pigeon and Amalfi lemons .
It had the potential to be everything a newspaper restaurant critic dreams of - a genuine find outside London , serving terrific food at a reasonable price .
It was all that and more .
I was n't the only one who thought so .
My companion agreed .
Simon Majumdar , a one - time publishing executive , is a food blogger .
We had met on internet food discussion boards , which he had left behind in favour of his blog , Dos Hermanos , so named because he writes it with his brother , Robin .
It is their account of eating out across the world .
A restaurant critic needs a companion , and Simon had regularly been mine .
We both adored the gazpacho and the rillette , the lamb with its butter - rich mashed potato and the sorbet made with Amalfi lemons .
And of course we loved the pig's head croquette with sauce gribiche , for we are both men with a taste for the cheaper cuts .
At the end I asked for a copy of the menu , paid the bill and we went home .
Within two hours of getting back to my desk , Simon 's review was online .
He did not explain why he had been there .
He did describe it as his best meal of the year so far .
My eye strayed to his mention of the pig's head , with mounting panic : ' a large disc of head meat fried perfectly in crumbs to a crisp coating which when punctured gave off a steamy aroma of pork ' .
Spot on .
Simon might not have been paid for it , but he is a good writer .
And a lot of people would read him .
Granted , not as many as read The Observer .
Even today , with the cult of the Dos Hermanos blog fully developed , it rarely gets more than 7,000 readers a week .
The problem was that his readers would be opinion formers : not just chefs , restaurateurs and food journalists but other hardcore restaurant goers .
And when my review was printed almost three weeks later they would all assume I was the one who had taken my lead from Simon rather than the other way round ; that the real finds were being made by the amateurs .
The blogger had beaten me into print .
I had no choice .
I called Simon and asked him to take down his post until my version had appeared .
Ever the gentleman , he agreed .
From that point on I concluded I could no longer view the blogosphere as source material or even mere displacement activity .
Now it was the competition .
It could be worse .
At least those of us in Britain who make our living from our opinions are still gainfully employed .
Across America it 's a different story .
Paid newspaper critics from a number of disciplines are being laid off or redeployed , their judgment deemed superfluous to requirements in the age of the net .
Book review pages are becoming increasingly skinny .
Television sections are disappearing .
In April , Sean Means , the film critic of the Salt Lake Tribune in Utah , used his blog to publish a roll call of his movie - reviewing colleagues who , since the spring of 2006 , were no longer in the opinion business : ' Steve Ramos , Cincinnati CityBeat , position eliminated ...
Jami Bernard , New York Daily News , contract not renewed ... Michael Atkinson , Village Voice , laid off ...'
At that point it ran to 28 names across the US media but since then it has stretched inexorably on .
Others soon started taking notice , with both the entertainment industry journal Variety and the Los Angeles Times publishing large pieces on the death of the critic .
As Patrick Goldstein put it in the LA Times : ' Critics are being downsized all over the place , whether it's in classical music , dance , theatre or other areas of the arts .
While economics are clearly at work here - seeing their business model crumble , many newspapers simply have decided they can't afford a full range of critics any more - it seems clear we 're in an age with a very different approach to the role of criticism . '
It appears that consumers no longer feel the need to obtain their opinions from on high : the authority of the critic , derived from their paid position on a newspaper , is diminished .
Opinion has been democratised .
In the movie world two sites are credited with decimating the profession .
Ironically , Rotten Tomatoes , founded in August 1998 , was designed to give readers access to the opinions of a bunch of critics .
If 60 per cent or more of the reviews are good , the film gets a fresh rating ; fewer than 60 per cent and it 's rotten .
The site became so popular that in 2004 it was bought by IGN Entertainment which , in turn , was bought by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp ( which , as a newspaper publisher , also pays critics ) .
Metacritic , launched in January 2001 , also combines reviews but across various media and arts , including films , video games and books .
It too became so successful it was bought out , by CNET networks .
Since then , blogs , written by unpaid enthusiasts , have proliferated to such a degree that in some areas of the arts their writers are being courted by the PR machine .
The old media have , predictably , been outraged .
After all , their jobs are on the line .
' People who make these decisions , ' says Sean Means of the host of sackings , ' get it into their heads that people who want to read about new movies have lots of places to do so , from fan sites , through blogs to critical aggregators , but they are being short - sighted .
The reason people buy newspapers is to hear that particular voice . '
So is he saying that the opinions expressed for free on blogs are not of value ?
Not necessarily , he says .
' The truth is , though , that there are very few amateurs who are better than professionals .
If you really are good at it you figure out some way to get paid for it .
At the risk of sounding elitist , everyone has an opinion , but not everyone has an informed opinion . '
The advent of the net has been described as a revolution .
If so , one of its most heated battles is being fought over the right to claim expertise .
In the US the ancien régime , in this case the salaried critic , appears to be in retreat .
The question is what will happen here ?
We need only look at television criticism , a once - noble calling pursued for this newspaper by both Julian Barnes and Clive James , for clues .
In May the Daily Telegraph decided it no longer needed a daily TV review .
Regular TV reviews have also gone at the Daily Mail , Mail on Sunday and London 's Evening Standard .
Could the same happen to other arts ?
The British critical tradition is long and rich and deep : from the pamphleteering of Joseph Addison and Richard Steele in the early 18th century , through the literary criticism of Oscar Wilde in the 19th to Graham Greene 's film reviews and Kenneth Tynan 's first - night theatre notices in the 20th , we have never been short of confident people to tell us what is good and what is not and why .
' We have a wonderful tradition of criticism in this country , ' says Brian Sewell , art critic of the Evening Standard for nearly 25 years , ' and it would be a tragedy if we lost it .
The onlooker sees most .
We are the skilled onlookers . '
But in a globalised world where something posted on the net in Chicago one minute is read in London the next , no trend is ever localised .
So how web - savvy are Britain 's crew of professional opinion - peddlers ?
Are they ready to take on the challenge from the ones who do it for free ?
There 's only one way to find out : ask them .
So we assembled a collection of Britain 's longest - serving and most distinguished paid critics who , between them , have more than two centuries ' experience in telling us what they think , and sought their opinions .
It 's what they 're for .
Andrew and Phil have lots of opinions too , and tonight I 'm hoping to hear some of them .
It is a warm evening in Waterloo and we are at the Young Vic for a preview performance of Berthold Brecht 's The Good Soul of Szechuan , starring Jane Horrocks , a gritty little number full of cement dust , exploitation of the workers , prostitution and discordant , irritatingly Brechtian songs .
Of course , paid newspaper critics do not review productions on previews , but Andrew and Phil - they insist on first names only , to maintain the web - enhanced ' mystique ' - are not paid by anybody .
They write a blog called the West End Whingers , which they set up in June 2006 after sitting through what they regarded as an appalling production of Sam Shepard 's Fool For Love , starring Juliette Lewis .
Both middle - aged , long - time theatregoers , they were fed up with each other 's whingeing so , as they explain on the blog , they ' decided to whinge at the world instead ' .
Their reviews , written under one voice , are sharp and irreverent in a mannered , high camp sort of way .
Their destruction of Michael Frayn's Afterlife at the National Theatre , written for the most part as a play about the imagined receipt of the script , is laugh - out - loud funny - and a damn sight more enjoyable than the hand - wringing from some of the paid critics when they held forth over what was agreed to be a sub- standard work by the revered playwright .
( ' [ Frayn's ] deliberately repeated bits over and over again , ' they imagine National director Nicholas Hytner howling , ' I knew I should n't have given him a word count .
It 's the oldest trick in the book . ')
As we wait for The Good Soul to start I ask them if they feel they have a responsibility to anybody .
( As with the no-surnames rule they also insist on being interviewed as one person , while telling you that they have never been a couple . )
' We 're only here for our own amusement , ' they say .
' We have no obligation to sit through it on behalf of our readers . '
Walking out of plays is a speciality of the West End Whingers .
If they do n't like it , they leave .
After all , their tickets are n't free .
They have paid for almost every one , bar those for Swimming With Sharks starring Christian Slater .
' We did n't care for it and we said as much .
We have n't been invited back to the West End since . '
Their beautifully described midway departure from an early preview of the epoch - long Gone With The Wind was , according to a number of people in the theatre world , the first sign that all was not well with the musical .
So do they think the mainstream critics have a role ?
' Oh yes .
Someone has to stay until the curtain to see what happens at the end . '
Would they like to be paid for what they do ?
' I think if we were paid it would mean we would have to play the game , which would be boring . '
They also have no desire to work for a newspaper .
' Endure the theatre without alcohol ?
Locate things in the wider discourse ?
No. we have no aspirations in that direction . '
There is quite a lot of alcohol tonight : before , during and after as the whingers and their entourage - me , other bloggers , a few friends of friends - settle in to enjoy themselves .
Their review , when it is posted a couple of days later , seems to reflect a good night out .
' Horrocks was great and there were many other performances to enjoy , too , ' they wrote .
' In fact there were oodles of things to write down : great wigs , a lot of cigarette smoking , rain , wonderful props and signage ...'
So no , not exactly a first - night crit of the sort Kenneth Tynan might admire .
But - whisper it - it did quietly remind me more of the night I 'd had than did the professional reviews I would later read .
Which is all well and good , says Charles Spencer , a theatre reviewer for the Daily Telegraph since 1991 .
But that does n't mean we should mistake what the West End Whingers do for criticism .
( Which , for the record , they never claim it to be ) .
' I do n't think they 're very helpful , ' Spencer says .
' Mildly entertaining , I suppose , but that brand of camp humour does n't do it for me .
They 're not really critics .
The last thing of theirs I read was them whingeing about squeaky seats at the Old Vic . '
Then again , Spencer admits to being a bit of a web - refusenik .
' I look at Wikipedia now and then but until a year ago I had n't looked at the web at all . '
Indeed it would be easy to portray many of our leading critics as a bunch of silver - backed elders of the tribe , caught on the hop by technological change .
Of course , just because it 's easy does n't mean it 's the wrong thing to do .
Gillian Reynolds , who has been writing superbly about radio since 1967 , and for the Telegraph since 1975 , admits she has little time for opinions on the web .
' I just do n't want to hang around with company I do n't value .
Life 's too short . '
Clement Crisp , who has been writing about dance for the Financial Times for more than 35 years , and for whom the word ' venerable ' might have been invented , is succinct about it : ' I do n't really understand the beastly internet . '
This is not to suggest that Crisp dismisses what bloggers are doing .
' The people who are writing these reviews are absolutely splendid , ' he says , letting the last word sing for slightly longer than the other nine put together .
' They are devoted ballet fans .
But it has nothing to do with criticism . '
The point , he says , is that the true critic can draw on a well of experience .
' I started going to the ballet as a child in 1943 , and for the next 20 years I saw everything there was - the creation of the great new companies , the arrival of the Russian , the Danes ...'
Only then did he begin to write .
Spencer agrees .
' You 're supplying a service , one with real authority behind it .
There is always going to be a need for expert opinion . '
Do n't even mention the need for the democratisation of opinion to Brian Sewell .
' I do not believe in the democratisation of opinion .
I believe in benign authority .
And if we undermine the authority of critics then we shall descend into mayhem . '
Our own Philip French , film critic for The Observer for 30 years , is a little more accepting of the challenge from the bloggers .
' People should have the right to express their opinions .
The right to free speech has been extended , but you do n't have to be elitist to say that not all opinion is of equal value .
There is good criticism and there is bad criticism .
The risk is that bad criticism will drive good criticism out of business by sheer volume . '
Michael Billington , the Guardian 's theatre man for more than 35 years , allows that there is a new accommodation to be made .
Then again , he works for the publishers of this newspaper which , historically , has embraced the online world with more enthusiasm than others .
He has been forced to join the debate on the web .
His first piece for Guardian Unlimited ( now theguardian.com ) was about The Sultan 's Elephant , a public art installation involving a huge mechanical pachyderm striding through London in 2006 .
' I wrote a piece attacking it and got hundreds of comments .
They clobbered me .
I was n't used to getting such a response . '
It was a wake - up call .
' I was suddenly aware that there was an army of people with opinions as strong as mine .
Journalists of my generation have to adapt .
And we have to accept that the printed word no longer has aristocratic supremacy . '
Of course , some newspaper critics are living the digital life to the full .
Both Mark Shenton , drama critic of the Sunday Express , and Ian Shuttleworth , of the Financial Times , either blog or weigh in on other blogs .
Norman Lebrecht , arts columnist of the Evening Standard , has long written a blog for artsjournal.com and is an avid consumer of online opinion .
' What I see out there is quite a mixture .
A lot of it is amateurish in a good sense .
But I do miss incisiveness , people delivering real information and knowledge . '
He also counsels his brethren to think twice before wading in to online discussions .
' One has to be very careful of making any comment .
Bloggers are as sensitive as any diva .
Criticise them and they will attack you .'
Sometimes they will attack without any encouragement .
Gareth James is a freelance management consultant who has been writing reviews at whatsonstage.com for six years .
There is , he argues , a shift in power towards the consumer .
' I simply started disagreeing with the critics , ' he says .
' They are out of step with the audience and that 's because they do it all the time .
Most people go to be entertained .
We go to have a good night out . '
Critics , he thinks , go for something else .
It 's why he believes they write enthusiastically about the works of Pinter or Chekhov which , for the most part , he can't abide .
' That sort of thing is put on for the Michael Billingtons of this world , not for Gareth James . '
It was a similar sense of disconnection that got Lynne Hatwell writing her book blog , Dove Grey Reader .
A community nurse with a major reading habit , who lives in the Tamar Valley on the border of Devon and Cornwall , she increasingly felt the books pages of national newspapers had nothing to offer her .
' I had this feeling there was a literary feast going on in London but that I was not a part of it .
I also did n't feel I was being well served by the bookshops , that I had become a puppet of their three - for - two tables .
I wanted to know how you find other stuff . '
Now , according to her ' what I 'm reading ' panel , she is working her way through Trauma by Patrick McGrath , Trying to Please by John Julius Norwich and , er , my latest one .
Hell , the woman 's far too influential for me to let that opportunity pass me by .
She declares that she is not a literary critic or reviewer .
She writes about what books mean to her .
' There 's nothing objective about what I 'm doing .
I used to worry about whether what I felt about a book was the same as anybody else . '
Not any more .
' I feel a responsibility to myself , to be transparent and honest , but also to the readers because there are some who now compile their reading lists solely from my recommendations . '
Is she posing a challenge to the books pages of national newspapers ?
' Absolutely , and one that was long overdue .
For too long it was a closed shop . '
But , she says , the project was personal .
In the first year she spent more than £ 2,000 on books .
But publishers set up Google alerts , which mop up any mentions of their titles online .
Soon she was receiving emails offering to supply her with details of new publications .
She now gets nearly all the catalogues and free review copies of books from most publishers ( except , curiously , Virago , which ignores her - but probably wo n't after reading this ) .
' I 've realised that I could be used as a marketing tool , and I have to resist that .
A fundamental rule is that reading still has to be a pleasure . '
Also , she does n't do bad reviews .
If it 's on her site it 's because she likes it .
' It 's about my emotional responses . '
Other sources of critical opinion have risen up online , their creators say , because the old media was n't able to handle them .
Steve Bennett created chortle .co.uk , an online stand - up comedy fanzine , because there was not enough coverage in the press .
' Even the mags that dedicated space to comedy did n't give it much space . '
Everybody did Ricky Gervais on tour .
Everybody did Bill Bailey and Lee Evans .
Nobody did the smaller names .
' To do a print version of Chortle would be very expensive whereas an internet start - up is cheap . '
Naturally , comedy publicists take notice of chortle , but it 's in film where the real PR action is .
Jam , a digital marketing agency , targets bloggers .
For Daniel Noy , an executive with the company , utilising their power is a no-brainer .
' Bloggers are important because of the way the internet started .
It 's a community , which means there 's a community of film fans online . '
The challenge , he argues , is to know how to use them .
' There 's a wariness about bloggers , a sense that you can't control them .
Personally I do n't think that you should control them .
Reactions can be good or bad .
It 's a risk you have to take , and that 's the power of real conversation . '
Jam has begun blogger - only screenings , starting with Juno .
' It helped that Diablo Cody , Juno 's screenwriter , was a blogger . '
But the digital marketers have to be honest .
Back in 1999 , the Jurassic age in web terms , Warner Brothers wanted to hold a test screening for the Will Smith movie Wild Wild West to build buzz on the net , but was so unsure of the film that it told the invited audience of online critics that they were going to watch The Matrix .
The audience was furious and helped create the negativity around it that never dissipated .
' They posted comments slagging it off and it did very badly . '
So does Noy think newspaper critics are now redundant ?
Not yet .
' You can't deny the readership of newspaper and magazines . '
Chortle 's Bennett agrees .
' A lot of newspaper critics have got the job because they both know what they are talking about and can write , ' he says .
' Where as a lot of bloggers may only fill one side of that equation . '
I wondered if my sometime dining companion Simon Majumdar agreed .
When his last employer went bust he decided to explore the world 's eating opportunities .
He came up with an idea for a book , Eat My Globe , which is out next year .
He is now a paid food writer .
Does he think the democratisation of opinion is a good thing ?
' You can get as many opinions as there are arseholes .
Everyone 's got one .
There are some good writers out on the web .
Then there are some who should n't be allowed to write an address on the front of an envelope . '
So the professionals still have a role ?
' I like reading you all but I do n't think any of you necessarily know more about food than I do .
I read you for entertainment .
If you 're not entertaining , however informative you are , there 's no reason for you existing . '
In short , he says , we can claim authority only by being good .
Finally , I alight on the killer question .
Simon , would you like my job ?
' If I had the opportunity to take your job away from you , ' he says , 'yes , I would . '
That is a reassuring vote of confidence in old media .
More reassuringly , there is n't a vacancy .
At least for now .

Update 8 : by James Hamilton .
James summarizing some latency info from Steve Souder , Greg Linden , and Marissa Mayer .
Speed [ is ] an undervalued and under - discussed asset on the web .
Update 7 : How do you know when you need more memcache servers ?.
Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache not to scale , but to reduce latency and reduce I / O spikes , and how to use stats to know when more servers are needed .
Update 6 : Stock Traders Find Speed Pays , in Milliseconds .
Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a 500 millisecond trading advantage .
Yes , latency matters .
As an interesting aside , Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs .
Update 5 : Shopzilla 's Site Redo - You Get What You Measure .
At the Velocity conference Phil Dixon , from Shopzilla , presented data showing a 5 second speed up resulted in a 25 % increase in page views , a 10 % increase in revenue , a 50 % reduction in hardware , and a 120 % increase traffic from Google .
Built a new service oriented Java based stack .
Keep it simple .
Quality is a design decision .
Obsessively easure everything .
Used agile and built the site one page at a time to get feedback .
Use proxies to incrementally expose users to new pages for A/B testing .
Oracle Coherence Grid for caching .
1.5 second page load SLA .
650 ms server side SLA .
Make 30 parallel calls on server .
100 million requests a day .
SLAs measure 95th percentile , averages not useful .
Little things make a big difference .
Update 4 : Slow Pages Lose Users .
At the Velocity Conference Jake Brutlag ( Google Search ) and Eric Schurman ( Microsoft Bing ) presented study data showing delays under half a second impact business metrics and delay costs increase over time and persist .
Page weight not key .
Progressive rendering helps a lot .
Update 3 : Nati Shalom 's
Take on this article .
Lots of good stuff on designing architectures for latency minimization .
Update 2 : Why Latency Lags Bandwidth , and What it Means to Computing by David Patterson .
Reasons : Moore 's
Law helps BW more than latency ; Distance limits latency ; Bandwidth easier to sell ; Latency help BW , but not vice versa ; Bandwidth hurts latency ; OS overhead hurts latency more than BW .
Three ways to cope : Caching , Replication , Prediction .
We have n't talked about prediction .
Games use prediction , i.e , project where a character will go , but it's not a strategy much used in websites .
Update : Efficient data transfer through zero copy .
Copying data kills .
This excellent article explains the path data takes through the OS and how to reduce the number of copies to the big zero .
Latency matters .
Amazon found every 100 ms of latency cost them 1 % in sales .
Google found an extra .5 seconds in search page generation time dropped traffic by 20 % .
A broker could lose $ 4 million in revenues per millisecond if their electronic trading platform is 5 milliseconds behind the competition .
The Amazon results were reported by Greg Linden in his presentation Make Data Useful .
In one of Greg 's slides Google VP Marissa Mayer , in reference to the Google results , is quoted as saying " Users really respond to speed . "
And everyone wants responsive users .
Ka-ching !
People hate waiting and they 're repulsed by seemingly small delays .
The less interactive a site becomes the more likely users are to click away and do something else .
Latency is the mother of interactivity .
Though it 's possible through various UI techniques to make pages subjectively feel faster , slow sites generally lead to higher customer defection rates , which lead to lower conversation rates , which results in lower sales .
Yet for some reason latency is n't a topic talked a lot about for web apps .
We talk a lot about about building high - capacity sites , but very little about how to build low - latency sites .
We apparently do so at the expense of our immortal bottom line .
I wondered if latency went to zero if sales would be infinite ?
But alas , as Dan Pritchett says , Latency Exists , Cope !.
So we can't hide the " latency problem " by appointing a Latency Czar to conduct a nice little war on latency .
Instead , we need to learn how to minimize and manage latency .
It turns out a lot of problems are better solved that way .
How do we recover that which is most meaningful - - sales -- and build low - latency systems ?
I 'm excited that the topic of latency came up .
There are a few good presentations on this topic I 've been dying for a chance to reference .
And latency is one of those quantifiable qualities that takes real engineering to create .
A lot of what we do is bolt together other people 's toys .
Building high - capacity low - latency system takes mad skills .
Which is fun .
And which may also account for why we see latency a core design skill in real - time and market trading type systems , but not web systems .
We certainly want our nuclear power plant plutonium fuel rod lowering hardware to respond to interrupts with sufficient alacrity .
While less serious , trading companies are always in a technological arms race to create lower latency systems .
He with the fastest system creates a sort of private wire for receiving and acting on information faster than everyone else .
Knowing who has the bestest price the firstest is a huge advantage .
But if our little shopping cart takes an extra 500 milliseconds to display , the world wo n't end .
Or will it ?
Latency Defined
My unsophisticated definition of latency is that it is the elapsed time between A and B where A and B are something you care about .
Low - latency and high - latency are relative terms .
The latency requirements for a femptosecond laser are far different than for mail delivery via the pony express , yet both systems can be characterized by latency .
A system has low - latency if it's low enough to meet requirements , otherwise it 's a high - latency system .
Latency Explained
The best explanation of latency I 've ever read is still It 's the Latency , Stupid by admitted network wizard Stuart Cheshire .
A wonderful and detailed rant explaining latency as it relates to network communication , but the ideas are applicable everywhere .
Stuart 's major point :
If you have a network link with low bandwidth then it's an easy matter of putting several in parallel to make a combined link with higher bandwidth , but if you have a network link with bad latency then no amount of money can turn any number of them into a link with good latency .
I like the parallel with sharding in this observation .
We put shards in parallel to increase capacity , but request latency through the system remains the same .
So if we want to increase interactivity we have to address every component in the system that introduces latency and minimize or remove it 's contribution .
There 's no " easy " scale - out strategy for fixing latency problems .
Sources of Latency
My parents told me latency was brought by Santa Clause in the dead of night , but that turns out not to be true !
So where does latency come from ?
Low Level Infrastructure .
Includes OS / Kernel , Processors / CPU's , Memory , Storage related I/O , and Network related I/O .
High Level Infrastructure .
Analysis of sources of latency in downloading web pages by Marc Abrams .
The study examines several sources of latency : DNS , TCP , Web server , network links , and routers .
Conclusion :
In most cases , roughly half of the time is spent from the moment the browser sends the acknowledgment completing the TCP connection establishment until the first packet containing page content arrives .
The bulk of this time is the round trip delay , and only a tiny portion is delay at the server .
This implies that the bottleneck in accessing pages over the Internet is due to the Internet itself , and not the server speed .
Software Processing .
Software processing accounts for much of the difficult to squeeze out latency in a system .
In very rough terms a 2.0 GHz microprocessor can execute a few hundred lines of code every microsecond .
Before a packet is delivered to an endpoint many thousands of instructions have probably already been executed .
Then the handling software will spend many thousands more processing the message and then sending a reply .
It all can add up to a substantial part of the latency budget .
Included in this category are support services like databases , search engines , etc .
Frontend .
80 - 90 % of the end - user response time is spent on the frontend , so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically rewriting the backend .
Service Dependency Latency .
Dependent components increase latency .
If component A calls compont B then the latency is the sum of the latency for each component and overall availability is reduced .
Propagation Latency .
The speed at which data travels through a link .
For fibre optic cable , the rate of signal propagation is roughly two - thirds the speed of light in vacuum .
Every 20 km takes about 100 microseconds of propagation latency .
To reduce latency your only choice is to reduce the distance between endpoints .
Transmission Latency .
The speed at which a data is transmitted on a communication link .
On a 1 Gbps network a 1000 bit packet takes about one millionth of a second to transmit .
It 's not dependent on distance .
To reduce latency you need a faster link .
Geographical Distribution .
BCP ( Business Continuity Planning ) requires running in multiple datacenters which means added WAN latency constraints .
Messaging Latency .
The folks at 29 west provide a great list forces that increase message latency : Intermediaries , Garbage Collection , Retransmissions , Reordering , Batching , CPU Scheduling , Socket Buffers , Network Queuing , Network Access Control , Serialization , Speed of Light .
Draw out the list of every hop a client request takes and the potential number of latency gremlins is quite impressive .
The Downsides of Latency Lower sales may be the terminal condition of latency problems , but the differential diagnosis is made of many and varied ailments .
As latency increases work stays queued at all levels of the system which puts stress everywhere .
It 's like dementia , the system forgets how to do anything .
Some of the problems you may see are : Queues grow ; Memory grows ;
Timeouts cascade ; Memory grows ;
Paging increases ; Retries cascade ; State machines reset ; Locks are held longer ;
Threads block ; Deadlock occurs ; Predictability declines ;
Throughput declines ; Messages drop ; Quality plummets .
For a better list take a look at The Many Flavors of System Latency .. along the Critical Path of Peak Performance by Todd Jobson .
A great analysis of the subject .
Managing Latency
The general algorithm for managing latency is :
Continually map , monitor , and characterize all sources of latency .
Remove and / or minimize all latency sources that are found .
Hardly a revelation , but it 's actually rare for applications to view their work flow in terms of latency .
This is part of the Log Everything All the Time mantra .
Time stamp every part of your system .
Look at mean latency , standard deviation , and outliers .
See if you can't make the mean a little nicer , pinch in that standard deviation , and chop off some of those spikes .
With latency variability is the name of the game , but that does n't mean that variability can't be better controlled and managed .
Target your latency slimming efforts where it matters the most and you get the most bang for your buck .
Next we will talk about various ideas for what you can do about latency once you 've found it .
Dan Pritchett 's Lessons for Managing Latency Dan Pritchett is one of the few who has openly written on architecting for latency .
Here are some of Dan 's suggestions for structuring systems to manage latency :
Loosely Couple Components .
Loose coupling has a number of benifits : Tightly coupled systems are impossible distribute across data centers , tightly couples systems fail together , and loosely coupled systems can be independently scaled and engineered for latency .
Use Asynchronous Interfaces .
Set an expectation of asynchronous behavior between components .
This allows you to add latency when you need to make changes .
Getting users on hooked on synchronous low - latency interactions does n't allow for architecture flexibility .
So start from the beginning with asynch semantics .
Horizontally Scale from the Start .
It 's very difficult to change a monolithic schema once you meet a scaling wall .
Start with a horizontal architecture so you do n't build in too many problems that will be hard to remove later .
Create an Active / Active Architecture .
Most approaches to BCP take an active / passive approach , only one data center is active at a time .
Creating an active / active system , where all data centers operate simultaneously allows users to be served from the closest data center which decreases latency .
Use a BASE ( basically available , soft state , eventually consistent ) Instead of ACID ( atomicity , consistency , isolation , durability ) Shared Storage Model .
BASE is derived from the CAP Theorem which is the highly counter intuitive notion that database services cannot ensure all three of the following properties at once : Consistency , Availability , Partition tolerance .
A BASE based system is more tolerant to latency because it is an inherently partitioned and loosely coupled architecture and it uses eventual consistency .
With eventual consistency you can make an update to one partition and return .
You do n't have to coordinate a transaction across multiple database servers , which makes a system have a higher and more variable latency .
Clearly each of these principles is a major topic all on their own .
For more details please read : Dan Pritchett has written a few excellent papers on managing latency : The Challenges of Latency , Architecting for Latency , Latency Exists , Cope !.
GigaSpaces Lessons for Lowering Latency GigsSpaces is an in -memory grid vendor and as such is on the vanguard of the RAM is the New Disk style of application building .
In this approach disk is pushed aside for keeping all data in RAM .
Following this line of logic GigaSpaces came up with these low latency architecture principles :
Co-location of the tiers ( logic , data , messaging , presentation ) on the same physical machine ( but with a shared - nothing architecture so that there is minimal communication between machines )
Co-location of services on the same machine
Maintaining data in memory ( caching )
Asynch communication to a persistent store and across geographical locations
The thinking is the primary source of latency in a system centers around accessing disk .
So skip the disk and keep everything in memory .
Very logical .
As memory is an order of magnitude faster than disk it 's hard to argue that latency in such a system would n't plummet .
Latency is minimized because objects are in kept memory and work requests are directed directly to the machine containing the already in - memory object .
The object implements the request behavior on the same machine .
There 's no pulling data from a disk .
There is n't even the hit of accessing a cache server .
And since all other object requests are also served from in - memory objects we 've minimized the Service Dependency Latency problem as well .
GigaSpaces is n't the only player in this market .
You might want to also take a look at : Scaleout Software , Grid Gain , Teracotta , GemStone , and Coherence .
We 'll have more on some of these products later .
Miscellaneous Latency Reduction Ideas
Cache .
No , really ?
Well it had to be said .
See A Bunch of Great Strategies for Using Memcached and MySQL Better Together .
Use a CDN .
No , really ?
See What CDN would you recommend ?.
Use a Caching Proxy Server .
At least this is a little less obvious .
See Strategy : Front S3 with a Caching Proxy .
Enhance Your Web Operations Capability .
There are plenty of available tools to help you pinpoint and correct operation related problems .
See Velocity Conference for more information .
Use Yslow to Make Your Pages Go. Yslow is a tool to show sources of latency on the client side and suggest ways to fix any problems found .
See Yslow to speed up your web pages .
Use an Edge DNS Accelerator .
This type of service " will ensure that a name server most accessible to the end user will pick up the request and respond . "
See Edge Acceleration Strategies : Akamai .
Optimize Virtual Machines .
People often forget VM 's exact a performance tax .
Virtualized I/O can suffer a substantial performance penalty .
See if it can't be tuned .
Use Ajax to minimize perceived latency to the user .
Clever UI design can make a site feel faster than it really is .
Use a faster network .
A high speed InfiniBand link can have an end - to end latency of about 1 microsecond .
Another option is a 10 GigE network .
Scale up .
Faster processors means less software induced latency .
Optimize firewalls .
An often hidden latency enhancer is your firewall system .
Use Small Memory Chunks When Using Java .
GC in Java kills latency .
One way to minimize the impact of garbage collection on latency is to use more VMs and less memory in each VM instead of VM with a lot of memory .
This prevents a large GC run and makes latency more predictable .
Use a TCP Offload Engine ( TOE ) .
TOE tech offloads the TCP / IP stack from the main CPU and puts it on the network controller .
This means network adapters can respond faster which means faster end - to - end communication .
Network adapters respond faster because bus wait time is reduced as the number of transactions across the system I /O bus and memory bus are reduced .
Design low latency network topoligies .
Phil Dykstra in Issues Impacting Gigabit Networks :
Why do n't most users experience high data rates ?
pinpoints poor network design as one major source of latency :
On a single high performance network today , measured latencies are typically ~ 1.5 x - 3 x that expected from the speed of light in fiber .
This is mostly due to taking longer than line - of - site paths .
Between different networks ( via NAPs ) latency is usually much worse .
Some extra distance is required , based on the availability of fiber routes and interconnects , but much more attention should be given to minimizing latency as we design our network topologies and routing .
Make TCP Faster .
FastTCP , for example , tweaks TCP to provide smoother and faster data delivery .
Copy Data Zero Times .
Efficient data transfer through zero copy .
Copying data kills .
This excellent article explains the path data takes through the OS and how to reduce the number of copies to the big zero .
Increase the speed of light .
Warp capability could really help speed up communication .
Get to work on that !
Application Server Architecture Matters Again
With the general move over the past few years to a standard shared nothing two - tierish architecture , discussion of application server architectures has become a neglected topic , mainly because there were n't application servers anymore .
Web requests came in , data was retrieved from the database , and results were calculated and returned to the user .
No application server .
The web server became the application server .
This was quite a change from previous architectures which were more application server oriented .
Though they were n't called application servers , they were call daemons or even just servers ( as in client - server ) .
Let 's say we buy into RAM is the New Disk .
This means we 'll have many persistent processes filled with many objects spread over many boxes .
A stream of requests are directed at each process and those requests must be executed in each process .
How should those processes be designed ?
Sure , having objects in memory reduces latency , but it 's very easy through poor programming practice to lose all of that advantage .
And then some .
Fortunately we have a ton of literature on how to structure servers .
I have a more thorough discussion here in Architecture Discussion .
Also take a look at SEDA , an architecture for highly concurrent servers and ACE , an OO network programming toolkit in C ++.
A few general suggestions :
Stop Serializing / Deserializing Messages .
It boggles my mind why we still serialize and deserialize messages .
Leave messages in a binary compressed format and decode only on access .
Very few activities waste more CPU and cause more lock contention through the memory library than does serialization .
Load Balance Across Read Replicas .
The more copies of objects you have the more work you can perform in parallel .
Consider keeping objects replicas for both high availability and high scalability .
This is the same strategy distributed file systems use handle more load .
It works in - memory as well .
Do n't Block .
The goal for a program is to use its whole CPU time quanta when it 's scheduled to run .
Do n't block .
Do n't give the processor back to the OS for someone else to get it .
Block for any reason and your performance tanks because not only do you incur the latency of the operation but there 's added rescheduling latency as well .
Who knows when your thread will get scheduled again ?
Minimize Paging .
Thrashing is when a system experiences excessive page faults .
More work is spent on moving memory around than is being given to tasks to perform real work .
It 's usually three orders of magnitude slower to access a page from disk instead of memory .
Unfortunately , memory managers in most languages make reducing paging difficult as you have no control over where memory is placed or how it us used .
With CPU speeds these days basically an operation is free when you are operating on paged - in memory .
Minimize / Remove locking .
Locks add latency and variability to a processing pipeline .
A lock is a blocking operation .
So you are choosing not to run when you have the CPU which means you incur a number of different forms of latency .
Select a server architecture that minimizes the need for locks .
Colocate Locating applications together reduces latency by reducing data hops .
The number and location of network hops a message has to travel through is a big part of the end - to - end latency of a system .
For example , from New York to the London Stock Exchange a round trip message takes 84 milliseconds to send , from Frankfurt it take 18 milliseconds , and from Tokyo it takes 208 milliseconds .
If you want to minimize latency then the clear strategy is to colocate your service in the London Stock Exchange .
Distance is minimized and you can probably use a faster network too .
Virtualization technology makes it easier than ever to compose separate systems together .
Add a cloud infrastructure to that and it becomes almost easy to dramatically lower latencies by colocating applications .
Minimize the Number of Hops Latency increases with each hop in a system .
The fewer hops the less latency .
So put those hops on a diet .
Some hop reducing ideas are :
Colocation .
Colocation is one hop reducing strategy .
It reduces the number of WAN links , routers , etc that a message has to go through .
If a router takes 400 microsecond for each packet , for example , getting rid of that router reduces latency .
Colocation also works for code and data , as in the GigaSpaces architecture .
They maintain a sharded in - memory object cache so an extra database hop is avoided when executing an operation .
Simplify Software Architecture .
Remove intermediate daemons , brokers and other latency adding components .
Dispatch work to where it will be processed as simply and fast as possible .
Peer - to - peer architectures and sharding approaches are good at this .
Avoid sending work into a hub for central dispatching .
Dispatch as far out at the edge as possible .
Open a New Datacenter .
Facebook opened a new datacenter on the east coast in order to save 70 milliseconds .
Build Your own Field - programmable Gate Array ( FPGA )
This one may seem a little off the wall , but creating your own custom FPGA may be a killer option for some problems .
A FPGA is a semiconductor device containing programmable logic .
Typical computer programs are a series of instructions that are loaded and interpreted by a general purpose microprocessor , like the one in your desk top computer .
Using a FPGA it 's possible to bypass the overhead of a general purpose microprocessor and code your application directly into silicon .
For some classes of problems the performance increases can be dramatic .
FPGAs are programmed with your task specific algorithm .
Usually something compute intensive like medical imaging , modeling bond yields , cryptography , and matching patterns for deep packet inspections .
I/ O heavy operations probably wo n't benefit from FPGAs .
Sure , the same algorithm could be run on a standard platform , but the advantage FPGAs have is even though they may run at a relatively low clock rates , FPGAs can perform many calculations in parallel .
So perhaps orders - of - magnitude more work is being performed each clock cycle .
Also , FPGAs often use content addressable memory which provides a significant speedup for indexing , searching , and matching operations .
We also may see a move to FPGAs because they use less power .
Stay lean and green .
In embedded projects FPGAs and ASICS ( application - specific integrated circuit ) are avoided like the plague .
If you can get by with an off - the - shelf microprocessors ( Intel , AMD , ARM , PPC , etc ) you do it .
It 's a time - to - market issue .
Standard microprocessors are , well , standard , so that makes them easy to work with .
Operating systems will already have board support packages for standard processors , which makes building a system faster and cheaper .
Once custom hardware is involved it becomes a lot of work to support the new chip in hardware and software .
Creating a software only solution is much more flexible in a world where constant change rules .
Hardware resists change .
So does software , but since people think it does n't we have to act like software is infinitely malleable .
Sometimes hardware is the way to go .
If you are building a NIC that has to process packets at line speed the chances are an off - the - shelf processor wo n't be cost effective and may not be fast enough .
Your typical high end graphics card , for example , is a marvel of engineering .
Graphics cards are so powerful these days distributed computation projects like [ email protected ] get a substantial amount of their processing power from graphics cards .
Traditional CPUs are creamed by NVIDIA GeForce GPUs which perform protein - folding simulations up to 140 times faster .
The downside is GPUs require very specialized programming , so it 's easier to write for a standard CPU and be done with it .
That same protein folding power can be available to your own applications .
ACTIV Financial , for example , uses a custom FGPA for low latency processing of high speed financial data flows .
ACTIV 's competitors use a traditional commodity box approach where financial data is processed by a large number of commodity servers .
Let 's say an application takes 12 servers .
Using a FPGA the number of servers can be collapsed down to one because more instructions are performed simultaneously which means fewer machines ar needed .
Using the FPGA architecture they process 20 times more messages than they did before and have reduced latency from one millisecond down to less than 100 microseconds .
Part of the performance improvement comes from the high speed main memory and network IO access FPGAs enjoy with the processor .
Both Intel and AMD make it relatively easy to connect FPGAs to their chips .
Using these mechanisms data moves back and forth between your processing engine and the main processor with minimal latency .
In a standard architecture all this communication and manipulation would happen over a network .
FPGAs are programmed using hardware description languages like Verilog and VHDL .
You can't get away from the hardware when programming FPGAs , which is a major bridge to cross for us software types .
Many moons ago I took a Verilog FPGA programming class .
It 's not easy , nothing is ever easy , but it is possible .
And for the right problem it might even be worth it .

Americans die in Iraq from ' electrocution , ' shocks reported by troops ' almost daily '
Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday July 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Among the seemingly innumerable scandal - worthy stories which have so marked the war in Iraq is one growing tragedy which has been largely ignored : shoddy electrical work by U.S. contractors at military bases leading to numerous electrical fires , troops receiving painful shocks , and even death by electrocution .
In January 2008 , Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth , a 24 - year - old weapons expert , was electrocuted while showering in Baghdad 's green zone .
According to a criminal investigation by the Army , an electrical water pump on the building 's roof shorted out from not being properly grounded when installed .
On March 19 his parents sued the contractor , KBR Inc. , for Sgt. Maseth 's death .
According to the Pittsburgh - Post Gazette : " The Defense Contract Management Agency , we believe , authorized [ the contractor ] to the tune of millions of dollars to make the repairs .
And they never made the repairs , " Mr. Cavanaugh said .
" And we do n't know why .
A simple repair -- just ground the building -- and Ryan would be alive today . "
On July 1 , New York Times Investigative Reporter James Risen , author of the 2006 book " State of War : The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration , " took up the subject .
According to Risen , General David Petraeus stated to Congress that 13 Americans had been electrocuted since the invasion of Iraq : 12 soldiers and one contractor .
As recently as July 11 , KBR Inc. electricians told a Senate panel tasked to investigate the deaths that their employer used inexperienced , non-English speaking workers to install electrical systems .
Many experienced contractors , they claimed , were dismissed after raising cautions over the work .
According to the Associated Press : " Time and again we heard , ` This is not the states , OSHA does n't apply here .
If you do n't like it you can go home , ' " said Debbie Crawford , a journeyman electrician with 30 years experience .
Army Times reports that the shoddy wiring and electrical risks have brought about the deaths of 11 service members and two U.S. civilians .
However , a follow - up report by James Risen in the New York Times on July 18 states that the problem is far worse than General Petraeus stated , and the military has known about the systemic problems since 2004 .
Since the invasion , over 283 electrical fires on US bases have been reported , along with two deaths in 2006 at a base in Tikrit , the death of Sgt. Maseth , and innumerable painful shocks dealt to Americans .
A log of complaints compiled early in 2008 found soldiers living in just one Baghdad building complex were complaining of painful electrical shocks ' on an almost daily basis . '
In public statements , Pentagon officials have not addressed the scope of the hazards , instead mostly focusing on the circumstances surrounding the death of Sergeant Maseth , who lived near Pittsburgh .
But the internal documents , including dozens of memos , e-mail messages and reports from the Army , the Defense Contract Management Agency and other agencies , show that electrical problems were widely recognized as a major safety threat among Pentagon contracting experts .
It is impossible to determine the exact number of the resulting deaths and injuries because no single document tallies them up .
( The records were compiled for Congressional and Pentagon investigators and obtained independently by The Times . )
The 2007 safety survey was ordered by the top official in Iraq for the Defense Contract Management Agency , which oversees contractors , after the October 2006 electrical fire that killed two soldiers near Tikrit .
Paul Dickinson , a Pentagon safety specialist who wrote the report , confirmed its findings , but did not elaborate .

The Miraj - Brief Description
In the twelfth year of his mission , the Prophet made his night journey from Mecca to Jerusalem , and thence to heaven .
His journey , known in history as Miraj ( Ascension ) , was a real bodily one and not only a vision .
It was at this time that Allah ordered the Muslims to pray the five daily prayers .
Almighty Allah has said : Glorified ( and Exalted ) be He ( Allah ) above all that ( evil ) they associate with Him , Who took His slave Muhammad for a journey by night from AlMasjid - al - Haram ( at Makka ) to the farthest mosque ( in Jerusalem ) , the neighborhood whereof
We have blessed , in order that We might show him ( Muhammad ) of 0ur Ayat ( proofs , evidences , lessons , signs , etc. ) .
Verily
He is the All - Hearer , the All - Seer . "
Surah 17 : 1 The Miraj - Full Description Abbas Ibn Malik reported that Malik Ibn Sasaa said that Allah 's Messenger described to them his Night Journey saying : " While I was lying in Al - Hatim or Al - Hijr , suddenly someone came to me and cut my body open from here to here . "
I asked Al - Jarud , who was by my side , " What does he mean ? "
He said : " It means from his throat to his pubic area , " or said , " From the top of the chest . "
The Prophet further said , " He then took out my heart .
Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and was filled ( with Belief ) and then returned to its original place .
Then a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me . "
( On this Al - Jarud asked : " Was it the Buraq , 0 Abu Hamza ? " I ( i.e. Anas ) replied in the affirmative .
The Prophet said : ' The animal 's step ( was so wide that it ) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal 's sight .
I was carried on it , and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven .
" When he asked for the gate to be opened , it was asked , ' Who is it ? '
Gabriel answered , ' Gabriel . '
It was asked , ' Who is accompanying you ? '
Gabriel replied , ' Muhammad . '
It was asked , ' Has Muhammad been called ? '
Gabriel replied in the affirmative .
Then it was said , ' He is welcomed .
What an excellent visit his is !'
The gate was opened , and when I went over the first heaven , I saw Adam there .
Gabriel said ( to me ) : ' This is your father , Adam ; pay him your greetings . '
So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said : ' You are welcomed , 0 pious son and pious Prophet . '
Then Gabriel ascended with me till we reached the second heaven .
Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened .
It was asked : ' Who is it ? '

The gate was opened .
" When I went over the second heaven , there I saw John ( Yahya ) and Jesus ( Isa ) , who were cousins of each other .
Gabriel said ( to me ) : ' These are John and Jesus ; pay them your greetings . '
So I greeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said , ' You are welcomed , 0 pious brother and pious Prophet . '

Gabriel said ( to me ) : ' This is Moses ; pay him your greeting .
So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said : ' You are welcomed , 0 pious brother and pious Prophet . '
When I left him ( i.e. Moses ) he wept .
Someone asked him : ' What makes you weep ? '
Moses said : ' I weep because after me there has been sent ( as Prophet ) a young man whose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers . '
Then Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened .
It was asked : ' Who is it ? '

Gabriel said ( to me ) :
This is your father ; pay your greetings to him . '
So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said : ' You are welcomed , 0 pious son and pious Prophet . '
Then I was made to ascend to Sidrat - ul - Muntaha ( i.e. the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary ) .
Behold !
Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr ( i.e. a place near Medina ) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants .
Gabriel said : ' This is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary . '
Behold !
There ran four rivers ; two were hidden and two were visible , I asked : ' What are these two kinds of rivers , 0 Gabriel ? '
He replied : ' As for the hidden rivers , they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates . '
' Then Al - Bait - ul - Mamur ( i.e. the Sacred House ) was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me .
I took the milk .
Gabriel remarked : ' This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following . '
Then the prayers were enjoined on me : they were fifty prayers a day .
When I returned , I passed by Moses , who asked ( me ) : ' What have you been ordered to do ? '
I replied : ' I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day . '
Moses said : ' Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day , and by Allah I have tested people before you , and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel ( in vain ) .
Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers ' burden . '
So I went back , and Allah reduced ten prayers for me .
Then again I came to Moses , but he repeated the same as he had said before .
Then again I went back to Allah , and He reduced ten more prayers .
When I came back to Moses he said the same .
I went back to Allah , and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a day .
When I came back to Moses , he repeated the same advice , so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day .
" When I came back to Moses , he said : ' What have you been ordered ? '
I replied : ' I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day . '
He said : ' Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day , and no doubt , I have got an experience of the people before you , and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel , so go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers ' burden . '
I said : ' I have requested so much of my Lord that I feel ashamed , but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah 's Order . '
When I left , I heard a voice saying : ' I have passed My order and have lessened the burden of My worshippers . " '

Researchers at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands have developed a technique for generating atom clusters made from silver and other metals .
Surprisingly enough , these so - called super atoms ( clusters of 13 silver atoms , for example ) behave in the same way as individual atoms and have opened up a whole new branch of chemistry .
If a silver thread is heated to around 900 degrees Celsius , it will generate vapour made up of silver atoms .
The floating atoms stick to each other in groups .
Small lumps of silver comprising for example 9 , 13 and 55 atoms appear to be energetically stable and are therefore present in the silver mist more frequently that one might assume .
Prof. Andreas Schmidt - Ott and Dr. Christian Peineke of TU
Delft managed to collect these super atoms and make them suitable for more detailed chemical experiments .
The underlying mechanism governing this stability in super atoms was described in Science by scientists from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2005 .
They had discovered metal super atoms , but from aluminium .
Their aluminium clusters of 13 , 23 and 37 atoms reacted in the same way as individual atoms because they comprised electrons that revolved around the atom cluster as a whole .
These so - called outer layers were strikingly similar to the outer layers of elements from the periodic table .
The super atoms gave the periodic table a third dimension as it were , according to Schmidt - Ott : ' The chemical properties of the super atoms that have been identified up until now are very similar to those of elements in the periodic table , because their outer layers are much the same .
However , we may yet discover super atoms with a different outer layer , giving us another set of completely new properties . '
Schmidt - Ott hopes to find atom clusters with new unique magnetic , optical or electrical properties , which would also be stable enough to create crystals or other solid forms .
Potential applications include catalysts in fuel and extra-conductive crystals .
So although super atoms are nothing new , thanks to TU Delft the particles can now be collected in a very pure form and selected according to size , thereby making them suitable for chemical experiments .

The overwhelming majority of Americans are relying exclusively on Social Security and Medicare to provide a comfortable retirement in their old age .
When interviewed , they say they think the systems are going to go bust , but they do not change their behavior and save more .
They save less .
Today , household saving as a percentage of household discretionary income is negative .
Americans are borrowing to maintain their lifestyles .
Most Americans now live 15 years or more after their Medicare payments begin and 14 years after their Social Security payments begin .
As longevity increases , and as Medicare payments keep people alive in the final six months of their lives , which are the most expensive phase of their lives , medically speaking , these two systems will go into red ink status .
The generally accepted estimate for this is 2017 for Medicare .
Social Security may take a decade longer .
The United States government is now something in the range of $ 75 trillion in the red for these two programs .
Most of this is Medicare .
I report on these figures in a free department on my Website .
You can verify there what I am saying here .
This means that over the life of the two programs , the Federal government will have to find $ 75 trillion to make the payments that it has committed to make to all Americans in their retirement years .
This assumes , of course , that this liability does not increase as a result of even greater life expectancy .
Whether or not Americans live longer , this gigantic figure is guaranteed to increase .
Why is this ?
Because the programs are not being funded today .
For every year that the expected liabilities are not being covered by money set aside that will produce a guaranteed return ( guaranteed by whom ? ) , the principal that is not paid is tacked onto the total debt owed .
If , this year , as is certain , $ 2 trillion are not set aside in income - producing assets , this $ 2 trillion will be tacked onto the $ 75 trillion obligation .
None of the investments are funded by investments in income - producing assets .
The trust funds of both organizations are exclusively invested in nonmarketable , long - term United States government debt .
There are only four ways to ecape .
First , the government can increase workers ’ taxes .
Second , the government can reduce the payments .
Third , the government can borrow from the capital markets .
Fourth , the government can borrow from the Federal Reserve System which will create the money out of nothing to purchase additional debt .
Because the government already refuses to lay aside sufficient tax money to pay off these debts , we know what the government will do .
It will either cut back on payments , or it will borrow additional money , either from the private capital markets or from the Federal Reserve System .
A WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING
The government is borrowing money today with a promise to pay off the loan later .
This “ later ” can best be understood by watching Judy Garland sing “ Someday , over the rainbow ( way up high ) . ”
For movie buffs , the best still image is W.C. Fields , with his top hat , dealing cards in My Little Chickadee .
His motto : “ Never give a sucker an even break . ”
For moving images , any scene by Groucho Marx will work fine .
But I recommend the scene in The Coconuts , where he is selling Florida real estate .
Chico asks what the houses are made of .
Groucho answers , “ You can get them in wood .
You can get them in stucco .
Boy , can you get stucco ! ”
Economically speaking , our best example of what we are facing is to think of ourselves as bankers who have lent trillions of dollars to borrowers .
The borrowers are officially retirees , but legally speaking , there is one borrower : the U.S. government .
Think of Social Security and Medicare as long - term mortgages .
The big question is this :
Which type of mortgages ?
We have all heard of subprime mortgages .
Very few people had ever heard of them a year ago , when the international capital markets began to break down as a result of these mortgages .
The banking industry trusted them .
The financial industry sold hundreds of billions of dollars of these toxic waste investments to their investors .
No one knows how to recover the losses that these stupid loans have inflicted onto tremendously naïve investors , which include hedge funds and European banks .
These loans are still inflicting losses on investors .
In addition to subprime loans there are also Alt - A loans .
These loans , a year ago , were considered to be medium - risk loans .
They are the next loans up on the risk level from subprime loans .
Now , they are regarded as what would have been regarded as a subprime loan one year ago .
They , too , are likely to go into default to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars .
Then there are the ARM mortgages .
These are adjustable rate mortgages .
I have warned against these loans continually .
These loans adjust the overall interest rate structure for relatively short - term loans .
This means that the borrower does not know what he is going to be paying a year or more from now .
If rates rise , his monthly payment will rise .
If they fall , his mortgage payment will fall .
Then there are the least - known mortgages .
They are called pay option mortgages .
These are the mortgages most like Medicare and Social Security .
Twenty years ago , they were called backward - walking mortgages .
BACKWARD -WALKING MORTGAGES
The pay option ARM mortgage allows a borrower to pay a minimum monthly payment .
This minimum monthly payment is not a complete payment in order to amortize the mortgage over a specific period of time .
Whatever portion of the monthly obligation that does not cover the full amortization of the mortgage is added to the principal owed by the borrower .
So , if he would normally have to pay $ 1500 a month , but he decides to pay only $ 500 a month , $ 1000 is added to the principal owed .
The person who elects to do this is never going to catch up .
He has such poor understanding of debt that he signed the papers .
He put no money down .
He thought he was securing his future .
He was securing his eviction .
Here is a summary of these loans , written 2007 , by someone who maintained an air of neutrality about these loans .
The author writes as if the kind of people signing these loans were careful evaluators of risks and rewards .
In fact , they were mostly first - time buyers .
This sort of article was common until a year ago .
They are all over the Web : “ Pay option mortgages . ”
There are an estimated $ 500 billion of these loans , 60 % in California .
They are now about to come due .
The mandatory trigger points for increasing monthly payments will start the default process rolling in the second half of this year , as the graph on the page makes clear .
The first re-sets are just now beginning .
They will escalate , month by month , until August , 2011 .
Then they trail off for a year .
This wave of unstoppable foreclosures will hit the housing market for three more years , accelerating month by month .
The borrowers who took on these loans are generally ignorant people who know nothing about finances .
These people are guaranteed defaulters .
There is nothing Congress can do about this .
These loans were supposedly justified as being only for sophisticated borrowers .
This was utter nonsense from 2002 onward , when they first appeared .
Only misguided people borrowed by using a pay - option mortgage .
These mortgages were touted as a rational option for lenders .
By November , 2007 , no institution was making them .
This was reported in the New York Times .
If they were wise loans , why are n’t lenders offering them any longer ?
Because they were always bonehead loans .
Brokers who were being paid large commissions made these loans to people who they knew would default .
Then they sold these loans to pools of investors assembled like lambs to the slaughter by Wall Street firms and major banks .
There were a few warnings in 2005 .
No one took them seriously .
The experts made excuses for them .
The experts were dead wrong .
Experts will baptize any screwball investment offered by idiots in the final stages of a boom fostered by central bank monetary inflation .
One of the large banks that promoted these loans is the fast - sinking Wachovia .
One site that has summarized these loans — after no one was making them — quotes a page from Wachovia ’s Website .
( This page has been dropped from Wachovia ’s site . )
At Wachovia , we understand the importance of flexibility and choice when it comes to choosing a mortgage .
That ’s why we ’ve teamed up with our affiliate , World Savings Bank , to provide you with a mortgage solution that lets you choose the monthly payment you ’re most comfortable with .
The Pick - a- PaymentSM Adjustable Rate Mortgage ( ARM ) offers you payment choices that allow you to take control of your finances .
You have up to four different payment options each month — Minimum Payment , Interest Only , Full Principal and Interest , or 15 - Year Payment Option .
With the Adjustable Rate Pick - a- Payment , you could :
Make a lower monthly payment and temporarily increase your cash flow so you can free up cash for : Retirement savings
Paying down high - interest debt Funding college tuition Make higher payments and pay offyour home loan sooner Keep mortgage payments low during the initial years of your loan Control your budget based on your individual financial needs
It sounded so good .
That was then .
This is now .
The experts never see economic disaster coming .
They go with the flow .
If something worked yesterday , it will work tomorrow . . . and ten years from now .
Here is a classic example .
Alan Greenspan offered this sage advice on ARMs in 2004 :
Calculations by market analysts of the “ option adjusted spread ” on mortgages suggest that the cost of these benefits conferred by fixed - rate mortgages can range from 0.5 percent to 1.2 percent , raising homeowners ’ annual after - tax mortgage payments by several thousand dollars .
Indeed , recent research within the Federal Reserve suggests that many homeowners might have saved tens of thousands of dollars had they held adjustable - rate mortgages rather than fixed - rate mortgages during the past decade , though this would not have been the case , of course , had interest rates trended sharply upward .
Thanks ,
Alan !
Bill Fleckenstein immediately said this advice was a mistake , but who was he , compared to Greenspan ?
A nobody .
He was right , but it did not matter .
With respect to pay option ARMs , there is a site on - line that sells these mortgages — or says it does .
Here , we read : “ With an understanding that pay option arms are as important and respected as any mortgage product in the market place today .
Take the time to see if pay option arms is the right path for your primary home , a vacation get a way or , an investment property . ”
Respected ?
In 2008 ?
I do n’t think so .
For a video analysis of the coming pay - option ARM implosion , see this by “ Mr. Mortgage , ” who used to sell them .
DEFAULT IS COMING
Mortgage debtors who cannot make their payments have two choices : ( 1 ) stop paying and walk away ; ( 2 ) stop paying and sit tight .
By far , the second choice is best for them .
It is also best for lenders .
Empty house are targets .
There are hundreds of thousands of owners in this second class .
They are no longer paying at all .
They are sitting in their houses , rent free , waiting for the lending agency to foreclose .
Recently , Freddie Mac extended the foreclosure date to 300 days from the last payment , up from 150 .
So , someone with a $ 1000 month mortgage can get another $ 10,000 of free rent .
Maybe he can gum up the system by making one payment on day 299 , and get another 300 days .
In any case , lenders have been hit with hundreds of billions of dollars in losses .
They can pretend that these losses do not exist , but they do exist .
The lenders are sitting on top of hundreds of billion dollars of uncollectible mortgage debt .
They are doing their best to avoid admitting to the auditors that these are nonperforming loans .
They are doing their best to keep these loans from being written down to zero .
They are therefore not foreclosing on homes rapidly .
On the homes that they have foreclosed on , they are not holding auctions in which buyers can submit any bid they want , with the low bid winning .
Instead , lenders are establishing a lowest - bid minimum , and this minimum is above any bid that a rational investor or buyer is willing to submit .
So , the lenders buy back 95 % of these properties each time they list these properties for sale .
These shadow sales constitute as much as 40 % of the homes sold in California .
This makes it look as though the housing market is not in a state of collapse in California .
It looks good , but it is a gigantic delusion .
FEDERAL DEFAULT IS COMING
As surely as holders of pay option mortgages will default , so will the U.S. government default .
But there is a huge difference .
Mortgage lenders can evict mortgage holders in default and gain ownership of their houses .
There is no way that “ lenders ” to the U.S. government can evict the government for non-payment .
This relieves today ’s politicians from having to make payments above the minimal required payment to be re-elected .
Year by year , month by month , day by day , the government is adding to principal owed to future retirees by not setting aside funds to pay the beneficiaries of the two old - age programs .
The funds are immediately spent by the government .
Any funds not paid out to today ’s growing army of elderly recipients is borrowed by the Treasury and spent .
The Treasury issues IOUs to the two trust funds , but these IOUs are not counted as part of the official on - budget debt .
This is deception .
The voters do n’t understand .
Congress likes the results : deferred day of judgment .
You may think : “ Why do n’t people in charge blow the whistle ? ”
Only one senior official ever did .
He is David Walker , the Comptroller General of the United States until early this year .
He resigned to head Peter G. Peterson ’s newly created foundation , which is devoted to warning the voters about the looming bankruptcy of the government .
[ Note , as is true of so many Websites , the outfit allowed the Website designer free reign .
Like all programmers , he is young , has a huge screen , and has chosen as his default rate 1024 ×768 pixels , which produces small print .
So , anyone who is older — I am one — who uses maximum resolution of 800×600 cannot easily view the Website . ]
Almost no one in authority warned bankers and Wall Street firms against subprime mortgages , Alt - A mortgages , and pay option mortgages .
The experts assume that the deal - makers know what they are doing .
The deal - doers do n’t know .
As Warren Buffett has said , there are three phases of the cycle .
Each is dominated by one group : ( 1 ) innovators ; ( 2 ) imitators ; ( 3 ) idiots .
We are in phase three .
CONCLUSION
A year ago , the capital markets were hit by a crisis .
Losses are now estimated at $ 450 billion .
That crisis continues .
It is likely to get much worse , as leveraged investments — borrowed short , lent long — produce more losses .
Almost nobody warned the public .
The experts would not have listened .
They never do .
Yet , without warning , the capital markets seized up .
This is what happens to capital markets .
Things go well for years .
Then there is a crisis .
Everyone in power says , “ We had no warning . ”
The Federal government today can still sell its debt .
There is a rush for liquidity in a recession period .
But there will come a time when , just like the capital markets in August 2007 , there will be an unforeseen lock - up of the market for Treasury debt .
The Federal Reserve will then have to inflate by buying this debt .
The bankruptcy that is guaranteed by the two pay option mortgages known as Social Security and Medicare will be paid off in a wave of inflation .
This inflation will begin long before the trust fund of Medicare goes into the red in 2017 .
There will be a default .
That default will be mass inflation .
The on - budget debt of the United States government will force the FED ’s hand before the off - budget debt does .
But if it does n’t , the backward - walking mortgage of Medicare will force the default .
We will have to take our medicine earlier or later .
I predict earlier .

The type of vehicles America makes best are , unfortunately , not the type of vehicles that people really want anymore .
Nobody builds better trucks than the Americans do .
Not even the Japanese build as good a truck as the Ford F - 150 or the Chevy Silverado .
It 's the same with performance cars .
The Corvette Z06 has 505 horsepower , comes with a big warranty , and can hit 200 miles per hour .
It weighs almost exactly the same as a half - million - dollar Porsche Carrera GT and gets higher mileage — 26 miles per gallon .
Where we seem to lose it is in the low - bucks econocar .
I used to be able to identify any American car from 25 yards .
Now they all have this jellybean look .
It ’s a mystery to me , because the one thing we used to do better than anybody else was build cheap , extremely high - quality cars .
We did it for decades , all the way back to the beginning of the industry .
There was no better car for the money than the Model T .
It was a basic car , but it used the finest materials available .
There are still almost a million of them out there .
When you get into a high - priced , well - made American car today and the key is in the ignition , you hear a melodic bong , bong .
But when you get in a cheap American car , like a rental , and the key is left in , it goes plink , plink , plink .
It ’s just horrible .
Every time you use the turn signal , it 's like breaking a chicken leg .
In order to make the more expensive car more appealing , U.S. companies feel as though they have to dumb down the cheaper car .
I believe that , all things being equal , Americans will buy American .
It just has to be as good as the competition ; it does n’t have to be better .
The classic example is Harley - Davidson .
Throughout the ' 70s , the motorcycle maker had huge quality - control problems .
Then Harley - Davidson said , " Look , let 's take our time .
Let 's build fewer bikes .
Let ’s build them properly , so they do n’t leak oil and they ’ll run forever . "
Harley - Davidson won back the market share it had lost , and it continues to dominate today .
Even though the bikes might not be technically superior , they 're bulletproof and they 're American .
People will buy American if given the chance .
The automakers are starting to think like Harley and understand that when you get into an automobile , everything should be appealing to you .
If you see stitching that 's out of line on the dashboard , you 're going to get madder and madder every time you see it .
That 's one place where the American car companies dropped the ball .
Thankfully , in the past couple of years , they have gotten better .
If you look at the new line of G.M. cars , they are almost as good as what the Europeans are doing , especially when you compare interiors .
Cadillac has a line of small four - door sedans that are , if not quite the rival of Audi or Mercedes , pretty darn close for quite a bit less money .
The problem with what 's happened over the past few decades is that you have a whole generation of kids who have no brand loyalty .
They 've grown up on Honda , Hyundai , Kia and Toyota .
To lure them to the American brand , you ’ve got to give them something exciting , something bold , something different .
America does technology well , and I think this is how the companies will bring those buyers back .
I think cars like the Chevy Volt , which is entirely battery - powered , or hydrogen cars from Chrysler , Ford , and G.M. will take off .
Looking into my crystal ball , I predict that Toyota will probably become the dominant force , and the other companies will have to become leaner to survive .
They ’ll start reining in some of the more unprofitable models .
The overhead at most of the U.S. firms is crazy , and they 'll have to figure out a way to fix that .
They 'll ultimately survive , but I think that they 'll need to change how they do business .
And in the future , you 'll see smaller companies doing more boutique manufacturing , as BMW has with the Mini .
One last thing :
No matter what happens , do not expect all American cars to go Eurosize .
American buttocks are not getting any smaller .
Stewart : ' Looks like the weather in Scarborough Country is partly bitchy David Edwards and Muriel Kane

If the Daily Show's Jon Stewart is to be believed , the hosts of MSNBC have come close to a state of all - out civil war in the course of the Democratic National Convention .
" One network is so focused on uncovering the smallest brush fire of discontent amongst Democrats that perhaps [ it ] has n't noticed its own house is on fire , " Stewart suggested .
Stewart began with a clip of Keith Olbermann making a comment about " us go[ing ] off at the mouth on the subject of Senator Clinton 's speech tonight , " accompanied by a yak - yak gesture with his hand .
He was immediately cut off by an annoyed Chris Matthews , who apparently took the remark personally .
" I can do the same to you , " Matthews snapped .
" That 's what I thought , alright , and I said it . "
" It 's Lord of the Flies on the NBC roof ! " Stewart exclaimed .
Stewart next played an already - classic clip of Olberman muttering over an open mic , " Jesus , Joe , why do n't you get a shovel ? " as Joe Scarborough was going on admiringly about the recent effectiveness of the McCain campaign .
" In Keith Olbermann 's defense , " Stewart noted , " he thought his mic was all the way up . "
But the infighting at MSNBC reached an extreme when host Joe Scarborough spat out at correspondent David Shuster , " Why are you so hateful ?
Why do you want to keep American troops in Iraq even longer ? " as co-host Mika Brzezinski buried her face in her hands .
Scarborough continued taunting Shuster with outright insults , saying , " Do you never watch this show ?
Oh , that 's right
You usually sleep through this show , because you did n't show up three times in a row . "
" Wow , " Stewart commented as his audience gasped in disbelief .
" Looks like the weather in Scarborough Country is partly bitchy with a chance of mmrrrwww . "
According to the Politico , " Shuster left the set , but returned later to hug it out " -- as he did after a similar dustup during last winter 's primaries .
The Politico also looked more deeply into the " intense behind - the - scenes turmoil " at MSNBC , quoting one " high - ranking MSNBC journalist " as saying , " The situation at our channel is about to blow up . "
However , MSNBC President Phil Griffin insists , " We hire smart people who are passionate about their love of politics and love of news .
Do I want them to have squabbles ?
No .
But I understand they re human . "

IDLEDALE — Sunday night was hot — so hot that Scout slept on the floor at the foot of Mack and Jacquie Anderson ’s bed while Sam snoozed in a nearby chair .
Scout , a 12 - year - old yellow Labrador retriever , and her close buddy , Sam , a 3 - year - old chocolate Lab — enjoyed the cool air flowing through the screenless , open French doors .
Sometime between 4 and 4:30 a.m. , Jacquie Anderson heard a scuffling and got up to see whether Scout was having a seizure .
“ I was a foot from something that was more than Scout , ” she said .
In the dark , she made out the shape and turned to Mack and said , “ There ’s an animal in here .
It ’s a mountain lion . ”
Her voice may have startled the mountain lion , which picked up Scout and ran .
The lion — a 130 - pound male — ran through the yard and jumped a 6 - foot fence with the 72 - pound dog in his mouth .
“ It happened so fast they ( the two dogs ) did n’t make a peep , ” Jacquie Anderson said .
On Tuesday , the Andersons noted the squished - down fence and scattered firewood pile in the lion ’s escape route .
Mack Anderson said he managed to turn on the light , grab his shotgun and a flashlight and head out to find Scout , to no avail .
“ It was pretty bizarre to wake up at 4 a.m. and find a mountain lion in your bedroom , ” Mack Anderson said .
They called 911 , and Jefferson County sheriff ’s deputies and Colorado Division of Wildlife officers tracked the lion up a hill about 200 yards , where they found Scout ’s body hidden under leaves .
Mountain lions will cache prey and return to eat it later .
Wildlife spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill said the habit resulted in the mountain lion being trapped early Tuesday where it had left Scout ’s body .
The Andersons agreed to use Scout ’s body as bait .
“ Scouty was already dead , ” Mack Anderson said .
They wanted to protect their neighbors by making sure a mountain lion that was n’t afraid of people was captured .
“ It was the best way of knowing we got the right animal , ” Churchill said .
The lion was shot and taken to DOW ’s wildlife lab for a necropsy to see whether there were health problems that led the 2 1/2 - to 3 - year - old animal to bypass its usual diet of elk and deer in favor of snatching a dog .
“ Scout probably never woke up , ” Jacquie Anderson said .
“ We think she was killed instantly ” of a broken neck .
The Andersons have lived in their home for 32 years and have seen mountain lions in the area before .
“ I love mountain lions and hate to see it had to be killed , ” Mack Anderson said .
“ We ’re pretty used to them , but not in our bedroom . ”

One of the big breakthrough acts of the last year has joined the increasing ranks of artists who do n't mind if people share their music .
Duffy , the million - selling 24 year - old vocalist and winner of this year 's MOJO Song of the Year Award has been downloading for a couple of years .
" It 's amazing , " she said .
If the media is to be believed , some artists spend most of their time going to big parties in hugely expensive designer clothes , drinking expensive champagne , driving around in prestige cars , smashing up hotel rooms – and the rest of the time complaining about piracy .
It ’s very difficult for the average Joe in the street to feel sorry for them , such is the lifestyle gap , but it does n’t have to be that way .
In recent times we ’ve written about the positive attitudes towards file - sharing shown by some big names in the music business .
The Nine Inch Nails are probably the most outspoken but there are others , including 50 Cent and more recently Joss Stone , who called file - sharing “ brilliant ” .
Others , like ‘ Travis ’ are happy for their fans to share .
Now , in an interview with Shortlist magazine , the million - selling 2008 MOJO Song of the Year Award winner , Duffy , says that she got into downloading a couple of years ago , calling it “ amazing ” .
One of twins , 24 year - old Duffy has sold over a million copies of her debut album Rockferry , making it the biggest selling album of the year in the UK , netting 180,000 sales in the first week alone .
In America , the album sold 72,000 in its first week , entering the Billboard 200 at Number 4 .
Her track ‘ Mercy ’ has been viewed over 17.6 million times on YouTube ( although I quite like the just - for - fun remix from ‘ The Game ’ )
But if you do n’t have the cash for the album , do n’t worry – Duffy is pretty forward thinking when it comes to ‘ legal ’ versus ‘ illegal ’ downloads :
“ Somebody asked me the other day what I thought of illegal downloading , and I thought , ‘ You know what ?
I do n’t care , ’ because I think the majority are kids and as they get old and get more income they ’ll probably buy records .
It ’s just making music a part of everyone ’s lives . ”
Duffy notes that access to music is all - important but due to where she lived in her childhood , she had no easy access herself , having to take a two - hour bus trip to get to a good record store .
She ’s pragmatic when looking at the big picture : “ Well , I mean , it can go two ways , there are pros and cons to everything .
Some people think it creates illegal access , but I think the big wheel is round , y’know ? ” I think it ’s got more positives because it basically gives people access , what ’s the harm in that ? ”

Some two weeks before he can actually join his new team , Ron Artest was already trying to neutralize his first Houston Rockets controversy Thursday , insisting that there will be no tension with Yao Ming once a trade sending Artest from Sacramento to Houston goes through as expected Aug. 14 .
Artest told ESPN.com that he and Yao have spoken by telephone to address the concerns
Yao voiced about team chemistry to the Houston Chronicle in response to the deal hatched Tuesday by the Rockets and Kings .
The trade calls for Houston to receive Artest in exchange for Rockets draftee Donte Greene , a 2009 first - round pick and Kings alumnus Bobby Jackson , who 's entering the final year of his contract at $ 6.1 million .
The deal can't be completed until Aug. 14 , according to league rules , because Greene signed with Houston on July 14 and is not eligible to be traded sooner .
But suggestions that Yao 's reservations or Artest 's outspoken , unpredictable nature could convince the Rockets to walk away from the trade between now and Aug. 14 were strongly dismissed by one source close to the process .
" The deal is done , " said the source .
Artest also denied suggestions that he would demand a contract extension before reporting to the Rockets -- " I 'm not demanding anything , " he said -- and reiterated his initial giddy reaction to news of the trade by describing the move as " a big opportunity for me . "
" I do n't think Yao meant to say that , " Artest offered Thursday , referring to Yao 's comments to the Chronicle which referenced Artest 's involvement in the infamous Indiana - Detroit brawl that spilled into the stands in 2004 .
" I spoke to Yao and I told him I can't wait to play with him , " Artest continued .
" I spoke to Tracy [ McGrady ] and I told him I can't wait to play with him .
I was a little bit down [ upon hearing Yao 's initial statements ] , because I 'm so far beyond [ the brawl ] .
But everything is going to be good . "
Artest expounded on his conversation with Yao in a broadcast appearance later Thursday on ESPN's " Pardon The Interruption , " revealing that he asked McGrady for Yao 's number .
Said Artest : " When I spoke to Yao , I just said , ' Everything 's going to be all right , I really know how to play the game , I 'm not a selfish player , I can adapt to any type of system and I can't wait to be part of the Houston Rockets . '
" I was a little bit disturbed , mainly because [ of ] the brawl comments .
That 's four years removed from now , maybe four or five years removed I wanted [ Yao ] to know I was a little bit frustrated , but I understand where he 's coming from .
But I can not wait to be a part of that team .
I do n't care if I have to come off the bench .
I could be the sixth man , a seventh man , all I want to do is just really contribute and win a lot of games . "
Later in the PTI interview , Artest added : " I 'm not just some knucklehead head case who 's bipolar , [ like ] everybody is always saying .
I 'm Ron Artest .
Everybody 's different .
That 's why we 've got different DNA
They gotta come up with a better story than Ron 's crazy .
There 's a lot better stories that they can come up with . "
Yet Artest clearly was unsettled by his lack of long - term security in his final days as a King , as the 28 - year - old enters the final year of his contract at $ 7.4 million .
Artest 's oft - cited regrets about passing on the opportunity to opt out of his contract June 30 to become an unrestricted free agent and his increasing desire to leave Sacramento stem largely from the Kings ' refusal to extend his contract .
Artest denied , however , that he needs his future in Houston to be clarified before joining the Rockets .
" I 'm not demanding anything , " Artest said .
" I will play in Houston [ this season ] and I will have a great year and they will have the first option to re-sign me .
This is a big opportunity for me because I 'm going to be playing with the best center in the game . "
The National Party , which imposed the yoke of apartheid to divide and rule South Africa for much of the previous century , is being resurrected to contest next year 's national elections where it will take on its old nemesis , the African National Congress .
The new incarnation may borrow the old orange sun logo , but that , according to the party spokesman , Juan - Duval Uys , is where the similarities end .
The 21st - century National Party ( NP ) is not interested in a return to the tainted past , he says .
What it wants to do is create a credible and strong opposition party that can loosen the ANC 's stranglehold on power .
" We want to move on and embrace every race in South Africa , " Mr Uys said in an interview yesterday , fresh from re-registering the National Party with electoral authorities .
" Our figures show that 85 per cent of those wanting to join are black .
They 're fed up of corruption and the lack of support from the ANC and want to join us in a non-racial party which represents everyone , not the few . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The resurrected party may trace its roots back to the Afrikaner heartlands of Bloemfontein , where it was founded in 1914 , but it will turn its back on the segregation that dominated the reigns of prime ministers Daniel Malan , Hendrick Verwoerd and Pieter Willem Botha .
The apartheid system was dismantled in the early 1990s , and Mr Uys is not about to rebuild it .
" We 're not going to be the party of P W Botha .
We are going to be the party of F W de Klerk , who is still massively respected in South Africa , " he said .
" The National Party handed over a modern state to the ANC in 1994 despite sanctions , but now look at the country .
We need to tackle poverty from the ground up , not with black empowerment deals which benefit the few . "
The party claims that Mr de Klerk – the last white leader of South Africa and the man who freed Nelson Mandela – has endorsed the resurrection .
But the former president 's office has only said he does not oppose the use of the old party name .
It is not the first time the NP has rebranded itself .
In 1997 , it was renamed the New National Party , but that incarnation lasted just eight years until its sole remaining MP , Marthinus van Schalkwyk , decided to throw his lot in with the ANC and join the government of the current President , Thabo Mbeki .
The NP 's official relaunch is scheduled for November and it is aiming to win 50 of the 400 parliamentary seats up for grabs in next year 's election , fielding both white and black candidates .
Its key policy area will be the spiralling crime rate and draft proposals include public executions for murderers and rapists , as well as forcing prisoners to grow their own food in jail .
But questions remain over the credentials of those spearheading the revamp .
Mr Uys , who was not a member of the original NP , has a colourful political past .
He represented a Cape Town politician who became embroiled in allegations of sexual favours , bribes and slander .
And many analysts in South Africa are sceptical about whether the NP can really attract the disillusioned white and coloured voters it is targeting , not to mention the so - called " black diamonds " , the new prosperous black middle class who might be tiring of the ANC .
Aubrey Matshiqi , a senior political analyst at the Centre for Policy Studies , says : " The majority black population will always associate them with apartheid , and a sizeable proportion of the white population feel betrayed by them for negotiating with the ANC to end apartheid .
I do not see them making waves . "
To date , the main opposition party has been the Democratic Alliance .
It has been vocal in tackling the government on corruption , but beyond that has pitched mostly for white middle - class voters .
Much of the real highlighting of government weaknesses is done by civil groups .
This is the gap Mr Uys wants to fill .
And he is not daunted by the long odds : " We want to be the underdog and are not bothered by the criticism .
We know what the feelings are on the ground . "
NEW YORK ( AP ) 
The World Trade Center 's owner announced a major design change to its multibillion - dollar transit hub Tuesday , a day after concluding that most projects at ground zero are behind schedule and over budget .
The wings on the dome designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava will no longer open and close once the hub is built , Port Authority of New York and New Jersey executive director Christopher Ward said Tuesday .
The change is expected to shave hundreds of millions of dollars from the hub 's budget , which has fluctuated between $ 2.2 billion and $ 3.4 billion .
Calatrava had designed the retractable roof so that it would open each Sept. 11 at the time of the terrorist attacks that destroyed the trade center , shining a sliver of light down into the atrium .
The architect 's office declined comment Tuesday .
Ward said the change would prevent the hub from imposing on the structures near it , including the memorial and office towers .
" This is a tough choice , but it is the right choice , " he said at a downtown business breakfast .
Ward has cited the difficulties of building the transit hub among more than a dozen issues that have slowed rebuilding at the 16 - acre site .
Other problems include the behind - schedule dismantling of a condemned ground zero tower and the challenge of building several projects around a working city subway line .
The memorial to the 2001 terrorist attack will not open by its 10th anniversary , Ward said Monday .
Ward did n't set a new schedule , but he said a committee of developers and agencies would set new " clear and achievable " timelines by September .
He said plans to build five office towers , the $ 2 billion - plus transit hub , a Sept. 11 memorial and a performing arts center would be completed , although " the question is when and for how much . "
Gov. David Paterson said later Monday that the Port Authority " will come back and alert us if they feel that perhaps the project is planned beyond our ability to perform . "
Under the most current estimates , the memorial would have been first to open on the site in 2011 .
Other projects were scheduled to open by 2013 , although the performing arts center never had a construction plan .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg , who chairs the foundation overseeing the Sept. 11 memorial , said Tuesday he had hoped the memorial could open sooner .
Bloomberg spearheaded its fundraising , while the Port Authority is in charge of building it .
" I 've pushed the Port Authority as much as I can , " the mayor said .
" I 'm not so sure they are n't doing a good job .
I think it 's easy to go and criticize them .
I 'm just pointing out that they set the priorities . "
The report ordered by Paterson — the third governor to push for speedy development of a 16 - acre site where a temporary train station is the only completed project in seven years — suggested that the earliest projections , just after the attacks for rebuilding ground zero , were n't truthful .
Ward called the estimates offered during Gov. George Pataki 's administration , " emotional dates . "
Paterson promised that in the future , " we will tell the truth every step of the way " about the project .
Pataki once predicted that steel for the 1,776 - foot Freedom Tower , the tallest skyscraper planned for the site , would be up by 2006 .
Steel has just risen above street level for the tower , most recently estimated to open in 2013 .
" Did we set aggressive timetables ?
Absolutely , " Pataki spokesman David Catalfamo said Monday , adding that they were based on engineers ' estimates .
" All the same people who are there now were there then . "

A Canberra public servant accused of leaking confidential information about the Iraq war has lodged an application in the High Court to have his legal costs paid by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ( DFAT ) .
The department sacked employee Trent Smith and alleged he sent an email in 2002 to the then federal Labor opposition in breach of the public service code of conduct .
He was also accused of leaking a confidential document that showed Australia committed to the Iraq war long before the public knew .
The Australian Industrial Relations Commission ( AIRC ) found the dismissal to be " harsh , unjust and unfair " and ordered he be reinstated .
The AIRC described DFAT 's case as lacking in truth and credibility .
Mr Smith 's lawyer James King says his client is now struggling to pay the $ 350,000 he spent defending the matter .
" I just see the situation as rather unfortunate , " he said .
" Essentially a hard working public servant who simply wanted to return to work is faced with quite crippling financial consequences .
" It really shows that unsubstantiated allegations can be exceptionally damaging in that a public servant on his own needs to defend them and incur those costs . "
Mr King says the Attorney - General , Minister for Finance and Minister for Foreign Affairs should now review the matter and correct the error that has been made .
" Basically in the interests of justice , to say that Mr Smith 's legal costs and costs associated in defending the matter should be reimbursed in full , " he said .
" The Government can do that by way of an ex gratia payment if they chose to do so . "
In a statement DFAT says it has met its obligations by reinstating Trent Smith and points out that the AIRC dismissed Mr Smith 's application for costs .
Juergen Leohold , chief research officer at Volkswagen Group , said the key problems were gaining adequate range , the huge cost and a lack of industrial capacity to make high - energy batteries .
In an interview with DPA news agency in Wolfsburg , he deflated predictions that millions of people would be driving electric cars by the middle of the 2010s as " very optimistic . "
Leohold said Volkswagen would sell electric models , but cautioned , " It will take 20 to 25 years before electric cars achieve a market share of more than 10 per cent . "
Volkswagen 's first electric car would be a small car due out in 2010 , but bigger ones might follow .
" We have an ambition to electrify more than just the really small cars , but also our main model series , the Golf , " he said .
Leohold said research into lithium - ion batteries had made big jumps , but the items were still far too expensive .
He said electric motors would never replace internal - combustion engines in some sectors , such as long - distance heavy trucks .
" At the moment it is inconceivable they could ever be powered by batteries , " he said , adding that there was still major potential to make petrol and diesel engines more efficient .
Separately , the German weekly magazine Focus reported Saturday that a key aim behind a takeover bid from German ball - bearings company Schaeffler for tyremaker Continental was a plan to jointly develop electric and other energy - saving engines .
Both companies make mechanical sub-systems for cars .
Schaeffler takeover deal include efficiency clause
Focus said Schaeffler chief executive Juergen Geissinger wanted to combine his company 's valve controls with Continental 's fuel - injection and exhaust - recycling technology to make combustion engines more efficient .
They could also jointly develop gearless electric traction motors for cars , the magazine said .
In a report to appear Sunday in the newspaper Welt am Sonntag , Continental chief executive Manfred Wennemer opposed the takeover but said he welcomed Schaeffler owning up to 20 per cent of his firm .
" We should get together and come up with a sensible solution , " he said .
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is 167 days away , but who 's counting ?
Maybe the software developers are counting because they have a whopping 2,278 issues targeted for this release .
Even though OpenOffice.org 2.4 is not yet out the door , let 's see how far they 've come with OpenOffice.org 3.0 .
The redesigned splash screen and about dialog :
Please keep in mind this article is based off an alpha release , so many things will change before the final release .
Start center
When OpenOffice.org 3 starts without a document and without a module ( such as Writer ) , it presents the new Start Center .
View multiple pages in Writer
One of the most ever voted issues is viewing multiple pages in writer .
Notice the two new controls in the statusbar ( bottom - right - hand corner ) of the first screenshot : the " View Layout " mode selection and the zoom slider .
The " View Layout " control switches between a single page , several pages side by side , and book layout .
Pretty notes in the margin
The much anticipated improvement called Notes2 is nearly ready .
It will refresh the look , introduce rich formatting and spell checking , aid accessibility , and boost usability while displaying notes in the margin .
The current DEV300_m3 alpha release only supports marking a single point with a note ; a later version will allow marking a selection of text with a note .
However , 3.0 will not track changes in the margin .
Microsoft Office 2007 file format support
Microsoft Office 2007 ( also called Office Open XML ) file formats include .docx , .pptx , and .xlsx .
Despite the similarity in names , these formats are significantly different than the Microsoft Office formats used since 1997 .
OpenOffice.org 3 offers native import .
OpenOffice.org 3.0 DEV300_m3 converted this reference . docx document with mediocre quality .
The notable problems were tracked changes , a comment , columns , an image , and an embedded Excel document .
For comparison , the same document is shown rendered in Word 2007 and in OpenOffice.org 3.0 DEV300_m3 .
Surely the quality of conversion will improve before September 's final release .
Tip :
To access .docx , .xlsx , and .pptx files in OpenOffice.org 2.4 , see previous Office 2007 file format articles and odf - converter - integrator .
Solver in Calc
It 's the perfect solution for your linear optimization needs .

A linear programming model is defined by formulas in spreadsheet cells , the objective and constraints are specified in a dialog .
Input variables can be defined to be integer or binary ( mixed integer linear programming ) .
Need a solver now ?
See Kohei's solver .
New theme in Calc
Calc 3.0 paints selections with translucence and renders column and row headers with a glass effect .
Version 2.4 is shown first for comparison .
Native tables in Impress
Impress 3.0 has native tables .
The new Table Design panel ( shown on the right ) makes it easy to apply colors .
Error bars in charts
Do n't make any mistakes about it : OpenOffice.org is serious about improving charts for scientific uses .
OpenOffice.org 3.0 has error bars in charts .
OpenOffice.org 2.4 also made progress in charts :
More columns in Calc
Calc 3.0 extends the maximum columns from 256 to 1024 .

Issue Tracker : Issues marked fixed for 3.0 ( number of issues will increase as September approaches )
What 's missing
With months left to go , there 's several pieces still missing .
Importing standard PDF files
Hybrid PDFs : fully editable PDFs with embedded OpenDocument files ( issue 65397 )
Presenter view in Impres
Dictionaries as extensions ( to replace DicOOo )
Macros in Base documents
Bug testing
A year ago in OOoCon 2007 's keynote address , Louis Suárez - Potts , Community Manager of OpenOffice.org , touched on many ideas for OpenOffice.org 3.0 .
Many are already fulfilled ahead of schedule in 2.4 or earlier : rectangular selection , wiki export , new chart module , and the Pentaho report engine .
However , one feature you may not see this year is an Outlook replacement .
For years , there have been talks of including Mozilla 's Thunderbird and Lightning ( calendar ) application with OpenOffice.org .
However , not much as come of it yet .
Perhaps with the financial resources of the new Mozilla Messaging Corporation , the Mozilla Calendar will get the boost it needs .
Conclusion
OpenOffice.org 3.0 will be an excellent release .
To make it better , please see Top 12 reasons to test the OpenOffice.org 2.4 release candidate for a guide to testing any version of OpenOffice.org .
OpenOffice.org 3.0 downloads ( marked DEV300 or BEA300 , not OOH ) are available from :
64 - bit Linux versions are not yet available .
Caution : this is an alpha build and is not intended for everyday use .
It may cause problems , so use it only for testing purposes .
UPDATED : Download the latest , stable release .

WSJ story that points out that the social worker that DEFuning blasted below Originally posted 2008 - 08- 03 06:09:35 ; updated to note today ' sstory that points out that the social worker that DEFuning blasted below has a police record dating back to 1992 for drugs , dwi , and battery .
-- bumped , cho .
The recent suicide of chief death - by - anthrax serial killer suspect Ivins seems like a tidy wrap up of a tremendously disturbing chapter of the Post 9/11 American tragedy .
Or is it ?
UPDATE : Not only does the WAPO report http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/05/AR2008080503747.htmlreport that Ivins suspected that his therapist was in cahoots with the FBI , it also reports that she was a newbie therapist , indeed , under strict supervision .
She was described as a former motorcycle gang member who used heroin , cocaine , PPCP , etc .
In addition , it describes the forensic psychiatrist who saw Ivins as David S. Irwin , who , according to the Maryland Medical Board https://www.mbp.state.md.us/bpqapp/PProfile.asp,is a psychiatrist who only has admitting privileges at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital , a facility with no listed psychiatric services .
Now , I know that many psychiatrists no longer do much / any hospital work because it is a hassle and they can make oodles more money doing 15 minute med checks , but it is odd for him to not even have any privileges at any psychiatric facility .
Especially when he is listed in Washingtonian Magazine of one of the area top docs .
It does not list him as a forensic specialist http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/health/2015.html: David S. Irwin , Gaithersburg .
Special interest in mood / anxiety disorders , psychopharmacology .
To say the very least , these are odd choices of medical professionals for Dr. Ivins .
Biker chick with serious drug use past under close supervision at new job as newbie social worker .
Shrink who has no admission privileges at any psychiatric facility .
For a patient in a safety - sensitive position who has a demonstrated need for inpatient care .
Is it too far of a reach to suggest that perhaps these medical professionals were not optimal matches for this patient ?
Gives my Lets Make A Deal speculation below a little more zip .
That he had been on antipsychotics for years but just got locked out of the safety sensitive position last year is --- odd , unlikely and bad business .
From what I can determine , the only diagnosis I have heard is Paranoid Personality Disorder which is an Axis II disorder -- in contrast to the more serious , debilitating Axis I disorders that feature paranoia , like schizophrenia , etc .
Axis II disorders have been most recently used by the DOD / VA to try to disqualify veterans from receiving disability benefits .
That Axis II diagnosis sure is convenient !
And it is in direct contradiction to the description of him by his cranky brother -- that Ivins had a character trait of " invulnerability " -- one not consistent with one described as paranoid .
Ah-- I love the smell of rotting fish in the morning .
Firedoglake has made some connect the dots hits on the story that are concerning .
The prosecuting attorney is the daughter of Scooter " Mr. Germ " Libby 's attorney - - remember him and his girlfriend Judy " The Germ " Miller ?
I do not intend to don the Alcoa Chapeau but I have some concerns that might not be evident to readers not versed in the ways and means of psychotherapy .
Some things about the Ivins story do not ring true to me and I wonder if this is not just a manufactured deus ex machina to seal this story .
Suspect # 1 is ready to be nicked by the coppers and he offs himself with some Tylenol 3 .
The relatives and co-workers say he seemed like a normal guy and respected researcher .
Yet this is so incongruent with the assertions of the therapist in the recently released tapes of the judicial hearing when she sought a restraining order against Ivins .
When one is THAT allegedly disturbed , it is highly unlikely that no one else saw it .
Not impossible , mind you but unlikely .
And remember , he had to have security clearance .
I know that they are saying that they do not review the medical records of every employee who requires clearance and rely on his self - report for any psychiatric history .
At least that is what they are saying .
Post 9/11 , I find that assertion a little hard to swallow and the air is redolent of fish .
Ivin 's therapist 's comments that " As far back as the year 2000 , the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people .
. . .
When he feels that he 's been slighted . . . he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings , " and that he had been " ... forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic , homicidal killer .
I have that in evidence .
And through my working with him , I also believe that to be very true . "
Now , as a card carrying therapist myself , I am very familiar with the duty to warn .
When you are dealing with a patient in the defense industry who is in a safety sensitive position , that duty is ramped up considerably .
It is simply not credible to me that for about 8 years Ivins has been a known danger to himself and others , had the motive , the means , and the plan to act upon his threats of violence and NO ONE ALERTS HIS EMPLOYER given his security clearance and public safety threat until November of last year ???
And he had been on antipsychotics for YEARS ?
Evene if he had not revealed that to his employers a random drub screen , which I assume they do , would have .
And the therapist knew of his threats of violence and failed to immediately alert law enforcement until he threatened her ?
And the " top " psychiatrists also failed to hospitalize him , warn the potential victims and alert his employer given his job ?
Given his history and nature of his threats , I seriously doubt that he would have been allowed to sign himself out of the hospital and just cheerfully return to work in an extremely safety sensitive position .
It just does not happen that way .
When employees come to the attention of psychiatry with such a high threat of violence ( TOV ) , it is very rare for a supervisor of the employee to be kept completely out of the loop when the employee is in a safety sensitive position .
This story is just not credible .
I am quite sure that the therapist could have felt fear and threat .
But that this guy just went back to his job after being declared a high TOV , psychotic and a sociopath - - business as usual - - working with anthrax just does not wash .
That is unless there is a chain of malpractice and ineptitude as long as I - 85 .
For those who might doubt my argument , as a therapist , if I see a pilot for a commercial airline who expresses suicidal / homicidal ideation , then I am BOUND BY LAW to report it to the FAA as that pilot is deemed to be a public safety threat given his job piloting hundreds of people through the air in a tin can all day .
It is deemed to be worth the violation of confidentiality to prevent a disaster of huge proportions .
There are other industries which have similar duties to warn and report because of the public health and safety risk .
I am not an expert on DOD or Ivins employer but I find it hard to believe that a similar protective layer is not in place especially given his high security clearance .
All these mental health experts recognized that this guy was a sociopath and there was a high level TOV and nobody alerted anybody until the therapist got scared and went to a judge ?
This smells fishier than the dumpster at a Fish Camp in a heat wave .
It also occurs to me that it is irregular that Ivins , a diagnosed " sociopath " , was in therapy at all unless he was coerced into therapy by another .
Sociopaths , by definition , have no remorse or moral core that is violated by their behavior and so rarely seek out insight oriented therapy ( or any other for that matter ) on their own .
There are many loose ends about this story still to be tied up before any sighs of relief are heard resounding around the nation .
Iraq deserter ordered deported from Canada Associated Press
Published : Wednesday August 13 , 2008
Print This Email This TORONTO ( AP ) -- A U.S. Army specialist who fled Fort Bragg for Canada after learning his unit was to be deployed to Iraq was ordered deported Wednesday .
Jeremy Hinzman , 29 , is likely to be court - martialed when he returns to the United States and could face up to five years in prison .
Hinzman said Canada 's Border Services Agency ordered him to leave the country by Sept. 23 and he would be handed over to U.S. authorities .
Before he fled Fort Bragg , N.C. , in January 2004 , Hinzman had already served a tour of duty with the 82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan .
He served in a non-combat position because before his unit left in 2002 , he applied for conscientious objector status .
In December 2003 , the unit was ordered to Iraq , but he left for Canada with his wife and son shortly thereafter .
He had served three years in the Army and was one of the first U.S. deserters from Iraq to seek refugee status in Canada .
He said he refused to participate in what he calls an immoral and illegal war .
" I 'm disappointed , but I think that every soldier that has refused to fight in Iraq has done a good thing and I 'm not ashamed , " Hinzman told The Associated Press moments after learning of the decision .
" I do n't know how political it was .
I had a high profile case , " he added .
He said Canada 's Border Services agency said there would not be any undue hardship on him if was deported .
An agency spokeswoman Vanessa Barrasa confirmed he was ordered deported .
The Immigration and Refugee Board rejected his claim for refugee status in 2005 and the Federal Court of Appeal held that he would not face any serious punishment if returned to the United States .
Hinzman took his pleas to the Supreme Court of Canada , which also refused to hear the case .
Hinzman enlisted voluntarily and said he joined the army for a variety of reasons , including the college fund , the adventure and the stability .
But after joining , he realized he could not bring himself to kill any one .
" I went through all the training .
I served honorably in my unit .
I used army provisions to try become a noncombatant and remain in the army as a medic or something , but I still would be subject to going on combat missions as a medic , " Hinzman said .
" I can't bring myself to shoot another person .
If people want to criticize me for that , then I 'm honored to be criticized because I 'm not a killer . "
About 200 American deserters are believed to have come to Canada trying to avoid service in Iraq .
So far , Canadian immigration officials and the courts have rejected efforts to grant them refugee status .
Last month , Robin Long became the first American resister to the Iraq war to be removed by Canadian authorities .
During the Vietnam War , up to 90,000 Americans successfully won refuge in Canada , most of them to avoid the military draft .
The majority went home after the United States granted amnesty in the late 1970s .
Many also were given permanent residence status in Canada that eventually resulted in citizenship .
Canadian parliament 's lower house passed a nonbinding motion in June allowing U.S. military deserters to stay in Canada , but the conservative government ignored the vote .
Conservative government party members opposed the motion , not willing to risk straining ties with Washington over the issue or fight rulings already made by the courts and immigration officials .
Russia 's punitive campaign in the Caucasus threatened to intensify into all - out war against Georgia last night , with Russian troops seizing control of strategic towns a couple of hours from the capital , and aircraft pounding Georgian infrastructure .
Vastly outnumbered by the Kremlin 's ground and air forces , the Georgian government announced it was pulling back its troops to defend the capital , Tbilisi , against a feared Russian onslaught .
Washington accused the Kremlin of long preparing an invasion of Georgia in " aggression that must not go unanswered " .
" Russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people .
Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century , " President George Bush said .
" The Russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on . "
He urged Russia to agree to a ceasefire offer by Georgia .
The Georgian authorities said the town of Gori , 40 miles north of Tbilisi , had , in effect , fallen to the Russians , who were also advancing from the breakaway province of Abkhazia in the west into territory previously under Georgian control .
" The Georgian army is retreating to defend the capital .
The government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of Georgia and further loss of life , " said the Georgian government .
Its president , Mikhail Saakashvili , said the Russian campaign was aimed at overthrowing his government .
The Georgian embassy in London last night accused Russia of attempting to " conquer " Georgia .
" Today the statehood of Georgia is in great danger and thereby leaving existing world order in uncertainty . "
Giorgi Badridze , acting head of the embassy , compared Russia 's actions with Nazi incursions into Europe in the run-up to the second world war .
Alexander Lomaia of Georgia 's National Security Council said : " Russia seems intent on overthrowing the democratically elected government of Georgia and occupying the country . "
The Kremlin spurned a chorus of western calls for a ceasefire , already accepted by Saakashvili , and appeared determined to ram home its military advantage at the risk of sparking an international crisis .
Moscow seemed intent on imposing humiliating truce terms on Georgia .
Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin , taking a leading role in the crisis , attacked Washington for helping Georgia fly home troops from Iraq and said the west was mistaking the aggressors for victims .
" The cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several US diplomats .
It is a real shame , " Putin said .
France 's president , Nicolas Sarkozy , is to try to mediate in Moscow today before meeting Saakashvili in the Georgian capital , while Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is to meet Russia 's president , Dmitri Medvedev , in Sochi , just outside Georgia on the Black Sea , on Friday .
The US vice - president , Dick Cheney , said : " Russian aggression must not go unanswered and its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States . "
Military officials in Moscow insisted yesterday that Russian forces would not move beyond the contested region of South Ossetia on Georgia 's northern border with Russia .
Sergei Ivanov , the deputy prime minister , insisted Russian " peacekeepers " were contained in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
The Russian defence ministry said : " There are no Russian troops in Gori . "
But by last night sources in Moscow and Tbilisi and observers on the ground confirmed that Russian troops had advanced tens of miles into Georgian - held territory from Abkhazia .
Russian troops and armoured vehicles were in control of a Georgian military base at Senaki , 25 miles beyond the Abkhaz boundary , UN military observers confirmed .
The Russians had also seized Georgian police stations in Zugdidi after delivering an ultimatum to the Georgians to surrender their weapons near the Abkhaz frontlines .
The towns of Kutaisi and Kurga were said to have been seized .
Georgian officials claimed that Russian tanks seized Gori , smashing the Georgian lines in two places to take control of the town that straddles the road connecting the eastern and western parts of Georgia .
Saba Tsitsikashvili , a local journalist in Gori , said Russian troops had occupied the main road on the edge of the city , but had not moved towards the centre .
" People are in panic .
This road where the troops are is about 2 km from the centre , " she said .
" This is a full - scale invasion . " said Irakli Batkuashvili , head of Georgia 's military planning division .
" This is an occupation ...
Half of Georgia is under Russian control .
Our aim now is to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of Tbilisi . "
You select the vehicles in question , your location , the local price for gas and the number of miles you drive a month , and the calculator tells you how many months it will take for the fuel savings to equal the money you would need to acquire the new vehicle .
The calculator may actually underestimate how often it makes sense to hang onto a gas guzzler , since it does not account for sales taxes or the immense hassle of having to deal with all of the registration paperwork .
IS A SMALL CAR PRACTICAL ?
You will be tempted to play with the Edmunds.com calculator by swapping your hulking Chevy Suburban for a tiny Honda Fit or an itty - bitty hybrid of some sort .
But let ’s get back to reality for a moment .
It is nice to fantasize about tripling your fuel economy , but you might have a trailer to tow or perhaps you are larger than average and are not comfortable in small cars .
Say you need to haul three rows of people but still want to save on gas costs .
So you trade in your 2005 Ford Expedition for a 2008 Toyota Highlander hybrid with a third row .
It will take more than 15 years to break even on that deal , driving 1,500 miles a month , according to the Edmunds.com calculator .
The numbers may work better if you get a used car instead .
Tex Pitfield , whose company , the Saraguay Petroleum Corporation , delivers fuel to gas stations , airports and elsewhere , has done the math himself on his 2003 Lincoln Navigator .
“ I ca n’t justify trading it in , ” he said .
“ It ’s going to cost me more to trade it in than it will to keep driving it . ”
WHAT IS YOUR LARGE VEHICLE WORTH ?
The answer is , probably much less than you think .
About 36 million S.U.V.’s were sold in the United States in the last decade , according to Autodata .
Plenty of people are blindly putting them up for sale or trading them in right now .
The Greenhorn 's Guide to becoming a Monad Cowboy
Howdy !
You all are probably wondering why this guide , when there are so many fine monad tutorials out there already .
Well , I 've noticed some people on the Haskell trail ( and in the saloon ) still talk of them monads like they were rattlesnakes hatched from a lawyer 's briefcase .
That just do n't feel right !
Actually , programming monads is much like cattle driving !
So , let 's get started .
Saddle up
First , let 's talk about prefix , infix and postfix .
Suppose you want to put the argument of a unary function before the function ( postfix ) .
flop :: a -> ( a -> b ) -> b flop x f = f x
The flop function takes two arguments ( binary ) and any such function can be written as infix using the inverted quotes .
x `flop` f
You can write the composite of functions f , g and h ( all unary and with the right types ) as
x `flop` f `flop` g `flop` h
That ain't hard , but what about a function with two arguments ( binary ) ?
Well , as you know , in Haskell them kind of functions are treated like they was two unary functions ( currying ) .
So , because flop is defined for any type , you can write
x ' flop` y `flop` f
Let 's try it out in Hugs or GHCi , with x and y type Double and division ( / ) for the binary function
3.0 `flop` 5.0 `flop` (/)
We get an error message
ERROR - Cannot infer instance *** Instance : Fractional ( a -> b ) *** Expression : flop ( flop 3.0 5.0 ) (/)
Turns out I should have used brackets
3.0 `flop` ( 5.0 `flop` ( / ) )
This works and gets 1.66666666666667 as answer in Hugs .
But it 's not what we want .
The double flop changes f x y into y x f .
We could use the Prelude function flip on ( / ) to get what we really , really want , which is x y f , but we wo n't do that .
We 'll use the lambda notation to force the result , using variable symbols .
3.0 `flop` ( \x -> 5.0 `flop` ( \y -> ( x / y ) ) )
So , can you define a function in this manner too ?
Sure , for example
divdbl :: Double -> Double ->
Double divdbl x y = x `flop`( \u -> y `flop` ( \v -> ( u / v ) ) )
Now , I can imagine some of you are having trouble holding on to the fence , right now , ' cause you 're laughing so hard .
First I 've used postfix notation for a function , then I needed the variables in lambda notation to get me out of a mess , and then I ended up with what I started with !
But the reason is , we 're going to use this flop , or at least something like it , in a very general way in our monads .
So , bear with me , even though it gets even crazier .
Them Haskell boys would rather ride out into a raging blizzard in their longjohns , than do any programming without types .
So , let 's get us a type
newtype Wrapped a = Wrap a
Usually the type constructor and the value constructor get the same name , but we want to show the distinction here .
You wrap a value of type a to get a wrapped type a .
So , the type signature of a wrapped divison of wrapped doubles would be
divwrp :: Wrapped Double -> Wrapped Double ->
Wrapped Double
Now , can we use the definition of divdbl above unchanged ?
Let 's try .
No , we get an error from Hugs .
Instance of Fractional ( Wrapped Double ) required for definition of divwrp
Seems we can't divide wrapped doubles .
We fix this problem by redefining our flop in two ways .
Firstly the definition , of course , but secondly the type of our function f .
To recall , we had
flop :: a -> ( a -> b ) -> b flop x f = f x
Now we replace this with
wrflop :: Wrapped a -> ( a -> Wrapped b ) ->
Wrapped b wrflop ( Wrap x ) f = f x
Note the change , especially in f .
The first argument , of type a , just becomes Wrapped a , and the result , which was type b , becomes Wrapped b.
But f does not go from Wrapped a to Wrapped b , as you 'd perhaps expect , but from a to Wrapped b .
Our function wrflop does not only change prefix to postfix , but also passes the unwrapped value of the argument to f , even though the argument itself is wrapped .
Now , some of you 're smiling and bobbing your heads and nudging one another , ' cause you 've heard this before .
Monads are containers , right ?
Right !
Let 's define a division function with wrapped doubles .
divwrp :: Wrapped Double -> Wrapped Double ->
Wrapped Double divwrp x y = x `wrflop`( \u -> y `wrflop` ( \v -> ( Wrap ( u / v ) ) ) )
Note the Wrap value constructor at the end , which you need to get a Wrapped result .
Run , with Hugs or GHCi
divwrp ( Wrap 3.0 ) ( Wrap 5.0 )
Hugs gives an error message
ERROR - Cannot find " show " function for : *** Expression : divwrp ( Wrap 3.0 ) ( Wrap 5.0 ) ***
Of type : Wrapped Double
All right , that 's just about displaying the result .
We fix this with
instance Show a =>
Show ( Wrapped a ) where show ( Wrap a ) = " Wrapped : " ++ ( show a )
Now the result from Hugs is
Wrapped : 0.6
Just to recall , Show is the Class of all types which can be shown , that is , for which the show function , which evaluates to a String , can be defined .
The actual definition for any particular type is done in an instance definition of Show .
Here we assume that the show function has already been defined for the particular type a .
So all we have to do is give a definition for types Wrapped a .
Before we ride out to get us some monads there 's one other thing we 'd better look at first .
Usually , you do n't want to show the evaluation as a wrapped or monadic type , but you 'll want the unwrapped result .
The old Haskell hands have a trick for this , which is to use named fields in their data and type definitions .
( Recall that a newtype definition is just like a data definition , but with no choice operator ( | ) .
A newtype has only one value constructor . )
So we 'll redefine our Wrapped type
newtype Wrapped a = Wrap {unwrap :: a}
This has nothing to do with monads , but the named field is automatically implemented as an accessor function to the Wrapped type .
So now , without defining the show function , you can use for the wrapped division
unwrap ( divwrp ( Wrap 3.0 ) ( Wrap 5.0 ) )
This gives the expected value 0.6
Round 'em up
Now , I do n't blame you for fidgeting and looking at them horses suspiciously , ' cause you 're starting to smell manure , right ?
You have n't heard one useful thing yet , is what you 're thinking .
Bear with me .
This Wrapped type constructor , which can Wrap any type you like , can itself be parametrized .
So now you have sort of twofold polymorphism , first for your type constructor and second for your type .
Now , if a type constructor is one of them monads , you can say so with
Class Monad m where
and next you specify what 's at least needed for such a type constructor to be a Monad .
Recall the Show Class we had earlier .
This says what is needed for a type to be a member of that class , which is just that there is a function show which takes something of that type as argument , and has a String as its value .
What the function actually is depends on the type , and you specify that in an instance definition .
With Monads it 's the same , but the variable m is not a type .
Recall that each type in Haskell has the same kind ( yep , kind of super type ) denoted by * .
A type constructor takes a kind and returns a kind , so its supertype is * -> * .
Now Monad is just the Class of them type constructors .
When is a type constructor a monad ?
Class Monad m where ( >>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
That 's it , really .
Now look at the wrflop function above .
Get it ?
The directed fish hook , which , by the way , you should call ' bind ' , so 's not to look foolish , reverts the postfix notation and hooks the value out of the container .
Thirdly , and that 's the useful part , the bind can do something different for each different Monad .
All this must be implemented in an instance , of course .
The class just provides the type signature .
Look at the divwrp function again , and note the actual division result had to be wrapped , for type consistency .
We generalize this too , and it's called return
return :: a -> m a
You 'll get the idea of returning the result , which is at the end , in the right type , but keep in mind the return is not like a return in an imperative language like C , or something .
Thirdly , in our Monad class , we have
(>>) :: m a -> m b -> m b ( >>) ( m x ) ( m y ) = ( >>= ) ( m x ) ( \_ -> m y )
You might also see
m >> k = m >>= \_ -> k
Do n't let this throw you out of the saddle !
Substitute m for ( m x ) and k for ( m y ) and look at the infix and prefix positions , and you 'll see the two definitions are the same .
It just means x >> y evaluates to y .
Why in the heck would anyone want to use that ?
Well , it 's when monads are used to model actions , like in input / output .
Then you might want to use a second monadic expression while disregarding the result of the first .
We 'll get to that .
Lastly , there 's a fail function , which is used sometimes , but not often .
fail :: String -> m a fail s = error s
Though we 'll ramble around this , note that apparently the well known error function returns a monadic type !
Note the fail can be overridden in an instance definition .
Also keep in mind the bind and return must obey certain laws , for the definition to work .
For the monads in the GHC library you can assume this has been checked , of course , but if you roll your own .... look at the list example we 'll be talkin ' about later .
All right , all right ... we 'll get us a monad , real soon now , though y'all will probably be disappointed .
It do n't do much at all , no sir !
But first the do notation , forgive the pun .
Bear with me .
Cause you 're all so impatient we 'll skip the pattern matching in the do notation .
The simple case is where we only have names before the arrow .
Then
do x <- e1 ; e2 ; ... ; en
evaluates to
e1 >>= \x -> do e2 ; ...;en
So , it 's essentially a sequence of binds .
Recall the definition of ( >> ) .
Now you see how that seamlessly fits in .
You can also have a let in a do notation .
It 's defined as
do let decllist ; e2 ; ... ; en
which evaluates to
let decllist in do e2 ; ...;
en
So you do n't need the keyword in in a monadic do notation , as you 're used to with the usual function definitions .
It 's already part of the syntactic sugar .
Now , at last , the first monad .
Define the type
newtype Wrapped a = Wrap {unwrap :: a}
Define the bind and return as Monad instances
instance Monad Wrapped where ( >>= )
( Wrap x ) f = f x return x = Wrap x
Note the fishhook is just our wrflop and the return is just our Wrap value constructor .
But now we can rewrite our wrapped division in monadic do notation
divwrp :: Wrapped Double -> Wrapped Double ->
Wrapped Double divwrp x y = do u <- x v <- y return ( u / v )
Run it in Hugs
unwrap ( divwrp ( Wrap 3.0 ) ( Wrap 5.0 ) )
This gives us the usual result 0.6 .
Note we still need the unwrap accessor function to get the value out of the Wrapped type .
Brand 'em
Our Wrapped monad is actually the Identity monad , as defined in the Control .
Monad .
Identity GHC module .
It do n't do much , but now we 're ready for some useful monads !
All you have to do is define your binds and returns ( keeping the laws in mind ) .
Many have already been defined in modules , or even the prelude .
Type Constructor
Maybe
Type Definition
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
Bind and return definitions
instance Monad Maybe where ( >>=)
Nothing f = Nothing ( >>= ) ( Just x ) f = f x return x = Just x
Rationale
The Maybe data type is for functions that might not always work out , like looking for things in a list , or floating point calculations which are not accurate enough for some arguments .
But what if the arguments themselves could or could not be of type Maybe ?
If an argument itself is Nothing , it makes sense to define the result of the function Nothing too , right away .
That 's what the bind does .
If the argument is Just x , the bind hooks the x out of the container and passes it to the function .
The return constructs the Maybe value from a value .
It can only be Just a .
Example
divsumdif : : Double -> Double ->
Maybe Double divsumdif x y | abs ( x - y ) <= 1.0e - 4 = Nothing | otherwise = Just ( ( x +y ) / ( x - y ) ) onediv :: Double -> Maybe Double onediv x | x >= 1.0e+5 || x <= 1.0e - 5 = Nothing | otherwise = Just ( 1.0 / x ) composediv :: Double -> Double ->
Maybe Double composediv x y = do u <- onediv x v <- onediv y divsumdif u v
Running Hugs
composediv ( 1.0/6.0 ) ( 1.0/4.0 ) Just 5.0 composediv 1.0e6 4.0 Nothing
Note the Maybe type apparently already has its show function defined in the Prelude .
Also note the absence of the return function in the example .
Suppose you want divsumdif , knowing there is a possible inaccuracy in the first argument , but the second one is allright .
oneokcompose :: Double -> Double ->
Maybe Double oneokcompose x y = do u <- onediv x divsumdif u y
Hugs
oneokcompose ( 1.0/6.0 ) 4.0 Just 5.0 oneokcompose 1.0e6 4.0 Nothing oneokcompose ( 1.0/4.0 ) 4.0 Nothing
Type Constructor
State s
Type definition
newtype State s a = State { runState :: ( s -> ( a , s ) ) }
Bind and return definitions
instance Monad ( State s ) where ( >>= ) ( State x ) f = State ( \st -> let ( v , ns ) = x st in runState ( f v ) ns ) return x = State ( \s -> ( x , s ) )
Rationale
How `bout that ?
Bet you Java slickers ain't seen nothing like this before !
No , sir !
But recall monadic computation is just function composition in postfix form with some type trickery .
As an aside , them tricks are supposed to keep folks from shootin ' themselves in the foot .
That 's the reason , though it might look strange .
But let 's move on .
A function which uses state is just a function from a type a to a type b , but the result also depends on something else , a state .
Secondly , the function can change the state .
In functional programming you never change anything , but of course you can get a new state as a function result .
So a stateful function itself , before even thinking of a monad , is of type
f :: a -> s -> ( b, s )
It 's a binary function which evaluates to a tuple .
Get it ?
If you take the first argument only , the result is a function which takes a state and returns a tuple .
It 's just currying .
Now you wrap this up in a State .
That 's your definition of the return .
Look at the newtype definition .
This is also kind of binary , right ?
State s a , with s and a of a certain type , is a type .
So ( State s ) is a type constructor .
State is also a type constructor , which evaluate to a type constructor .
It 's just currying with types .
But your monad m a is now monad State s a so you need State s and not State in your instance definition .
The bind function , the fish hook .
What does it do ?
Well , it converts ( m x ) f to f ( m x ) and gives the x to f .
That 's the same for all monads .
Looking again at the type signature for bind in the Monad Class definition , we see the that x >>= f , for this instance , evaluates to type
State ( \s -> ( a , s ) )
In this case x is a function , which takes an s and gives a tuple ( a , s ) , so that 's what we use in the definition
State ( \st -> let ( v , ns ) = x st in ......)
Here v is the value of type a , ns is the new state of type s .
These two are the arguments of our binary function f .
But this is of type
a -> State ( s -> ( b , s ) )
So you have f v , where value v is of type a .
But now , to apply this to argument ns , you must first use the accessor function runState .
So you get
(>>=) ( State x ) f = State ( \st -> let ( v , ns ) = x st in runState ( f v ) ns )
Example
Define a function which turns a character into upper or lower case , depending on a state of true or false .
You need module Data .
Char for this .
chncase :: Char -> Bool -> ( Char , Bool ) chncase x s | s == True = ( ( toLower x ) , False ) | otherwise = ( ( toUpper x ) , True )
With Hugs
chncase ' a' True ( ' a ' , False ) chncase ' a ' False ( ' A ' , True ) chncase ' A ' True ( ' a ' , False ) chncase ' A ' False ( ' A ' , True ) chncase ' A ' ERROR - Cannot find " show " function for : *** Expression : chncase ' A ' ***
Of type : Bool -> ( Char , Bool )
Note that the error just refers to the show function .
Taking just one argument returns a perfectly valid Haskell type .
Redefine the function as a State monad .
chncasewst :: Char -> State Bool Char chncasewst x = State ( \st -> chncase x st )
Note we 've done nothing , except redefine the function with one argument only , and put the State value constructor in front for type correctness .
But now we can use our monad definition of bind and return to compose the function .
chncasewst3 :: Char -> Char -> Char ->
State Bool String chncasewst3 x y z = do u <- chncasewst x v <- chncasewst y w <- chncasewst z return [ u , v, w ]
Look at the type declaration .
It 's a function , which takes a Char , evaluates to a function which takes a Char , evaluates to a function which takes a Char , evalutes to a State Bool String .
This , however , is a function which takes a Bool and evaluates a Char , Bool tuple .
Just for fun , let 's rewrite chncasewst3 with the fish hooks .
chncasewst3 :: Char -> Char -> Char ->
State Bool String chncasewst3 x y z = ( chncasewst x ) >>= ( \u -> ( chncasewst y ) >>= ( \v -> ( chncasewst z ) >>= ( \w -> return [ u , v, w ] ) ) )
Note it 's just postfix composition , with the fish hook doing the work .
To actually get some result from this all , keep in mind it's of type State Bool String .
So , as always , you 'll have to use the accessor function .
If you have not used a named field for your newtype definition , you 'll have to write something yourself .
In this case the content of the result is itself a function , which takes a Bool argument .
So , with Hugs or GHCi
runState ( chncasewst3 'e ' ' d ' 'f ' )
False ( " EdF " , True ) runState ( chncasewst3 ' E ' ' D ' ' F ' )
False ( " EdF " , True ) runState ( chncasewst3 ' E ' ' D ' ' F ' )
True ( " eDf " , False )
Of course , to clean it up , you could write
altcase3 :: Char -> Char -> Char -> Bool ->
String altcase3 x y z tof = charstr where ( charstr , _ ) = runState ( chncasewst3 x y z ) tof
With Hugs
altcase3 ' d ' ' e ' 'f '
True " dEf " altcase3 ' d ' ' e ' 'f '
False " De F "
Now , in this example all the arguments were of the same type .
Course it do n't have to be that way , so long as you use the correct types in your composition .
But if they are of the same type , like here , you can map them monadic functions to a list , like any other function .
Then there 's a special function in the Prelude , called ' sequence ' , which will insert all the binds for you .
In fact , this is so common , there 's a function mapM which does both .
Have another look at
chncasewst :: Char -> State Bool Char chncasewst x = State ( \st -> chncase x st )
Checking the type of mapM with Hugs
:t mapM mapM :: Monad a => ( b -> a c ) -> [ b ] -> a [ c ]
So let 's define
altcasestring :: String ->
State Bool String altcasestring str = mapM chncasewst str
With Hugs
runState ( altcasestring " abcdefg " )
True ( " aBcDeFg " , False ) runState ( altcasestring " abcdefg " )
False ( " AbCdEfG " , True )
As before , you 'd probably put the runState inside yet another function which will take a String and a Boolean and evaluate to a String
altstring2string :: String -> Bool ->
String altstring 2string str tof = altstr where ( altstr , _ ) = runState ( altcasestring str ) tof
Hugs
altstring2string " ABCDEFG " True " aBcDeFg " altstring 2string " ABCDEFG " False " AbCdEfG "
There 's lots more functions and tricks , so you monad cowboys just better look for 'em and start practicing !
Yes , Sir !
Meanwhile , here 's another monad for you .
Type constructor
[ ]
Type definition
the standard Haskell list
Bind and return definitions
instance Monad [ ] where ( >>= ) [ x ] f = concatMap f [ x ] return x = [ x ]
Rationale
If you 're still thinking of monads as special things , now 's the time to change your ways .
The return function takes something of a type a to a list of type a .
The function f takes something of type a to a list of type b.
This is all in the general Monad Class declaration .
The bind here is the standard concatMap function on lists , but in postfix notation .
Example
The instance definition is already in the Prelude , so you can use monadic notation straight away .
cross :: [ a ] -> [ b ] -> [ ( a , b ) ] cross ls1 ls2 = do x <- ls1 y <- ls2 return ( x , y )
Well , this does demonstrate a disadvantage of using the same symbols for all those different monads ( overloading ) .
You must keep track of what your code means when it all looks the same .
Hugs
cross " AB " [ 1,2,3 ] [ ( ' A ' , 1 ) , ( ' A ' , 2 ) , ( ' A ' , 3 ) , ( ' B ' , 1 ) , ( ' B ' , 2 ) , ( ' B ' , 3 ) ]
So the cross function evaluates to the Cartesian product .
Another way to do this would be with list comprehension
cross :: [ a ] -> [ b ] -> [ ( a , b ) ] cross ls1 ls2 = [ ( x , y ) | x <- ls1 , y <- ls2 ]
Hugs
cross " AB " [ 1,2,3 ] [ ( ' A ' , 1 ) , ( ' A ' , 2 ) , ( ' A ' , 3 ) , ( ' B ' , 1 ) , ( ' B ' , 2 ) , ( ' B ' , 3 ) ]
Do n't let the similarities in the two definitions confuse you .
The use of the arrows is just another case of symbol overloading in the Haskell programming language .
List comprehension is not monadic .
Let 's use the list monad to examine the monad laws mentioned earlier .
Each instance of the monad class has to comply with
( m x ) >>= f >>= g = ( m x ) >>= ( \y -> f y >>= g ) ( >>= ) ( return x ) f = f x ( >>= ) ( m x ) return = m x
What does this mean ?
Define two functions ( you need module Data .
Char for this )
f :: Char ->
[ Int ] f x = [ ord x , ord x ] g : : Int -> [ Char ] g y = [ chr y , chr y ]
These are of the right monadic type .
Monadic composition with the bind
gf1 :: [ Char ] -> [ Char ] gf1 ls = ls >>= f >>= g
In do notation
gf1 :: [ Char ] -> [ Char ] gf1 ls = do x <- ls y <- f x g y
Both versions clearly show the composition , but for the do notation you use self named variables .
Hugs gives
gf1 " abc " " aaaabbbbcccc "
The function gf1 quadruples each element in the list , but , just to demonstrate the use of different types in a monadic computation , through the intermediate ord function .
So , what does the notation
( \y -> f y >>= g )
stand for ?
cfg :: Char -> [ Char ] cfg x = ( f x ) >>= g gf2 :: [ Char ] -> [ Char ] gf2 ls = ls >>= ( \y -> cfg y )
In do notation
gf2 :: [ Char ] -> [ Char ] gf2 ls = do x <- ls cfg x
Hugs
gf2 " abc " " aaaabbbbcccc "
So , the first monadic law above states that functions like gf1 and gf2 must always evaluate to the same result .
Monadic composition is associative .
The two laws with the return just say you can slap 'em on at the beginning and the end , even when they 're not needed .
A return is kind of an identity in monadic composition .
So you can write
fm1 :: Char ->
[ Int ] fm1 x = do u <- return x f u fm2 :: Char ->
[ Int ] fm2 x = do u <- f x return u
Hugs
fm1 'a ' [ 97,97 ] fm2 ' a ' [ 97,97 ] f ' a ' [ 97,97 ]

instance Monad ( Reader e ) where return x = Reader ( \e -> x ) ( Reader x ) >>= f = Reader ( \e -> runReader ( f ( x e ) ) e )
Rationale
If you 're still wondering about the State monad , look at this one .
It 's also for a function of some type a which evaluates to a type b , but depends on a second argument .
Other than with State , however , this second argument does not change when the function is evaluated .
The function just reads it .
That 's why it 's called the Reader monad , and the second argument is often referred to as environment .
Example
Because it 's so much like state we 'll use almost the same example .
chncase :: Char -> Bool ->
Char chncase x e | e == True = toLower x | otherwise = toUpper x
Because e is not changed , we do n't have to put it into the result .
The next step is to convert this into a function which evaluates to a Reader Bool Char type .
chncasewrd :: Char ->
Reader Bool Char chncasewrd x = Reader ( \e -> chncase x e )
Now we can define a monadic composition
chncasewrd3 :: Char -> Char -> Char ->
Reader Bool String chncasewrd3 x y z = do u <- chncasewrd x v <- chncasewrd y w <- chncasewrd z return [ u , v, w ]
Hugs
runReader ( chncasewrd3 ' A ' ' B ' ' c ' )
True " abc " runReader ( chncasewrd3 ' A ' ' B ' ' c ' )
False " ABC "
The rest is left as an exercise to the reader .
Sorry , just horsin ' around ...
There are some helper functions which might come in handy .
ask :: Reader e e ask = Reader id
runReader ask is a function which takes something of type e and returns something of type e .
If that function is id , the identity function , the result will be the environment itself .
Hugs
runReader ask [ 1,2,3 ] [ 1,2,3 ]
Often you have a function from the environment , typically some lookup function , like the standard one from the Prelude .
asks :: ( e -> a ) ->
Reader e a asks sel = ask >>= return .
sel
Hugs
runReader ( asks $ lookup 2 ) [ ( 1 , 'a ' ) , ( 2 , 'b ' ) , ( 3, 'c ' ) ]
Just 'b '
You might want to change the environment .
local :: ( e -> e ) ->
Reader e a ->
Reader e a local f c = Reader ( \e -> runReader c ( f e ) )
Here f e is the new environment to apply the Reader on .
Actually , these three functions are defined in the GHC library as instances of a derived class , which is more general , but we do n't care about that here .
Some more horsin ' around now , just to show how it works .
We 'll use sample as the environment .
sample :: [ ( String , Int ) ] sample = [ ( " count " , 3 ) , ( " 1 " ,1 ) , ( " b " , 2 ) ]
The following function uses lookup " count " to get the Int 3 .
The result is a Maybe , so we have to check for Nothing and get the value from Just .
Note the use of fail from the monad class definition , which defaults to error .
The last line of the function returns the result of the comparison of cnt and the length of the list .
countcorrect :: Reader [ ( String , Int ) ]
Bool countcorrect = do maybecnt <- asks ( lookup " count " ) let ok ( Just x ) = return x ok _ = fail " countcorrect : lookup failed " cnt <- ok maybecnt env <- ask return ( cnt == ( length env ) )
Hugs
sample [ ( " count " , 3 ) , ( " 1" ,1 ) , ( " b" ,2 ) ] runReader countcorrect sample True runReader countcorrect [ ( " 1 " , 1 ) , ( " b " ,1 ) ]
Program error : countcorrect : lookup failed
The next function illustrates the use of local .
The function of type ( e -> e ) is the function ( ( " c " , 3 ) :) , which adds the element ( " c " ,3 ) to the front of the list .
newcountcorrect :: Reader [ ( String , Int ) ]
Bool newcountcorrect = local ( ( " c " ,3 ) :) countcorrect
Now the length of the new ( local ) environment list is 4 , so newcountcorrect returns False .
runReader newcountcorrect sample False
Since Reader and State are so similar , you might wonder if there are also helper functions defined for State monads .
Yes , there are .
get :: State s s get = State ( \s -> ( s , s ) ) put : : s -> State s ( ) put s = State ( \_ -> ( ( ) , s ) )
The first one evaluates to a tuple ( s , s ) when given a state s .
The second one is a function which can take anything , and then will have s as the second value of the tuple .
The ( ) is the unit type , which is a sort of void , or null or noop .
Again , these functions can be defined as instances of special classes , but we do n't care here .
Of course , if you run into trouble with my definitions , just import the standard modules you want .
I wo n't mind .
No , sir .
Fact is , I recommend it !
An example of the use of get and put
tick :: State Int
Int tick = do n <- get put ( n+1 ) return n
Hugs
runState tick 5 ( 5,6 )
Cleaning up the tick
increment :: Int ->
Int increment n = snd $ runState tick n
Hugs
increment 5 6
Well , we could go on like this for some more time , I suppose , because there 's many more monads , but I figure enough is enough .
Except for the IO Monad , that is .
Try Hugs
:t getLine getLine :: IO String :t putStrLn putStrLn :: String -> IO ( ) :t putStr putStr :: String -> IO ()
Now , what the heck is goin ' on here ?
Well , there 's a problem with things that do more than just evaluate , in functional programming .
Take putStrLn and putStr , for example .
They take the same input type , but where 's the output ?
It 's out , that 's where !
So how do you express the difference , that is that one adds a newline and the other does not ?
Answer , you can't !
But using monads allows you to model actions just like they were functions .
Recall the trouble we had getting the value out of the State monad ?
Well , with the IO monad you can't get the value .
Actually IO uses a token which is passed , but this is made invisible to the user .
But now you can do all input and output inside the same type , and all other functions , including the monadic ones , are protected from type errors .
module Main where main :: IO ( ) main = do putStrLn " Enter a string : " str <- getLine let nwstr = reverse str putStrLn nwstr
The type of the action , inside the IO ( ) , is the unit type .
As mentioned before , it 's similar to void , null , noop or whatever .
Hugs
main Enter a string : danoM Monad
Rewrite with the bind operator
main :: IO ( ) main = putStrLn " Enter a string : " >> getLine >>= ( \str -> let newstr = reverse str in putStrLn newstr )
Hugs
main Enter a string : danoM Monad
Recall the default definition of the ( >> ) operator in the general Monad Class declaration ?
Here 's an example of its use .
The action getLine , of type IO String , does not operate on the putStrLn before , which outputs the user prompt .
The getLine binds the next function , though , which is the putStrLn which outputs that argument variable .
In between you have the pure functional part , which reverses the string .
So , the IO monad allows for a very clear separation between input / output and the rest .
Of course , normally you would n't use the let for this , but
module Main where main : : IO ( ) main = do putStrLn " Enter a string : " str <- getLine putStrLn ( reverse str )
The result is the same , and you still have a clear separation of your functions and the input of arguments and the output of evaluations .
And because the IO monad can have anything for its inner type , and these have to be correct , you have input / output with all the usual type checking facilities from Hugs and GHC .
You might wonder , why the main all of a sudden ?
No ' special reason , but how many functions are you going to have , which take no arguments and evaluate to the unit type ?
But you could define the same action as useraction , or anything else , if you like .
More useful would be another action , or function , which gets you the string .
userrev :: IO String userrev = do putStrLn " Enter a string : " str <- getLine return ( reverse str )
Hugs
userrev :: IO String Enter a string : Monad
It runs all right , but it wo n't give you an answer !
You can't get the string out of the IO wrapper !
What you can do
main : : IO ( ) main = userrev >>= putStrLn
Look at the bind .
It does exactly what it 's supposed to do , it changes the postfix to prefix and takes the String argument out of the IO String .
Now the putStrLn can use it .
Hugs
main Enter a string : Monad danoM
Breed 'em
Well , y'all know , that if you put a horse and a donkey together , of opposite genders , at the right place and the right time , you might get yourself a mule .
Which is a good thing , because that mule will have the characteristics of both a horse and a donkey !
Monads that can take another monad in such a way , that the results are combined , are called monad transformers .
Any monad is of type m a , and of course the general type a can itself be monadic , say m2 b .
Now a monad transformer is defined in such a way , that it works on the value of the inner monad , b , and not just the m2 b .
To distinguish such a monad transformer from its simpler cousin , it 's called the same , but with a T at the end .
So , you have State and StateT , Reader and ReaderT , and so on .
Note that this is just by convention of the library writers , you can call them anything you like .
The definition of each monad transformer can be different , and not all monads have a transformer .
But monad transformers are monads , so they can be defined in the usual way .
We 'll take StateT as an example .
Type Constructor
StateT s m
Type Definition
newtype StateT s m a = StateT { runStateT :: ( s -> m ( a , s ) ) }
Bind and return definitions
instance ( Monad m ) => Monad ( StateT s m ) where return a = StateT ( \s -> return ( a , s ) ) ( StateT x ) >>= f = StateT ( \s -> do ( v , ns ) <- x s ( StateT nx ) <- return ( f v ) nx ns )
Rationale
The type constructor is like the one for State , but with one extra parameter .
Note that the type definition places the tuple inside the inner monad , not the first element of that tuple .
In general each different monad transformer uses its own type definition .
There is no general structure or design pattern for monad transformers .
The bind and return definitions of StateT use the bind and return of the inner monad , here with the do notation .
The return is just like the one for State , but it takes the return of monad m as its parameter .
The bind should be read the same way .
Again x is a function , running it will evaluate to m ( v , ns ) , therefore ( v , ns ) is the parameter in the lambda notation .
The function takes the value v , the return makes it a monad , and value constructor StateT takes it to the right type .
Now the function nx takes parameter ns .
Yes sir !
Sure looks like a monad rodeo trick to me , but greenhorns can use it easily .
I 'll show ya .
Example
We 'll use the same basic function as with State , but now we 'll check if the character is a letter .
We use Maybe , which is a monad .
The function was
chncase :: Char -> Bool -> ( Char , Bool ) chncase x s | s == True = ( ( toLower x ) , False ) | otherwise = ( ( toUpper x ) , True )
The new version is
mbcase :: Char -> Bool ->
Maybe ( Char , Bool ) mbcase x s | isAlpha x = Just ( chncase x s ) | otherwise = Nothing
Adapt this for use in StateT
mbcasewst :: Char -> StateT Bool Maybe Char mbcasewst x = StateT ( \st -> mbcase x st )
Now we can use monadic function composition
mbcasewst3 :: Char -> Char -> Char ->
StateT Bool Maybe String mbcasewst3 x y z = do u <- mbcasewst x v <- mbcasewst y w <- mbcasewst z return [ u , v, w ]
Hugs
runStateT ( mbcasewst3 'a ' ' b ' ' c ' )
True Just ( " aBc " , False ) runStateT ( mbcasewst3 'a ' ' b ' ' c ' )
False Just ( " AbC " , True ) runStateT ( mbcasewst3 ' 1 ' ' b ' ' c ' )
True Nothing runStateT ( mbcasewst3 'a ' ' b ' ' 3 ' )
True Nothing runStateT ( mbcasewst3 ' 1 ' ' b ' ' 3 ' )
True Nothing
You can use mbcasewst on a list and define everything like an ordinary function
mbaltstr :: String -> Bool ->
Maybe String mbaltstr str tof = case ( runStateT ( mapM mbcasewst str ) tof ) of Nothing -> Nothing Just ( rstr , _ ) ->
Just rstr
Hugs
mbaltstr " abcdefg " True Just " aBcDeFg " mbaltstr " abcdefg " False Just " AbCdEfG " mbaltstr " abc4efg " True Nothing
StateT also has helper functions put and get
get :: ( Monad m ) => StateT s m s get = StateT ( \s -> return ( s , s ) ) put :: ( Monad m ) => s -> StateT s m ( ) put s = StateT ( \_ -> return ( ( ) , s ) )
They 're very similar to the ones for State .
So similar , in fact , their signatures are declared in a MonadState class in the standard library , with the actual definitions as instances of that same MonadState class .
Other monads , like Reader and ReaderT , also use an intermediate class .
These definitions , however , depend on non Haskell 98 features , and are somewhat complicated by themselves , so I 've just skipped that part here .
But be aware , when you 're using the standard library documentation , that they 've done it that way .
There 's a generalized function to let you use a monad in a monad transformer
class MonadTrans t where lift :: ( Monad m ) => m a -> t m a
Its definition for StateT is
instance MonadTrans ( StateT s ) where lift c = StateT ( \s -> c >>= ( \x -> return ( x , s ) ) )
Note that it just puts the state it 's given into the StateT value ( this makes sense , when you think about it ) .
But lift is widely used with monad transformers , and even with StateT it can have its use .
Suppose you have
mbexcl :: Char ->
Maybe Char mbexcl x | x == '!' || x == '?' =
Just x | otherwise = Nothing
Now , using lift , you can use this in our example
mbcasewst4 :: Char -> Char -> Char -> Char ->
StateT Bool Maybe String mbcasewst4 x y z ec = do u <- mbcasewst x v <- mbcasewst y w <- mbcasewst z p <- lift ( mbexcl ec ) return [ u , v, w , p ]
Hugs
runStateT ( mbcasewst4 'a ' ' b ' ' c ' '? ')
True Just ( " aBc ? " , False ) runStateT ( mbcasewst4 'a ' ' b ' 'c ' ' 4 ' )
True Nothing runStateT ( mbcasewst4 'a ' ' b ' ' c ' ' d ')
True Nothing
You can also use monad transformers with IO .
This is special , because you can't get a result out of an IO monad .
There is no runIO accessor function .
Recall this is done on purpose , to keep input / output apart from the functions .
For the same reason there 's no IOT monad transformer .
To use standard IO with a transformer monad you use liftIO , which is , for each case , an instance of the MonadIO class .
class ( Monad m ) => MonadIO m where liftIO :: IO a -> m a
If you import Control .
Monad .
Trans you do n't even have to bother with the actual definition .
Note , however , that to use the transformer library with Hugs you need to use the - 98 option .
There 's another house keeping note .
In the following example it would be natural to use getChar , but then you need to specify unbuffered IO , because else the input will be cluttered with newlines .
We avoid this by using getLine , and taking the head for the input character .
Finally , if you want the actual instance definition , you 'll have to dig into the GHC source code .
The documentation appears to be broken here .
Now , using chncase as defined above , we define
iocase :: Bool -> IO ( Char , Bool ) iocase s = getLine >>= ( \str -> return ( chncase ( head str ) s ) ) iocasewst :: StateT Bool IO Char iocasewst = StateT ( \s -> iocase s)
This is almost exactly like the example with Maybe .
Monadic composition with some user prompts
iocasewst3 :: StateT Bool IO String iocasewst3 = do liftIO $ putStrLn " Three Characters " liftIO $ putStrLn " First . . " u <- iocasewst liftIO $ putStrLn " Second . . " v <- iocasewst liftIO $ putStrLn " Third .. " w <- iocasewst return [ u , v, w ]
Note the use of liftIO for putStrLn with its argument .
If you experiment with this in Hugs or GHCi , using runStateT with argument True or False , you 'll have a problem .
You can't get the result out of the IO .
To actually see the result you need something like
display :: StateT Bool IO String -> Bool -> IO ( ) display x s = do u <- ( runStateT x ) s print u
or the shorter equivalent
display x s = ( ( runStateT x ) s ) >>= print
Now a Hugs session could be
display iocasewst3 True Three Characters First .. a Second .. b Third .. c ( " aBc " , False )
Let 's breed some more monads ...
Type Constructor
WriterT w m
Type Definition
newtype WriterT w m a = WriterT {runWriterT :: m ( a , w ) }
Bind and return definitions
instance ( Monoid w , Monad m ) => Monad ( WriterT w m ) where return a = WriterT $ return ( a , mempty ) m >>= f = WriterT $ do ( a , w ) <- runWriterT m ( b , nw ) <- runWriterT ( f a ) return ( b , w `mappend` nw )
Rationale
The WriterT transformer , and the Writer monad , which we 've skipped , but will use later , are mostly used to add a small log message to a function result .
In a monadic composition these messages are then automatically appended .
The type of a log message is usually String , mempty is [ ] , and infix mappend is string concatenation .
Likewise for any other list .
But a monoid , implemented in Data .
Monoid , is more general .
A monoid consists of an associative binary operator , and a neutral element .
List concatenation is a monoid , but so is addition over types in Num ( with 0 as the neutral ) and multiplication over types in Num ( with 1 as the neutral ) .
So , you can do more with Writer and WriterT than append log messages .
Just so you know .
Example
We 'll start with this ( like before ) , to change the case of letters .
Then we 'll use WriterT as the outer monad transformer , and State as the inner monad .
chncase :: Char -> Bool -> ( Char , Bool ) chncase x s | s == True = ( ( toLower x ) , False ) | otherwise = ( ( toUpper x ) , True )
To add a log message , we must use
logchncase :: Char -> Bool -> ( ( Char , String ) , Bool ) logchncase x s | s == True = ( ( ( toLower x ) , " Low " ) , False ) | otherwise = ( ( ( toUpper x ) , " Up " ) , True )
This adds a log message .
Why change the types like this ?
Look at the bind and return definitions for WriterT .
If we use a State monad , then the return of an a is a function s -> ( a , s ) ( skipping the State value constructor ) .
But the WriterT definition says that the return of this transformer monad is the return of the inner monad , applied to the tuple ( a , mempty ) .
We will use String for the log message , so we need a tuple ( Char , String ) to be able to construct the two monads from the non monadic base function .
First the State monad .
statecase :: Char -> State Bool ( Char , String ) statecase x = State ( \s -> logchncase x s )
Nothing new here .
And now the WriterT monad transformer
logstatecase :: Char ->
WriterT String ( State Bool ) Char logstatecase x = WriterT ( statecase x )
Yeeehah ....
Hugs
runState ( runWriterT ( logstatecase ' a ' ) )
True ( ( 'a ' , " Low " ) , False ) runState ( runWriterT ( logstatecase ' a ' ) )
False ( ( ' A ' , " Up " ) , True )
Watch the order of runWriterT and runState .
Recall the notion of monads as packages or containers ?
You pack from inner to outer , you unpack from outer to inner .
Of course , the purpose of all this processing of the base function is to enable monadic composition .
For example
logstatecase3 :: Char -> Char -> Char ->
WriterT String ( State Bool )
String logstatecase3 x y z = do u <- logstatecase x v <- logstatecase y w <- logstatecase z return [ u , v, w ]
Using the accessor functions runWriterT and runState as before , we now see that not only the State bind is applied , but also the WriterT bind .
runState ( runWriterT ( logstatecase3 'a ' ' b ' ' c ' ) )
True ( ( " aBc " , " Low Up Low " ) , False ) runState ( runWriterT ( logstatecase3 ' a ' ' b ' ' c ' ) )
False ( ( " AbC " , " Up Low Up " ) , True )
The second example is similar , but now we use the StateT transformer , defined above , and the Writer monad .
The definitions for the Writer monad are
newtype Writer w a = Writer {runWriter :: ( a, w ) } instance ( Monoid w ) => Monad ( Writer w ) where return a = Writer ( a , mempty ) m >>= f = Writer $ let ( a , w ) = runWriter m ( b , nw ) = runWriter ( f a ) in ( b , w `mappend` nw )
With StateT and Writer the base function must be different from the one with WriterT and State .
The definition of the StateT return , of a value a , uses the return of tuple ( a , s ) .
But this inner return is , for the Writer monad , a tuple ( a , w ) , so the combination is a combined tuple ( ( a , s ) , w ) .
The base function is
altlogchncase :: Char -> Bool -> ( ( Char , Bool ) , String ) altlogchncase x s | s == True = ( ( ( toLower x ) , False ) , " Low " ) | otherwise = ( ( ( toUpper x ) , True ) , " Up " )
We must construct the Writer on the result of the function
logcase :: Char -> Bool -> Writer String ( Char , Bool ) logcase = ( \ x s -> Writer ( altlogchncase x s ) )
This must be changed to a StateT type
statelogcase :: Char -> StateT Bool ( Writer String )
Char statelogcase x = StateT ( \s -> logcase x s )
Another monad down !
Yeeehah ....
Hugs again ..
runWriter ( runStateT ( statelogcase 'a ' ) True ) ( ( 'a ' , False ) , " Low " ) runWriter ( runStateT ( statelogcase 'a ' ) False ) ( ( ' A ' , True ) , " Up " )
An example of monadic composition .
statelogcase3 :: Char -> Char -> Char -> StateT Bool ( Writer String )
String statelogcase3 x y z = do u <- statelogcase x v <- statelogcase y w <- statelogcase z return [ u , v, w ]
Looks pretty much like the other one .
Well , with monads , that 's the idea , is n't it ?.
Hugs ..
runWriter ( runStateT ( statelogcase3 'a ' ' b ' ' c ' ) True ) ( ( " aBc " , False ) , " Low Up Low " ) runWriter ( runStateT ( statelogcase3 ' a ' ' b ' ' c ' ) False ) ( ( " AbC " , True ) , " Up Low Up " )
In this example , usage of StateT with Writer is equivalent to WriterT and State , but in general the order of application may lead to very different results .
As a note , the inner monad can itself be a monad transformer , with an inner monad , so with transformers you can breed real monster monads , if you 're so inclined .
Drive 'em
When monads have the same type , they can be put in a list , and in the Prelude there is a general function for that
sequence :: Monad a => [ a b ] -> a [ b ]
So , this takes a list of monads , and evaluates to a monad of a list .
The definition is
sequence :: Monad m => [ m a ] -> m [ a ] sequence = foldr mcons ( return [ ] ) where mcons p q = do x <- p xs <- q return ( x:xs )
The usage is pretty simple .
Recall the example earlier with the State monad
chncase :: Char -> Bool -> ( Char , Bool ) chncase x s | s == True = ( ( toLower x ) , False ) | otherwise = ( ( toUpper x ) , True ) chncasewst :: Char -> State Bool Char chncasewst x = State ( \st -> chncase x st )
Define a list
stbcls :: [ State Bool Char ] stbcls = map chncasewst " abcdefg "
Now , with sequence , you can evaluate this with no further ado ... ha , ha ..
runState ( sequence stbcls ) True ( " aBcDeFg " , False )
Fact is , it 's so common to map monads to some list and sequence them , there 's a short cut , called mapM
mapM :: Monad m => ( a -> m b ) -> [ a ] -> m [ b ] mapM f ls = sequence ( map f ls )
So , with Hugs , or GHCi , of course
runState ( mapM chncasewst " abcdefg " )
True ( " aBcDeFg " , False )
Both sequence and mapM have versions with an underscore at the end .
sequence_ :: Monad m => [ m a ] -> m ( ) sequence_ = foldr ( >>) ( return ( ) ) mapM_ :: Monad m => ( a -> m b ) -> [ a ] -> m () mapM_ f ls = sequence_ ( map f ls )
So , these do not return anything , that is , they return the unit value , of the unit type .
This is what you want when performing I/O .
So , for example
mapM_ print [ 1..3 ] 1 2 3
These functions also work with monad transformers , of course .
Recall the definitions used earlier
mbcase :: Char -> Bool ->
Maybe ( Char , Bool ) mbcase x s | isAlpha x = Just ( chncase x s ) | otherwise =
Nothing mbcasewst :: Char -> StateT Bool Maybe Char mbcasewst x = StateT ( \st -> mbcase x st )
Note that , in the following , we must use runStateT , and not runState
runStateT ( mapM mbcasewst " abcdefg " ) True Just ( " aBcDeFg " , False ) runStateT ( mapM mbcasewst " abc_defg " )
True Nothing
A list is a monad too .
Recall the cross function we defined to get Cartesian products of lists ?
If these lists have the same type , we can put them in a list and use sequence
sequence [ " AB " , " . " , " 12 " , " . " , " abc " ] [ " A.1.a " , " A.1.b " , " A.1.c " , " A.2.a " , " A.2.b " , " A.2.c " , " B.1.a " , " B.1.b " , " B.1.c " , " B.2.a " , " B.2.b " , " B.2.c " ] sequence [ [ 1,2 ] , [ 3,4 ] , [ 5,6,7 ] ] [ [ 1,3,5 ] , [ 1,3,6 ] , [ 1,3,7 ] , [ 1,4,5 ] , [ 1,4,6 ] , [ 1,4,7 ] , [ 2,3,5 ] , [ 2,3,6 ] , [ 2,3,7 ] , [ 2,4,5 ] , [ 2,4,6 ] , [ 2,4,7 ] ]
Right at the beginning we talked about flopping a function first and then using it to get something out of a monad .
Well , there 's also a flip to this fishook or bind .
Compare the following
cross1 ls1 ls2 = do x <- ls1 y <- ls2 return ( x , y ) cross2 ls1 ls2 = ls1 >>= ( \x -> ls2 >>= ( \y -> return ( x , y ) ) ) cross3 ls1 ls2 = ( \x -> ( \y -> return ( x , y ) ) =<< ls2 ) =<< ls1 cross4 ls1 ls2 = ( =<<) ( \x -> ( =<<) ( \y -> return ( x , y ) ) ls2 ) ls1 cross5 ls1 ls2 = concatMap ( \x -> concatMap ( \y -> [ ( x , y ) ] ) ls2 ) ls1
They are all the same , for lists that is .
But look at how the flow of cross2 is more natural than the one in cross3 .
However , suppose you have an application , like
z x = h( g ( f x ) ) )
You would probably write this as
z x = h $ g $ f x
but you can't do that when the argument is a monad m x and f , g and h have type a -> m b and the like .
But you can use ( = << ) for this
z ( m x ) = h = << g = << f ( m x )
Now , of course this suggests point free programming with monads .
The above function with ( $ ) would become
z = h . g . f
and for monads you use
(<=<) :: Monad m => ( b -> m c ) -> ( a -> m b ) -> a -> m c z = h < =< g < =< f
This is called right to left Kleisli composition of monads .
You 'll have to admit , this sounds really nice .
And , obviously , there 's also a right to left Kleisli composition
(>=>) :: Monad m => ( a -> m b ) -> ( b -> m c ) -> a -> m c
This is more like the fish hook or bind we have all come to love .
Now take a look at the monad laws again
return >=> f == f f >=> return == f ( f >=> g ) >=> h == f>= > ( g >=> h )
These laws become very clear now .
' Cherchez la type ' , if you 'll pardon my French .
Before we move on , please note again the directions of the two variants .
In the second one , the rightmost function is also the last one to be applied .
If you take the functions as points ( or objects ) and ( >= > ) as arrows ( or morphisms ) you can write the composition as a triangle .
Yes , that 's right , it 's a category , referred to as the Kleisli category by many saloon regulars .
But note that composition only works within the same monad , so there are in fact many different Kleisli categories .
Hmmm ... what about monad transformers ... I do n't know , actually .
But feel free to join in when you figure it out !
Yes , Sir !
Anyway , the flipped Kleisli variant , which we discussed first , follows conventional function composition , with the leftmost the last to be applied .
Now , for something completely different , as our Python friends would say .
There are several related functions , called liftM , lift M2 etc. , up to lift M5 , that take functions , with the arities suggested by the names , to functions of monads of the arguments .
For example
liftM :: ( Monad m ) => ( a -> b ) -> ( m a -> m b ) liftM f x = do a <- x return ( f a ) lift M2 :: ( Monad m ) => ( a -> b -> c ) -> ( m a -> m b -> m c ) lift M2 f x y = do a 1 <- x a 2 <- y return ( f a 1 a2 )
These are not to be confused with the lift functions used for monad transformers .
The liftM function is actually identical to the fmap , which is declared in the Functor class definition .
Every monad is also a functor , even an applicative functor .
Yep ... that 's right .
Another monadic function is called ap .
ap :: ( Monad m ) => m ( a -> b ) -> m a -> m b ap mf mx = do f <- mf x <- mx return ( f x )
Now , liftM , return and ap can be used more generally than with monads .
Unfortunately , these classes are not very well integrated in the Haskell language libraries , as yet .
So , you use fmap for functors , ( < $ > ) for applicative functors , and liftM for monads , even though they 're all the same .
You use ' pure ' for applicative functors and ' return ' for monads .
You also use ( <*> ) for applicative functors and ' ap ' for monads .
Of course you can define monads as instances of functors and applicative functors , or even use the WrappedMonad type constructor , which is defined in the Control .
Applicative library .
Impressed ?
Intimidated even ?
No worries , mate !
When you 're drivin ' monads out on that Haskell trail , you just fake it till you make it !
So , consider the following function , which uses the monadic parser from the Text .
ParserCombinators .
Parsec library , shipped with GHC and Hugs .
You also need to import Control .
Monad and , for Hugs , use the - 98 flag .
p_abc :: Parser String p_abc = do as <- many ( char ' a ' ) let n = length as bs <- pnTimes n ( char ' b ' ) cs <- pnTimes n ( char ' c ' ) return ( as ++ bs ++ cs ) pnTimes :: Int ->
Parser a ->
Parser [ a ] pnTimes 0 p = return [ ] pnTimes n p = ( :) `liftM` p `ap` pnTimes ( n - 1 ) p
As you can see , Parser String is a monad , and though it 's hidden in the type synonym , because that feature is not used here , a general parser ( in Parsec ) can even take a user state .
It 's very easy , for example , to add the number of parsed tokens using this feature ( not used here ) .
The function ' many ' is standard in Parsec and parses zero or more of something , here the character ' a ' .
The function p_abc recognizes strings beginning with 0 or more letters ' a ' , followed by as many lettrs ' b ' and ' c ' .
Because the parser is a monad it can use the count of the ' a ' letters it has seen , and compare that with what 's coming next .
To run a Parsec parser interactively you need parseTest , as shown below , but that 's just for displaying the result .
parseTest p_abc " aaabbbccc " " aaabbbccc " parseTest p_abc " aaaaabbbbbccccc " " aaaaabbbbbccccc " parseTest p_abc " aaaaabbccccc " parse error at ( line 1 , column 8 ) : unexpected " c " expecting " b "
Note the usage of liftM and ap , both in infix notation .
This is a very common combination , which can be extended to functions of arbitrary arity .
So , you do n't really need lift M2 and so on .
You can also use liftM followed by the appropriate number of ap's .
Well , folks , that 's it .
Sure , there 's lots more to discuss , but I hope you 'll agree , by now , that them monads ain't scary , like rattlesnakes .
What the heck , I even overheard one trail boss referring to them as warm , cuddly things ... well , now !
But them Haskell boys have come up with many useful monads and remember , you can easily define one yourself .
So long as you do n't forget to check the monad laws !
You can breed with monads to get new combinations .
You can use all the notation and all the predefined functions .
Finally , you can treat them as applicative functors too , and use some handy functions to get them in line .
So , thinkin ' again , maybe them monads are cute little critters after all !
Yes Sir , maybe they are !
For further reading , I recommend Brent Yorgey 's article ' The Typeclassopedia ' in the Monad Reader 13 .
The reference monad tutorial is ' All about Monads ' by Jeff Newbern .
Henk - Jan van Tuyl has compiled a handy ' Tour of the Haskell Monad Functions ' .
To study monad usage in the wild , look at Parsec and read the ' Parsec , a fast combinator parser ' tutorial , by Daan Leijen .
Not to forget the obvious , the new book ' Real World Haskell ' by O'Sullivan , Goerzen and Stewart , covers monads extensively .

The researchers modelled how molecular clouds are sucked into black holes
Astronomers have shed light on how stars can form around a massive black hole , defying conventional wisdom .
Scientists have long wondered how stars develop in such extreme conditions .
Molecular clouds - the normal birth places of stars - would be ripped apart by the immense gravity , a team explains in Science magazine .
But the researchers say stars can form from elliptical discs - the relics of giant gas clouds torn apart by encounters with black holes .
They made the discovery after developing computer simulations of giant gas clouds being sucked into black holes like water spiralling down a plughole .
" These simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy , " said co-author Ian Bonnell from St Andrews University , UK .
Ripped apart
Their findings are in accordance with actual observations in our Milky Way galaxy that indicate the presence of a massive black hole , surrounded by huge stars with eccentric orbits .
The simulations , performed on a supercomputer - and taking over a year of computing time - followed the evolution of two separate giant gas clouds up to 100,000 times the mass of the Sun , as they fell towards the supermassive black hole .
The simulations show how the clouds are pulled apart by the immense gravitational pull of the black hole .
The disrupted clouds form into spiral patterns as they orbit the black hole ; the spiral patterns remove motion energy from gas that passes close to the black hole and transfers it to gas that passes further out .
This allows part of the cloud to be captured by the black hole while the rest escapes .
In these conditions , only high mass stars are able to form and these stars inherit the eccentric orbits from the elliptical disc .
These results match the two primary properties of the young stars in the centre of our galaxy : their high mass and their eccentric orbits around the supermassive black hole .
" That the stars currently present around the galaxy 's supermassive black hole have relatively short lifetimes of [ about ] 10 million years , which suggests that this process is likely to be repetitive , " Professor Bonnell explained .
" Such a steady supply of stars into the vicinity of the black hole , and a diet of gas directly accreted by the black hole , may help us understand the origin of supermassive black holes in our and other galaxies in the Universe . "

What are these ?
Time is a vital constituent of life … so time saving activities are life saving .
The best way to save time is to simply do things right the first time .
Confucius once said , “ Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done properly . ”
In other words , haste makes waste .
If you agree with these statements , you will find value in the remainder of this article .
Here are 25 sharp cuts of time saving wisdom from around the blogosphere .
Each links back to a source article containing additional insight .
Enjoy .
Men talk of killing time , while time quietly kills them .

Here ’s another great war graphic , courtesy of Yasha Levine at eXile .
This one shows every coalition casualty as a red drop , so like Yasha wrote me , you see this blood rain falling on a map of Iraq as the days click by from the invasion in the spring of 2003 right through 2007 .
And it really is like rain : first the storm front comes through , up from the Gulf dripping through Basra and up the river valleys all the way to Mosul .
But once the occupation settles in — you may remember that was when we were getting out our suntan lotion and expecting fine weather — the rain started falling hard .
And like the map shows , the “ rain ” in Iraq falls mainly on the plain .
It ’s nothing but red drops , big ones , over Baghdad from start to finish .
You ’ll notice some other interesting precipitation patterns , like how blood - free Kurdistan is .
That ’s got to be a first in history , a blood - free Kurdish region .
And the Shia towns down toward Basra only get a light pink drizzle too , just because those Sunni suicide bombers figured why waste your last day behind the wheel on a long boring trip down south ?
Much easier to put the DVD on AC / DC , gun it to a nearby Shia town and ask directions to the nearest religious procession .
Since 2003 , people do n’t really get that holiday feeling in Karbala or Najaf unless there ’s the tang of BBQ in the air and the jolly kabooms of Plymouths going up in 500 pounds of ammonium nitrate .
There are cool sound fx with each little drop that splatters too , sort of a click , like a detonator .
If you watch the dates zoom by and you know your Iraq timeline , you ’ll be ready for a big castanet - solo of clicks when April 2004 rolls around .
That was the month we lost 141 troops , and even the yay - sayers almost admitted , for the first time , that OK , maybe it was n’t just a few of Saddam ’s cousins being sore losers .

The summer of 2007 was a washout - literally so for people in Gloucestershire , Herefordshire , Yorkshire and beyond , who suffered severe flooding .
Autumn weather alternated between further rainfall and plunging temperatures .
The glorious summer days and fiery autumn colours of 2005 and 2006 seemed a fond memory .
Poor weather was matched by growing unease in the British middle class as 2007 turned into 2008 .
On every front , its living standards , status and career prospects were threatened , along with such objects of affection as the value of its homes and its children 's education .
Life was still sweet for the New Olympians , the pampered rich who run the country 's biggest companies and financial institutions .
But Middle Britain , that union of the traditional professional middle class and the much wider group of " aspirant " households , was facing the stark possibility that 15 or more years of prosperity were drawing to a close .
Worse , its members could have been forgiven a sneaking feeling that they were now the target of the sort of asset stripping that had been visited on the nation 's factory workers , on those employed in " primary " industries such as farming , fishing and mining , and on small shopkeepers , thousands of whom had been driven out of business by supermarkets .
Indeed , on the subject of supermarkets , lawyers learned this time last year that they had a new competitor .
" Tesco , " the Sunday Telegraph reported , " is plotting to take on high - street solicitors by launching a property conveyancing service ...
The move is likely to see a call centre - type operation offering shoppers a low - cost , computerised service . "
Lest anyone comfort themselves with the thought that property conveyancing is a pretty standardised service , and that a supermarket 's incursion into the market is nothing about which to get excited , beware .
The Labour government 's " liberalisation " of the legal system , due to take full effect by 2011 , aims to allow all legal advice , not merely conveyancing , to be dispensed from booths in supermarkets .
Not for nothing have the " reforms " been dubbed " Tesco law " .
As with the City of London 's " Big Bang " changes in 1986 , " Tesco law " allows firms of solicitors to seek outside investment and even have their shares listed on a stock market .
This parallel was made explicit in an authoritative news report on November 9 , headed " Law firms gear up for their own Big Bang " .
" Observers inside and outside the profession , " reported the Financial Times , " say the very act of selling out would destroy the value of the business , as young lawyers who had been aiming to become partners would immediately leave and go into a better - paid industry such as banking .
Young lawyers would stay only if the new owners raised pay sharply so that salaries and bonuses were competitive with those at leading investment banks . "
This , of course , is precisely what happened to the stockbroking and stock - jobbing professions after Big Bang .
Partners sold out for huge sums and firms were absorbed into anonymous , all - purpose " investment banks " .
With the checks and balances of the partnership system replaced by bonus - driven salary packages , the way was clear for " rogue traders " , most famously Nick Leeson , whose reckless gambles brought the bank Barings to its knees .
Nor was the law the only middle - class profession to face the asset strippers in 2007 .
In early November , the Heart of Birmingham primary care trust announced plans to let private firms run general practitioners ' surgeries .
According to the trust , Asda and Tesco had expressed an interest , as had Sir Richard Branson 's Virgin group .
As the Sun reported , " the trust said the non-health organisations ... were confident they can replicate the best aspects of the GP partnership 's relationship with its patients .
They do this with their customers on a daily basis . "
The British Medical Association attacked the proposal , with one member of the GP Committee claiming that " continuity of care " for patients would be disrupted if the private firms took over surgeries , while some smaller practices would be forced out of business .
By the early weeks of this year , the government was in a confrontation with family doctors over extended opening hours for surgeries .
From the doctors ' ranks came murmurings that this was merely a dummy run for a much bigger battle , started by ministers , to force doctors into anonymous " polyclinics " run by private companies .
On January 29 the London Evening Standard reported : " A private American health firm has won control of three GP surgeries in London .
The deal with United Health Europe opens the way to the privatisation of family doctors ' practices .
It comes after a government push to put primary care into corporate hands .
Doctors have warned that patients could suffer as conglomerates offer ' cut - price deals to win contracts ' . "
If that sounded an extraordinary sell - out by a supposedly Labour government , it was of a piece with the news on January 28 that commercial companies were for the first time to be allowed to award nationally recognised qualifications based on their own workplace training schemes .
In a parody - defying move , the government announced that the first three accredited schemes would be run by the burger chain McDonald 's , the airline Flybe and the train track operator Network Rail .
The Guardian that day reported : " Staff at McDonald 's will gain the equivalent of A - levels in running burger restaurants after the fast - food giant won government approval to become an exam board . "
Elsewhere , plans to slash the Post Office network were being finalised .
Of the 14,000 - strong branch network , 2,500 were to close , leaving customers and communities stranded .
The Telegraph described it as " an act of community vandalism " that would " rip the hearts out of many of our small towns and villages " .
For generations , the job of sub - postmaster and sub- postmistress has been part of the very backbone of middle - class respectability .
Yet despite the terrible sadness of the destruction now being wreaked on the Royal Mail , the way it came about is instructive .
The Conservative government of the early 1990s announced plans to privatise the Post Office , but backed down in the face of enormous public protest .
Undaunted , ministers and bureaucrats merely put the country 's name to a European Union scheme to liberalise all EU postal services , which would have much the same effect without too much in the way of pesky public debate .
When the branch closure programme - coupled with the abolition of second deliveries - evoked protest , the Royal Mail and the government were able to claim they had no choice , as the service had to be made leaner and fitter in order to compete with both private delivery organisations and foreign post offices .
Lawyers , GPs , sub-postmasters ... like bewildered characters in a superior television thriller , all seem destined by some shadowy authority for punishment for crimes the nature of which has never really been spelled out .
Nor are they alone .
The bank manager , in times gone by a pillar of the community , has virtually disappeared in his old form .
Lending decisions have been almost entirely centralised , using complex computer risk - assessment systems .
Managers and staff are expected to concentrate on selling financial products - insurance , savings , investments and the like .
If the unrestrained free market threatens the status and earnings of the middle class on one flank , the activities of government mandarins pose quite a different threat on another .
Next in the affections of the denizens of Middle Britain to the value of their homes ( and often linked intimately with that value ) is their children 's education .
Since the late 1980s , the official emphasis has been on parental choice within the state system .
By last year , however , it was becoming clear that , in the wonderful world of public education , " choice " was not meant to involve actually choosing anything .
Indeed , making effective school choices was thought to be vaguely reprehensible .
In November the admissions regulator , Dr Philip Hunter , declared that schools should select pupils by lottery to prevent middle - class parents monopolising the best comprehensives .
The policy should be used even if " deeply unpopular with groups of articulate parents " .
The Department for Children , Schools and Families broadly agreed with Hunter .
That in doing so it was tacitly admitting that parents , rich and poor , would try to avoid like the plague a large number of the schools for which it was directly responsible would not be lost on Hunter 's " articulate parents " - or even , perhaps , on the inarticulate ones .
At this point , the neutral observer may find his sympathies starting to drift .
Does not the school lottery affair highlight a problem with going to the defence of Middle Britain at this time ?
Is it not merely a defence of semi-closed shop arrangements that may be agreeable to those on the inside but less so to those who are not ?
After all , if Tesco can provide cheap legal advice from a corner booth and medical services in a similar ( albeit , one would hope , rather more private ) location , what is so wrong with that ?
We would argue on four grounds that there is likely to be a great deal wrong with it .
First , from the customers ' point of view there is little - indeed , no - reason to believe that the public , as a whole , will enjoy better or cheaper professional services from corporate providers than they do from local partnerships .
Some of these providers will doubtless seek to cherry - pick the best customers , as ( quite legitimately ) did the pioneering telephone insurance service Direct Line and its banking equivalent First Direct .
Those customers will receive favourable offers .
The others will not , being offered instead standardised " quickie " services .
In law and medicine , in particular , where personal advice and consultation are so vital to the provision of the service , this could prove a very bad deal indeed .
Second , the transformation of independent professionals , who are effectively self - employed , into salaried corporate employees will be bad for everybody .
It will rob ordinary people of sources of confidential service and bloat further the power of large corporations .
Professionals provide an important counterweight to other forms of power , and can assert their independence in ways that corporate employees cannot .
Pro bono work is different in kind from PR - driven " corporate social responsibility " .
Third , an independent professional class has value beyond its utility as a source of advice and as a bulwark against the power of companies and the state .
It provides a continuum within which aspirations can be satisfied while delivering a public service .
If social tranquility matters more than shareholder value , the independent professional class should be shielded from corporate and other depredations , not exposed to them .
Fourth , as we have said before , if these dumbed - down , commoditised , supposedly cheap , corporately owned services are so good , why do we rarely hear of members of the wealthy elite using them ?
Why do the New Olympians prefer to stick with the traditional one - to - one relationship with doctors or solicitors ?
The reply could be that they can afford it ; but so , at present , can most people , thanks to the ways in which the National Health Service and the legal profession are structured .
The local GP 's surgery may be down at heel compared to the Harley Street consulting room , but the two are fundamentally the same thing .
School lotteries may appear to raise a separate issue , involving as they do the middle class solely as a user of one particular type of public service .
But the neat symmetry of the whole affair is a near - perfect illustration of the way in which Middle Britain has been " had " .
For 10 years , the government supported the whole notion of parental choice while suggesting it would become increasingly irrelevant as all schools were steadily improved .
With the lottery , the illusion is ended - the government opposes the whole notion of parental choice precisely because it exposes the fact that there has been no such improvement .
Middle Britain has been conned , well and truly .
Where did all the money go ?
By no stretch of the imagination could the public sector be considered to be starved of cash .
In the eight years between 1999 - 2000 and 2007 - 2008 , public spending in Britain rose by 29 % when adjusted for inflation .
Even so , the local police station that was once open 24 hours a day , seven days a week , is now open only between 8 am and 4 pm and closed all day Monday .
The local sub - post office is closing for good , the library is short of books , and the weekly refuse collection is fortnightly .
Voters supported the increase in spending : they had been unhappy at the shabby state of the public realm in 1997 and wanted to see extra investment .
They now want to know what has happened to all the money .
The government 's answer is twofold .
First , it says the money has led to an improvement in services , which is true but only up to a point .
Given the colossal increase in spending - particularly on health and education - it would have been miraculous had there been no benefits ; the question is whether the improvement matched the scale of the investment .
Sad to say , it does not .
In the NHS , for example , productivity has been falling ; in education , there is no evidence that extra money has meant higher achievement .
The government argues that , after the hard rations of the 18 years of Conservative rule , it will take time for the extra money to show up in higher productivity .
While stretching the boundaries of plausibility , this explanation is a lot more convincing than the second reason for the economies made by ministers , namely that they have a duty to make sure that precious resources are spent as efficiently as possible .
If that means temporary opening hours at police stations that might have only two callers a day , or the closure of " uneconomic " post offices , then so be it .
This is undermined by the glaring examples of New Labour 's non-efficiency once big corporate and financial interests become involved .
These include the £ 2bn bail - out for the failed Underground maintenance contractor Metronet ; the doubling of the cost of the new IT system for the NHS from £ 6bn to £ 12bn ; and the systematic closure of hospital beds to pay the fees on Private Finance Initiative contracts .
Clearly , there have been beneficiaries of the surge in public spending over the past eight years .
It is , however , not immediately apparent that the real gainers have been either the public or those at the sharp end - the nurses , the refuse collectors , the librarians , or the police .
Labour used to be accused of allowing producer interests to " capture " the public sector .
It is still open to that charge .
But now the producer interests in question have bigger salaries , drive more expensive cars , and appear to have been singularly unsuccessful in delivering for the public .

COSTA MESA , Calif . 
A specter from the grittier past of skateboarding has reappeared , ready to reconnect with his past without letting it drag him down .
The X Games are scheduled to begin in Los Angeles on Thursday , and Jay Adams , whose skateboarding career has been the subject of two major films , wants to attend .
Adams , 47 , does not compete anymore , but he hopes to watch and visit with friends he has not seen in years .
More important , he wants to reunite with his wife and a daughter he has never seen outside of prison .
The decision about the X Games will not be up to him .
The relationship with his family will be .
Adams was transferred from a federal prison in Oregon on July 7 to a halfway house in Garden Grove , Calif. , where he will serve the final months of a four - year sentence for his role in a major drug shipment scheme .
Although he has enjoyed increased freedom , his schedule and movements remain strictly supervised .

Bicyclist Behavior 2
The Real : How Bicyclists Actually Behave ( and how hard that is for some of us to accept )
Effective Cycling program graduates are rare , even among serious cyclists .
Less than 3,000 bicyclists have passed the Effective Cycling course ( Clarke & Tracy , 1995 , p. 67 ) .
Jerry Hopfengardner , chairman of the League of American Bicyclists  Education Committee estimates that only three thousandths of one percent of the cyclists in this country have received the training that the Effective Cycling program provides for safe and efficient bicycling  ( McClun , 1995 ) .
But certified Effective Cyclists are not the only riders who are aware of , or who seriously adhere to , vehicular cycling principles .
Repeatedly in his writings , Forester emphasizes that expert cyclists throughout the world have practiced the techniques he espouses since long before he put them in print .
Cyclists have numerous sources of information on riding techniques besides Forester and the League of American Bicyclists .
It s hard to tell how widely vehicular style cycling is practiced , or how closely those who do practice it adhere to the official Effective Cycling methods .
Peter Lagerwey , bicycle coordinator for Seattle , Washington , estimates that 80 percent of the bicycle miles traveled in the U.S. are covered by a hard core of experienced and frequent cyclists .
The remaining 20 percent , he says , are ridden by the 80 percent of cyclists who consider themselves infrequent or less confident riders .
Seattle has a larger than average adult bicyclist population , so Lagerweys estimate of experienced  cyclists  portion of mile traveled may run high .
The 1990 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey found that the average bicycle trip length was 1.99 miles , and more than half the trips were social and recreational 
( Federal Highway Administration , 1994 , sec. 3 , pp. 17 & 21 ) .
Given that experienced  cyclists frequently travel 15 to well over 100 miles on recreational trips , it seems that the bicycle miles are overwhelmingly made up of shorter trips more characteristic of less hard - core riders .
This chapter will leave behind the sophisticated some would say esoteric realm of Effective Cycling and examine how ordinary people behave when they travel by bicycle .
Most studies of bicyclist behavior start with some criteria for proper behavior and count the number of cyclists who either conform with or deviate from the criteria .
For this section , though , I ask the reader to , at least temporarily , suspend the temptation to view certain cycling behaviors as deviant or problem behaviors .
I ask the reader to assume that cyclists have rational reasons for what they do .
The task here is to explore and learn from the day - to - day habits of common bicyclists .
Riding with traffic or facing traffic
Studies of bicyclists  behavior point to one overriding rule :
The more options cyclists have , the more options they take .
This is true whether or not those options are officially sanctioned .
The side of the street on which bicyclists ride , for example , is influenced by the kind of space they have in which to ride .
Thom and Clayton ( 1992a ) observed bicyclists riding at mostly busy intersections with standard 12 - foot lanes and speed limits mostly either 50 or 60 kph ( 31 or 37 mph ) .
A full 97.6 percent of the cyclists rode on the side of the street with the flow of traffic ( p. 97 ) .
On most of the streets at the seven intersections studied , bicyclists would have had to ride close to on - coming traffic if they had chosen the other side of the street .
The picture changes where bicyclists have more room .
A study of bicyclists on nine streets with striped bike lanes ( Cycecki , Perry , & Frangos , 1993 ) found that 22 percent of the cyclists who rode on the streets chose to ride facing the motor traffic on their side of the street .
On one street the bike lane was marked with four arrows per mile  to show clearly that bicyclists must ride with traffic . 
Apparently the arrows did not deter wrong - way riding as much as the extra space encouraged it ; 23 percent still rode facing traffic .
On another bike - laned street , 39 percent cycled against the flow ( pp. 29 , 31 ) .
Cyclists also choose sides more freely on sidewalks .
In a comparison of sidewalk riding with street riding , Wachtel and Lewiston ( 1994 ) found that of the cyclists riding on the road at the studied intersections , 95 percent were riding with traffic .
Among cyclists riding on sidewalks along the same roads , though , 32 percent faced the traffic on their side ( p. 33 ) .
Thom and Clayton ( 1992a ) found a half - and - half split between sidewalk cyclists riding with traffic and those facing it ( p. 93 ) .
In fact , of all wrong - way bicyclists they observed , 70 percent were riding on sidewalks ( p. 98 ) .
Bicyclist behavior varies somewhat from place to place , though .
It s influenced by factors beyond roadway design , such as local bicyclist education and public relations programs , having large numbers of experienced adult cyclists to set examples , the degree to which police enforce bicycle laws , and local motorists  attitudes toward and treatment of bicyclists on the road .
So , statistics such as those in the last two paragraphs illustrate a general principle , that cyclists take advantage of the available options , but the numbers are site specific .
They do not reflect how cyclists behave on all bike lanes , for example .
In fact , a recent bicyclist behavior analysis in Oregon ( Moule & Ronkin , 1996 ) found less wrong - way riding on streets with bike lanes than on those without , and the lanes seemed to lure cyclists off the sidewalk ( see Table 9 ) .
Stop signs and red lights
So , the space in which cyclists ride influences the freedom with which they choose a side of the street on which to ride .
Likewise , the amount of traffic at intersections influences how bicyclists respond to stop lights and stop signs .
Most of the bicyclists in the Thom and Clayton study had little choice when they were required to stop .
 At the observation sites ,  the authors say , most cyclists were forced to comply with stop signs and red lights because of high traffic volumes .
As a result , 97 percent stopped ( p. 97 ) .
 Cyclists were , however , more likely to disobey red lights and stop signs when traffic was light ( p. 93 ) .
Cynecki , Perry , and Frangos found that although 80 percent of their subjects stopped for red lights , only 17 percent stopped for stop signs , even though the observer was instructed to give the bicyclists the benefit of the doubt when they came to a near stop ( p. 31 ) .
In addition to conveying a stronger message than stop signs , red lights are most likely to be installed at intersections with heavy traffic which , again , forces bicyclists to stop .

Members of the New York City advocacy group Transportation Alternatives defend running red lights .
It is a way , according to Herman ( 1993 ) , for bicyclists to get ahead of the platoon of motor vehicles and away from the exhaust and the pressure from impatient drivers  ( pp. 26 - 27 ) .
( For the record , I am not trying to advocate , condone or defend the practice of running red lights .
Im just trying to describe how normal , rational people behave on bicycles , and why . )
Scofflaw , or just plain human ?
Non-cyclists and expert cyclists often view bicyclists who ride against traffic and who run stop signs and red lights as reckless scofflaws or , at best , sorely misguided .
Yet , the statistics above demonstrate that these behaviors are not totally arbitrary , that cyclists use some discretion when choosing where to ride or whether to stop at a stop sign .
No doubt there are reckless and misguided cyclists on the streets , but there are also plenty of rational reasons for cyclists to choose non-vehicular - style actions .
A bicyclist whose destination is the wrong way up a one - way street , for example , might choose to ride against traffic if the alternative is a considerably longer route .
A cyclist turning left on a busy street with four lanes may decide that it makes sense to ride the left bike lane to a destination half a block up the road on the left ; otherwise , the cyclist would have to cross four lanes , ride a short distance , then cross back again , exposing himself to greater risk .
Even John by - the - rules - of - the - road Forester advocates that bicyclists treat stop signs as if they were yield signs :
You dont have to stop to yield , and you are best able to get moving again if you are still riding , with your feet on the pedals .
Therefore , it is to your advantage to keep going , riding as slowly as you can between the visibility point and the edge of the actual traffic line , because that gives you the maximum time to see and choose a gap in traffic that is long enough for you to cross the intersection .
If you get close to the actual traffic line and no gap comes along , you must stop to wait ( 1993 , p. 314 ) .
Where traffic is light and its easy to see down the road , bicyclists may appear to ignore stop signs entirely while , in fact , they may be entering intersections with as much care as those who stop .
On a bicycle , the energy to get up to speed after a stop comes out of the riders endurance , not a gas tank , so there is a strong , practical incentive to keep rolling .
As one very experienced bicyclist put it , its not human to stop at every stop sign .
Bicyclists are not the only practitioners of this sort of situational decision making .
For example , motorists may flout speed limits where a road seems to be able to handle faster traffic .
One study found that drivers paid little attention to posted speed limits and chose a speed that they considered appropriate for the prevailing conditions 
( Garber & Gadiraju , 1989 , p. 65 ) .
Some scofflaw behavior is just what a particular combination of environmental cues seems to ask of a cyclistits just human .
Affordance cycling
To most people who bicycle for transportation , cycling is an informal activity .
It s common , ordinary , everyday .
It could be argued that motorists manage to adhere to well - defined behavior patterns a lot better than bicyclists , even though driving a car is also an everyday activity .
There are some important differences between motor vehicles and bicycles , however , that account for bicyclists  less structured behavior .
I have touched on these differences before , but they take on new meaning in this context .
First , bicycles are narrow .
On the whole , this is a great asset .
It allows bicyclists to share lanes with faster - moving traffic .
Being narrow makes it possible for the bicycle to be a slow - moving vehicle that can move about city streets and rarely hold up traffic .
This sets the bicycle apart from most other slow - moving vehicles , too .
If one fourth of a citys workers biked to work , that would be just fine .
If , instead , they drove tractors , harvesters , and threshing machines , you would see major tie ups .
However , this narrowness also affords other behaviors that would be difficult or impossible with wider vehicles .
Along with the ability to share a lane comes the ability to ride on the wrong side of the road without colliding with on - coming traffic .
A bicyclist can ride in the space between lines of cars and the curb .
A bicycle fits on a sidewalk and through other narrow spaces where motorists in cars wouldnt normally think of going .
Being narrow also makes it possible for a bicyclist who wants to turn left to wait on the right side of the road for traffic from behind to pass , a commonly - used technique , even though it is frowned upon by vehicular cycling advocates .
In addition to being narrower , bicycles generally move more slowly than cars , of course .
This creates some opportunities and precludes others .
For example , while approaching a stop sign , a bicyclist may have plenty of time and a clear view by which to judge whether it is safe to cross the intersection .
So bicyclists can often blow stop signs safely , even if illegally , where motorists would have to stop to assess the situation .
The speed difference also makes it impossible , though , for a bicyclist to take a place in the traffic flow in the same way that a motorist would .
That constraint forces bicyclists to create alternatives , for better or worse .
Finally , bicyclists pose much less of a threat to other road users than do car drivers .
The dangers inherent in the speed , size , and weight of a car demand a high level of care and responsibility from drivers .
Consequently , there are severe legal incentives for motorists to follow prescribed rules of the road .
In most cities bicyclists are not held to the same standards because they are not seen as such threats .
In short , compared with motorists , bicyclists have a different set of constraints and , more importantly , affordances .
Norman ( 1988 ) defines affordances  as the perceived and actual properties of the thing , primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used  ( p. 9 ) .
Bicyclists have more diverse physical and social / legal affordances than motorists , so bicyclists exhibit a more diverse range of behaviors than motorists .
If we label one style of riding vehicular cycling ,  we can dub the broader range of cyclists  behavior as affordance cycling ,  meaning that the bicyclists actions are governed less by preplanned and analyzed patterns and more by what seems to make sense from among all the possible actions the bicyclist perceives in the moment .
The affordance cycling concept may become more meaningful once we begin to explore how bike lanes influence bicyclists  perceptions .
For now , the point is that bicyclists have such varied behavior because they have so many options .
Cyclists who understand the rules of the road well know when those rules can be safely and usefully broken .
Roadside researchers who make ledgers of vehicular - style behaviors versus non-vehicular - style behaviors give us data that is interesting , but that does not tell us the extent to which the supposed transgressions pose real dangers .
Bicycling : the folk transportation 
While Effective Cycling is presumably guided by extensive planning and analysis , bicycling in general is much more free form , which should not be confused with chaotic , even though it may sometimes look that way .
Part of the appeal of bicycling for some people is that it offers the freedom to go places and do things that a car driver couldnt without being a threat to health and property .
Bicyclists enjoy more spontaneity than motorists .
Cincinnati traffic engineer Jim Coppock , who is also a folk musician , folk dancer , avid bicyclist , and bicycle advocate , describes bicycling as folk transportation ,  an apt description of this informal method of moving about .
One of bicyclings greatest assets , arguably its single most socially significant attribute , is the mobility it offers people from a wide range of ages , abilities , and economic means .
There is no test to pass or drivers license fee to pay .
 Expert cyclists may sigh and shake their heads as they watch other bicyclists improvise their way through traffic , but the behavior they are seeing goes hand in hand with a vehicle thats as available to five your olds and people with Downs syndrome as it is to three - time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond .
Cycling sanctimony
As a group , bicyclists behave in richly diverse ways .
Individually , though , bicyclists often harbor strong feelings about whats true and proper cycling technique .
Those of us who invest a lot of time in studying bicycle issues and practicing advanced cycling techniques run the risk of developing what C. M. Deasy ( 1974 ) , writing about problems in environmental design , calls naive realism .
It s a sort of professional tunnel vision :
the action schemes in the designers mind are very special ones ; they are formed by training and by the values of his professional group and thus may need to be accommodated to the viewpoint of the rest of the world .
The alternative possibility , that human nature will adapt itself to the designers values , is so utterly unrealistic as to be absurd , yet it is a concept that is implicit in much of the literature of architecture and planning ( p. 39 ) .
Two Canadians provide a good example of naive realism at work .
Robert Thom is a research engineer with the University of Manitoba Road Safety Research Unit .
He has reportedly carried out extensive research in the area of cycling safety .
He is also an avid cyclist who rides through all four seasons and averages 16,00 kilometers ( 9,900 miles ) per year .
Alan Clayton is an engineering professor at the University of Manitoba .
( Thom and Clayton , 1992 b , p. 378 . )
Based on observations of 900 cyclists in the Canadian cities of Winnipeg and Vancouver , Thom and Clayton ( 1992a ) concluded that it is apparent that many cyclists do not ride according to the established rules and principles of traffic flow : only half of the cyclists were observed to be riding correctly  ( p. 93 ) .
As we will see , this statement is based on an unrealistically rigid definition of what riding correctly  means .
In addition to wrong way  riding and disobeying stop signs and red lights , the criteria the researchers used to judge correct riding style included the following :
Sidewalk or crosswalk riding
The researchers do not say whether sidewalk riding was illegal in the study cities .
In some cities it is , in others its not .
As recently as 1994 , three cities in the Dayton , Ohio , area had laws that required bicyclists to ride on sidewalks .
Clearly , experience has shown that sidewalks can be dangerous places to ride ( Williams & McLaughlin , 1992 ; Wachtel & Lewiston , 1994 ) .
From an affordance cycling perspective , though , we would have to know where the rider was going , the alternative ways of getting there , the conditions of the various routes , the cyclists speed , the care the cyclist took in crossing intersections .
Without knowing such circumstances , we cannot carte - blanche condemn sidewalk riding .
I have seen an expert cyclist he was a certified Effective Cycling Instructor and president of a bike club with more than 1,000 members lead a group of cyclists comprised of the board of directors of that club down city sidewalks for two blocks to access a bike path .
Considering the surrounding streets and traffic patterns , no one could argue that it would have been safer or wiser to use the road .
In some cases , the choice between riding the road or the sidewalk is more a matter of style than substance .
Improper left turn
As described in the last chapter , vehicular cycling has definite , sometimes complex , rules about choosing a lane position .
Many cyclists put in the majority of their miles where the traffic is light enough that left - turn technique is not a major concern .
The researchers stacked the deck , though .
All but one of the seven study sites were on streets with four or more lanes .
Three of the sites were extremely complex intersections with pork chop islands and center dividers .
These sites are good examples of places where , as Forester ( 1993 ) put it , being a good cyclist requires more skill and forethought than driving a car ( p. 296 ) .
Undeniably , vehicular cycling techniques enable a bicyclist to glide through such intersections with the greatest ease and least risk of conflict with traffic .
But to expect the average cyclist to be more skillful and more thoughtful than the average motorist flies in the face of bicyclings nature as folk transportation .
Finally , a turn from the wrong position poses no hazard at all if done at the right time , when theres no possibility of conflict with traffic .
Faced with the complexity of choosing a proper position and the difficulty of changing lanes to reach that position , many bicyclists , especially slower ones , may find a way to muddle through that s not technically correct , but that works well enough for them .
Overtaking between traffic and curb
This is another maneuver that even Forester does not universally condemn .
The danger is that a motorist will turn right and slam the bicyclist riding in the motorists blind spot .
The official Effective Cycling text says its all right to pass on the right when motorists are stopped , or are barely moving with no place to turn into ( p. 313 ) .
In a vehicular cycling manual distributed by Bicycling magazine , Allen ( 1988 ) gives several paragraphs of instructions for riding through stopped motor traffic , then advises cyclists to wait behind the first car at the traffic light . 
In the end , it is hard to pin down one proper way of cycling .
There is not even a clear consensus about what should properly be called vehicular cycling .
Not even the carefully thought - out Effective Cycling program provides a cut - and - dried standard .
I have known Effective Cycling graduates who either did not fully understand , were unable to carry out , or had forgotten , Foresters detailed instructions .
I have known certified Effective Cycling Instructors who outright disagreed with some of the Effective Cycling lessons .
Even if you follow Forester to the hilt , affordances sometimes offer several choices : at stop signs and when passing on the right , for example .
Thom and Clayton chose to chronicle actions that they believed were improper , implying that these actions would put bicyclists at risk .
What we have seen is that in specific instances these actions may be harmless , or even safer than the supposedly proper actions .
Those of us who are involved with bicycle advocacy and planning face one very real risk if we cling too tenaciously to our vehicular cycling principles :
We risk denying ourselves the ability to fully understand the depth and breadth of bicycling as it is practiced on the streets of our cities every day .
Theres a man , about 45 , who rides the sidewalk down Main Street in my home town against the flow of traffic on his side of the street , by the way .
 Joe is large , though not tall .
The low seat on his old ten speed makes his knees stick out as he pedals .
He does not push himself breathless , but rolls slowly , draws a hit off his cigarette , and sends smoke swirling beneath the brim of his cowboy hat .
When he reaches Central Avenue in the middle of town , he stops and waits for the pedestrian signal , then slowly rides the crosswalk to the other side .
At the video store , he pries down his kickstand with his stable stomper , finishes his smoke , and leaves his unlocked bike by the door as he saunters inside .
Is Joe a problem bicyclist ?
Should we put a helmet on him , boot him off the sidewalk , put him on the right side of the street , and teach him to ride properly ?
Id wager hes as much of an expert at pedestrian cycling as many club cyclists are at vehicular cycling .
He has figured out how to get where he wants to go , and he gets there in a way that s comfortable for him .
At the speed he rides and with the care he takes , Joe may be no more at risk than a vehicular cyclist .
If we judge his behavior by vehicular cycling principles , his actions are quite improper .
But its hard to argue that Joe is a hazard to himself or anyone else on the sparsely - peopled sidewalks of downtown Fairborn , Ohio .
The beauty of the bicycle is that it can accommodate both a Joe and a John Forester .
And it would be just as absurd to try to make Joe into John as to try to get Forester on the sidewalk .
This is not to say that Joe couldnt practice vehicular cycling if he wanted .
But what would make him want that ?
The curseor the challenge of bicycle planning is that John and Joe experience bicycling so differently .
For Joe , motor traffic goes by him .
Period .
He moves around its periphery and through its gaps .
John , on the other hand , is part of the traffic .
He rides in its midst and participates in its flow .
What makes bicycling even more complicated or interesting is that there is no pure John experience or pure Joe experience .
As long as traffic moves faster than a cyclist , that cyclist cannot be 100 percent in the flow .
And as long as there are streets without sidewalks you cant ride 100 percent on the periphery .
Even where there are sidewalks , for most bicyclists it would take great constraint to poke along for any distance with the amount of caution it would take to cross every driveway and intersection safely .
Sidewalks do not isolate bicyclists from traffic .
How realistic is it to hope that Americans will some day embrace vehicular cycling on a large scale ?
It s hard to say .
Culture has a lot to do with it , I suspect , since cultural attitudes will determine how motorists and bicyclists act toward and respond to each other .
For example , Drake ( 1996 ) describes how he watched as a nun in full habit rode her three - speed sedately  into the midst of a busy French roundabout :
Immediately , she was afforded what I could only assume was the leeway exclusively reserved for people of the cloth .
Then I tried it myself , and discovered her secret had nothing to with social strata , but with assertiveness .
Easy .
Drakes allows that not all European motorists are so courteous :  Cycling in Milan , for instance , calls for a downhillers body armor .
Ditto for Barcelona .
I would no sooner ride in these cities than I would go jogging in Sarajevo . 
How bad are bicyclists , really ?
A common way in which bicycle safety pundits link behavior with consequences is to compare the share of car - bike crashes caused by bicyclists with the share caused by motorists .
If there is a 50/50 split , then we assume , for what its worth , that bicyclists arent doing any worse than motorists .
That is , if bicyclists  contribution to car - bike crashes is equal to motorists , then bicyclists arent any worse drivers than motorists .
This may be a crude measure of bicyclists  skill , but many people take this kind of comparison seriously , often using it to put cyclists in a bad light .
So it is worth examining .
Thom and Clayton estimated that cyclists were at fault in 65 percent of reported crashes they analyzed from Winnipeg , Canada , and cyclists were partly at fault in 5 percent more ( p. 96 ) .
Other studies have credited cyclists  errors with causing from 21 percent to 65 percent of car - bike crashes ( Clarke & Tracy , 1995 , p. 31 ) .
A. F. Williams came up with a nearly identical range overall , and found that cyclists aged 25 and older weighed in at just 35 percent ( Drury , 1978 , p. ) .
The Cross - Fisher study revealed a similar tendency for child cyclists to be at fault , and adult cyclists not to be ( Table 10 ) .
It appears as if adult cycling habits are not so hazardous ; motorists are more often to blame .
In general , children do not pilot their bikes as safely .
Celestine Trainor of the Human Factors division of the U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission attributes this to childrens limited cognitive abilities , self absorption , and fondness for testing their skills ( Rogers , G. , et al. , 1994 , pp. 87-88 ) .
There is cause to be cautious about interpreting this information , though .
That motorists appear to be more often at fault in crashes with adult cyclists may reflect factors other than just the adult riders  street smarts .
If adult cyclists tend to ride faster than children , motorists may have less time to detect and react to the presence of an adult cyclist on the road .
Also , motorists might drive more cautiously around children .
In any case , many crashes that are technically caused by motorists  errors could be avoided by skilled cyclists ; bicyclists who practice vehicular cycling have techniques that not only minimize cyclist errors , they reduce the likelihood of crashes caused by motorists  errors as well .
Finally , the top rural adult crash type appears to be carelessly caused by overtaking motorists , but is often the result of bicyclists riding at night without the gear to make themselves visible .
Vehicular cycling principles guide the actions of an experienced , well - informed , hard core of cyclists .
The reason they choose this riding style is simple : the principles help bicyclists get where they want to go most safely and efficiently .
There is room for fudging , true , but even there a bicyclist who understands traffic and how to avoid crashes can more clearly see her options and more wisely choose among her affordances .
Those of us who enjoy the benefits of a vehicular riding style naturally wish the same freedom and sense of safety for other bicyclists .
But bicycling is not by nature so tidy , and shouldnt be .
There are many who sing , but few expert singers .
There are many who dance , but few expert dancers .
There are many who bicycle , but as along as bicycling remains folk transportation , as long as bicyclists dont need a skills - based license to mount up , as long as bicycling serves the young , the poor , and the mentally handicapped , expert cycling is likely to remain the realm of the hard - core few .

If bicycling is a dance , no one should have to be an Arthur Murray graduate to jump in .
At the same time , we dont want people bumping into the furniture and we dont want to make it hard for accomplished dancers to cut a mean rug .
If we must build a dance floor some kind of bicycle facility , that is we must take care of two things .
First , we must try to find a design that neither encourages unsafe behavior nor perpetuates inaccurate ideas about car - bike interactions ; misinformed bicyclists cannot accurately predict the consequences of their improvisations .
Second , the design must not prevent , inhibit , or contradict vehicular cycling : to do so is to squelch the safest and most efficient form of bicycling transportation .

There 's a reason Warren Buffett is so revered : Because he deserves to be .
It 's a tall order to get up at 5 am and speak for three hours and never say anything that is n't wise , charming , or funny .
Sure , it helps to have CNBC 's lovely Becky Quick sitting right there , but that 's not the source of Warren 's wisdom .
Full three - hour transcript here ( with minor deletions ) , courtesy of CNBC .
If you do n't have time to read it now , save it for the weekend .
BECKY QUICK , co-anchor ( Omaha , Nebraska ) :
Good morning , everybody and welcome to SQUAWK BOX right here on CNBC .
This morning we have quite a show in store for you coming up today .
As you probably know , our special guest for the next three hours is a man who needs no introduction .
We are talking about Warren Buffett .
And , Warren , good morning .
Thank you for joining us this morning .
Mr. WARREN BUFFETT ( Berkshire Hathaway Chairman & CEO ) :
Yeah , early morning ,
right .
QUICK : Very early morning .
You 've only had a couple of complaints about
that , right ?
Mr. BUFFETT : No , I try not to complain too much ...
QUICK : One of the things we'd like to get straight to ... is what you see happening in the economy right now .
We 've been talking to you for some time about what you see as some significant problems in the economy .
And , from your perspective , have things gotten any better ?
Have they gotten any worse ?
Mr. BUFFETT : No , they 've rippled out some , and that 's what you 'd expect .
So
the excesses in credit , the deleveraging that was required , the weak credits
that are exposed , all that is -- we 're seeing manifestations out as the ripples
go out , and I think I said one time that , you know , you only find out who's
been swimming naked when the tide goes out .
Well , we found out that Wall
Street has been kind of a nudist beach .
There 's -- it 's just one discovery
after another of firms that either did n't know what they were doing or that
did things that they should n't have knowingly .
And all of the troubles have
not been revealed the first time around , usually , so there 's considerable
disillusionment that 's set in in terms of are these guys telling us the truth
now or maybe they just do n't know what the truth is .
So all of that 's having
an effect , and what we 're seeing in business , in our retail businesses ...
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : ... certainly , anything to do with housing is even a further
slowing down .
I mean , June and July , both in terms of credit experience with
people that first got into trouble of house payments and now on credit card
payments and so on .
And retail trade , it 's not over by a long shot .
QUICK : Does that make you think that things are going to continue to decline
over the next , let 's say , six months ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Oh , I think they could easily go beyond that , yeah .
QUICK : What 's your prognosis , or what 's your best guess or your best estimate
of what ...
Mr. BUFFETT : You never know .
I 've said in the past it ought to be longer
and deeper , and I think it is going to be longer and deeper , but no one knows
when -- what you do know is that it will turn around .
I mean , the country will
be doing far better five years from now than it is now , but it wo n't be , in my
judgment , it probably wo n't be doing better five months from now .
QUICK : You talk about how this has rippled out and it's affecting the
consumer at this point .
Have the credit markets themselves gotten any better ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , the credit markets have had this situation where
periodically it 's seemed like they were getting better and then something else
comes along .
So the bankers feel a little bit better for a while and then
something comes along and then they want to deleverage further .
They find out
they 've got more trouble .
Right now , for example , they 're taking back all
these auction rate securities .
Well , they do n't want to take things out of
their balance sheet .
So it 's just one more problem for them , and you 've seen
these waves of problems and sometimes they create their own momentum .
I mean ,
if the stock prices go down enough of the banks , then they feel like they
ca n't sell securities .
Of course , the extreme example was Freddie Mac
was -- has sort of been chasing a rabbit down the hill ...
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : ... and promised they would raise additional money and of course
the price of the stock got to the point where it became ridiculous .
So
troubles feed on themselves .
QUICK : Let 's talk about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , specifically .
These are
two stocks that it seems like every time you turn around are touching new low
levels .
There 's a lot of concern out there on the market about these two
stocks right now .
What 's your general take on how they got here and what you
think 's going to happen next ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , how they got here was they had two businesses , basically .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT :
They insured mortgages on a huge scale , trillions , and then
they ran sort of a hedge fund , a carry trade where they bought mortgages and
borrowed extensively against them .
And because they had really the backing of
the United States government -- and everybody assumed they had the backing .
I
assumed it .
And the truth is they do have the backing of the United States
government in terms of their debt , not in terms of their equity -- they were
able to borrow without any normal restraints in terms of capital or margin
requirements or anything of the sort .
They had a blank - check from the federal
government .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : And they also had an added problem in that they had a dual
mission .
The government expected them to promote housing and the stockholders
expected them to raise the earnings substantially every year .
And as the
years went by , they emphasized the latter more and more .
They started talking
about " steady Freddie , " and Fannie Mae said , ` We 're going to increase the
earnings at 15 percent a year . '
Any large financial institution that tells you
that sort of thing is giving you a line of baloney .
I mean , they may do it
for a while , but when they can't do it with operations , they do it with
accounting and they cheat .
And that 's what happened at both those places on a
huge , huge scale .
And we have this -- they 're so wound up with national housing policy , that
they 're a national problem and , with this dual situation , you know , Lincoln
said a house divided against itself , you know , must fall .
And they existed
half - slave , half - free for a long time , and then the motivations became in
conflict , and when they got on the 15 percent a year merry - go - round and said ,
you know , ` We 're going to deliver earnings up every quarter , and we 'll meet
them to the penny , ' when they can't do it operationally , they do it with
accounting .
QUICK : So what happens now ?
You mentioned that this is all tied up with the
national housing situation now .
Are they two big to fail , and what does that
mean ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah , they 're too big to fail .
QUICK : Yeah .
Mr. BUFFETT : So that does n't mean that the equity can't get wiped out , and
it almost has in the stock market , and in practical sense as institutions ,
they do n't have any net worth .
I mean , if you look at their obligations and
look at the fact they have big deferred tax assets as assets .
They would 've
been gone in any market where the government was n't behind them long , long
ago .
But the government is behind them , and they will stay behind them , and
people that own insured mortgages or who own their debt , I think -- nothing 's
going to happen to them .
The equity and the preferred stock is another
question and I think you 'll see some action fairly soon .
You 've already seen
it in the fact that the Treasury has made pretty much explicit what was
formerly implicit .
QUICK : Do you say that knowing anything ?
Do you know there 's a
behind - the - scenes plan ?
Mr. BUFFETT : No . I do n't know .
No .
They - - I 'm not getting called on it .
QUICK : OK .
You 're not getting called on this , but you do ...( unintelligible ) .
Mr. BUFFETT : I 'm not getting called on that specific aspect of it .
QUICK : All right .
Now you 're telling me we 're warm .
Mr. BUFFETT : They 're looking -- they 're looking for help , obviously .
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : And the scale of help needed is such that I do n't think it can
come from the private sector .
QUICK : So there could have been a situation where you 've been called in the
past and you passed on any involvement ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Yes .
They were looking for -- they , obviously , had been looking
for money .
They say that .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : And they were told to look for money and -- but even the amount
of money they were told to look for would be inadequate .
I mean , 5 1/2
billion at Freddie would be , you know , that 'd be like taking a spoonful out of
the Atlantic to try and save the Titanic .
QUICK : How much to you think they need ?
Mr. BUFFETT : They need a lot .
But to get back to the confidence that they
had and all of that , it takes far more now .
I mean , an ounce of prevention
really is worth a pound of cure .
QUICK : If you imagine where things will go with Fannie and Freddie , and you
think about the regulators , where were the regulators for what was happening ,
and can something like this be prevented from happening again ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , it 's really an incredible case study in regulation
because something called OFHEO was set up in 1992 by Congress , and the sole
job of OFHEO was to watch over Fannie and Freddie , someone to watch over them .
And they were there to evaluate the soundness and the accounting and all of
that .
Two companies were all they had to regulate .
OFHEO has over 200
employees now .
They have a budget now that 's $ 65 million a year , and all they
have to do is look at two companies .
I mean , you know , I look at more than
two companies .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : And they sat there , made reports to the Congress , you can get
them on the Internet , every year .
And , in fact , they reported to Sarbanes and
Oxley every year .
And they went -- wrote 100 page reports , and they said ,
` We 've looked at these people and their standards are fine and their directors
are fine and everything was fine . '
And then all of a sudden you had two of the
greatest accounting misstatements in history .
You had all kinds of management
malfeasance , and it all came out .
And , of course , the classic thing was that
after it all came out , OFHEO wrote a 350-- 340 page report examining what went
wrong , and they blamed the management , they blamed the directors , they blamed
the audit committee .
They did n't have a word in there about themselves , and
they 're the ones that 200 people were going to work every day with just two
companies to think about .
It just shows the problems of regulation .
QUICK : That sounds like an argument against regulation , though .
Is that what
you 're saying ?
Mr. BUFFETT : It 's an argument explaining -- it 's an argument that managing
complex financial institutions where the management wants to deceive you can
be very , very difficult .
Or even when the management does n't know what 's
going on , and -- just take Bear Stearns .
Bear Stearns had -- I read it ,
anyway - - 750,000 derivative contracts .
Now , you know , I could clone Albert
Einstein , you know , and -- many , many times and have him work 12 - hour days for
me and he would not be able to keep track of what 's going on in an institution
like that .
It 's -- the ones that are too big to fail may be too big to manage ,
in some cases .
And they 're particularly difficult to manage if they 're
promising Wall Street and their investors that they 're going to do things that
ca n't be done .
QUICK : You 've come out and said derivatives are the weapons of financial mass
destruction before .
But you use derivatives , too .
Mr. BUFFETT : That 's right .
I do n't say they 're evil , per se .
QUICK : Yeah .
Mr. BUFFETT : I just say that once the genie opened the bottle on those many
years ago , that their proliferation , their variation , their inability to be
valued and their ability to allow institutions to pile up leverage like the
world has never seen can cause great systemic problems .
And that does n't
mean , you know - - it 's like gun powder or water .
You can do damage with a lot
of things , but these have systemic -- they pose systemic risks .
And
incidentally , the government recognizes this .
I mean , you 've had a task force
working on , you know , what do we do to prevent these things from causing a
real problems ?
But they have caused problems so far .
I do n't think they 're
going to cause problems at Berkshire Hathaway .
I know every single derivative
contract we have .
Now , when we bought Gen Re , they had 23,000 plus contracts .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT :
There was no way in the world I can get my mind around that .
I
mean , if I -- if I had spent full time and had all kinds of assistants and
everything , I never would 've known what was in those contracts .
We had one
contract that was due in 100 years , so that meant that for 100 years some guy
at our place put a mark on it every day and some guy at another place put a
mark and they got their bonuses based on it .
I mean , that is a system that is
guaranteed to cause trouble .
And so I got out of the business .
It took me
four years under benign market conditions , and we lost $ 400 some million in
the process .
So they are dangerous things .
The ones we put on may be
dangerous things , too , but I do know every contract , and I know what my
gain - loss arrangement is and nobody else marks them .
I mean , I keep track of
it .
QUICK : You do it yourself on every one .
OK .
Warren , we have a lot more to
talk about with you this morning .
We 'd like to get to some of your holdings ,
more on the economy , but we also are going to take a very quick pause right
now for a quick break .
QUICK : All right , welcome back , everybody .
You know , Warren , we know that you are a huge sports fan .
You 're somebody who watches all sorts of things , and , of course , one of your major holdings ,
Coca - Cola , so what better way to tie all this up than Coca - Cola , sports ,
you 've got one of the major sponsors of the Olympics here .
Let 's bring Carl back into this conversation from Beijing .
And appropriately ,
yeah , Warren is holding up his Coca - Cola just right now , Carl .
So , as always ,
he 's got a cherry Coke by his side .
CARL QUINTANILLA , co-host : Cherry Coke , yes .
QUICK : Yeah , cherry Coke by his side .
And , Warren , we 've been talking all
things
Olympics the whole way through .
What do you think about Coca - Cola and
the major sponsorship that it has with the Olympics ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , it has a long , long history with the Olympics , and
it -- it 's very important .
I mean , Coca - Cola wants to be associated with
happiness around the world .
Every major event they want to be here .
And it's
important -- with a brand , there 's something in the mind about a brand .
I mean ,
you have something in your mind about Coca - Cola or -- but you do n't have
anything in your mind about RC Cola because they 've never been , you know .
So
we want that -- we want that brand to be associated with something like the
Olympics where there 's happiness , where there 's competition , where the nations
are getting together .
It 's a venue we could not skip .
QUICK : There have been people in the past who have said , ` Hey , these
sponsorships get more and more expensive . '
There are other ways that other
companies can kind of make their way in ...
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah .
QUICK : ... without paying .
Is that an option for Coca - Cola down the road ?
Mr. BUFFETT : No , I -- Coca - Cola would never be going on a country road when
the interstate 's available .
And it 's -- we 're not -- we 're not there to be around
the edges , we 're there to be front and center .
QUICK : You know , Carl , we 've been talking earlier in the week about what some
of the Chinese media had been reporting about Buffett , about Bill Gates .
What
have people been saying ?
QUINTANILLA :
Well , I think -- I think the Coke comments are interesting ,
Warren .
We interviewed the chief marketing officer from Coke here last week ,
and of all the Olympic sponsors , right , the global sponsors , the GEs of the
world , the Lenovos , in China the poll numbers show that they associate the
Olympics the most of all the sponsors with Coke .
So the marketing machine is
obviously working .
We did -- we did talk earlier in the week back -- maybe it was
last week -- about Pangu Plaza , the big hotel and office park ...
QUICK : Right .
QUINTANILLA : ... and shopping mall that 's over my shoulder here .
And The
Times did that story earlier in the week about whether or not Bill Gates had
rented out a penthouse for a year , and whether or not Warren was staying
there .
Any truth to that at all , Warren ?
Mr. BUFFETT : No , I 'd actually talked about going to the Olympics a little
bit with Bill , but I 'm the kind of guy that has to have it explained to me on
television what happened , you know , that I just saw .
So I enjoy it enormously
watching it on television , and Bill was over there for a week .
Although the
day or two before he went over he was playing at a bridge tournament in Omaha
and then he came back to Omaha almost directly from the Olympics after about a
week over there .
QUICK : So that was n't you ?
You were n't -- you were n't the one they spotted
walking around in Beijing ?
Mr. BUFFETT : No , that must be my double , George Clooney , actually that was
spotted .
QUINTANILLA : Has -- Warren , has the -- have the games , in all seriousness , have
the games made you think any differently about this part of the world -- the
world , western China , growth opportunities , the ability for American companies
to operate effectively within a different government structure ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah , well , I was over there almost a year ago -- Becky was with
me --and I was blown away by what I saw .
I 'd been there -- the time before that
was 1995 , and I really had never seen a country change so much in a -- in a 12
or so year period , and clearly , when you think of the size of the country , to
effect that sort of change .
So I -- no I 've been a big believer in China before
the Olympics and certainly they 've put on a marvelous show during the
Olympics .
And -- but I would have expected that .
You get -- you get a bunch of
very , very bright people who care enormously about putting on a wonderful
event , they 're going to get the job done .
QUICK : What about Chinese stocks ?
Does -- do those -- does the stock market
there interest you ?
You 've been looking around the globe ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah , you know , you still can't buy stocks within China except
under special circumstances .
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : But , yeah , I -- we owned that PetroChina stock at one time .
There 's one other stock over there that we actually made a bid on here not so
long ago , and it was n't accepted .
But it 's a terrific -- it 's going to be a
terrific area for business .
So , under the right circumstances , you could see
us with a lot of money there .
QUICK : What was the stock that you made the bid on ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Oh , surprise , surprise .
I never thought you 'd ask .
QUINTANILLA : Nice , Beck .
Mr. BUFFETT : No , that -- I have sort of a mind blankout after I learned ...
QUICK : But it 's not -- it 's not impossible to say that , yeah , you are
continuing to look at stocks and you would make a bid from time to time if you
found something that interested you .
Mr. BUFFETT : We made -- we made a half a billion dollar bid on something ,
right .
QUICK : You made a half a billion dollar bid ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Dollar bid , right .
QUICK : OK , if you do n't remember the -- if you do n't remember the stock , what
was the industry ?
QUINTANILLA :
Oh sure , now you tell us .
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah , it 's bigger than , yeah - - you 're good , but ...
QUICK : But not that good .
No dice on this one ?
All right , well , Carl ...
Mr. BUFFETT : She thought she'd get me at 5 in the morning , folks , and I 'd be
punchy .
QUICK : Yes , and maybe you would n't quite be on the defensive just yet .
But , Carl , we do have about two and a half more hours where we can try and
work on him and squeeze more details out , so ...
QUINTANILLA : Yeah , I 've heard - - I 've heard that if you get enough cherry Cokes
in him , he will spill everything .
QUICK : We 've got them lined up .
Mr. BUFFETT : It acts like truth serum , yeah .
There 's no question about
that .
QUICK : Yeah , well we 've got those cherry Cokes lined up , and we 'll keep them
coming .
All right , folks , coming up , we 're going to go from Wall Street to Washington ,
as a new movie is out there creating some shock waves this morning .
This
movie is all about debt and why it could be putting the future of our country
at risk .
We 'll get to the men behind the film who'll be joining us when
SQUAWK BOX returns live from America 's heartland .
QUICK : Welcome back , everybody , to this very special edition of SQUAWK BOX .
Yeah , you hear the " Love Boat " music playing today .
We are in Omaha where
last night we got to watch a new movie premier that came out .
We 're going to
be talking about that more .
But we figured while we had Warren Buffett here
and we 're in this movie theater of sorts , Warren , we 'd ask you about the first
time you ever took a date to a movie theater .
Mr. BUFFETT :
It was in eighth grade right here in Omaha , and a friend of
mine wanted particularly to ask out one girl and he was afraid to go by
himself , so he talked two others of us to each asking a girl .
And we picked
these girls up sequentially to go to the streetcar , and they lived miles
apart .
By the time we got to the streetcar they were all exhausted , and we
came downtown to the movie .
We picked a movie called " The Cat Woman " with
Simone Simon and " The Mummy 's Hand " with Lon Chaney .
And we felt that the
girls would get terrified and jump onto our laps or something of the sort .
And what happened is , instead , we got terrified , and the boys jumped on each
other 's laps .
The girls were very cool .
We finally got them home , and I
do n't think anybody ever when on another date for about two years after that .
QUICK : All right , so it cured you the first time out .
We 'll take it as that .
You know , Warren , we have a lot more to talk about with you today .
That was a
quick little fun one , but we also want to start asking you about some of the
holdings of Berkshire Hathaway and where you see the economy going .
We're
going to get to all of that in just a few minutes .
BECKY QUICK , co-anchor ( Omaha , Nebraska ) :
We 're in Omaha this morning , folks , for the world premiere of a new documentary that 's resonating with Americans from Wall Street to Main Street .
It is appropriately titled " I.O.U.S.A " ...
David Walker ... served as comptroller
general , and he plays a major part in this documentary .
He 's joining us this
morning on set .
And , Mr. Walker , thank you for being here today .
Mr. DAVID WALKER ( Former U.S. Comptroller General ) : Good to be with both of
you this morning .
QUICK : All right .
Well , we were just listening to what you were talking
about , a major problem that you 've laid out .
How serious and drastic is this
problem , in your view ?
Mr. WALKER : Well , I -- it talks about four deficits , the film does .
The
budget deficit , the savings deficit , the balance of payment / trade and the
leadership .
I think they 're all a problem .
But the biggest problem 's the
leadership deficit .
We have too many people today focusing on short - term
issues , not enough trying to take on structural problems to try to help make
sure that our future is better than our past .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Warren , you said at the beginning of the show you did n't necessarily agree
with everything , but you do agree with taking a longer term look at some major
problems out there .
Mr. WARREN BUFFETT : Absolutely .
I admire what Dave 's doing , that he -- the
future does not -- has not had much of a constituency in this country in recent
years and , you know , it 's because the electoral cycle 's shorter than the
policy cycle on many issues , and it's hard to get worried about what 's going
to happen 10 or 20 or 30 years out .
And we 're feeling the effects of that in
energy and , obviously , every fiscal decision you make today has an impact
forever , really ...
QUICK : Yeah .
Mr. BUFFETT : ... in the country .
So I -- like I say , I admire -- I admire Dave
and Pete Peterson in terms of what they 've done here .
QUICK : David , you 've been looking at the budget and studying these things for
about a decade and a half and being really aware of every single thing that
happened as the nation 's chief auditor .
When did you really get worried that
things were headed down a terrible path ?
Mr. WALKER : You know , I came in as auditor general of the United States , or
the comptroller general , in 1988 , and things were going pretty well .
You
know , we had tough budget controls in place , the economy was doing pretty
well , we were moving to surplus , we had surpluses for four years in a
row -- although only one of them without the Social Security surplus .
In 2002
the budget controls , the statutory ones that were in place that helped us take
us from deficits to surpluses expired , and Washington totally lost control .
It was more spending , enhanced entitlements , more tax cuts .
Out of control .
QUICK : Is there a sense that right now -- with American people facing some
tougher times , with an economy that 's in crisis , is there a sense that this is
a message that 's starting to resonate ?
Mr. WALKER : Well , first , I 've had the good fortune of being able to go to
over half the states , over 40 cities ...
QUICK : Right .
Mr. WALKER : ... over the last two years talking directly to the American
people with others about this .
They get it .
The question is , do people in
Washington get it ?
The risk is , is that , clearly , as Warren said , there are
things that need to be done today .
We do have challenges today .
People are
hurting today , and we need to do some things to deal with that .
But we must
also deal with our structural , systemic problems and not exacerbate the long
range by doing things that might be good today but further mortgage our
future .
QUICK : What -- in short order , what would you like to see done if you had a
wish list , maybe three things that could get done right away ?
Mr. WALKER : Well , for the presidential candidates , I 'll give them two
things .
QUICK : OK .
Mr. WALKER : Number one , publicly acknowledge that we 're in a $ 53 trillion
hole that gets deeper 2 to 3 trillion a year even if we balance the
budget -- unfortunately , we 're headed the wrong way -- and that they 'll make
addressing that a priority .
And secondly , for them to endorse the need for a
capable , credible and bipartisan commission to make recommendations to the
next president and the next Congress for an up or down vote ; things like
budget controls , Social Security reform , round one of tax reform and round one
of health care reform .
That would be a tremendous positive step .
QUICK : Warren , what do you think about that ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , I think I -- probably the second point I agree with more
fully .
I think that you 've had situations like the Greenspan commission on
Social Security ...
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : ... back in 1982 .
There are times -- usually commissions are a
waste of time .
I mean , you know , the report goes in a drawer someplace and -- I
mean , just think of the last six or eight that you can recall and how much
came out of them .
But there are occasions and , frankly , a time of recession
would make the country more receptive .
And you would need -- you would need
people on them that , in effect , the president could n't ignore after the report
came in .
But there 's-- it makes perfectly good sense to have people that are
smart , that care about the future of the country sit down .
There are things
we can do to improve ourselves always , and the time might be ripe for
something like that .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Dave :
Mr. WALKER : You know , we 've got to learn how to walk and chew gum in
Washington .
You know , we need to be able to do more than one thing at a time .
And that 's why a commission is particularly critical , because we need to make
progress on reinstituting budget controls .
Social Security reform is easy .
We can do that if we go about it the right way .
Health care is the real
challenge .
And we do need tax reform , too .
So if we had the right kind of
commission with an up or down vote -- and that 's what 's different from a number
of the other recent commissions -- then we could make progress on multiple
fronts , and that 's what we need .
QUICK : Have you reached out to the two campaigns ?
I mean , you said you 've
been across more than half the country .
What about the two political
candidates right now ?
Mr. WALKER : Yes .
I met with the top economic policy advisers of both of the
campaigns -- they both happen to be friends of mine -- to help them understand
where we 're coming from in the foundation , what we believe is important .
And
I 'm hopeful that the general election campaign will make fiscal responsibility
and intergenerational equity a higher priority .
But we 'll wait and see .
QUICK : OK .
You say that you 're hopeful that the campaign will push that .
Does that mean you did n't get a great reception from either one of these two
when you sat down with them ?
Mr. WALKER : Well , you know , that means most politicians like to gain votes
rather than lose votes , OK ?
And that 's why I think it 's unrealistic to expect
that they 're going to get to a great level of specificity about , ` Well , this
is exactly what we 're going to do to Social Security or taxes or health care . '
That 's why this proposal acknowledging the problem , endorsing this type of
commission is the right way for both of them , because then they do n't have to
get into the specifics but yet they then have an ability to take on the issues
after they 're president .
And for the sake of our country , our children and
grandchildren , they need to .
QUICK : All right , Dave , we 're going to talk more about the film later this
morning .
We 'll also be joined by Pete Peterson coming up .
But thank you for
getting up early with us to talk about this right off the bat .
And we 'll get
back to you just a little bit later this morning .
Mr. WALKER : Great .
QUICK : Again , we also have Warren Buffett who 's with you this morning .
We'll
be talking more about " I.O.U.S.A. , " but also the state of the economy .
We're
going to talk about the " Oracle of Omaha , " where he 's investing in the stock
market right now -- at least we 'll try and get that out of him .
Some of his
investments , his thoughts on the state of the banking system .
Stay tuned ,
this is a very special edition of SQUAWK BOX right here on CNBC .
( Announcements )
QUICK : All right , welcome back , everybody .
As we mentioned a little earlier ,
the movie " I.O.U.S.A. " premiered across the country last night , and we got the
chance to host a live town hall in Omaha that was simulcast to theaters across
the country last night .
Our CNBC team was on the ground at some of those
theaters across the country .
They got the chance to catch up with crowds from
the East Coast to the West Coast .
And , Warren , a lot of them heard you were going to be at this town hall
meeting , and so we had our cameras ask some of those people some questions
that they wanted to pose to you .
Are you ready ?
Mr. BUFFETT : I 'm ready .
QUICK : All right .
Let 's get to some ...
Mr. BUFFETT : Where 's the popcorn ?
QUICK : Oh , there -- they did n't provide popcorn quite this early ...
Mr. BUFFETT : All right .
QUICK : ... but we do have some questions that are coming up .
Let 's get to the
first question for Mr. Buffett .
Unidentified Man # 1 : Do you think there 's a characteristic about American
democracy that leads to American debt ?
QUICK : A characteristic about American democracy that leads to American debt .
What do you think ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , there 's nothing inappropriate about having debt in
America .
I mean , Berkshire has debt , and it 's helped us grow over time .
And
it 's when debt gets out of control that you worry .
But the American
democracy , it 's always fun to spend a little more than you take in , and that
applies to individuals , it applies to governments .
And in a $ 14 trillion
economy , having debt that 's 60 - odd percent of GDP is not inappropriate .
It
was n't inappropriate when we had 120 percent of GDP in debt after World War
II , because we had to fight a war .
QUICK : Although you can't expect to maintain deficits like that endlessly .
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah , you can expect to maintain a deficit that 's a given
percentage of the GDP .
I mean , Berkshire can expect to have debt forever , and
the larger we get in terms of our equity and earning power , the more debt we
can sustain .
And I do n't think our shareholders would want us to
operate -- take on some rule where we 're going to operate debt - free in the
future .
So it 's -- what you worry about is when the debt starts spiraling out
of control , when it goes up year after year after year as a percentage of GDP ,
because eventually when that occurs people -- if you try to borrow money around
the world in your own currency , the world will say no .
That 's what happened
in South America in the past , it happened in the -- in the Asian arena .
We are
able to borrow money in dollars .
The world trusts the dollar .
If we tried to
run our debt up to 3 - or 400 percent of GDP , nobody would want debt
denominated in dollars .
QUICK : OK .
Let 's take another question .
This one comes from Irvine ,
California .
Unidentified Man # 2 : Hey , Mr. Buffett , I would like to know what is going to
happen with Fannie Mae .
Are they going under ?
QUICK : That was , again , what would be the best investment to hedge against
the upcoming debt crisis ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah .
Well , I would say I do n't think there 's going to be an
upcoming debt crisis , but if you believe that fiscal activities that the
government will get out of control and that we will get on a situation where
the debt skyrockets , you will have , obviously , you 'll have
inflation -- significant inflation .
No government likes to pay back its debt in
dollars that are equivalent to the kind they took in .
The best thing you 're
going to have is develop your own talent .
I mean , if you 're the best doctor
in town , if you 're the best teacher in town , if you 're , you know , the best
salesman in town , you 'll do well no matter what the currency does .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : I mean , you will get your share .
So investing in yourself is
always the best thing .
Now , second best thing is to own products or stocks that have products that
do n't require much capital investment , because you do n't want to be -- have a
lot of required capital investment during inflation ; where they have very
little capital investment but they are sort of a royalty on whatever the
current price level is in the country .
I mean , if you take -- I do n't know what
product you might buy regularly , but what -- whatever you use for your hair
or ...
QUICK : ( Unintelligible )
Mr. BUFFETT : You 're not going to change that if the price level doubles .
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : And if they do n't have to build new plants or anything , they
just ride along that curve .
QUICK : OK .
And very quickly , that Irvine , California , question , I think we
heard the wrong one .
The Irvine question , another one he was just asking
about was what 's going to happen with Fannie Mae ?
Are they going under ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , in a sense they 've gone under in that -- in that they only
are existing because the federal government has said that they 're going to
back up their obligations , so that ...
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : ... from a standpoint of an independent entity , it -- it's -- the
game is over on that , pretty much .
And that does not mean the Fannie debt or
the guarantee on Fannie mortgages is bad .
Fannie Mae's an important
institution in the -- in the United States .
But they priced risk wrong .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT :
They did some things in accounting that were bad , they tried to
obtain goals that could n't be achieved , and in the -- and they leveraged up to
an extent that was kind of crazy and certainly was crazy to do it with the
assets that they were using the leverage for .
So essentially the equity got
wiped out .
QUICK : OK .
We 're going to take a quick break right now , but folks , when we
come back we 're going to talk about Warren and Bill 's excellent adventure .
We 'll get the inside story of your summer expedition with Bill Gates .
You
just went this week to look at the tar sands . @
Mr. BUFFETT : True .
QUICK : All right .
We 're going to talk about all of that when we come up , and
we 'll be checking in with questions from more viewers across the country , too .
Unidentified Man # 3 : I was very curious , in your recent 10 - Q , that you had
not purchased any bank stocks , very surprised that you had not jumped on that
in July .
I was wondering how low they have to go before you 're interested .

Announcer :
This is a special edition of SQUAWK BOX live from the Holland
Performing Arts Center in the heart of beautiful Omaha , Nebraska .
Now , once
again , here 's Warren Buffett and Becky Quick .
QUICK : Welcome back , everybody , to this special edition of SQUAWK BOX .
We've
been talking all morning long with Warren Buffett of Omaha , Nebraska , since
we 're live in Omaha today .
And , Warren , we 've covered a range of topics , but there has been an awful lot
of people who are interested in the trip you made this week .
On Monday you
headed up with Bill Gates and you got to take a look at the tar sands .
What
happened ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , what happened was Bill and I talked some months ago about
just how interesting the whole thing was from a geology standpoint and from
the standpoint that that represents one of the few big upcoming sources of
more oil production in the world , or very few .
And we both thought we'd
understand a little bit better if we went up and looked at it than simply by
reading about it .
So on Monday six of us , Bill and a few other fellows -- the
Kiewit company arranged it .
They 're -- they 've done a lot of construction up
there .
And we went up to northern Alberta and we saw a very big mining - type
project .
There are two ways that they recover oil from the tar sands .
And
then we went to this in situ project also , and we had some perfect people
explain a lot about how it worked both from a economic standpoint and from a
physical standpoint .
QUICK : Uh-huh .
And was this something that you came up with , that Bill came
up with , your friend , Walter Scott , from the Kiewit company ?
Who came up with
the idea ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , Walter Scott arranged it for us .
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : Walter 's a whole lot smarter than I am about what goes on in
mining and all of -- anything to do with the real world .
I 'm good with numbers .
And so he arranged the trip for us .
But it was something that Bill and I
cooked up by - - a couple of months ago when we were talking about the tar sands .
We said why do n't we go up and take a look ?
And so we found a date when six
of us could do it .
Walter arranged the trip .
We had some wonderful people up
there in Alberta at both projects that explained how the things really work ,
the costs involved .
And they just could n't have been more helpful .
QUICK : OK .
So having seen that , there 's already been a lot of people who've
been speculating that you must be interested in investing in this arena .
Are
you ?
Mr. BUFFETT : No , no .
I go to the movies , but I do n't buy movie companies .
I mean , I -- I 'm always interested in understanding the math of things and
understanding as much as I can about all aspects of business .
And what I
learn today may be useful to me two years from now .
I mean , if I understand
the tar stands today and oil prices change or whatever may happen , I 'm -- I've
got that filed away and I can -- I can use it at some later date .
And that 's
really the wonderful thing about investments is your knowledge is cumulative .
So if you learn about coal or you learn about retailing or something , 40 years
you -- it 's useful at some point .
QUICK : Wait , does that make you think that an investment in a tar sands
company , somebody who 's making -- taking advantage of that would not be worth it
at $ 120 a barrel for oil ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , the biggest variable in whether it's a good investment is
the price of oil .
Now , it 's important to know how much they can get out and
what their costs are going to be and what the capital costs -- all of that is
important and that fits into it .
But you still have to figure out what your
own feeling is about what oil 's going to be selling for three years from now
or five years from now .
Because you could be the world 's greatest mining
engineer , but if you were wrong about the price of oil in a big way it would
negate all that knowledge .
So it -- I can tell you that if 100 - - if you had $ 120
oil from now till , you know , 50 years from now , that the tar sands would
be --would work out very well .
But I do n't know the answer to that .
And I may
form an opinion at some point , and I 've got it -- I 'm prepared to form that
opinion now .
QUICK : But you are not actively looking right now to invest in any of these
companies ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Do I have a buy order this morning ?
The answer 's no .
QUICK : OK .
Warren , we have a lot more to get to with you this morning .
When
we return , we 're going to be speaking more with Warren Buffett .
Again , this
is a big day .
We 've still got two hours left and we 've still got two big
stories coming up .
Again , I 'm here live with Warren Buffett in Omaha .
We're
also going to be covering everything that 's happening with the Olympics .
Carl
is standing by live in Beijing .
This is day 13 of the Olympics , coming to an
end .
We 'll have more SQUAWK in two minutes .
CARL QUINTANILLA , co-anchor ( Beijing ) :
But first we 're going to start with the man of the hour , Beck -- actually , he's
the man of three hours -- Warren Buffett with you in Omaha .
BECKY QUICK , co-anchor ( Omaha , Nebraska ) :
That 's right , Carl .
We are live in Omaha today because last night there was a
groundbreaking event in the world of finance and politics and it took place
right here .
This was the world premiere of a documentary that 's called
" I.O.U.S.A . "
This film takes a look at what it thinks are America 's four key
deficits and it explores into all the risks of these deficits , what it means
to the future of this country and its citizens .
Now , Warren , you were in the documentary last night right along with Robert
Rubin , with Paul Volcker and with Alan Greenspan .
So let 's take a quick look
at a brief clip from the film last night .
( Clip from " I.O.U.S.A. " )
QUICK : OK .
Again , that was a clip with Alan Greenspan from the movie last
night .
It premiered on hundreds of movie screens across the country last
night , including right here in Omaha .
After the debut , I got the chance to
moderate a town hall meeting with the men who were behind the movie ,
Blackstone 's Pete Peterson and the former US Comptroller General David Walker .
This is a quick look from that .
And Warren , we did have a big discussion last night about what the big
problems are and exactly where things are going at this moment .
In your -- in
your view , we just heard from Alan Greenspan , he said that you need to be
looking at what 's happening down the road .
What do you think about that ?
Mr. WARREN BUFFETT ( Berkshire Hathaway Chairman & CEO ) :
Well , I think in any
personal activity , business activity or certainly governmental activity , you
know , there should be -- you should be thinking plenty about what happens down
the road .
That 's one of the jobs of government is to think about what is
going to be our energy situation if we do n't change 20 or 30 years from now .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : What 's going to be the fiscal situation .
And so unfortunately ,
you have a many -- the most important things in society , the policy cycle is
longer than the electoral cycle .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : So it 's very tough to elect people every two years and ask them
to be thinking about something 20 years down the road .
QUICK : OK .
We 're going to talking more about this film in just a little bit .
David Walker will be joining us again , Pete Peterson , to talk about some of
these issues .
We also , though , have you here for a lot of things that are happening right
now in the economy .
And at the top of the last hour you talked about where
you think the economy is headed .
You still think that the trouble in the
economy , it could get much deeper from here ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , I think you 're seeing the ripples go out from what 's
started as a crisis in home lending and the fact that we had a-- we had a
housing boom fueled by a lot of lending by people who did n't know what they
were lending on .
And that 's caused enormous problems in the financial markets
as people have started looking at these instruments which they thought were
triple - A and they 're finding out they 're about triple - F and -- but those
problem -- problems have a way of spreading , and that caused the banks to start
want -- starting to want to start deleveraging in a big way .
And when banks
start deleveraging , that has -- sends ripples out .
So there 's consequences to
every pebble that 's dropped in the ocean and we had a pretty big pebble
dropped in .
QUICK : Now , you -- your view of the economy comes not only from your own
holdings , all the companies that you own outright -- everything from GEICO to
Dairy Queen to Gen Re to Acme Brick Company , all the companies that you
hold -- but also the holdings that you have in other big companies , correct ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Right .
QUICK : What sort of insight does that give you ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , it -- obviously , I pay a lot of attention to what 's
happening .
And we 'll say at American Express -- and Ken Chenault talked about
that here a month ago -- but they are experiencing credit deterioration and
they 're experiencing it sort of in all segments .
So they 're seeing the rich
customers slow down in payments , slow down in purchases .
And American Express
can describe that rather than I , but I pay a lot of attention to that sort of
thing .
And incidentally , it will get cured at some time in the future , but
right now the situation is getting worse and I would say I do n't see any early
end to that .
QUICK : We want to talk to you about ...
Mr. BUFFETT : But I do see an end .
QUICK : You do see an end , but no early end .
I mean , is that six months , is
that 12 months , is that 18 months ?
Mr. BUFFETT : I do n't know .
QUICK : Can you put a time ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah , I do n't know the answer to that .
All I know is that it's
not -- I do n't think it 's going to be really soon .
I think that -- my candidate
is Obama , so I think President Obama is going to have plenty on his plate in
January .
QUICK : OK .
Let 's talk about your most recent disclosures for some of your
holdings .
When we saw the last numbers , your shares in Anheuser - Busch , a lot
of people were surprised to see that you had gotten out of those shares before
a deal went through with InBev .
Mr. BUFFETT : That 's right .
I sold about 60 percent of them in the second
quarter .
QUICK : Why ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , I was n't -- it was an evaluation of whether I thought the
deal would go through and the desire to sell at least some of the shares .
I
mean , Anheuser - Busch did not want the deal to go through and they hired
investment bankers , very expensive .
They spent $ 72 million with two
investment banking firms .
And believe me , most of that was spent with the
idea of trying to keep InBev away .
So who knew how it was going to come out ?
And InBev persevered , they raised their price and on the remaining shares
we 'll do somewhat better ; although there 's still a time factor and we 've used
the money for other things .
But in retrospect , I was wrong to decide to
partially sell the holdings .
QUICK : What ...
Mr. BUFFETT : But that -- that 's not news .
I 'm often wrong .
QUICK : What price did you sell at ?
It did not say in the filings .
Mr. BUFFETT : Oh , I -- we probably averaged around 61 or 2 , something like
that .
QUICK : OK , 61 or 62 , you still had a third .
Are you -- do you still hold that
position ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah .
We -- yeah .
We hold the shares , yeah .
You did n't ask me
that last time , so yeah .
QUICK : I know , I did n't .
I had to circle back this time a lot .
So you still
have those shares .
One of the other things from that filing that Berkshire filed with the SEC
noted that you were n't talking at that point about what 's going on with
ConocoPhillips .
Mr. BUFFETT : That 's right .
QUICK : OK .
Well , we have you here right now .
That means a lot of people are
out there assuming that you 're either buying or selling shares of Conoco
and ...
Mr. BUFFETT : That 's certainly correct .
QUICK : And if I was a betting man , would it be right to think that maybe you
were selling and taking profits based on where oil prices have gone ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , if you were a betting man , you 'd be betting .
QUICK : Oh , so you 're not going to necessarily come out there on that .
Let 's talk about the price of oil in general .
Mr. BUFFETT : Sure .
QUICK : Price of oil has gone rapidly higher in the last few days .
Once
again , about 120 , still down from where it was ...
Mr. BUFFETT : Mm-hmm .
QUICK : ... just a month ago .
But 120 , you think that that 's a comfortable
price for oil ?
Mr. BUFFETT : It 's very hard to tell , but what you do know is that the
situation in respect to supply and demand in oil has changed dramatically in
the last five or six years from what has existed ever since World War II .
I
mean , ever since World War II we 've always had a significant amount of
producible capacity beyond the demand that existed .
Now , maybe for one reason
or another it was n't being produced .
The Texas Railroad Commission used to -- which was kind of -- kind of a domestic OPEC -- used to shut down the wells in Texas because there was so much producing capacity and they did n't want to knock down the price , which was $ 3 a barrel then .
So we 've always had the
situation post World War II where it 's been a lot more supply could come on
than there was demand .
In the last 10 years , the first five years oil demand
went up around four million barrels a day , and then in the next five years it
went up another eight million barrels a day .
That 's 12 million barrels a day .
We did not bring on , in the world , anything like that in terms of productive
capacity .
So at 86 million barrels a day , which is the present demand ,
roughly ...
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : ... the world that has no real buffer stock in terms of the -- you
ca n't turn the tap on and get 90 or 95 .
And that means that prices have been
and will be quite volatile and probably - - well , they have been at a-- certainly
at a higher level .
It is a different world in terms of supply and demand on
oil than existed five years ago .
QUICK : What 's your thought as to what the nation needs to be doing right now ?
I know you 've spoken with Boone Pickens about his plan .
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah .
Well , Boone 's on the right track .
And then one way or
another , you know , we 're using 20 million barrels or so a day of oil , we're
using a quarter of the oil , roughly , in the world .
We and the world cannot
certainly keep increasing our demand for oil .
If we -- if we required another
10 million or 12 million barrels a day in the next 10 years , I 'm not sure
where it would come from or at what price it would come from .
We just do n't
have that .
The tar sands would actually - - will increase some , but oil
depletes , production of oil depletes .
QUICK : Hm .
Mr. BUFFETT : And so one way or another , we 're going to have to learn to use
a lot less oil .
And my guess is we 're using less oil right now in the United
States because of price factors .
QUICK : Yes .
Mr. BUFFETT : But I 'm not sure that the world demand is -- maybe it 's decreased
a million barrels a day or something like that , but that is n't going to do it
over 10 years .
We 're going to have to use less oil .
QUICK : OK , Warren , we 're going to be checking in with you again after we come
back .
We 'll have more from Omaha , folks .
But we 're also going to be checking
in with Carl .
He 's got plenty more coming up in Beijing .
Carl :
QUINTANILLA : Becky , if Warren breaks any more news we 're going to have to
just go off the air here , our heads are going to explode for all he
information that 's coming from him .
***
Mr. BUFFETT : ( From town hall meeting )
Every line in the tax code is
important to some constituency .
I 'm not sure every line in the Bible is ,
though .
The -- and actually , you know , you 've got thousands of lobbyists there
protecting each line in the tax code and I 'm - - again , I 'm not sure about
whether the Bible has an equal army of people in -- on K Street .
QUICK : All right , that was Warren Buffett answering a question on taxes
during our town hall right here in Omaha last night .
Again , this was a town
hall that was celebrating and looking into the opening of " I.O.U.S.A. , " that 's
a new documentary that opened and premiered last night in theaters across the
country .
That question that came was from someone who wrote in asking why the
tax code is longer than the Bible .
Well , it 's something we got to talk about
with plenty of our participants last night .
In fact , we 're joined right now
by some of the other participants in that conversation .
Pete Peterson is here with us this morning .
Also David Walker and Bill
Novelli , the CEO of the AARP .
And gentlemen , thank you for being here once again this morning on the same
stage where we were last night .
I 'm guessing everybody is working on
adrenaline at this point , practically all - nighters for everybody involved .
Pete , let 's start out with you .
The movie last night , " I.O.U.S.A. , " is
something that the Peter G. Peter -- Peter G. Peterson Foundation did put some
financial backing into .
Why did you get interested in it ?
What 's important
that you think in the message ?
Mr. PETE PETERSON ( Peter G. Peterson Foundation ) :
Well , Dave and I have
concluded unanimously , the two of us , that the country faces some long - term
challenges that if we do n't address them are undeniable , at least in our
opinion , unsustainable , and yet they 're , politically speaking , not touchable .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. PETERSON : And our job , we think , in a democracy like ours is to use
every means we can , and this film is only part of a much broader program to
educate the American public and to activate them and motivate them to do
something about it .
And the doing something about it is essentially to let
our elected representatives know that this is serious and they want action .
At the present time they feel -- that is , our representatives feel that if they
confront some of these long - term problems , since all of them involve somebody
either giving up something or paying more for something , that it will
result -- not only being politically incorrect , but politically terminal .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. PETERSON : And we 've got to change that around so that they feel that if
they do n't do anything , then they 're going to be in re-election trouble .
QUICK : David Walker , we spoke with you earlier this morning .
Again , David
Walker who 's the former comptroller general of the United States .
If you have
to look and put your finger on one issue that you think is the most pressing
thing , what is it ?
Mr. DAVID WALKER ( Peter G. Peterson Foundation ) : Health care costs are
totally out of control .
Health care costs represent 34 trillion , just
Medicare alone , 34 trillion of our $ 53 trillion hole .
The United States is
the only country on the face of the earth that 's dumb enough not to have a
budget for health care .
Every other country does .
We need to engage in
fundamental reform of health care to achieve universal coverage for basic and
essential health care , have a budget for health care .
We need universal
practice standards , evidence - based practice standards , and we need to enhance
personal responsibility and accountability .
QUICK : All right .
Bill , you represent the AARP , and some people have said in
the past that seniors get very concerned when you start taking away benefits
or changing things that have been set up .
What are -- what does your
constituency think about the plan presented here ?
Mr. WILLIAM NOVELLI ( AARP CEO ) :
Well , we 've done a tremendous amount of
research among our 40 million members and the rest of the public down to 18
years old , and we 're pretty sure that the public is ahead of the politicians .
People do want change .
The generations in this country are very closely
connected to each other and they have one thing in common , they want this
country to be strong for the future , for their children and their
grandchildren .
And so what we have here is a big opportunity .
This video
that has been done here is a good kind of wake - up call , and from an AARP
standpoint we can do town hall meetings across the country , thousands of them .
So this is an opportunity to make change .
QUICK : Warren , you 're not convinced that things are quite as dire .
Mr. BUFFETT : No , I -- the short - term outlook is not .
But we 've had a number
of recessions in this country ; in fact , we had a Great Depression , we
had -- we 've got world wars .
And throughout , the genius of the American
economy , our emphasis on a meritocracy and a market system and a rule of law
has enabled generation after generation to live better than their parents did .
And , I mean , most of the people in this room , practically all of them last
night , lived better than John D. Rockefeller lived .
I mean , all kinds of
things have happened .
And in the 20th century alone , the standard of living
of the average American went up seven for one .
There 's never been a period
like it in history .
And that 's not an accident .
It 's because we unleash
human potential and will continue to do that in the future .
And we 'll always
have challenges and we 'll always have disputes between different demographic
groups and income groups .
The rich do n't want to pay their share of the
taxes .
The poor probably , you know , they -- in the last 20 years , the net worth
of the Forbes 400 has gone from 220 billion to a trillion five hundred and
forty billion .
So you 'll always have fights within the family about who gets
what of the pie , but the pie will grow .
QUICK : But there are points that all four of you agree on .
What 's the
closest point where , I mean , you say , ` Yes , this is something the American
people need to hear ' ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , I think you should always be thinking about the future .
I mean , I think you 're crazy if you 're not -- if you 're not planning out where
you 'll be in 10 and 20 or 30 years .
You 'll get surprises in those plans .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : And frankly , American ingenuity will tend to surprise on the
upside much of the time .
I also think that it 's dangerous politically over
time .
It does n't endanger the economy in a huge way , but it 's dangerous
politically over time to run very large current account deficits whereby
there 's a massive transfer of assets or IOUs to the rest of the world from
America .
I think that will cause a lot of demagoguery and potentially some
real problems 20 years down the road .
We 'd still have a more prosperous
society .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : But it would n't be -- would n't be as good as if we did n't do it .
QUICK : David ?
Mr. WALKER : I think we agree on two things .
I believe all four of us do ,
based on listening last night and talking this morning .
Number one , we need
to focus on the future .
QUICK : Hm .
Mr. WALKER : We 're a great country , we need to do a number of things to make
sure we stay great .
And secondly , we support a capable , credible and
bipartisan commission to be able to make recommendations to the next president
and the next Congress to deal with some of these challenges so we can start
making a down payment on our big hole and try to increase the likelihood that
our future will be better than our past .
QUICK : You 've had conversations with both campaigns , with the McCain and the
Obama campaigns .
What 's been your takeaway from those conversations ?
Mr. WALKER : Well , the takeaway is there 's a difference between getting
elected and governing , and there 's a tendency for people not to want to talk
with too much specificity with regard to some of these challenges in order to
get elected .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Right .
Mr. WALKER : The challenge is this :
If they do n't at least acknowledge the
problem and figure a -- figure a path for it , like a commission , then you do n't
have a mandate to be able to do something after you 're elected .
And so that 's
why I think acknowledging the problem , endorsing a capable , credible and
bipartisan commission is the right thing to do for them and the right thing
for the country .
QUICK : Mr. Peterson , you put some financing into this film .
Would you
consider doing a debate with the two political candidates that focuses
specifically on the economic issues out there ?
Mr. PETERSON : I 'm just the aging founder of this .
We have the CEO sitting
here .
We 're exploring all kinds of possibilities .
Mr. BUFFETT :
The one thing you wo n't find , Becky , you wo n't -- you wo n't find
either candidate telling you that if we 're going to spend $ 3.1 trillion next
year , the federal government will tell you how they 're going to raise 3.1
trillion .
They just are n't going to come up with it .
They ...
QUICK : Long on promises , short on ways on how to do it right now .
Mr. WALKER : Maybe if you invited them , they 'd come .
But they would have
some trepidation , I think .
And I think we 'd find some ways to come up with
some funding for it if it was necessary .
QUICK : But ...
Mr. PETERSON :
The other big audience that we 're going to focus on are the
young people .
And I 'm one of these old fogies that does n't even do e-mail , so
I 'm hardly the person to plan it .
But we 've got a bunch of young people who
are experts looking at Facebook and MySpace and MTV and so forth , because it's
going to be very important to get these young people aware of their future ,
incidentally , not mine .
Buffett and I 'll do pretty well , if we do n't live ...
Mr. BUFFETT : I hope so .
Mr. PETERSON : If we do n't live too long .
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah .
QUICK : David , if you had , again , to take a look and go out to Congress , do
you think this is a message that plays back ?
You 're in an election season ,
it 's a tricky time .
But what 's been the push back ?
What 's been the ...
Mr. WALKER : Well , I agree with what Bill Novelli said .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. WALKER : I mean , the American people are ahead of the politicians .
QUICK : Hm .
Mr. WALKER : They 're not accustomed to hearing the truth from the politicians
and they 're looking for two things .
They want truth and they want leadership .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. WALKER : And they need -- we need more of both right now .
So I think that
if we can get the American people engaged , involved , if we can get the
presidential candidates to acknowledge the problem , to be able to endorse the
type of commission we 're talking about as a way forward , there 's hope .
QUICK : OK .
Mr. NOVELLI : Becky , you got a question last night from a woman who said ,
` I 'm a boomer and I 'm worried about my adult daughter . '
QUICK : Yeah .
Mm-hmm .
Mr. NOVELLI : This is true all over the country .
You know , the majority of
adults in this country think that their children are going to be worse off
than they were .
This would be the American dream going backwards .
We can't
let this happen .
QUICK : All right , gentlemen , I want to thank you all for joining us this
morning .
It 's a topic we 'll be discussing through this morning as well .
But also coming up , this is something you 've never heard Warren Buffett talk
about ever before .
We 're going to be back in two minutes .
I 'm as intrigued
as you are .
Mr. BUFFETT : ( Unintelligible )
QUICK : So is he , you should see his face .
We 're going to be spending the
morning with the world 's most famous investor and we have much more SQUAWK
right after this .
BECKY QUICK , co-anchor ( Omaha , Nebraska ) :
Coming up , we will have much more from the " Oracle of Omaha . "
He has lots of
wisdom to share with all of us .
In fact , just listen to this .
Mr. WARREN BUFFETT ( Berkshire Hathaway Chairman & CEO ) :
It has not paid to
sell America short since 1776 , and the time to start is not 2008 .
QUICK : All right .
Welcome back , everyone , to this special edition of SQUAWK
BOX .
We are live in Omaha , Nebraska , and we are fortunate enough to be joined
this morning with Warren Buffett .
He 's got to be the world 's most celebrated
investor .
Warren , we want to thank you for joining us here this morning .
Mr. BUFFETT : I 'm enjoying it .
QUICK : Well , we have a lot to talk about .
If you take a look at what 's been
happening with the Federal Reserve , with the challenges they 've been facing ,
what kind of job , what kind of ratings would you give the Federal Reserve up
to this point ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , I -- I 'm inclined to give anybody that takes on a tough job
like that a pretty good rating .
I mean , they get the toughest problems of the
world thrown at them .
And in my job , I wait for easy pitches .
I mean , I -- you
know , somebody can say Microsoft at 27 or General Motors at 10 and I do n't
have to swing .
I -- there 's no called strike in my business .
So I wait -- I
could wait a year and get one pitch I like and swing .
And so I wait for the
easy ones .
And in the Federal Reserve position , you have to take on the
toughest problems .
There are no obvious answers , there 's trade - offs .
And
when I -- when somebody that 's very bright , very public - spirited takes on the
job , I 'm disinclined to ever criticize .
QUICK : Do you think the Federal Reserve has gotten inflation under control ?
Do you think that they 've focused a fair amount on the economy ?
Mr. BUFFETT : No , they 've got a tough problem .
I mean , with these dual goals
of essentially stimulating growth and at the same time containing inflation ,
they 're in direct conflict .
And the temptation is , since the lack of growth
is apparent today and the inflation tends to kick in later on , to ignore the
inflation aspects .
It 's a very tough balancing act and it can't be done
perfectly .
And like I say , I could n't do it perfectly and I do n't think
anybody can , but I admire the people that take on the job .
I admire Bernanke ,
I admire Greenspan .
That does n't mean I think they were always right .
It 's -- I think they 're thought to have more power than they really do have .
I
mean , Ben Bernanke does not have any magic wand that 's going to create -- enable
people that have borrowed too much money on their homes or people who 've lent
unwisely or the banks that are too leveraged , that does n't go away easily .
QUICK : We talked earlier this morning about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and
some of the major problems facing those two institutions right now .
In your
opinion do these stocks , you think , get wiped out ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , there 's certainly a reasonable chance of [ Fannie and Freddie going bankrupt ] because they wrote insurance at the wrong price .
And if you write insurance and
write -- we write insurance at the wrong price , you know , we 're going to go
broke .
I mean , it -- when you write insurance , you make a promise .
In their
case , they guaranteed the credit of trillions of dollars worth of mortgages
and they charged a service fee for doing it -- an insurance premium you can call
it -- and they got the wrong price for it .
And then they -- their other activity ,
which is to run a very large sort of hedge fund with a carry , where they lend
money long and they borrow money in various ways , they had a spread on that .
And that works fine as long as the spread 's maintained and they 've done some
things to protect that , but it does n't do well if the assets crumble on them ,
and they 've had some crumbling .
So they got into trouble the way people have
historically got into trouble both in terms of running a carry trade and both
in -- and in terms of writing insurance at the wrong prices .
And there is no
easy cure .
You can't tear up your old insurance contracts .
And they
can -- they keep existing because they 've got the federal government behind
them .
And the federal government should be behind them , excluding the equity
portion .
QUICK : You own shares of Fannie Mae , Berkshire Hathaway did , up until when ,
about 2001 ?
Mr. BUFFETT : We were the largest shareholders of Freddie Mac in the -- in the
United States , and around 2000 or 2001 ...
QUICK : Yeah .
Mr. BUFFETT : ... it became so apparent to me that they were intent on trying
to report quarterly gains to please Wall Street , and there are all - - if you 've
got the government behind you and you can borrow money in unlimited amounts ,
you can report earnings for any given quarter that you want to .
I mean , the
chickens do n't come home to roost till later .
And the management was intent
on that .
They started doing things on the asset side they should n't have
done , they made promises they should n't have made , and so we got out .
QUICK : All right .
If -- is there anything that would ever convince to you get
back in , or would these companies have to be completely recapitalized and
reset up ?
Mr. BUFFETT : It would -- it would -- it would take a much different situation .
QUICK : ( Unintelligible )
Mr. BUFFETT : You need -- if you run an institution with enormous leverage , you
need somebody with a fiduciary gene running it .
And they had a peculiar
problem in that they were trying to serve two masters .
And then Congress was
telling them push the money out and foster housing in every way you can , do n't
require as much in down payments , make -- you know , all kinds of things , take on
projects that they would n't have taken on for an economic reason .
And Wall
Street was saying deliver us 15 percent earnings gains every quarter .
And
they tried to do both of those things , and in the end they 're going to do
neither .
QUICK : When you take a look at the United States and its stock market
compared to what you see overseas right now , where -- what makes you most
excited when ...
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , I see values in all arenas .
I mean , we try to look for
the best ones , but there 's no magic to any given market and things are cheaper
than they were a year ago in markets here and in markets around the world .
So
everything is more attractive , generally speaking , both here and in Germany
and the UK and Korea and you name it .
And I just try to look for the things I
understand the best and that also are selling for less than I think they 're
worth .
QUICK : The dollar has gotten much stronger over the last month .
Mr. BUFFETT : Right .
QUICK : Is that a trend that you think can or will continue ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , it wo n't continue if over the next five or 10 years we
run very large current account deficits .
Now , exports have been doing well
lately .
I mean , the country is remarkably innovative and resilient .
I mean ,
we are going to export 12 percent of our GDP this year , and in 1970 it was 5
percent .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : So people who think that America is not in the game are totally
wrong .
But we have been importing like 17 percent of GDP .
If we have that
gap and it continues , the dollar over time will get weaker .
Not necessarily
next week or next month or next year , but it will get weaker over time .
You
ca n't run persistent , huge current account deficits for decades and not have
consequences .
QUICK : But you do n't have any bets against the dollar right now .
Mr. BUFFETT : Not right now .
QUICK : You 've taken them in the past .
At the moment , nothing ?
Mr. BUFFETT : That 's right .
QUICK : You have any currency plays right now ?
Mr. BUFFETT : None -- no direct currency play .
We own stocks in companies in
other countries , but no currency plays .
QUICK : OK , let 's take a couple questions from people that we were listening
from last night .
Again , we 've been spending the morning with you , but last
night we did have CNBC crews who went out to some of the theaters across the
country that were previewing " I.O.U.S.A . "
We got a chance to catch up with
some of the people there and ask them a few questions .
Let 's start out with
one question that 's coming from Chicago .
Unidentified Woman : Hi , Warren .
Identifying the debt problem and coming up
with a solution seems like an easier task than motivating Congress .
What
would you suggest that we do to help motivate a shortsighted Congress ?
QUICK : OK .
That 's , again , going back to how do you motivate a shortsighted
congress .
What would you suggest ?
Mr. BUFFETT : It 's very tough .
I mean , in the end , can I name a politician
in the last 20 years that said , ` My campaign is I 'm going to increase your
taxes a lot and come close to closing the budget deficit . '
And since nobody
wants spending cut -- they all want the other guy 's spending cut ...
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : ... and , you know , we 'll have to increase taxes .
I -- Walter
Mondale tried it in 1984 without much success .
Now , what I do with
politicians is I ask them what they believe in and will work for that a
majority of their constituents oppose .
Now , if they give me an answer to
that , I know they really believe that .
I mean , I do n't get long answers to
that question .
But what they ...
QUICK : I bet you do n't .
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah , no .
But that 's the real test of what they believe in .
Anybody 's for anything that gets them elected , so if they -- if they say , `I'm
for lowering your taxes , ' or `I 'm for bringing all kinds of things to my
district , ' or `earmarking things , ' you know , of course they 're going to say
that .
And they 'll say that whether they believe in it or not because it keeps
their jobs .
Now , the question is what do they believe in that might endanger
their job if in -- if done ?
QUICK : What did Barack Obama say when you asked him that question ?
You're
supporting him .
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah .
I 'm not going to ask him that question .
QUICK : You have n't asked him that question .
Mr. BUFFETT : No , I did n't -- I did n't -- I did n't put that one to him .
QUICK : Why not ?
Mr. BUFFETT : I did n't feel like putting him on the spot that way .
QUICK : But he got your support anyways .
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , I have a choice of two candidates ...
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : ... and I support Barack and I think that on balance he will be
better for America .
Although I admire John McCain as an individual , but I
think that Barack would be better .
But I will -- I can tell you that both
candidates are not addressing things in the campaign that are important
issues , because they feel it 'll cost them votes .
QUICK : What do you think is the most important issue that 's not being
addressed by either campaign ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , I think in the -- certainly in the financial area .
Now ,
they 've both made certain proposals on taxes , but in terms of the realism of
what would happen in terms of closing budget deficits or something of the
sort , I do n't think they really want to get that specific about it now .
QUICK : OK .
I think we 're going to have more on this conversation -- a little
bit more about what 's happening in the election , what you think about the
ideas of a windfall profits tax , and we 'll talk about all of those issues in
just a little bit coming up .
Meantime , though , we 're going to take a very quick break and let you catch
your breath .
You can have a sip of your Cherry Coke .
You , too .
Anyway ,
folks , we 'll be right back with much more from Warren Buffett on his home turf
right here in Omaha , Nebraska .
( Announcements )
QUICK : Warren , you could n't hear what Steve had just been talking about , but
he did say that one point coming out of Jackson Hole is that this rise we've
seen again in the dollar -- rise that we 've seen again in oil is clear evidence
that the Fed does not have everything under control when it comes to
inflation .
What do you think about that ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , the Fed does n't have -- but even without that fact , I mean ,
the Fed 's got real problems with inflation and have got it in commodity
prices .
I -- every business we have , but some of them in a dramatic way , are
getting cost increases thrown at us .
I just was looking at the reports for
July on certain businesses , and we 're trying to push through price increases
ourselves .
And our margins are getting squeezed in certain major businesses
simply because we do n't get price increases as fast as we 're getting them .
But we 're pushing up prices .
QUICK : So you see it going right through ?
Which ...
Mr. BUFFETT : Sure it 's going to go through .
QUICK : Which businesses are the toughest to get them through ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , it 's tough , and we 're in various things connected with
residential housing .
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : Take carpet , for example ...
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : ... or insulation .
These things all have a huge energy base to
them .
I mean , carpet is oil , and weekly we get these price increases thrown
at us and they 're usually effective immediately , whereas we have trouble with
our retailers getting them to say , well , 30 days from now or 60 days from now .
And we do n't want to -- we do n't like telling a retailer that you can have your
price increase tomorrow .
So there have been increase after increase in prices
and our margins are still going down , and that 's happening -- if you take brick ,
that 's natural gas .
I mean , there 's all kinds of areas where it 's happening .
Food it 's just -- it 's pouring through .
QUICK : But does that mean you were not surprised by that very hot PPI number
that we just ...
Mr. BUFFETT : No , I was n't surprised at all .
QUICK : You were n't .
Mr. BUFFETT : No .
I -- in fact , if anything I feel that the CPI has been sort
of understating what 's been going on .
We are in an -- we are in a economy that
is going to see significant -- and is seeing significant inflation .
The
only -- the only people who are n't getting much inflation are blue - collar
workers and the middle class in terms of their income .
So they are getting
squeezed like crazy .
QUICK : Would it -- does that mean you expect to see more PPI increases and
eventually see that showing up in the CPI as well ?
Mr. BUFFETT : It has to , but -- yeah .
They -- the cost of living is going up
and , you know , unfortunately , the prices of houses going down and
there 's-- there are problems in the economy .
We will get through this .
But as
Paul Volcker mentioned in the movie last night , the problem with inflation is
if it gets ignited , it gets very hard to put at a -- at a -- at a point .
I mean ,
Paul Volcker had to go in with a 2x4 to the economy in the early ' 80s and we
had inflationary expectations built in to a terrific degree .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : And if that happens again , we 've got lots of troubles .
QUICK : Warren , we teased earlier that we were going to mention something
nobody had heard about just yet .
We know that you 're a huge baseball fan , but
you also have a big day coming up .
What is that big day ?
Mr. BUFFETT : It 's a -- it 's a huge day for all of baseball , actually .
On
September 9th in Fenway Park I will be starting .
And -- but more important than
that -- because I 've thrown out the first pitch other times -- but this time I
brought my secret weapon .
QUICK : Which is ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Jack Welch is going to be my catcher .
QUICK : Jack Welch is your catcher .
Mr. BUFFETT : Yeah .
I mean , can you imagine being able to pitch with Jack
calling the pitches ?
And , I mean , anything he calls for .
I 've got -- I 've got
a fastball , a curve , a sinker , you know , a spitball , a knuckleball , a sidearm
delivery .
And if Jack calls for any pitch , including the ball that bounces
four or five times before it gets to the plate , I 'm going to throw it .
QUICK : You 're going to throw exactly what he calls for .
Mr. BUFFETT : So if I -- if that 's the pitch , it 's because Jack called it .
QUICK : All right , we 'll all be watching that .
That 's coming up , again , you
said September 9th .
Mr. BUFFETT : September 9th , right .
QUICK : OK .
Folks , we still have a lot more to come this morning .
You have
not heard the last from Warren Buffett yet .
We 'll get much more on his
holdings , what he 's thinking about buying and selling , maybe .
We 'll also talk
to him about the economy .
We 'll get to the election and much , much more .
Plus , do n't forget , Carl is live in Beijing as day 13 of the Olympics comes to
an end .
We are going for the gold this morning .
This is a special split
edition of SQUAWK BOX live from America 's heartland and from China .
It 's all
coming up when we come right back .
BECKY QUICK , co-anchor ( Omaha , Nebraska ) :
Welcome back , everyone , to SQUAWK BOX here on CNBC , first in business
worldwide .
We are just one hour away from the opening bell right now .
Again ,
we 've been watching the futures higher through the morning .
We 've been
spending a lot of time this morning with Warren Buffett and he 's been
answering questions from followers across the country .
If you see right now ,
the Dow futures are , in fact , close to 100 points above fair value , but let's
head back to California to get a question of - - from one of you at home .
Unidentified Man # 1 : What are the odds that we could have a bank failure
similar to the 1929 era ?
QUICK : Warren , that question was , again , what are the odds that we could have
a bank failure similar to what we saw in 1929 ?
Mr. WARREN BUFFETT ( Berkshire Hathaway CEO ) :
Well , that 's quite unlikely ,
partly because of the FDIC .
People - - you had failures in the Great Depression
where the failure of Bank A caused the failure of Bank B .
When they saw a
line at Bank A , everybody lined up at Bank B and then they lined up at Bank C .
And the FDIC was one of the great ideas of the Depression .
You 've got
terrific woman , Sheila Bair , running that .
So we wo n't see failures simply
because there 's a wave of failures elsewhere .
What we 'll see here are
failures where the banks were dumb in what they did and you will see a fair
number of those .
We had a huge number of bank failures in this Midwest area ,
including Nebraska , in the early 1980s when there was a farm bubble .
Where
there 's been a real estate bubble and the bankers have participated big time ,
you 'll see some bank failures , but you will not see any losses to anybody
that -- in terms of FDIC covered accounts of 100,000 or under , so nobody needs
to worry about their $ 80,000 account at any bank , even though the bank may
have been run in a dumb way .
QUICK : Although you 've said it before that the financial system is much more
intertwined and linked than it had been in the past , especially when you start
looking at some of the investment banks and beyond .
Do you worry about that ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , that 's why the Fed had to rush in on Bear Stearns .
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : I mean , they were n't -- they were n't worried about Bear Stearns ,
they were worried about the consequences of Bear Stearns toppling and then the
domino action following , which would 've happened in my view .
I think they
made exactly the right decision .
There 's enormous interconnection and
derivatives have accentuated that in a big way so that trouble spread .
And
even if you made sound loans getting 10 or 20 percent down , if the other guy
made a bunch of dumb loans and that causes a huge supply of houses and house
prices , appreciation , and even the better loans can get impaired to some
degree .
So nobody gets insulated from the problems of the economy .
And if
you 're a bank , you feel some of those effects no matter how prudent you 've
been over time .
But there 's not going to be a wise -- there 's not going to be
bank failures happening just because there 's other banks fail .
QUICK : Could there be another Bear Stearns this time around , though ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Sure .
People -- and I 've said that you only find out who 's been
swimming naked when the tide goes out .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , Wall Street has turned out to be a nudist beach .
I mean ,
there 's-- there 've been plenty of people that pushed balance sheets extremely
hard .
I mean , there was virtually no limit on credit .
People , anything was
going in the credit market and they were mispricing credit , they were -- they
were overleveraging and now the truth comes out as people start looking with ,
you know , some care at what 's really on the liability side and the asset side
of these banks .
A long time ago there was a movie producer holding an annual
meeting and one of his shareholders said in the film , you know , ` I do n't
understand all these figures , Mr. Scurus , ' or whatever his name was .
` What
do they mean ? '
And the CEO said , ` Well , ' he said , ` I do n't really understand
them very well , either . '
But he said , ` But I can tell you this , the
liabilities are good . '
Well , that 's what you find out in a period like this .
The assets may not be so hot , but the liabilities are good and then that 's
when the trouble begins .
QUICK : When people start looking around to find the next potential Bear
Stearns , Lehman Brothers is the name that comes up again and again .
Should
people be concerned about what 's happening at Lehman ?
Mr. BUFFETT : I do n't think it 's appropriate , really , to talk about
financials .
QUICK : Financials , in particular , banks .
Mr. BUFFETT : No .
I think that -- I really think that 's inappropriate to talk
about them .
QUICK : Do you think that 's caused ...
Mr. BUFFETT : I have no problem talking about Fannie and Freddie because the
government stands behind them .
QUICK : Do you think that 's part of what caused the problems with Bear
Stearns , though ?
Once the rumors get out , once the media picks up on it , once
the names came back again and again ?
Is that ...
Mr. BUFFETT : If you had a $ 400 billion balance sheet and 400 or so billion
of stated equity underneath it , that means that you 're dependent on the
kindness of strangers every day .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : And you know , it -- if the strangers are n't there , you do n't have
a way of paying back the 400 billion .
And so if your name is bandied -- if
you -- in the case of the kindness of strangers , if your virtue is questioned ,
you know , you 've got a problem .
And there is no bank , investment bank , that
can pay all its liabilities tomorrow , and if people present those liabilities
and say we do n't want to have anything to do with you , even if you offer us a
little more on the repos or something of the sort , the game is over and it's
a-- I think Jamie Dimon said , you know , `Anybody who spreads rumors about
financial institutions ought to be -- ought to be put in jail . '
It 's -- you can
cause trouble .
If I were to say XYZ is in trouble , they are in trouble .
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : I mean , you create your own fire in this case .
QUICK : Do you agree with Jamie Dimon that people should be going after the
people who are spreading rumors about these financial institutions ?
Mr. BUFFETT : It 's hard to do .
I mean , to find out where a rumor starts or
anything .
But I mean , it is -- it 's very serious business to question the
integrity of a financial institution when you can't possibly pay all your
liabilities the next day or the next week .
And a rung -- or a question creates
its own dynamic and you can do a lot of harm to a financial institutions just
by spreading rumors .
So there ought to be penalties attached .
QUICK : I know it 's hard to prove , but would your gut tell you that that 's
partially what happened with Bear Stearns ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , it 's partially , but there -- it is n't the whole story , but
Bear Stearns , you know , they had problems and their balance sheet was too big
and the assets were too illiquid and -- but the rumors moved it along .
I mean ,
and it comes like that .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : You know , I ran Salomon in 1991 for a little while and we
could 've been put out of business .
As it was , our balance sheet was shrinking
every day .
There was a lot of pressure .
But one big story in the paper that
says , you know , Salomon did go out of business tomorrow or something of the
sort would have meant we would have gone out of business .
I mean , everybody
would have pulled their lines from us .
QUICK : OK .
OK .
Warren , we 're going to have a lot more coming up .
We 've got
more questions from people back home and we 've got more questions from right
here as well .
Again , folks , if you are just joining us we , are live with
Warren Buffett from Omaha , Nebraska .
We 'll have more SQUAWK right after this .
***
QUICK : Welcome back , everybody .
We are in Omaha , Nebraska .
Last night it
was the premiere of the " I.O.U.S.A. " movie and after that debut we got the
chance to moderate a town hall meeting right here with the men behind the
movie , Blackstone 's Pete Peterson and former US Comptroller General David
Walker .
Warren Buffett was also on that prestigious panel and in the movie
and we had a chance to send people out to go around the country to get
questions , Warren , from people around the country that they 'd like to have
come back to you .
These are people who were at the " I.O.U.S.A. " premiere , but
right now we do have a question from Chicago .
So why do n't we listen to this .
Unidentified Man # 2 : Hi , Warren .
Given the state of the US credit markets
and the way that banks are withholding lending from retail customers
essentially , how do you see the housing market playing out over the next 18 to
24 months ?
QUICK : Hm .
That 's a great question .
How do you see the housing market
playing out , given how banks are lending right now ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Hm .
It will be pretty tough .
The , you know , we had a very ,
very big bubble and we had a lot of people do things they should n't have done
as borrowers in terms of either counting on making payments they could n't make
or lying about their financial circumstances .
We had a lot of mortgage
lenders that were doing bad things and we had a lot of investors that were
doing stupid things .
So you put all that together and you put it into an $ 11
trillion mortgage market and you 've got lots of pain for the investors and
you 've got pain for the people that can't make their payments .
Now the nice thing about borrowing on a house is if you make your payments ,
you keep it .
And so if you signed up for payments you could handle , you 're
fine unless you lose your job or there 's a divorce or death or something of
that sort .
But a lot of people speculated on houses and bought them with no
down payments .
And the consequences of that wo n't get washed out in the next
month or two .
They will last , in my view , a considerable period of time .
But
the good thing about it is we have -- we have household formation growth in this
country .
We 're not a stagnant economy and we will work our way out of it , but
it took -- with the farm crisis here in the early ' 80s , it took years to work
our way out of it .
QUICK : There are people who will point to statistics like with housing starts
that we saw earlier this week .
People said , hey , it 's still down , but the
rate of decline is decreasing .
Is that about the best thing people can find
to say about this ?
Or is the best ...
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , the best thing they could find is if there were n't any
housing starts , then we would clear up the inventory much quicker .
QUICK : Right .
Mr. BUFFETT : I mean , in the end , housing starts work against the housing
recovery .
So it 's going to -- it will take time .
I mean , there -- the losses are
huge with the home builders and then the losses of people losing homes but ,
again , only if they do n't make the payments .
And lenders are losing a lot of
money .
People are finding out they did n't have any idea what they were doing
when they bought the CDOs and that sort of thing .
And the rating agencies did
not cover themselves with glory and frankly Wall Street did n't either .
So
it 's -- there 's a lot of blame to go around and we probably should n't worry too
much about that .
We should -- we should worry about really creating enough
households so that the excess supply gets sopped up .
There 's a lot of vacant
homes now .
And the market wo n't really come back until you get a normal -- a
close to normal ratio of vacant homes , homes up for sale compared to current
sales , and that 's a ways off .
QUICK : We get anecdotal evidence all the time from people who say they are
having a really tough time even though they have great credit .
They ca n't get
a mortgage .
Other people saying I can't get a second mortgage , I can't find
something for a second home .
Is it your sense from what you know about
lending right now that lending has gotten that much tighter ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , I do n't know about every area in the country .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : But I think if you have a significant down payment and you have
a job and your income covers the payments by the old traditional yard sticks ,
I do n't think there 's a problem getting a loan .
I mean , Wells Fargo is
lending a lot of money .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : And they 're looking for more loans .
But they 're not going to
lend it to you for nothing down .
They 're not going to lend you so that you
have payments that are 50 percent of your income and that stuff -- you 've got to
get the bad practices out of the system and then we wo n't have these problems .
QUICK : Fair to say that since you think these problems could stick around for
a long period of time that maybe the home builders do n't look that cheap and
you have n't been looking there for bargains ?
Mr. BUFFETT : No .
The home builders still have plenty of problems and that
does n't mean -- you know , the time to buy the stocks is not necessarily when
they 've already -- their business has already turned up .
QUICK : Sure .
Mr. BUFFETT : I do n't look -- I do n't try to pick turns in any kind of an
industry in terms of buying stocks .
I just like to buy them when I think
they 're cheap relative to their long - term earning power and I do n't happen to
have that conviction about home builders now , but it very well may be the
case .
It 's just I do n't have the conviction .
QUICK : OK .
Warren , we have more to come .
It 's been a long morning already
but , hey , time is flying by .
Mr. BUFFETT : You 're paying me by the hour .
I mean , why should I complain ?
QUICK : OK .
We 'll have much more with Warren Buffett when we return and more
from Carl in Beijing .
Stick around folks , SQUAWK BOX is coming right back .
***
QUICK : No , it 's not in his ear , folks .
Welcome back , everybody .
Let 's get
back to our conversation with Warren Buffett .
Carl is also joining us right
now from Beijing , and Carl , we 've been chatting all through the morning
talking about a lot of different things .
CARL QUINTANILLA , co-anchor ( Beijing ) :
Yes .
QUICK : But actually , we 're going to have a conversation with Warren , too .
One of the things he'd been wondering .
Warren , do you want to toss out to
Carl , what you 've been thinking about ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , I wonder what he enjoys the most over there .
I mean , he
has seen these terrific athletes .
What one memory are you going to come back
with , Carl ?
QUINTANILLA :
That 's a good -- that 's a good question , Warren .
You know , I was
here last summer and we did a documentary about McDonald 's and the city at the
time was full of cranes , was very dirty , very polluted , and I still ca n't get
over even 20 days later how the Chinese marshaled whatever resources they had
to get the city to look like it does right now .
They figured out some way to
do big projects in a short amount of time and I think that 's going to be
interesting to see how they leverage that as they go west to all those big
cities that we really have no idea what they look like , what the
infrastructure 's like there .
Pictures that come in over the next year from
there , I think , are going to be fascinating .
My question to you is if you had to guess at this moment , how - - what is your
investment in China , if there is going to be one , going to look like ?
Is it
going to be individual companies ?
Is it going to be currency plays , debt ?
Have you -- have you sorted that out in your own mind ?
Mr. BUFFETT :
It will certainly be extensions of the businesses that we
already have .
We opened that plant in Dalian for Iscar almost a year ago .
I
was amazed when I saw what has been accomplished in Dalian at the time .
But
we will be there with our businesses .
But I like buying securities and I like
buying companies , and I 'm open to doing either one .
And I would be surprised
if we do n't do something in the next few years .
QUINTANILLA : Yeah .
QUICK : You would be surprised if you do n't do something and then ...
QUINTANILLA : I think it 's interesting , too ...
QUICK : Go ahead , Carl .
QUINTANILLA :
In fact , I think it 's interesting , Warren , you know , we walked
in here and everyone worries about China slowing down as the global economy
slows .
You know , will their exports be bought ?
You know , is their economy
dependent on exports ?
And the lesson we got from a lot of companies here was
there is a self - contained economy here .
There are Chinese businessmen doing
business with other Chinese , and I wonder if you think that decoupling is
significant or not ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , I think their economy is going to do fine .
Who knows
whether it gets overheated or the inflation picks up or something , but it 's
like the United States .
It really is n't important what happens in the next
six months or a year .
It 's what 's going to happen over the next 10 years .
We 're going to do well .
The truth is , the Chinese will do better , because
they 're starting from a lower base , but they have learned a tremendous amount
about business in the last 20 years , and about how to unleash the human
potential , and that 's something that our country learned earlier .
And -- but
they 're picking it up very , very , very fast .
QUICK : You know , Warren , we had Jim Chanos on the program several months ago ,
and he had said when we asked him , what 's the one thing you worry about that
you think could be the next big drop ?
He had pointed out , well , maybe you
look at this endless infrastructure play when it comes to the Indias , the
Chinas of the world .
Maybe that is not going to be as strong as some people
think .
What do you think about that idea ?
Mr. BUFFETT : I do n't know whether it will be or not , but I know that 10
years from now , 20 years from now , China and India are going to be a long way
ahead of where they are now .
So I do n't really - - I do n't worry too much about
whether there 's going to be a sudden interruption or something .
I would n't be
able to predict it anyway , and if I did , I still want to be in wonderful
businesses bought at the right price and have them in the right place .
So I
do n't -- I do n't worry about the things that I really am not going to understand
anyway .
I worry about what 's important and knowable .
And if I can find a few
things that are important and knowable , I play in that box and I do n't worry
about what 's unimportant and I do n't worry about what 's unknowable .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
QUINTANILLA : Warren , are you -- are you going to try to learn Mandarin at this
stage of the game ?
Mr. BUFFETT : No , no , I 'm not even going to try to learn how to eat the food .
I am -- if I can't make a deal while eating at McDonald 's , I 'm in trouble .
QUICK : Hey , Warren , you have a little bit of insight into the Olympics , too ,
right ?
You were in Las Vegas just before the United States basketball team
left to go over .
Mr
DNA – the long , thin molecule that carries our hereditary material – is compressed around protein scaffolding in the cell nucleus into tiny spheres called nucleosomes .
The bead - like nucleosomes are strung along the entire chromosome , which is itself folded and packaged to fit into the nucleus .
What determines how , when and where a nucleosome will be positioned along the DNA sequence ?
Dr. Eran Segal and research student Yair Field of the Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Department at the Weizmann Institute of Science have succeeded , together with colleagues from Northwestern University in Chicago , in cracking the genetic code that sets the rules for where on the DNA strand the nucleosomes will be situated .
Their findings appeared today in Nature .
The precise location of the nucleosomes along the DNA is known to play an important role in the cell ’s day to day function , since access to DNA wrapped in a nucleosome is blocked for many proteins , including those responsible for some of life ’s most basic processes .
Among these barred proteins are factors that initiate DNA replication , transcription ( the transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA ) and DNA repair .
Thus , the positioning of nucleosomes defines the segments in which these processes can and ca n’t take place .
These limitations are considerable : Most of the DNA is packaged into nucleosomes .
A single nucleosome contains about 150 genetic bases ( the “ letters ” that make up a genetic sequence ) , while the free area between neighboring nucleosomes is only about 20 bases long .
It is in these nucleosome - free regions that processes such as transcription can be initiated .
For many years , scientists have been unable to agree whether the placement of nucleosomes in live cells is controlled by the genetic sequence itself .
Segal and his colleagues managed to prove that the DNA sequence indeed encodes “ zoning ” information on where to place nucleosomes .
They also characterized this code and then , using the DNA sequence alone , were able to accurately predict a large number of nucleosome positions in yeast cells .
Segal and his colleagues accomplished this by examining around 200 different nucleosome sites on the DNA and asking whether their sequences have something in common .
Mathematical analysis revealed similarities between the nucleosome - bound sequences and eventually uncovered a specific “ code word . ”
This “ code word ” consists of a periodic signal that appears every 10 bases on the sequence .
The regular repetition of this signal helps the DNA segment to bend sharply into the spherical shape required to form a nucleosome .
To identify this nucleosome positioning code , the research team used probabilistic models to characterize the sequences bound by nucleosomes , and they then developed a computer algorithm to predict the encoded organization of nucleosomes along an entire chromosome .
The team ’s findings provided insight into another mystery that has long been puzzling molecular biologists :
How do cells direct transcription factors to their intended sites on the DNA , as opposed to the many similar but functionally irrelevant sites along the genomic sequence ?
The short binding sites themselves do not contain enough information for the transcription factors to discern between them .
The scientists showed that basic information on the functional relevance of a binding site is at least partially encoded in the nucleosome positioning code :
The intended sites are found in nucleosome - free segments , thereby allowing them to be accessed by the various transcription factors .
In contrast , spurious binding sites with identical structures that could potentially sidetrack transcription factors are conveniently situated in segments that form nucleosomes , and are thus mostly inaccessible .
Since the proteins that form the core of the nucleosome are among the most evolutionarily conserved in nature , the scientists believe the genetic code they identified should also be conserved in many organisms , including humans .
Several diseases , such as cancer , are typically accompanied or caused by mutations in the DNA and the way it organizes into chromosomes .
Such mutational processes may be influenced by the relative accessibility of the DNA to various proteins and by the organization of the DNA in the cell nucleus .
Therefore , the scientists believe that the nucleosome positioning code they discovered may aid scientists in the future in understanding the mechanisms underlying many diseases .
