On a good Sunday , Jay Bakker ’s storefront church in Brooklyn may attract as many as 30 worshippers .
That ’s alright with Bakker , the founder and pastor of Revolution , a nondenominational congregation that might be described as an anti-megachurch .
Intimacy trumps grandeur in this “ church for people who have given up on church . ”
It got its start in an Atlanta bar , luring wayward skaters and punks with a gospel of “ ultimate grace , ” a come - as - you - are theology that holds that God loves you , combat boots , body art , and all .
Bakker , a pierced and heavily tatted 31 - year - old , takes a casual yet passionate approach to his role , delivering sermons with titles such as “ Nobody Likes a Selfish Bastard , ” “ Jesus : A Friend to Porn Stars , ” and “ Galatians Baby ! ”
Revolution ’s modest message and alternative aesthetic are a far cry from the glitzy religious empire built by Bakker ’s parents , televangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker .
At its height in the early 1980s , their Praise the Lord ministry boasted 13 million viewers , raked in millions in donations , and ran the world ’s largest Christian - themed resort .
It all came crashing down in 1987 , amid a sex scandal and accusations of greed and embezzlement .
The Bakkers divorced , Jim went to prison for fraud , and Tammy ’s tear - streaked mascara and fake eyelashes became a punch line .
Jay Bakker , who was 11 at the time , hit the bottle , dropped out of high school , and felt that God had forsaken him .
Twenty years later , Bakker is a sober , self - taught preacher with a epiphany .
“ Whenever I went deeper into the Bible and went into the Greek or the Hebrew or the historical background , ” he explains , “ I was always afraid like , ‘ OK , I ’m gonna prove that God does n’t love me . ’
But it seemed that every time I studied deeper , it was actually good news .
Sometimes it seems too good to be true . ”
For many mainstream Christians , Bakker ’s beliefs are too good to be true .
Just ask Ted Haggard .
Bakker ’s quiet revolution is the subject of “ One Punk Under God , ” a six - part documentary series that debuts on the Sundance Channel tonight .
The series catches Bakker at a crossroads .
As the first episode opens , his Atlanta church is humming along nicely , but he wants to officially accept gays and lesbians — a move that threatens his relationship with his financial backers and his co-founder , a conservative Boomer who ’s been a father figure .
Meanwhile , he ’s trying to close the emotional distance between himself and his real dad , who ’s remarried and launched “ The New Jim Bakker Show . ”
He ’s also tending to his mom , who ’s battling colon cancer .
And to complicate things , his wife is n’t so hot about his decision to be a preacher , and wants him to move to New York City , where she ’s starting grad school .
“ One Punk Under God ” reveals the human side of a godly man without superhuman aspirations .
Bakker has none of the punk - rock bravado suggested by his appearance nor his parents ’ showbiz chops .
Instead , he comes off as unpolished , humble , and painfully honest about his family and his faults .
“ I do n’t have a phone line to God anywhere in my house , ” he says .
Yet Bakker ’s unassuming style is forceful in its own way .
In one of “ One Punk ” ’s most touching moments , Bakker reconnects with his father after two years , appearing on his dad ’s show to talk about his philosophy ( and show off his PTL tattoo ) .
The elder Bakker tearfully declares that his once - estranged son “ is what I should be but can not be . ”
Jay Bakker spoke with MotherJones.com by phone from Brooklyn .
MotherJones.com :
What lessons did you learn from your parents about what to do and what not to do as a preacher ?
Jay Bakker :
My parents always taught me to love people no matter what .
My mom was reaching out to people with AIDS in the early ’ 80s .
My parents always taught me to put other people first .
But I saw my parents get in this trap where they created this huge ministry .
They created a monster and they had to feed it .
They had all these employees and facilities and bills , and all of a sudden they had to raise money all the time to keep all this stuff running .
They got themselves between a rock and a hard place and I think that ’s why , from a young age , I ’ve been taking stands that have n’t been that popular .
I did n’t want to have to compromise and I think there were times when my parents had to compromise some of their beliefs and ideas in order to keep their church going .
[ As a preacher ] I just feel like I have to be honest ; I could n’t live with myself if I was n’t .
I think that ’s why I ’ve been able to reach some people who do n’t feel comfortable in churches .
I do make mistakes and I can be goofy and quirky sometimes .
I ’m not the world ’s greatest speaker .
I do n’t try to hide that .
MJ.com :
One thing that struck me is how you ’ve put yourself in a leadership position where you freely admit you do n’t know all the answers .
And people literally embrace you for that .
JB : I do n’t have all the answers .
I grew up around people who told me they did , and then in the long run I found they did n’t .
So I figured I better start out honest with people and stay that way .
I think there ’s pressure when you ’re a pastor that you have to have all the answers , and if you do n’t , your faith is built on sand .
For me , faith is about believing in those things you ca n’t see and at times ca n’t understand .
I ’ve been really blessed to have people who are open to that and stick around .
Not everyone does stick around , though .
MJ.com :
So people have left Revolution because they realized you did n’t have all the answers ?
JB : Well maybe not exactly that , but maybe not the answers they were looking for .
MJ.com : How do you describe Revolution in a nutshell ?
JB : We ’re really just a small church .
We meet in bars .
We ’re a come - as - you - are - whoever - you - are kind of church .
We ’re a church about love and grace and acceptance and caring about people and at times agreeing to disagree .
MJ.com : You and [ Revolution Atlanta pastor ]
Stu Damron have a fundamental disagreement on homosexuality but there ’s been no split .
JB : I ’ve seen churches split on the color of the paint on the walls .
With me and Stu , we have a great love for each other and our love is bigger than one particular misunderstanding .
I do n’t think we can write someone off because they do n’t see what I see or we have n’t gotten to the same place yet .
Church splitting is ridiculous most of the time .
MJ.com : Have Stu ’s views about being a gay - affirming church changed at all ?
JB : I definitely think they ’ve changed some .
I think he ’s become more open and sensitive to the issue .
I do n’t know exactly where he stands at this point .
I do know he ’s become more open , and that ’s pretty cool .
MJ.com : “ One Punk Under God ” catches you right as you make the decision to make Revolution a gay - affirming church .
How did you get to that point ?
JB : It took me a long time to get there .
I had a lot of gay friends and even had some congregation members who were gay , and I just was n’t sure where I stood .
In my heart , I was like , “ How can I condemn these people for their love of one another ? ” I started looking deeper into the Bible and studying and then I went to a [ gay - affirming ] church .
It all came together at one point .
One of my friends came out , and I ran into one of my old camp counselors who had come out .
I was like , “ This is so strange — all these people who have been important parts of my life are all coming out and are being asked to leave their church or not having anything to do with their church anymore . ”
It kind of took a while because I knew I ’d be risking everything .
I knew this particular decision would cause me to lose a lot and would cause the church to hurt .
MJ.com :
Has the church been just as strong since that decision ?
JB : The church is going well , but we have n’t been supported .
We lost a lot of financial support and I ’ve lost most of my speaking engagements .
News traveled fast .
MJ.com : Can you talk more about the founding principle of your church , the idea of grace , and what that means ?
JB : I always thought I had to earn God ’s love and approval ; I always thought I had to please God .
I kept trying , but it never seemed like I could do it , and I thought , “ Man , what ’s wrong with me ? ” A friend of mine was like , “ Man , you ’re full of it .
You ’re trying to do what Christ has already done :
You ’re trying to earn your salvation and you can ’t — it ’s a free gift . ”
It sounded too good to be true .
He said , “ You need to start reading the Bible for yourself and stop taking everyone else ’s word for it . ”
When I really started to do this , I realized God loved me no matter what .
His love for me was n’t going to change no matter how good I was or how bad I was .
There was something very liberating about that .
It actually changed my heart and made me want to follow God more .
I got into a 12 - step program and have been sober for about 10 and a half years now .
MJ.com :
So even though there ’s this come - as - you - are philosophy , you ’re trying to become a better person , just not in the way mainstream churches advocate .
JB : It ’s like not having expectations on other peoples lives .
It ’s like trusting God in other people ’s lives , which I think is a very scary thing for people .
When it ’s grace , it ’s all about God .
When it ’s legalism or man ’s religion , it ’s more about what we can do to please God or what we can do to perform .
It seems to be more about control , because just trusting God is a little bit harder .
I try to love my neighbor as myself but I ’m not trying to be a people pleaser .
Sometimes that ’s hard , because my human nature is to want people to be happy with me .
But sometimes I feel my convictions are so great that it would be compromising the truth if I did n’t do that .
So sometimes it ’s a struggle to say , “ This is what I think ; this is what I believe , and if you do n’t agree with me , oh well . ”
The hardest thing for people to accept is the gay - affirming issue .
It ’s hard for people to agree to disagree on that one .
MJ.com : Your dad was recently in New York preaching at Revolution .
He seems to have adopted the idea of grace .
What are the similarities and differences between his and your beliefs ?
JB : We have a lot of differences .
[ Grace ] is something that ’s pretty new for him .
The difference is , I ’ve been talking about this for 10 years and he ’s been talking about it for not even six months .
He ’s sitting with me saying , “ Jay , God loves us , ” and it ’s funny , because those are things I was telling him years ago .
I usually do n’t get places before my dad does .
It ’s even helped our relationship ; we have some more common ground to talk about .
We ’ve had a lot of ups and downs .
MJ.com :
What appeals to you about punk culture and the punk aesthetic ?
How do you think they overlap with Christianity ?
JB : In high school I had a lot of punk friends and have always been attracted to punk rock music .
When we first started Revolution , I was a skater and we were reaching out to skateboarders and hippies .
I like the loyalty that ’s in the punk rock scene , but I do n’t really consider myself a punk rocker .
I ’ve sung in bands ; I ’ve hung out in tattoo parlors a lot , so I got a lot of tattoos .
A lot of my friends were tattoo artists .
It was just the culture that I was in and was involved in ; it was n’t a premeditated thing like , “ Oh , we ’re gonna be a punk - rock church . ”
If you came to our church you ’d realize there are only one or two people who consider themselves punk rock .
[ Punk ’s ] loyalty and not conforming to what everyone else is into — that ’s definitely something that we are .
That ’s who Jesus was .
He was crucified , in my opinion , because he did n’t conform ; he loved everybody .
He was inclusive rather than exclusive .
And that made a lot of people angry .
That ’s the way I try to live .
I do n’t probably live that way all the time , but I try to .
MJ.com :
In one episode , you say , “ I hate Christian politics . ”
Were you talking about internal church politics or the church getting into politics ?
JB : Probably the internal politics , but I ’m not a big fan of the church getting involved in politics , either .
I do n’t think you can say there is a Christian party .
MJ.com : You preached about Ted Haggard a few weeks ago .
What was your response to his scandal ?
JB : Well , my response was that we may not see eye - to - eye with this guy , but he deserves to be restored .
He deserves to be loved and helped .
To me , it was sad because I felt like he was automatically kicked out of the church .
Why do we keep doing this , when the church is about forgiveness ?
Jesus explains that the church is like a hospital .
But this hospital does n’t want to let any sick people in .
I feel like people like that have had to lead these secret lives because they ’re so afraid of how people will react .
I think we have to get to the point where we ’re restoring people and caring for them , and when they fall , we pick them up .
My thing is that we need to love this guy and pray for him and his family and open our homes to him if need be .
I do n’t know if he wants to come sleep on my futon here in Brooklyn , but he ’s welcome to if he ’d like .
MJ.com : How is New York treating Revolution ?
JB : It ’s the best it ’s ever been .
I ’m really happy here .
I love New York .
It ’s made me realize that God ’s a lot bigger than I thought he was .
It ’s a really interesting crowd .
We have an agnostic person who comes on a regular basis , a transgender person who said that they found our church because they we ’re looking for a church that would n’t hate them .
The congregation is really great .
My mom is really sick with cancer , so I ’ve been gone a lot and members of the congregation have been getting up and speaking .
I ’m starting to realize that we ’ve become a church of people instead of a church with this head guy .
There ’s something really neat about that because I do n’t think it ’s fair for them to think that I have this hotline to God .
Too often we put these pastors up on pedestals and make it all about the man of God .
That ’s something I ’m really excited to be getting away from .
I want to thank everyone who emailed me , and posted to the blog on this subject .
I have the benefit of hindsight , and the night I wrote that blog I was out - of - my - mind with worry .
I want to address some of the comments people made .
About 99 % of the emails I got were very supportive , asking how my son was doing … and asking me to send a link to the consumerist .
To those people , I say thank you and god bless .
Your emails reaffirm my belief that the majority of people are “ good people ” .
I did send it to the consumerist .
I ’ve not heard back .
I think some people believe this story is n’t real .
Not much I can do about that .
For those who sent in letters of support , I will write you back .
Each of you .
It ’s going to take time though . 🙂
My son was released from the hospital and is back in school doing well .
I am hesitant to discuss his medical issues online , but I will say that he has recovered .
I was scared as hell that night .
I have never been so scared .
It ’s even worse when you ’re pacing around waiting to hear what is going on .
This was the first time he had a seizure .
The night this happened , I called Comcast demanding to have someone woken up , but not because I wanted it fixed ( I did , but I knew at 2 AM they were n’t / could n’t do anything ) .
I called because I wanted someone ’s life to be interrupted as mine was .
I wanted them to know it ’s not acceptable to offer a service , such as 911 , and not have it be stable .
And yes , my worry got the best of my attitude .
It was n’t that the phone did not work ; it worked fine , until I called 911 .
Only dialing 911 failed .
I was able to call the customer service center at Comcast on the same phone line .
They indicated to me that nothing was wrong with the line in , what sounded like , the most condescending contemptuous way possible .
I work for a company like any other schlep , and in my severely diminished mental state , my thinking that night went something like this …
“ The squeaky wheel gets the oil .
They are probably recording the call .
I want this call to get to the top of the list for review the next time they review it for “ training purposes ” .
I want it to be the call that is sent to the CEO .
I want the policy changed about how these incidents are handled .
A short call would n’t cut it . “
In hindsight , I gave the folks that night at Comcast hell .
I know it ’s not their fault .
I know they ca n’t do anything to help .
If I regret anything about that call to comcast support , it was letting my emotions get the best of me .
Even though I felt like I was getting baited , I should have handled it way differently .
I wanted some VP who is snug in their bed to realize that , because the service they offer failed , it took time away from getting my son treatment .
In my mind , I was envisioning some mother or father that worked at Comcast as a SVP / EVP / VP , with two children of their own , getting a call at 4:00 about my call .
I saw him or her listening to a recording of the call , relating to it , and calling a meeting of their staff to get to the bottom of it .
I saw policies changing .
I saw a commitment being made , maybe not publicly , but inside Comcast to improve the service .
I wanted them to realize that they are n’t just providing internet service to just surf Amazon anymore , they were providing a vital link to emergency help and it , by far , is the most important service they provide .
I know , what was I thinking ?
All I know is that this logic made complete sense to me that night .
I feel I made my point with my post .
It was dugg on Digg over 5000 times and I received more email than one could possibly hope to get , many from people who had no idea that Comcast voice service could fail in this way .
Many people became aware , and if Comcast did n’t change , maybe a consumer ’s thinking did .
Some people told me that this was my fault .
That it was my fault for not understanding that e911 is not 911 .
That I had an unrealistic expectation of the service working .
To them , I say “ I agree ” .
I believe that I am accountable for the service I purchased .
I should have understood what I was buying before I did .
Lesson learned .
I also want to say that when I purchased the packed service ( voice , cable , internet ) , I had every expectation it would function as it was sold .
I was n’t looking for something cheap , I was just looking for one bill .
I also do not read the terms of service for everything I purchase .
No one does .
In this instance , I should have .
I do n’t believe the average person knows how fundamentally different 911 works over E911 .
I was not told , and looking through the documents that Comcast gave me that day , their is nothing said anywhere about the stability of e911 service ( although it is on the Comcast website )
I know now .
I found out the hard way .
Maybe a few others know now too and wo n’t have to .
PS . POTS line installed .
No lawsuit filed .
And yes , I know I spelled seizer wrong .
To be frank , I ’m surprised I did n’t spell it Sizzler that night .
But that flight this week was at the centre of a transatlantic row that saw the prime minister being put on the spot on the floor of the House of Commons and the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , forced on the defensive during a visit to Europe .
The Gulfstream V has been identified as having been used by the CIA for " extraordinary renditions " - abducting terror suspects and taking them to secret prisons around the world where they may be tortured .
The recording of flights by spotters like Paul from places as far afield as Bournemouth and Karachi has unintentionally played a significant role in helping journalists and human rights groups expose the scale of the CIA 's renditions system .
But his impact on such international intrigue largely passes Paul by .
" It 's not the CIA bit that interests us .
You do n't even know who owns the plane when you take down the serial number , " he said , already distracted as something comes in to land through the grey drizzle .
" You keep accurate logs , for your own records . "
At the door of the shabby end terrace which houses the Glasgow Airport Aviation Enthusiasts Club , Paul is considering how his hobby got him tangled in such a complex web .
" We know now that these planes are run by the CIA , but it 's not something we set out to know , " he said .
" I have seen the planes land in daytime and I 've seen them land at nighttime .
You never see anyone get off them .
Most of the time they are just coming in to refuel , but the ones coming in at night you would expect to see people getting off .
But you do n't - at least , I never have . "
Broadly , planespotters fall into three categories : those who like to take serial numbers , those who like to take photographs , and those who indulge in both .
About 40 miles away , on a mound exposed to wind and rain near the freight terminals of Prestwick airport , Stephen , lugging a lens more commonly used by paparazzi lurking in the undergrowth , is setting up a tripod waiting to see what will land today .
He knows it wo n't be as exciting as July , when the planes of G8 leaders and their secret service entourages landed at Prestwick , but he 's hoping for a good day .
" It 's my day off , so I 've come over to Prestwick , but I 'll go to Glasgow and Edinburgh as well , " he said .
" I do it mostly for myself - it 's been a passion since I was child - but I 'll post good photographs on websites too . "
Stephen clicks the shutter .
He does n't think this one will make airliners.
net , his favourite planespotting website .
But he 'll add it to the collection of hundreds of other plane photographs .
Despite the particular eccentricity of planespotting - and the obvious capacity for fun-poking - it is not a pastime limited to Britain .
In Spain town planner Josep Manchado is part of a small group who gather with their long lenses and foil - wrapped sandwiches at Majorca 's Son Sant Joan airport .
In January last year Mr Manchado saw a Boeing 737 on the airport tarmac .
He pressed his camera shutter button while speculating idly that some US millionaire was in town .
Then he put the picture of the Boeing ( tail fin number N313P ) on airliners.net , and forgot about it .
Within a few days Mr Manchado starting getting strange calls and emails .
They came from the US and from Sweden .
" People were asking me questions about the plane .
They obviously were n't all planespotters because they were asking questions that people who know about planes do n't ask , " he said .
Activists and journalists had become interested in the rendition flights .
There were also , however , strange calls .
" One man wanted to buy up all the photos .
He eventually sent me a form in which he asked for everything , including my home address .
I did n't give it to him and I never heard from him again , " he said .
Months later , he got a call from Germany 's ZDF television .
A man called Khalid El - Masri had come to them claiming he had been kidnapped by the CIA from Macedonia , bundled onto a plane and taken off to a prison many hours away .
Several months later , after allegedly being tortured , he was flown back and dropped in Albania .
One of the planes thought to be involved was one Mr Manchado had photographed .
It was believed that it had flown on to Macedonia that very same day .
With the photo in their hand , ZDF reporters were able to persuade Skopje flight control to give them a printout of the flight plan .
The aircraft had gone from Palma to Skopje and from there to Baghdad and Kabul .
Mr El - Masri's story , convincingly told but difficult to believe , fitted .
For those prepared to sift through the endless information complied by planespotters and posted on websites , there are many more clues to the CIA 's activities to be found .
In Ireland peace campaigners have turned themselves into planespotters .
At Shannon airport Tim Hourigan uses a scanner that allows him to see what air traffic control sees , and he , and other activists , religiously note down the numbers of landing planes .
Then , using a combination of Federal Airport Authority Records and planespotting websites , they can track the movements of intelligence planes across the world .
" It is a tedious job looking through hundreds of pictures of planes , " says Mr Hourigan , who is not a planespotting enthusiast .
" But it allows you to confirm and expose the activities of the CIA and our own government . "
· The planespotters have been given first names only , as they asked not to be identified .
Scientists have constructed a custom enzyme that reverses the process by which the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) inserts its genetic material into host DNA , suggesting that treatment with similar enzymes could potentially rid infected cells of the virus .
In tests on cultured human tissue , the mutated enzyme , Tre recombinase , snipped HIV DNA out of chromosomes .
Curing real infections by this or any other technique , however , would require mastering one of HIV 's sneakiest tricks — its ability to hide from the immune system by laying dormant for months or years in host cells .
HIV infects the immune system 's disease - killing T cells by converting its genome into double stranded DNA and using the enzyme integrase to insert that DNA into a T cell 's genome .
Researchers have speculated that they could reverse this process with bacterial DNA - cutting enzymes they have adapted for adding and subtracting genes from mice and other multicelled organisms .
To take that step , researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics and the University of Hamburg 's Heinrich Pette Institute for Experimental Virology and Immunology began with the bacterial enzyme
Cre recombinase , which exchanges any two pieces of DNA flanked on either end by a certain pattern of nucleotides ( DNA subunits ) known as loxP .
HIV does not naturally contain loxP sites , so the team created a hybrid of the two DNA molecules , which they used to select a series of mutated Cre enzymes that were increasingly able to recognize the combined DNA .
The final enzyme , Tre , removed all traces of HIV from cultured human cervical cells after about three months , the researchers report online today in Science .
" This is the first demonstration of actual removal of the integrated virus from cells , " says Alan Engelman , a molecular virologist at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston .
The results are promising , he says , but researchers have to make sure the slow - acting
Tre enzyme works on real - world strains of HIV and figure out how to safely and precisely administer it in gene form to give it time to snip .
Ideally , Engelman wrote in an editorial accompanying the new report , researchers would like to find a way to send
Tre enzymes into the small number of T cells that carry the virus without producing new viral particles , which allows HIV to hide from both antiviral drugs and the immune system .
No more excuses .
No more waiting .
No more waste .
For the longest time , coffee shops across America have sidestepped the “ recycle your cup ” issue because there have been no eco-friendly alternatives .
In conventional hot water cups , the inner surface is lined with a petroleum - based plastic ( polyethylene ) to prevent leaking .
This process alone prevents the cups from being recycled or composted .
Here ’s an interesting little fact ,
“ In 2005 , Americans used and discarded 14.4 billion disposable paper cups for hot beverages .
If put end - to - end , those cups would circle the earth 55 times .
Based on anticipated growth of specialty coffees , that number will grow to 23 billion by 2010 — enough to circle the globe 88 times .
Based on hot cup usage in 2005 , the petrochemicals used in the manufacture of those cups could have heated 8,300 homes for one year . ”
Damn .
So , for the longest time , we ’ve been waiting for someone to solve this egregious situation .
Thankfully , the answer has come from International Paper and Green Mountain Coffee .
Their 100 % biodegradable hot beverage cup has just won the Specialty Coffee Association of America ’s 2007 Sustainability Award .
The “ Ecotainer™ cup ” has a liner made from corn instead of petrochemicals .
In a blind trial test of more than 5 million cups , not one customer noticed anything “ different ” about the corn - based cups from the regular variety .
Sadly , while we ’re one step ahead on the cup , the lid that completes the package is still an environmental enigma .
There is n’t yet a bio-plastic that can take the form and function of a disposable hot cup lid .
However , International Paper and Green Mountain are working with companies that have had breakthroughs with using soy for such a purpose .
According to their site , this is the next advancement they are working to push to market .
In the meantime , I would encourage any coffee companies out there with green ambitions ( ahem , Starbucks ) to consider replacing their non-recyclable , non-compostable cups with this eco-friendly alternative .
It kills me not to be able to recycle a hot paper cup because of the inner-plastic liner .
For those moments I ’m without a reusable mug , a little less guilt when I ’m done getting my caffeine fix will be a rush .

Of course , there 's another thing that George Bush could have done with the money : he could have given every Iraqi $ 18,700 .
I imagine that would have reduced the threat of international terrorism somewhat .
Call me old - fashioned , but I can't help thinking that giving someone $ 18,700 brings them round to your side more quickly than bombing the hell out of them .
They could certainly buy a lot of lavatory paper with it .
In 2002 the house budget committee and the congressional budget office both guesstimated the cost of invading Iraq at approximately $ 50bn ; $ 500 bn seems a bit wide of the mark .
What 's more , with over half a million dead , it means that the world 's greatest military superpower has spent a million dollars for every Iraqi killed .
That can't be value for money !
So how on earth could such a vast overspend occur ?
After all , the US is the flagship of monetary common sense .
Well , for starters , in 2003 the White House refused to allow competitive bidding for contracts in Iraq , which is odd for the champions of free enterprise .
Then the White House ensured there would be no overseeing of what was spent .
In the original Iraq spending bill , which earmarked the first $ 87bn to go down the drain , there was a provision for the general accounting office to keep a check on things , but that provision was stripped from the bill - even though the Senate had originally voted for it 97 to 0 .
But what I want to know is : how do they actually spend all that money ?
Well the answer is : they do n't .
According to the website Halliburtonwatch , the Halliburton subsidiary KBR bills the US taxpayer for $ 50 - $ 80 per day for labourers working for it in Iraq , but pays them only $ 5 - $ 16 per day .
It 's the same with Halliburton .
In December 2003 the US army discovered that the company had overcharged by $ 61 m for fuel transportation and $ 67 m for food services in Iraq .
Then there is good old - fashioned incompetence .
Take the al - Fatah pipeline : KBR went through $ 75.7 m of taxpayers ' money , supposedly trying to replace a pipeline across the river Tigris that US forces had blown up .
They never finished the job , but still got paid .
With all this double - dealing and incompetence , you 'd expect that those responsible would have been penalised by now .
But that 's where the mystery deepens .
Companies such as Halliburton and its subsidiaries have never had it so good .
In January 2006 the Bush administration intervened in a dispute between the Pentagon and Halliburton , and agreed to pay the company $ 199 m in disputed charges .
On January 26 2006 Halliburton announced that its 2005 profits were the " best in our 86 - year history " .
And to date KBR has received around $ 16bn from its contracts in Iraq .
Vice - President Dick Cheney , formerly CEO of Halliburton , has not had a bad war either .
His tax returns for 2005 show that he earned $ 194,862 from his Halliburton stock options alone .
Mind you , it 's small change compared to his $ 36 m payoff when he left the firm .
Was that for his past role , or was Halliburton anticipating further services from the future vice - president of the US ?
Perhaps it 's just as well that in 2003 the White House removed from the Iraq spending bill any provision to penalise war profiteers who defrauded US taxpayers .

A study commissioned by a British architectural firm finds traditional buildings are more eco-friendly than modern ones with lots of glass .
Atelier 10 , an environmental engineering firm , compared two computer models , one of an old - style building with less than 40 percent of its exterior glass and the other with glass walls on south and north faces .
The researchers found the more traditional building would cost 15 to 20 percent less to heat in the winter and cool in the summer , The Telegraph reported .
" Actually the architectural establishment do know this but they do n't want it said -- that traditional buildings are more sustainable , " said Robert Adam , the architect who commissioned the study .
" Environmental engineers know this too but they tend to work for architects .
This is the great secret that no one wants to reveal . "
Robert Adam Architects , Adam 's firm , specializes in traditional buildings .

Easy PDF Photo - Calendars in Ruby
Looking at the sample calendars above you would think that humanity has failed - each day is represented by a lead image from the BBC News and seems to showcase nothing but suffering , destruction , and pain .
On a more positive note , generating these PDF calendars was nothing but joy thanks to the nifty PDF :: Writer library by Austin Zigler .
With a few extensions and some Ruby - foo magic , my final calendar featured news - clustering , multi- month views , and a number of other goodies .
Here , we ’ll cover the basics of generating the PDF calendar grid and populating it with photos .
Let ’s get to it !
Creating the PDF canvas
In my project , I had a number of different print - out styles ( Calendar , Treemap , etc. ) and output mediums ( PDF , SVG , etc. ) .
Hence , I created a Canvas class and abstracted the PDF code inside to decouple some of the functions :
require ' rubygems ' require ' pdf / writer ' require ' RMagick ' module Canvas class Canvas attr_accessor : name def initialize ( name ) @name , @doc = name , Pdf . new ( name ) @maxWidth , @maxHeight = @doc . pdf .
page_width , @doc . pdf .
page_height @x , @y = 0 , @doc .
pdf . y - 75 # offset the y - pointer end def save ( ) @doc .
save ; end end private class
Pdf attr_reader : name , : pdf def initialize ( name ) @name = name @pdf = PDF :: Writer . new ( :orientation => : landscape ) #
Set document meta - data @pdf .
info .
title = @name @pdf .
info .
author = " Ilya Grigorik " @pdf . info . subject = " Calendar " @pdf .
margins_pt ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) # top , left , bottom , right end def save ( ) @pdf .
save_as ( @name ) ; end def addImage ( * attrs ) @pdf . add_image_from_file ( * attrs ) ; end end end
As you can see , the Canvas object will encapsulate the PDF class in our example .
This is an unnecessary step if you ’re only working with PDF output , but we ’ll keep it as it is , it should n’t complicate our code too much .
Creating the calendar view
The CalendarView class will be responsible for creating the grid and handling the calendar logic .
First , the CalendarView constructor will initialize the pdf output file ( super ) .
Then , once the canvas is ready , it will go ahead and draw the calendar grid .
Now , depending on the year / month view of the calendar , the first of every month will fall on a different day of we week , and we need to figure out which !
Hence , we also provide a date object to the constructor ( first day of the month , ex : ‘ 2007-02-01 ’ ) :
module Canvas class CalendarView < Canvas def initialize ( name , date ) super ( name ) @topRow = 50 @rowH = ( @doc . pdf .
page_height .
to_i - @topRow ) / 6 @columnW = ( @doc . pdf . page_width . to_i ) / 7 @doc . pdf . stroke_color !
Color :: RGB . new ( 140 , 140 , 140 ) # Draw calendar grid 1 . upto ( 6 ) do | n | @doc .
pdf . line ( @doc . pdf . absolute_left_margin , n * @rowH , @doc . pdf . absolute_right_margin , n * @rowH ) .
stroke end 1 . upto ( 6 ) do | n | @doc .
pdf . line ( n * @columnW , @doc . pdf . absolute_bottom_margin + 6 * @rowH , n * @columnW , @doc . pdf . absolute_bottom_margin ) . stroke end #
Set first day of the week to Monday & figure out the start - position for current month @order = [ ' Monday ' , ' Tuesday ' , ' Wednesday ' , ' Thursday ' , ' Friday ' , ' Saturday ' , ' Sunday ' ] @startSquare = @order .
index ( date . strftime ( " % A " ) ) - 1 end def addImage ( file , date ) squareNum = @startSquare +
Time .
parse ( date ) . day .
to_i row = squareNum / 7 col = squareNum % 7 # Calculate the x , y offsets x = @doc . pdf . absolute_left_margin + col * @columnW y = ( @doc . pdf . absolute_top_margin . to_i - @topRow - @rowH * ( row + 1 ) ) - 3 # Read the source image file and it's corresponding dimensions imageMagick = Magick :: Image . read ( file ) . first imgWidth , imgHeight = imageMagick .
columns , imageMagick .
rows imgRatio = imgWidth .
to_f / imgHeight .
to_f # scale to fit in calendar , preserve aspect ratio imgWidth , imgHeight = @columnW , ( @columnW / imgRatio ) . to_i if ( ( imgWidth > imgHeight ) and ( imgWidth > @columnW ) ) imgHeight , imgWidth = @rowH , ( @rowH * imgRatio ) . to_i if ( ( imgHeight > imgWidth ) and ( imgHeight > @rowH ) ) imgHeight , imgWidth = @rowH , @columnW if ( imgHeight == imgWidth ) # center the photo in the calendar square x = x + ( @columnW - imgWidth ) / 2 if imgWidth < @columnW y = y + ( @rowH - imgHeight ) / 2 if imgHeight < @rowH @doc .
addImage ( file , x , y , imgWidth , imgHeight ) end end end
By this point , we already have the calendar layout , and now we just have to populate it with photos .
To do so , we simply call on the addImage method , and provide the filename and the date of the photo - this method will automatically figure out the correct square and resize , and center the image for us !
Spiffy , on - demand PDF calendars
We ’re almost there .
All we have to do now is define the list of photos and dates .
This could be a directory listing with ‘ created ’ timestamps , or it could also be your Flickr photostream , etc .
For the sake of brevity , we will simply hard - code a few photo filenames with dates :
require ' canvas.rb ' require ' calendar.rb ' #
First parameter : output filename , Second parameter : Date object for the month / year of the calendar view pdfDoc = Canvas :: CalendarView . new ( " my-calendar.pdf " , ' 2007-02-01 ' )
# Load an array of images , provide full path , and the date ( read exif from photo ? ) images = [ [ ' image1.jpg ' , ' 2007-02 -25 ' ] , [ ' image2.jpg ' , ' 2007-03 - 26 ' ] ]
#
Insert the images into our calendar !
images .
each { | image | pdfDoc .
add Image ( image [ 0 ] , image [ 1 ] ) } pdfDoc .
save
That ’s it , a dynamic PDF photo - calendar in ~ 100 lines of code !
If you ’re curious , you can view the full calendar for BBC news : download it first , it ’s rather large !
For more examples on using PDF :: Writer , I would also recommend a great guide by Austin Ziegler himself : Creating Printable Documents with Ruby .

Shuttle launch delayed until at least Saturday Faulty fuel sensor forces NASA to scrub Discovery 's liftoff By Thom Patterson
CNN
Mission specialist Soichi Noguchi leaves the orbiter after Wednesday 's launch was scrubbed .
RELATED SPECIAL REPORT YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) Space Exploration Kennedy Space Center or or Create Your Own KENNEDY SPACE CENTER , Florida ( CNN ) --
A faulty fuel sensor aboard the space shuttle Discovery on Wednesday forced NASA to delay its launch until at least Saturday .
Wednesday 's attempt to launch , on the first day of a launch window that closes July 31 , would have been the space shuttle program 's first mission since the Columbia disaster 2 1/2 years ago .
" We would not in any conceivable way be ready to launch before Saturday , " Wayne Hale , deputy shuttle manager , told reporters Wednesday afternoon .
Saturday 's launch would be at 2:40 p.m. ET .
" We 're going to go where the technical data leads us until we solve this problem . "
NASA said the sensor device was showing low fuel levels despite the exterior tank having been filled just hours before .
" It will take some time really to understand what to do to remedy the situation , " said NASA spokesman George Diller .
" There are long faces here in the control center and around the site .
Everybody was so looking forward to flying today , " Diller said .
Crew members were already aboard the orbiter when the launch was canceled .
A series of mishaps marked the last 24 hours before Discovery 's scheduled launch .
On Wednesday morning , it appeared foul weather might postpone the high - profile mission .
Repairing a ground heater earlier in the morning had delayed filling the massive external fuel tank .
On Tuesday , a cockpit window cover fell off and damaged two protective tiles near the orbiter 's tail section .
But it was the fuel sensor that stopped the launch , a little more than three hours before the scheduled 3:51 p.m. ET launch .
The sensor monitors the amount of super - cold hydrogen fuel in the tank and tells the orbiter 's engines to shut down if there 's not enough fuel .
A launch controller described it as " a low - level fuel sensor in the external fuel tank , one of a set of four -- two of which are needed to work . "
About 10 miles from the launch site along the Banana River , scores of shuttle watchers -- many wearing shorts and swim wear -- had gathered hoping for a liftoff when word reached them about the scrub .
" I 'm disappointed and I 'm leaving tomorrow , so I will miss it , " said Rick Nakazawa , 47 , of Santa Barbara , California .
" It was exciting , you know , I 'm glad I came out .
I sure do n't regret it , but it kind of sucks , pretty much . "
Many in the crowd sought shelter under umbrellas or had constructed makeshift tents from bed sheets .
Lacey Nielsen , of Alta , Iowa , expressed a bit of optimism about it all .
" I am really bummed , but at least for their safety they caught it before anything bad could happen , " Nielsen said .
" Hopefully it 's nothing big and they will be able to get done and put up into outer space . "
' Minor repair ' among mishaps
In Tuesday 's incident , a plastic and foam cover fell about 65 feet from a cockpit window and damaged two protective tiles near the orbiter 's tail section .
The tiles were replaced .
Discovery vehicle manager Stephanie Stilson described it as " a minor repair for us . "
The cover , which weighs less 2 pounds , is designed to protect the shuttle 's windows while it is on the launch pad and is removed before liftoff .
NASA did not know how the shield had come loose , she said .
The loss of the Columbia was blamed on damage to a heat - resistant panel .
The panels and insulating tiles make up the shuttle 's thermal protection system .
NASA concluded a piece of foam from Columbia 's external fuel tank hit the shuttle 's wing during liftoff , punching a hole in the reinforced carbon - carbon panel and allowing super - hot gas into the wing during re-entry .
NASA has committed to daytime launches for the next two missions to ensure ideal lighting conditions for cameras to scrutinize the shuttle 's ascent into orbit .
Shuttle program gets overhaul
In the 2 1/ 2 years since the Columbia accident , NASA has undergone a wrenching overhaul of the shuttle program .
The shuttle has a new fuel tank designed to prevent foam chunks of the size that downed Columbia from breaking off and hitting the spacecraft .
NASA engineers also have designed an orbital boom sensor system , which is a second robotic arm tipped with cameras and other instruments and mounted in the shuttle 's payload bay .
Once in orbit , astronauts will use the boom to inspect panels on the orbiter 's wings and nose cone for any damage that might occur during launch .
But repairing damage to the protection system -- should any be found -- could prove difficult .
Engineers have been testing plugs and crack - repair procedures for the reinforced panels as well as tile - repair techniques in the event of damage .
Two such methods will undergo limited testing in orbit by Discovery astronauts , but mission managers acknowledge that the techniques likely will need to be modified before they can be certified .
Most NASA engineers agree that astronauts would never be able to repair a hole the size of the one that doomed Columbia .
" The past 2 1 / 2 years have resulted in significant improvements that have greatly reduced the risk of flying the shuttle .
But we should never lose sight of the fact that space flight is risky , " said NASA Administrator Michael Griffin .
Discovery plans to deliver much - needed supplies to the international space station .
More than two years have passed since a shuttle , with its school bus - size payload bay , visited the station .
Discovery will deliver a replacement gyroscope , an external storage platform and an Italian cargo carrier called Raffaello .
The storage platform is needed for upcoming flights when it will be used to assemble the rest of the station .
For most of its scheduled mission , designated STS - 114 , the crew will devote time to inspecting and testing repairs .

Windows XP made its debut in 2001
The decision reverses a policy begun in January that meant Windows Vista was the only operating system available on almost all new home machines .
The change came after Dell 's feedback site was swamped with calls for the return of the venerable software .
Now customers can opt for the Home or Professional version of XP on six models of Dell machines .
Customer clamour
The four consumer versions of Windows Vista went on sale on 30 January and since then many PC makers have sold most of their machines with the software pre-loaded .
Since January
Dell has been gradually phasing out the XP option on new PCs .
By March Dell only sold two models in its extensive range with the XP operating system installed .
Dell is currently the second - largest PC seller in the world and has a 15.2 % share of the overall PC market .
Dell changed the policy in response to pleas posted on its Ideastorm website which invites customers to post suggestions about how the PC maker can meet their needs .
The suggestion saying " Do n't eliminate XP just yet " got almost 11,000 votes .
In response Dell said it would offer the operating system on four models of Inspiron notebooks and two Dimension desktop PCs .
" This is really odd , " said Michael Silver , research vice president at analysts Gartner .
" On new PCs , consumers usually do want the latest and greatest . "
Other analysts speculated that the reason consumers were keen on XP was because it was familiar and it worked well with many of the digital peripherals they owned .
In response Microsoft said that Dell was responding to a " small minority " of customers who had a very " specific " request .
It is not clear how long Dell will be able to keep its offer to install XP going .
From the end of January 2008 PC makers will no longer be able to buy new licences for the operating system .
WHEN is a bicycle not like other bicycles ?
To begin with , when it has no brakes , or at least no visible brakes , or possibly just a front brake .
That means you ca n’t ride this bike very well on your first try , and certainly not very gracefully , easily or safely .
The rear cog is bolted directly to the hub , so that whenever the vehicle is in motion , the pedals go around , making coasting impossible .
This bike does n’t have a shift lever or extra sprockets , and the chain is shorter and wider than on traditional bikes .
There are no fenders , and the rear wheels are probably bolted onto the frame to deter theft .
You slow down by reversing the pedals , or skidding , or doing a skip stop .
And that ’s just the beginning of the differences between your run -of - the - mill 10 - speed and a track bike , or fixed - gear bike — fixie for short — as it is also known .
Many fixed - gear adherents contend that their bikes are the ultimate and all others are pretenders .
And these fixed - gear zealots are a growing presence on the streets of New York .
Perceived by some as nuisances , or as troublesome , anarchist Dumpster - diving punks who happen to ride bikes , they are occasionally reviled , but they are also the subject of curiosity and interest .
Just as die - hard skateboarders 15 years ago stood on the cusp of providing a new lifestyle , so the fixed - gear bike culture could be the tip of something that nobody can accurately predict but something that is huge .
ROME ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Americans are less happy today than they were 30 years ago thanks to longer working hours and a deterioration in the quality of their relationships with friends and neighbors , according to an Italian study .

Americans are less happy today than they were 30 years ago thanks to longer working hours and a deterioration in the quality of their relationships with friends and neighbors , according to an Italian study .
REUTERS / Sergei Karpukhin
Researchers presenting their work at a conference on “ policies for happiness ” at Italy ’s Siena University honed in on two major forces that boost happiness -- higher income and better social relationships -- and put a dollar value on them .
Based on that , they concluded a person with no friends or social relations with neighbors would have to earn $ 320,000 more each year than someone who did to enjoy the same level of happiness .
And while the average American paycheck had risen over the past 30 years , its happiness - boosting benefits were more than offset by a drop in the quality of relationships over the period .
“ The main cause is a decline in the so - called social capital -- increased loneliness , increased perception of others as untrustworthy and unfair , ” said Stefano Bartolini , one of the authors of the study .
“ Social contacts have worsened , people have less and less relationships among neighbors , relatives and friends . ”
He and two other Italian researchers looked at data from 1975 to 2004 collected by the annual General Social Surveys that monitors change in U.S. society through interviews with thousands of Americans .
By contrast , it appeared that based on the limited data available the happiness trend had remained largely stable in Europe , which had apparently avoided some of the changes in the American workplace like longer hours and more pressure .
“ The increase in hours worked by Americans over the last 30 years has heavily affected their happiness because people who are more absorbed by work have less time and energy for relationships , ” said Bartolini .
“ Another important cause is that American society in the last 30 years has experienced a huge increase in competitive pressure compared to Europe .
It ’s easier in the United States , if you belong to the middle class , to become poor than you would in Europe .
This creates a state of insecurity . ”

Dark Web Myths and Misconceptions
The dark web is shrouded in mystery with many enduring misconceptions about what it is , how it works , and what are the threats and the trends that we should be worrying about .
Every individual having a natural right to life , liberty , and property , in turn , has a natural right to defend them .
Every individual having a natural right to life , liberty , and property , in turn , has a natural right to defend them .
Any law meant to deprive an individual from obtaining the means necessary to defend these rights is an infringement on his liberty and is unjust .
If I wish to own a hand gun , I have that right .
If I wish to own a hunting rifle , I have that right .
If I wish to own an assault rifle — as outrageous as that may sound to you — I have that right and it can not legitimately be taken from me .
Those who wish to deny individuals their natural rights , even when done for apparent humanitarian reasons , are acting as tyrants .
The gun control advocates ' goal of disarming every individual destroys his / her right to self - defense and , in turn , puts every other one of his / her natural rights in greater danger .
Gun control laws are morally wrong , constitutionally illegal , and detrimental to the safety of many peaceful citizens .
As Thomas Paine once asked , — ¦If a thief breaks into my house , burns and destroys my property , and kills or threatens to kill me , or those that are in it , and to ' bind me in all cases whatsoever ' to his absolute will , am I to suffer it ? "
To say one must allow such destruction of one 's life , liberty and property , and to not allow for the means to protect such rights , is to say that the individual does not hold these natural rights , and that whoever holds the power shall decide what " rights " will be granted .
Such an idea is preposterous .
The Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights does not grant but acknowledges the individual 's natural right to defend him or herself with whatever means he deems necessary .
Our founders understood that this right must be protected in order to allow the protection of their other natural rights .
But protection from whom ?
As Thomas Jefferson explained , it was n't just from other individuals , but in fact " the strongest reason for the people to retain their right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government . "
Our founders understood that government is and always has been the greatest enemy of the people and that any government which disarms their citizenry should never be trusted since it makes it only that much easier to take the rest of their rights .
As George Washington once said , " A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined , but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them , which would include their own government . "
Gun control advocates often argue that we would be safer with more gun laws .
The truth is the exact opposite .
As Thomas Jefferson explains , " laws that forbid the carrying of arms disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes .
Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants ; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides , for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man . "
Gun control advocates always point out how many gun-related deaths there are per year ( 11,628 in 2004 , says the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control ) , but what should also be looked at is how much good firearms do .
As Dr. Jeremy D. Blanks writes ,
" The numbers have varied from a low of around 100,000 crimes prevented every year by armed citizens to a high of over six million crimes per year . "
The accurate number probably falls somewhere in between , but even if it were just the low of 100,000 crimes prevented does that not show that more good comes from gun ownership than bad ?
And what if it is 6 million crimes prevented ?
Knowing this , how can you honestly argue for the disarming of peaceful American citizens ?
The truth is that you cannot disarm the people without becoming a tyrant .
And you can't disarm the people without making the criminals and the government even more powerful and more of a threat to our individual liberties than they already are .
The gun control advocates ' intentions matter little if the means is immoral and the end undesirable .
If you care about your natural rights as a human being , if you wish not to be controlled as if a slave to the government , than there is only one candidate to vote for : Congressman Ron Paul .
Dr. Paul is the last man in Washington that understands the principles of liberty that this country was founded upon and the only politician left who is fighting for your rights as an individual .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- China stocks swooned overnight - the response on Wall Street : Yawn .
A 6.5 percent decline in the Shanghai stock market sent U.S. equities lower at the open Wednesday , but no global wave of selling ensued - a sign of how accustomed investors are growing to sharp swings overseas .
Around midday , the Dow industrials were modestly higher - compare that to the 416 point loss the blue - chip barometer chalked up the last time Chinese stocks tanked .
And European shares only fell slightly .
Global markets may be more linked than ever before , but investors are growing accustomed to wild swings in China , according to Paul Nolte , director of investments at Hinsdale Associates , a money management firm .
" Financial markets have at least learned to deal with China on a short - term basis .
They 're figuring what 's going on there is not going to have a major impact on the U.S. - at least not immediately , " he said .
In another sign of how investors are taking the China storm in stride , the yen has remained fairly stable .
In the past , sharp declines in Chinese equities have led to a rise in the Japanese currency as yen - funded carry trades came unwound .
The yen carry trade refers to when investors borrow yen at ultra- low interest rates and use the funds to buy higher - yielding investments based in other currencies .
The unwinding of yen carry trades that occurred in late February occurred when global equities came under pressure and investors - caught off guard - began curbing their risky positions , says Ronald Simpson , global currency analyst at Action Economics .
But investors have been bracing for some weakness in Chinese stocks - which have risen at a blistering pace in recent months .
" It 's a bubble situation that everyone is looking forward to having some air let out of to a degree , " Simpson said .
Furthermore , the 6.5 percent decline is n't much of a correction for a market that has gained more than 50 percent for the year , says Emily Sanders , CEO of Sanders Financial Management .
" There should n't be a direct correlation between profit taking in the Chinese stock market and what goes on in the U.S. market , " she said .
And when it comes to the U.S. , the economy still looks to be in fairly shape , says Edward Keon , chief investment strategist at Prudential Equity Group .
Growth may be slowing , but inflation numbers still appear to be fairly tame , he says .
" The backdrop we have now is slowing growth but the possibility of improvement over the next several quarters combined with less inflation pressure .
Historically , this has led to strong stock returns , " he said .
In addition , equity valuations have been remarkably stable over the last five years , says Keon .
He thinks U.S. stocks are undervalued and still have some room to run this year and into next .

Samsung Electronics announced that it has begun mass producing 1.8 - inch solid state drives ( SSD ) at 64GB - the highest density SSD available today for mobile computing applications .
" We see sharply increasing interest in SSDs among OEMs worldwide amid a growing push to launch premium SSD - based notebooks , particularly in the ultra- mobile category , " said Jim Elliott , director , flash marketing , Samsung Semiconductor , Inc .
SSDs feature far greater reliability , faster boot times and faster application start - up times than hard disk drives .
SSD can also improve battery life by up to 20 percent in notebooks .
The 64GB SSD consists of 64 eight Gigabit ( Gb ) single - level cell flash memory chips .
Use of 51nm process technology permits fabrication of much smaller components , with each chip having circuitry 1/2500th the width of a human hair .
Samsung is aggressively expanding market development efforts for its SSDs .
Industry wide attention on ultra- light , ultra - slim notebook PCs with flash memory based SSDs reflects early market support for this new storage medium .
In addition , Samsung has already introduced 32 GB SSDs into ultra-mobile personal computers ( UMPCs ) .
SSDs also are being considered for server applications such as in advertising and for Web search engines .
Other digital consumer products such as camcorders , PDAs and printers can now be equipped with SSDs ranging from 4GB to 64GB .
Samsung 's mass production of 64GB SSDs makes it the largest producer of high - capacity SSDs in the world .
Rapid expansion of the 1.8 - inch SSD market will spark demand for even smaller SSD formats to be used in mobile consumer electronics .
The miniaturization of SSDs will give rise to new types of digital products .
Over the next three years , 2.5 - inch and 3.5 - inch SSDs will also gain a great deal of momentum for widespread use in standard notebooks and desktop PCs , respectively .
Samsung expects that sales of SSD units will increase at a rapid 270 percent pace industry - wide between now and 2010 to become the largest growth segment in the NAND flash industry .

Day 1 : Monday 14 May 2007 : 6:00 am
Some last minute preparations meant that I got to sleep around 1.30 am Monday morning , awake again at around 4.30 am to meet a news reporter so not exactly the kind of long lie in I had imagined .
After a rushed breakfast and a couple of interviews for the local media I presumed it would be a fairly uneventful day .
However both the Studio Bar phone and my mobile number started ringing almost continuously and at times simultaneously from mid morning onwards .
Journalists , reporters , press agencies , TV and radio , at least a thousand and one questions in quick succession .
I had presumed and hoped to generate some media interest by the time the event was two or three days old , I did not expect such an immediate rush .
Suddenly staying awake seemed the least of my concerns , trying to remember who I was talking to , who was next and if it was live or recorded left me feeling more bewildered than a week without sleep .
Once the rush eased off the rest of the day was spent catching up with emails and writing letters .
The evening was a mixture of live music and chatting to some of the musicians and patrons of the bar .
My plans for a resident support team had not as yet materialised so from around 2.30 am , just before the last of those bound for bed had left I set up ' camp ' at a table directly in front the main web cam .
Amongst other things I trawled the net looking for information on the origin of the so called ' ginger gene ' considered an evolutionary response to low light levels at high latitudes .
It conveys amongst other things more efficient conversion of vitamin D from sunlight and a susceptibility to sunburn , more on that tomorrow .
Not the most enthralling of nights but the 24 hour mark came and went without incident .
Roll on the next 14400 minutes .
Day 2 : Tuesday 15 May 2007
Another day another phone call and another and another , finally easing off as the day progressed .
Two reporters and a photographer added a more human element to the media interest and in depth discussions of my research ensued between recording takes .
Fifteen copies of the book I have written ' Left in the Dark ' , explaining research and ideas that ultimately led to my quest to break the sleep deprivation record , finally arrived .
The rest of the day past off without difficulty and once again it was dark , live music and people coming and going and late evening had turned into early night .
For the first time a few noticeable waves of tiredness , the remedy ?
a three hour pool marathon , after the best part of fifty hours awake I won every single game !
( do n't ask Alex the Studio Bar owner as he may be in denial ) .
Morning again , two days or fifty hours completed , suddenly another nine days seems a very very long time , hats off to Randy Gardner .
A quick chat to a local radio station then being interviewed by a local newspaper .
Back to the ' ginger gene ' mystery , as the gene turns out to be at least 100,000 years old it could not have evolved in the dark northern climates as modern humans had yet to leave their evolutionary home in Africa by this date .
The high light and ultraviolet levels typical of the climate in Africa would have rendered its evolution unlikely and useless .
One recent suggestion is that it evolved in Neanderthals and entered the modern human population via crossbreeding , more tomorrow .
Day 3 : Wednesday 16 May 2007
Well not so much to report today except of course the 70 hour blues , after all the interviews in the last couple of days my voice has started to go again so have decided to reduce any talking to minimum today .
Also have played pool for several hours each of the last two nights as a means of passing time , the standard was not so good last night and to add to my woes by morning the cumulative mileage was rubbing the skin off my feet .
Sheilding his eyes from the screen
So much for whinging , well I 'm not finished on top of my ailments I felt very tired on a couple of occasions and it became easy to imagine climbing into a soft warm bed and pulling the covers over my head .
However , rather than giving in at the first hurdle I survived these terrible ordeals and now feel fine if a little hoarse chaffed and surreal around the edges .
Final thought on the mysterious origins of the ginger gene , it is likely to have emerged in response to a low level of light yet confers little defence against the harmful effects of sunlight .
Perhaps a solution exists , tropical forests have been the evolutionary home of most primates and apes for millions of years .
On the forest floor almost all the light has been absorbed and filtered by the forest canopy , you are left with very shady environment without the direct and harmful impact of ultraviolet light .
For any animal that lived some of its life high in the trees being forced to spend more time on the forest floor would have caused problems , could this have been the kind of scenario that humans ones faced .
Of course it is still believed by many that we evolved on the savannah or along the coastal fringes yet the possibility that it was the forest all along that shaped our evolution is never considered .
Day 4 : Thursday 17 May 2007
Once more a journey through the long dark night of the soul loomed large , a few games of pool , the now regular midnight chat with Danny Kelly at BBC Radio Birmingham and the increasing questions from local visitors .
Would that be enough to stave off the ever - lurking presence of sleep ( Deaths younger brother , according to some ancient traditions )
In short it was but only just !
The lure of sleep in alliance with its distant cousins Stress and Burnout .
I considered throwing in the towel .
I had realised that dealing with the initial and unexpected number of press enquiries and follow up interviews had taken a bit of a toll .
The very positive knock on effect was a lot more publicity than I had expected at such an early stage , good ?
Yes , however at 3 am the alliance sowed the seeds of doubt and for a couple of hours encouraged them to grow .
One of my support team kept reminding me ( for a couple of hours ) of the effort that had gone into getting this off the ground and although everyday we receive more and more emails of support , it was still not enough to allay the doubt and negativity and the malaise may well have continued .
Fortunately a call from Radio Cornwall shook me out of this self hypnosis and the spell was broken , no way , not until 264 hours have passed will I be tempted by the lure of an easy exit .
Not long after sustainability consultant Steve Charter turned up , he is chairing the 1st ever Transition Penwith ’s Sustainability and Consciousness meeting here in the Studio Bar at 6 pm tomorrow .
I am supposed to co host if I ’m still awake and coherent so come along and check out my sleep deprived state of mind !
Day 5 : Friday 18 May 2007
Today 's News ... Significant milestone 100 hours successfully passed ( actually 122 hours at the time of dictation ) .
Once more into the jaws ... not sure where I was going with that ...
This entry will be short and others may be ( I 'm dictating this and someone else is typing it ) ...
You may have heard of an NDE ( Near Death Experience ) or what about an OBE ( Out of Body Experience ) , well I 've just had my first couple of NSE's ( no not Near Sex Experience , but the dreaded Near Sleep Experience ) ...
It turns out in the etiquette of sleep deprivation marathons there are a number of does and don'ts that I discovered almost to my cost .
One is ' Thou Shalt Not Type Long Blogs for the BBC ' ; number two is ' Thou Shalt Not Redraft a Press Release ' .
Apparently it is written ( or probably not ) that once you 've passed the 100 hours mark , a great curse will be bestowed upon you when , for example , trying to write ...
One 's pen initially does as it's told , yet imperceptibly and without warning you find yourself staring ever more closely at the word you are writing , to the point where your nose starts resting on the paper .
Simultaneously the word you began with has mysteriously transformed into an incomprehensible hieroglyph .
You also become aware of a loud ringing in your ears .
This is the sound of the non -stop sleeper from Penzance coming to take you away .
The results were remarkably similar despite resorting to a keyboard and screen .
The flat screen starts turning into a multi-dimensional portal to another world and the text into a welcoming entourage of giggling dancing pixies and elves ...
Remarkably , one 's nose heads in a similar direction , and without a last - second reprieve would have come firmly to rest on the Z key .
That 's the humorous way of saying I was almost caught out and from now on these great taboos in the religion of sleep deprivation will no longer be ignored .
Near misses aside , everything is going well .
Do n't forget if you 're in the Penzance area tonight at 6 pm for the Consciousness meeting - see previous postings - at the Studio Bar , 40 - 41 Bread Street .
Day 6 : Saturday 20 May 2007
After the near sleep experience on Saturday I have been a lot more careful to avoid sleep ambushes , however it 's a tricky blighter and it can jump you without warning anywhere , relax for just a mo , bang its in your head and trying to take you down .
The only option is to fight it off , do not negotiate , do not appeal to its better nature and never show it any mercy or it will be back almost immediately .
Despite the ever present risk from the sleep monster today , 6 days in was the first day I began to feel really confident that the record was mine for the taking .
However I could do with a little help , a few extra allies during the day and subject to prior agreement ( see diary heading ) at night would be great , evenings are already too busy for sleep to stand a chance though more would be better .
In a rush , must keep on the move as its always just one small step behind for sleep or one big blackout for me !!!!!
( hey I have n't slept for 6 days ) .
Day 7 : Sunday 21 May 2007
Well as the end of the sleep fast draws nigh the bloggers chores are never done , peering closely into the laptop screen when down around 150 hours of sleep is doubly Riske , aside from the new strains of NSE caused by the hypnogogic effects of a close screen encounter , the webcam seems to give an unhelpful impression of total stillness when one is merely pondering ones creative insights ( or in this case lack of them ) .
Several emails appeared and the phone rang to point out the lack of vital signs so efforts were made to ensure my existence had not prematurely ended .
While NSE has become a real headache , threatening ones laptop with a fake headbutt having hunched over its screen and population for too long they are still a step from real sleep the killer for record adherents .
Tomorrow , hopefully something of relevance !!!
Day 8 : Monday 22 May 2007
Having some real trouble with this blog stuff , its more fun writing it when sleep deprived than expected but the risks of a damaging NSE or rare and deadly fatal TSE experience is increasing in proportion ( or exponebtialkky ) to the number of hours I stay awake .
Every attempt to glance at the screen can end up in a nose dive and if your lucky some pathetic attempts at nonchalance when your strange acrobatic performance is the embarrassed centre of everyone 's attention .
I have tried a couple of approaches , stealth -- by sneaking short sideways glances at the screen it is possible to cobble together short words though further editing can result in pre sleep deprived psychosis , Two ---
Hold your ground , stare rigidly at the screen and type like hell , or at least use your best finger .
This always gives the impression it will work , that is until catastrophic failure results in laptop , table and stool flying away from the operators head .
11 days without sleep in the name of research is one thing , a couple of paragraphs for a blog seemed so innocuous , however a veteran war reporter would be easy prey in this hell hole .
However I 'm no quitter , shaking the concussion from my last crash out of my head I grabbed my sunglasses and without hesitation looked straight into the middle of the screen .
No swirling hieroglyphs , dancing pixies or sudden NSE , at last a safe screen for heavily sleep deprived bloggers .
Day 10 : Wednesday 24 May 2007
OK , I have decided to lay off the surreal references to hallucinating and stage diving laptops .
During my sleepless - feast I have received many enquires as to the difficulties of my endurance , being sleepy , being the focus of attention etc
As it turns out writing while sleep deprived is easily the most difficult thing to do , for that reason I have decided I wo n't write anymore , so this will be my last entry .
Best Wishes Tony
High Achievers : What Price Are They Paying ?
A Harvard Interviewer 's Honest Assessment
They come to me with SATs pushing 1600 and more awards than military heroes .
The valedictorians .
The student leaders .
The super - jocks .
They are applying to Harvard .
They are the children you want your kids to become .
For the past 17 years , I 've been an alumni interviewer for Harvard .
As part of its admissions process , Harvard extends applicants an opportunity to meet with one of its alumni .
To personalize the process .
To allow its applicants to " come alive , " apart from their strategically packaged portfolios .
Acknowledging that most teens walk into these interviews with understandably heightened anxiety , my initial focus is on helping them exhale their fears and worries about impressing me .
" We 're here so that Harvard can get to know you a little better .
There are no right or wrong answers .
We 're just going to chat for a while , " I offer calmly .
I try to get beyond their Miss America - like , rehearsed responses -- " Harvard is the best environment available for me to pursue my pre-medical studies . "
I 'm looking for clues as to whether they 'd make considerate roommates , inquisitive scholars , and generous contributors to Harvard 's community .
Most often , these frightened , pressured high - achievers have trouble finding their own voice .
Instead , I hear them speak in the boilerplate , programmed , success - oriented words of their parents , teachers and college coaches .
Running on Empty
He listed cross-country as a sport he took up in his junior year .
No athletic endeavors had preceded his high - school running .
I asked John* ( all names have been changed ) what had drawn him to distance running and why he came to pursue it his junior year .
He replied matter - of - factly , " My guidance counselor told me it would look good on my transcript if I had a sport .
He said that colleges looked for well - rounded kids and that I needed something like a sport to look better for colleges .
Time was running out and my junior year was the last year I could get a sport in before I sent in my applications .
I joined cross-country because everyone makes it who tries out . "
" Do you like running ?
Does it give you pleasure ? " I hoped .
" No , " was his hollow reply .
Peter had scored two 800s on his SATs and was recognized as a National Merit Scholar .
As we spoke of his favorite high - school classes , I asked whether he had ever challenged any of his English teachers ' opinions in class .
Looking down at the floor , he spoke softly .
" Sure , I used to disagree lots of times .
I mean , there 's no absolute right answer when it comes to knowing whether an author was using her own life or not as the basis for the main character , right ?
But every time I 'd disagree with this teacher or our textbook 's opinion I 'd end up getting marked down for it .
So I learned it 's better to tell teachers what they want to hear so you 'll get a better grade . "
Sadly , there was no anger or disappointment in his voice .
Sarah , class valedictorian and winner of numerous , prestigious math and science awards , spoke with a dull and disembodied affect about her academic triumphs and her future , " Math and science have always been easy for me .
I do n't like them nearly as much as literature but they 're what I do best .
I guess I 'll major in them in college , get a graduate degree in them and then get an engineering job and get married .
That 's what my parents ( survivors of Cambodia 's killing fields ) expect .
They want me to get an engineering job and to get married as soon as I get my graduate degree .
I hope that I can save up enough money so that I can retire early , like in my 50s , and travel . "
Sarah was 17 , a broken sparrow , dying to be middle - aged .
Stressed for Success
Heard enough ?
I have .
Over the past two decades , the children I 've interviewed have become progressively more packaged for success .
They 've been advised , scared , and professionally coached into believing that school 's only purpose is to get the grades that will gain them admission into an elite college .
College must then result in a degree that translates into a high - paying job and a secure financial future .
That 's the plan .
The only plan .
It 's no wonder that a recently released American Council on Education survey of more than 348,000 college freshmen reports that , " Academic credentials , rather than a love of learning , seem to be their motivation . "
Shame on us all .
We begin telling kids by eighth , or ninth grade , " It all counts now !
Every grade , every sports performance , every activity in or out of school .
You 're building your permanent record for college .
It 's time to get serious . "
As one student explained , " The big transcript worries start freshman year and your whole future is pretty much determined by the end of junior year in high school . "
We actually start scaring them much earlier than middle school .
I 've got a list of third - and fourth - grade therapy clients who have seen me for school - related stress to prove it .
Free to Be
So how do you raise kids to be high achievers without their suffering anxiety , dread , and abject resignation ?
Stop hurrying and stealing their childhood , structuring and scheduling their every waking moment ; read or re-read David Elkind 's prophetic , cautionary , The Hurried Child : Growing Up Too Fast Too Soon ( Perseus Books , 1988 ) .
Do n't frighten them into believing in and following your master plan for academic and career success .
Begin telling them as preschoolers that you love and admire them for who they are , not for the grades and achievements that they bring you .
Encourage their own natural academic and extracurricular interests , regardless of whether they are deemed portfolio - advisable by costly college " handlers . "
Urge them to volunteer and to serve others and do so together -- as part of your family 's values , not because it will look good on their college transcripts .
In short , love and support them as they challenge and search for themselves , fulfill their dreams and become the people they choose to be .
I 've been thinking a little bit about Google Gears recently and after reading the documentation things I 've realized that making a Web - based application that works well offline poses an interesting set of challenges .
First of all , let 's go over what constitutes the platform that is Google Gears .
It consists of three components
LocalServer : Allows you to cache and serve application resources such as HTML pages , scripts , stylesheets and images from a local web server .
Database : A relational database where the application can store data locally .
The database supports both full - text and SQL queries .
WorkerPool : Allows applications to perform I / O expensive tasks in the background and thus not lock up the browser .
A necessary evil .
At first , this seemed like a lot to functionality being offered by Google Gears until I started trying to design how I 'd take some of my favorite Web applications offline .
Let 's start with a straightforward case such as Google Reader .
The first thing you have to do is decide what data needs to be stored locally when the user decides to go offline .
Well , a desktop RSS reader has all my unread items even when I go offline so a user may expect that if they go offline in Google Reader this means all their unread items are offline .
This could potentially be a lot of data to transfer in the split instant between when the user selects " go offline " in the Google Reader interface and she actually loses her ' net connection by closing her laptop .
There are ways to work around this such as limiting how many feeds are available offline ( e.g. Robert Scoble with a thousand feeds in his subscription list wo n't get to take all of them offline ) or by progressively downloading all the unread content while the user is viewing the content in online mode .
Let 's ignore that problem for now because it is n't that interesting .
The next problem is to decide which state changes while the app is offline need to be reported back when the user gets back online .
These seem to be quite straightforward ,
Feed changed
Feed added
Feed deleted
Feed renamed
Feed moved
News item changed
Item marked read / unread
Item flagged / starred
Item tag updated
The application code can store these changes as a sequential list of modifications which are then executed whenever the user gets back online .
Sounds easy enough .
Or is it ?
What happens if I 'm on my laptop and I go offline in Google Reader and mark a bunch of stuff as read then unsubscribe from a few feeds I no longer find interesting .
The next day when I get to work , I go online on my desktop , read some new items and subscribe to some new feeds .
Later that day , I go online with my laptop .
Now the state on my laptop is inconsistent from that on the Web server .
How do we reconcile these differences ?
The developers at Google have anticipated these questions and have answered them in Google Gears documentation topic titled Choosing an Offline Application Architecture which states
No matter which connection and modality strategy you use , the data in the local database will get out of sync with the server data .
For example , local data and server data get out of sync when :
The user makes changes while offline
Data is shared and can be changed by external parties
Data comes from an external source , such as a feed Resolving these differences so that the two stores are the same is called " synchronization " .
There are many approaches to synchronization and none are perfect for all situations .
The solution you ultimately choose will likely be highly customized to your particular application .
Below are some general synchronization strategies .
Manual Sync
The simplest solution to synchronization is what we call " manual sync " .
It 's manual because the user decides when to synchronize .
It can be implemented simply by uploading all the old local data to the server , and then downloading a fresh copy from the server before going offline .
...
Background Sync
In a " background sync " , the application continuously synchronizes the data between the local data store and the server .
This can be implemented by pinging the server every once in a while or better yet , letting the server push or stream data to the client ( this is called Comet in the Ajax lingo ) .
I do n't consider myself some sort of expert on data synchronization protocols but it seems to me that there is a lot more to figuring out a data synchronization strategy than whether it should be done based on user action or automatically in the background without user intervention .
It seems that there would be all sorts of decisions around consistency models and single vs. multi-master designs that developers would have to make as well .
And that 's just for a fairly straightforward application like Google Reader .
Can you imagine what it would be like to use Google Gears to replicate the functionality of Outlook in the offline mode of Gmail or to make Google Docs & Spreadsheets behave properly when presented with conflicting versions of a document or spreadsheet because the user updated it from the Web and in offline mode ?
It seems that without providing data synchronization out of the box , Google Gears leaves the most difficult and cumbersome aspect of building a disconnected Web app up to application developers .
This may be OK for Google developers using Google Gears since the average Google coder is a Ph.D but the platform is n't terribly useful to Web application developers who want to use it for anything besides a super - sized HTTP cookie .
A number of other bloggers such as Roger Jennings and Tim Anderson have also pointed that the lack of data synchronization in Google Gears is a significant oversight .
If Google intends for Google Gears to become a platform that will be generally useful to the average Web developer then the company will have to fix this oversight .
Otherwise , they have n't done as much for the Web development world as the initial hype led us to believe .
Vincent van Gogh was a brilliant depicter of natural phenomena , especially when he was at his most psychotic .
According to José Luis Aragón of the National Autonomous University in Mexico , Van Gogh 's famous spiral brushstrokes are near - perfect renderings of turbulence .
From the largest visible swaths of paint to the tiniest strokes , Van Gogh 's brushwork seems instinctually guided to simulate river eddies and cloud rotations .
Aragón and a colleague , Manuel Torres , plotted the swirls in Van Gogh 's most turbulent paintings , which , coincidentally or not , were made during his most serious dips in mental health .
Starry Night was painted during the artist 's stint in a French insane asylum .
Road With Cypress and Star was made after a prolonged bout of disturbing hallucinations , and Wheat Field With Crows was finished just before Van Gogh committed suicide .
Aragón found that Van Gogh 's eddies matched the famous Kolmogorov statistical model of turbulence .
For a layman like Van Gogh , that 's quite a coup , since the problem of turbulence is generally considered the last unsolved mystery of classical physics .
Is it possible that Van Gogh 's mind , warped by disease , was prepared to grasp phenomena that have baffled physicists for centuries ?
This is n't the first time Van Gogh 's talent for rendering natural forms has made him a scientific standout .
Last year a study found that bumblebees that had never encountered real flowers favored Van Gogh 's Sunflowers over the floral works of other well - known artists .
Programming notes and ideas from an astrophysicist .
We depend on credit for so many important things in life -- whether it's for buying a car , house or computer or getting a student loan .
A three - digit number -- your credit score -- can determine whether you can do these things and even how much it will cost you .
How can a simple number determine whether you can buy a house or car ?
If you 've read How Credit Reports Work , you know that your credit report contains a history of how you 've paid your bills , how much open credit you have , and anything else that would affect your creditworthiness .
Your credit score boils down all of that information to a three - digit number .
Using the credit score , lenders can predict with some accuracy how likely the borrower is to repay a loan and make payments on time .
It 's how electronics and department stores can offer instant credit .
This incredibly important number , which affects how much you pay for credit , insurance and other life necessities , used to be hidden from consumers .
Until recently , only lenders and other businesses that used the score could access it .
Fair Isaac and Company , which developed the score , felt that the score would only confuse consumers since there was nothing to tell them what it meant or what lenders were looking for .
In 2001 , however , all of this changed due to pressure from the U.S. Congress and industry and consumer groups .
Now you can view your credit score -- for a fee -- from credit reporting agencies and credit monitoring services .
But to help us understand that number and ultimately know how to improve it , we 'll need to find out how it 's calculated .

Private Facebook profiles are n't quite as hidden as many users might think they are .
Pages that are supposedly restricted are visible to anyone using searches based on religion , sexual orientation or relationship status .
Security researcher Christopher Soghoian announced the flaw on Tuesday .
A quick search by Wired News for women in a major U.S. city who were interested in random hookups with men revealed the names and photos of two high school girls , including one ninth grader .
Like many social networks , the increasingly popular Facebook allows its users to mark their profile page as private , semiprivate or open .
However , even if you mark your profile to be visible only by friends , that does n't change how you turn up in Facebook searches or whether your profile is open to indexing by search engines .
Instead , users looking for privacy must also change their preferences under search , else their profiles will be indexed by internet search engine spiders and their names , photos and personal data fields will be searchable by any Facebook member who is a fellow member of a " group " such as a school or geographic area that the user elects to join .
For instance , if you are a Facebook member of your college , you could run a search to see all the people who are Christian women who are lesbians , all the women interested in women or all the Muslim men into other men .
Your search results will likely include people who thought they marked their information as private , but did n't also change their search settings .
( These links all require a valid Facebook account . )
Searchers still can't click through to the full profile for members who chose to make the profile visible only to their Facebook friends .
Soghoian first discovered the discrepancy in September 2006 and revisited it after speaking with attendees at a privacy conference last week , who suggested that the setup could violate European privacy standards .
Soghoian , a graduate student previously known for disclosing holes in both airport security and Firefox browser extensions , contends that the number of people whose private profiles show up in search results is clear proof that Facebook 's options are too confusing .
" There is an easy way to fix this at the individual level , " Soghoian said .
" But the fact that so many people have n't done it easily demonstrates that opt - out privacy does n't work . "
Facebook is no stranger to privacy concerns .
Last September , the networking site faced a minor riot from its members following a unilateral change in how other members learn of changes to a user profile .
A Facebook representative did not respond to a request for comment and Soghoian says his attempts to reach Facebook 's privacy person were foiled when a receptionist told him that the individual did not take outside phone calls .
A company representative responded to an email to privacy@facebook.com by thanking Soghoian for his note and said that the company would " certainly keep it in mind . "
Facebook users who set their profile to private and want to keep their name and photo out of searches can do using the search preference page .
Story update : A Facebook representative responded to Wired 's inquiry after deadline June 27 with an announcement that it had changed the behavior of its privacy settings .
" Facebook offers sophisticated search and privacy controls and is constantly making improvements based on feedback from our users , " the spokesman wrote .
" We have since updated the advanced search function so that profile information that has been made private by a user , such as gender , religion and sexual orientation , will not return a result . "
Story update , Oct. 9 , 2007 : The Facebook search flaw discussed above was first made public in a 2005 paper ( .pdf ) written by Carnegie Mellon University professor Alessandro Acquisti and Ph.D. student Ralph Gross .
This information was unknown to Wired News or security researcher Christopher Soghoian when this article was published on June 28 .

How to Drown a Child -
It happened at an afternoon wedding celebration .
The hosting home had a pool , and very soon some younger guests began jumping in .
My four - year - old son did n't know how to swim yet , but was drawn by the activity and the water .
He begged me to let him go in , " Just to my knees , Papa . "
I found a ledge where I could sit , dangling my legs in the water , and where my son could stand " to his knees " beside me .
I sat with another guest , keeping an eye on my son , who splashed about on the ledge no more than two feet away from me .
After about 30 - seconds of chit- chat , I looked beside me to check on my son .
He was n't there .
He must have gotten out .
So I looked around the yard .
But with all the people and activity , I did n't see him .
Damn !
I told that kid to stay close and not wander off .
Then I looked down .
Under the water I saw my son's terrified face .
He was desperately reaching up toward me , his eyes filled with shock and fear .
I reached down , grabbed his arm and pulled him up .
We stared at each other 's faces in disbelief for a second , then held each other tight ....
An embrace that defied death .
Here 's the truth :
Had that chit - chat been more interesting , I 'm sure my son would have drowned .
Had I gotten up to look for my son in the yard , my son would have drowned .
Had I not happened to look down , my son would have drowned .... I can think of so many ways that my son would have drowned .
And he would have died silently , with people all around .
How do you drown a child ?
It 's very easy .
Just chit - chat with a friend while your child plays two feet away from you in a pool .

The iPhone is Steve Jobs 's attempt to crack a juicy new market for Apple Inc .
But it 's also part of a decades - long campaign by Mr. Jobs against a much broader target : buttons .
The new Apple cellphone famously does without the keypads that adorn its rivals .
Instead , it offers a touch - sensing screen for making phone calls and tapping out emails .
The resulting look is one of the sparest ever for Apple , a company known for minimalist gadgets .
While many technology companies load their products up with buttons , Mr. Jobs treats them as blemishes that add complexity to electronics products and hinder their clean aesthetics .
( Early iPhone sales figures from AT&T Inc. disappointed Wall Street .
See related article . )
Buttons have long been a hot - button issue for Apple 's CEO .
Bruce Tognazzini , a former user - interface expert at Apple who joined the company in 1978 , says Mr. Jobs was adamant that the keyboard for the original Macintosh not include " up , " " down , " " right " and " left " keys that allow users to move the cursor around their computer screens , giving it a sleeker appearance than other personal computers have .
Mr. Jobs 's reasoning , says Mr. Tognazzini : Omitting the cursor keys would force independent software developers to create programs that used the Mac 's mouse -- a novel technology at the time .
" He wanted the thing to look nonintimidating , " Mr. Tognazzini says .

An odd - looking Canadian coin with a bright red flower was the culprit behind the U.S. Defence Department 's false espionage warning earlier this year , the Associated Press has learned .
The odd - looking - but harmless - " poppy coin " was so unfamiliar to suspicious U.S. Army contractors travelling in Canada that they filed confidential espionage accounts about them .
The worried contractors described the coins as " anomalous " and " filled with something man-made that looked like nano - technology , " according to once - classified U.S. government reports and e-mails obtained by the AP .
The supposed nano - technology actually was a conventional protective coating the Royal Canadian Mint applied to prevent the poppy 's red color from rubbing off .
The mint produced nearly 30 million such quarters in 2004 commemorating Canada 's 117,000 war dead .
あなたの愛猫は、今何か体調面で問題を抱えてはいないでしょうか？
生活習慣の問題によるちょっとした場合もあれば、通院を繰り返しているほどの重い病気を患っているという場合など、大小さまざまでしょう。
今回は、そんな体調面の問題の改善を図るために作られたキャットフードについてご紹介します。
最もありふれたケースでいえば、「肥満の改善」に向いているキャットフードを探している方が多いことでしょう。
肥満になってしまえば、体重の増加による体への負担が大きいため、椎間板ヘルニアや捻挫、関節炎などが起きやすくなってしまいます。
肥満の改善については、単純に「低脂肪 」 や「低脂質」のキャットフードを選べば良いです。
本来、普通のものは牛肉や魚を素材にしていますが、低脂肪タイプではチキンやササミといった、肉の中でもカロリーや脂質が少なく、健康を気遣うなら真っ先に挙げられる素材を中心に使用しています。
低脂肪や低脂質の食品を人間がイメージすると、味が薄かったり安っぽかったり、さらには変に感じられてしまったりと、味を楽しめる要素はないように思われるはずです。
しかしキャットフードはどうかというと、興味を引くために味やにおいをしっかりと考慮しており、嗜好性も十分にあるので、「低」が付く食べ物ならではの心配は基本的にありません。
重めな健康問題を挙げれば、 「 慢性腎不全」があります。
体内、とりわけ血液中の老廃物をろ過し、尿に作り替えて排出するという、腎臓の機能が低下してしまう病気で、食欲不振や脱水症状、嘔吐、体重の減少といった深刻な症状に陥ってしまいます。
この腎不全のケアを目的に作られたキャットフードは、ヨーロッパ製を中心に意外に多く販売されています。
主な効果としては、腎不全といえばタンパク質をはじめとした栄養素の分解能力が低下するため、それらを最低限必要な分のみに抑えて摂取するようにし、症状の悪化を抑えられるようになっています。

The Phoenix —
They are not stopping traffic or waving picket signs : a group of concerned peaceniks from the Brunswick area have found another means of change .
According to the rules of the US House of Representatives , any state legislature can present a resolution to impeach the president .
Deborah Gordan and Stan Lofalia of MaineImpeach.org hope Maine will be the first state to do so , though similar efforts are under way in several other states .
The group of artists and activists has collected 3600 signatures on a petition to US representatives Michael Michaud and Tom Allen , as well as to state lawmakers , hoping to push any or all of them toward seeking impeachment .
Organizers say they want to collect 10,000 signatures before formally submitting them to Michaud , Allen , and others .

P.S. Twice now I ’ve noted how Hackers or Reddit itself is knocking down this post .
Each time I add the note to the article , the Reddit score goes up ( Roaches scurry when the lights turn on ) .
Then when I remove the notice , it goes back down .
A renowned hedge - fund honcho hatched a heinous revenge plot against his former mistress by posing as her on the Internet – saying she wanted to be kidnapped and raped as part of a sicko sex fantasy , officials said yesterday .
Albert Hsu , 43 , a wealthy , married dad of two and former Cub Scout leader , posted his fiendish ad on a hardcore , S&M Web site , Connecticut authorities said .
He allegedly included the woman ’s name , photo , address , license - plate number , train schedule to and from work and even the rail car she usually sits in .
“ The defendant set the victim up to be abducted and raped by a complete stranger , ” prosecutor Ricki Goldstein said in Norwalk , Conn. , Superior Court .
Hsu , who co-founded Anchor Point Capital in New York City after overseeing billions in investments for everyone from Xerox to Atlantic Philanthropies , meticulously planned the scheme down to the last detail , officials said .
Posing as his ex in the “ ad , ” he allegedly begged anyone responding to not contact her or give her a head ’s - up before the attack because it “ would ruin the fantasy ” for her .
His motive appeared simply to be pure “ hate , ” Goldstein said .
She said Hsu had already lined up one potential attacker and has confessed to the crime .
The investor was held in lieu of $ 750,000 bond after being busted Friday , but a judge jacked up the amount to $ 1 million at his arraignment yesterday .
The slightly built Hsu appeared extremely grim - faced and hunched over in court .
He sported tailored pants , a pricey , button - down , powder - blue shirt , a gray cashmere sweater – and shackles .
His evil plan came to light after his unidentified victim alerted authorities to the terrifying posting about her on http://www.collarme.com
Feb. 26 , authorities said .
“ We acted on it as quickly and as urgently as we could to protect the safety of the victim , ” said police Lt. David Bender of New Canaan , where Hsu lives .
“ We felt she was in grave danger . ”
Hsu was charged with attempted kidnapping , attempted sex assault , criminal impersonation and other raps , officials said .
The money man ’s court - appointed lawyer , Dawn Bradanini , said her client was “ thoroughly embarrassed by this . ”
She asked for a lower bond “ based on the lack of history of a serious nature . ”
Goldstein said Hsu had previously been charged with assaulting his wife .
A bail official added that he has a history of mental problems and is on medication .
He was placed on suicide watch .
News of Hsu ’s bizarre bust stunned his community and colleagues , who heralded him as one of the nation ’s leading , most quotable authorities on hedge funds .
“ Albert is absolutely the last man in America you would expect to do anything wrong , let alone anything like this , ” one rival trader said .
“ He is incredibly smart and polite , the type of guy you ’d like as a partner and a neighbor . ”
Matt Crowe , the son of Hsu ’s partner at Anchor Point , declined to comment when asked if anyone at the firm had noticed a recent change in the suspect ’s behavior .
“ We only know what we ’ve read , ” he said .
Hsu , who attended the prestigious Bronx School of Science , lives with his wife – a management consultant – and young son and daughter in a ritzy home .

IronRuby
I am going to make a bold statement here .
Under the current circumstances , I do n't believe it 's possible for John Lam and his team to create a Ruby implementation that runs Rails within at least 18 months .
And frankly , that 's not soon enough .
As I said above , I have all confidence that John can do great stuff if he has the right resources .
But creating a Ruby implementation is hard enough while having all the benefits of the open source community .
Ruby specification
The two points I want to make with this point is this :
The Ruby community must damned well get serious about creating a good , complete specification and test suite .
It 's time to do it right now , and we need it .
It 's not a one - man job .
The community needs to do it .
( And yes , the two SoC projects are a very good start .
But you still need to be able to run RSpec to take full advantage of them ; and let 's face it , the RSpec implementation uses many nice Ruby tricks . )
Google SoC sponsors two students to work on RSpec tests for the specification ( InfoQ recently featured an interview with one of the students )
tests for the specification ( InfoQ recently featured an interview with one of the students ) JRuby 's Charles O. Nutter has long ago started a Wiki for the Ruby specification
The Rubinius project has also been busy creating many RSpec tests to check compatibility and they cooperate with the JRuby team on this too .
Having run the Ruby gauntlet and brought JRuby from not running anything to running Rails almost 100 % perfectly ( in just over a year , I might add ) , I will confidently say there 's no way with current specs and tests that anyone could create an implementation of Ruby from scratch that will run Rails unless they can look at the existing implementations .
I simply do not believe it 's possible .
This is a good friend 's belief , but he 's won me over : we do n't believe Microsoft would ever willingly allow IronRuby to get to the point of running Rails , since that would directly compete with their ASP .
NET server , software , and tool offerings .
What would be the benefit to them of a free runtime running a free language implementation that runs a free web framework ?
Probably zero .
independent project
Having spent the better part of 14 years doing Microsoft based development , there has never been a time where I was more proud to call myself a Microsoft platform developer .
The stuff coming from Anders Hejlsberg and the C# team , let alone the stuff coming out with the DLR and Silverlight , is some of the best innovation this business has seen in years .
Given these facts and the current situation , I 'd say it 's a better bet for us as a community to get behind the Gardens Point Ruby .
NET Compiler project , which is already much farther along than IronRuby ... plus it 's real open source ( you can contribute ) and they can look at Ruby 's source ( and have admitted to doing so for at least the parser ) .
I was wary / skeptical of Ruby .
NET last year , but they now seem like the current best hope for Ruby on the CLR .
Microsoft 's announcement of , a Ruby implementation that runs on .NET has caused a lot of debates in the Ruby space .
Ola Bini , JRuby team member , kicks of another one by expressing doubt about the feasibility of the project .
He bases this opinion on one crucial problem behind IronRuby : the developers supposedly cannot look at Ruby 's source code due to copyright or license issues .
Another problem is Microsoft 's refusal to accept outside code contributions .
Ola explains
Ola 's solution is to focus on speeding up the work on a full
The specification effort is already going on : While Ola seems to believe IronRuby could become a full , compliant Ruby implementation , if only Ruby was specified in enough detail , Charles O. Nutter is pessimistic Charles also suspects a lack of determination on Microsoft 's part :
This is a surprising statement ( to say the least ) coming from a developer employed by Sun to work on JRuby .
Sun employs two full time developers to work on JRuby and two more to work on the Netbeans Ruby tools .
Yet , Sun wo n't see a single dime in return of this investment directly , since JRuby is an( it 's not a Sun project ) and the Netbeans tools are free of charge .
Actually , using Charles ' reasoning , Sun would not want a JRuby capable of running Rails , because developers using JRuby on Rails wo n't use JSP , JSF or any other Java technologies .
So , unless developers or companies use JRuby on Rails on Sun hardware or use Sun 's software support services for running on Sun software , Sun does n't earn any money from this effort .
So , by Charles ' logic , there should n't be four Ruby runtime and tool developers on the payroll .
Yet there are .
Another flaw in this logic is the view that every developer using Rails on .NET must have switched over from ASP .
NET , thus incurring a profit loss for Microsoft .
But this is not necessarily the case .
Switching an experienced ASP.NET team to using a different language and framework incurs retraining costs .
The advantages from switching to Rails must be considerable for a particular project for that to happen .
There is also the question , whether all .NET developers would see the benefit of this , when they can chose from a host of technologies from Microsoft .
Aaron Erickson , a .NET developer , explains his perception of the the Microsoft platform at the moment
If more .NET developers think like this and are fully satisfied with the technologies and tooling that Microsoft provides , then there is not much chance of mass migrations from .NET tools to Ruby .
The group of developers that would drop their tools and switch to Rails are the same that did this on the Java platform , the people who ditched Struts , JSF and Co to work with Rails .
This is a group that is either dissatisfied with the old ways of solving problems or developers new in the web space who are n't used to the old ways yet .
The availability of a full Rails version on .NET would ensure that developers interested in Rails could stay on the .NET / Microsoft software stack , and retain most of their experience ( with Windows , IIS , Visual Studio , etc ) .
If Rails is not available , then there 's a chance that this group will wander off to use a Non-Microsoft stack for Ruby , maybe switch to JRuby on Rails on another Operating System and Web server .
With a full Rails implementation , Microsoft can keep developers on the .NET / Microsoft software stack , and with good tool support , it could attract new ones .
This results in a direct benefit for Microsoft : companies using Windows and Microsoft server software and tools will pay license fees for this software , not to mention support contracts or training courses .
As for IDE support , Ruby in Steel already offers state - of - the - art support for Ruby and Rails in Visual Studio .
The general idea : making .NET more attractive for a wider audience can retain and maybe attract paying customers , without cannibalizing sales of other products .
Unconvinced about IronRuby 's chances , Charles mentions another way to bring Ruby to the .NET platform : The Gardens Point Ruby .NET compiler project is an active project to create a Ruby to .NET bytecode compiler .
It ships with an executable that behaves just as the ruby or jruby command line versions , but instead of interpreting Ruby Abstract Syntax Trees ( ASTs ) , this will compile Ruby code to MSIL ( the instructions set used on the CLR ) before it runs .
Debates like this make the first release of IronRuby ever more interesting .
John Lam , IronRuby 's developer , recently mentioned the first public release of IronRuby will happen at O'Reilly 's OSCON , July 23 - 27 , 2007
More than 90 years ago , when Turkey was still part of the Ottoman Empire , Turkish nationalists launched an extermination campaign there that killed 1.5 million Armenians .
It was the 20th century ’s first genocide .
The world noticed , but did nothing , setting an example that surely emboldened such later practitioners as Hitler , the Hutu leaders of Rwanda in 1994 and today ’s Sudanese president , Omar Hassan al - Bashir .
Turkey has long tried to deny the Armenian genocide .
Even in the modern - day Turkish republic , which was not a party to the killings , using the word genocide in reference to these events is prosecuted as a serious crime .
Which makes it all the more disgraceful that United Nations officials are bowing to Turkey ’s demands and blocking this week ’s scheduled opening of an exhibit at U.N. headquarters commemorating the 13th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide because it mentions the mass murder of the Armenians .
Ankara was offended by a sentence that explained how genocide came to be recognized as a crime under international law : “ Following World War I , during which one million Armenians were murdered in Turkey , Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin urged the League of Nations to recognize crimes of barbarity as international crimes . ”
The exhibit ’s organizer , a British - based antigenocide group , was willing to omit the words “ in Turkey . ”
But that was not enough for the U.N. ’s craven new leadership , and the exhibit has been indefinitely postponed .
It ’s odd that Turkey ’s leaders have not figured out by now that every time they try to censor discussion of the Armenian genocide , they only bring wider attention to the subject and link today ’s democratic Turkey with the now distant crime .
As for Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and his inexperienced new leadership team , they have once again shown how much they have to learn if they are to honorably and effectively serve the United Nations , which is supposed to be the embodiment of international law and a leading voice against genocide .
Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee ’s comment yesterday that Michael Moore is an example of “ why the health care system costs more in this country ” — an apparent reference to Mr. Moore ’s weight — drew a sharp response from one of the filmmaker ’s associates .
Meghan O’Hara , the producer of Mr. Moore ’s new documentary , “ Sicko , ” fired back :
“ Looks like Mike Huckabee is auditioning for some insurance company dough , since he ’s raised just about no money and sparked zero interest since jumping into the race I wonder what the good Governor would say to the French , who drink more , smoke more , eat more cheese and still live longer than us despite paying less for health care ? ”
“ No wonder the Republicans are in such trouble , their entire plan to fix the health care system in this country is to tell people to lose weight .
Maybe if Mike Huckabee and his Republican friends stopped sucking up to health insurance campaign contributors they would n’t feel the need to blame Americans for this crisis .
Just because he stopped eating twinkies by the bushel does n’t make that an outline for a national health care plan .
“ There ’s nothing worse than a reformed smoker — or twinkie eater for that matter — preaching conversion .
We ’ve all had one of those in the house and ca n’t wait for them to just leave .
With 66 percent of the American Public overweight , it certainly does n’t seem the way to win an election .
Americans would feel better if they ate more fruits and vegetables , and walked around the block some more , but they wo n’t be encouraged to do that by a scold from Huckabee .
And is n’t he a minister ?
I do n’t remember Jesus blaming the sick for their ailments .
He healed them , and told others that unless you help them , you ca n’t come into the kingdom of heaven . ”
Mr. Huckabee ’s comments about Mr. Moore came near the end of what was an otherwise routine conference call that primarily focused on the former Arkansas governor ’s presidential bid .
A reporter asked Mr. Huckabee about his views on health care reform and whether he planned to see the movie , “ Sicko . ”
“ Michael Moore is an example of why the health care system costs more in this country , ” Mr. Huckabee responded .
He described his own efforts to lose weight over the years and said that his doctor visits , prescription drug costs and other chronic problems have all “ gone down dramatically ” since he shed more than 100 pounds .
Mr. Huckabee said he had not seen “ Sicko ” — and does n’t plan to — but did catch Mr. Moore defending his film from criticism during a series of appearances on CNN this week .
He said that Mr. Moore should n’t be acting “ as if he ’s got all the answers ” to the health care situation in the United States .
Mr. Huckabee has spoken publicly about his personal struggle to lose weight and has made fighting childhood and adult obesity an issue in his presidential campaign as it was during his governorship .
In 2006 he authored a self - help book on weight loss called “ Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork : A 12 - Stop Program to End Bad Habits and Begin a Healthy Lifestyle . ”
When asked whether Mr. Moore would respond directly to Mr. Huckabee , one of the filmmaker ’s media representatives said the candidate ’s remarks “ did n’t really dignify a response . ”

Here , in a nutshell , is what I picked up : 1 . Guantanamo is not a prison .
The official term is " detention facility " .
Although the two most recently built complexes , Camps Five and Six , were modelled on prisons in Indiana and Michigan , it is not acceptable to use the word " prison " at Gitmo .
2. Guantanamo has no prisoners , only " enemies " .
As in " unlawful enemy combatants " or " detained enemy combatants " .
3 . Once an enemy combatant , always an enemy combatant .
" Today , it is not about guilt or innocence .
It 's about unlawful enemy combatants , " Rear Admiral Harry Harris , the commanding officer of Guantanamo , told us .
" And they are all unlawful enemy combatants . "
This despite the fact that the Government also has a category for those deemed " no longer an enemy combatant " , which was not mentioned .
Nor was the possibility of mistaken detention .
4 . No trustworthy lawyers come to Guantanamo .
The handlers used the term " habeas lawyers " as a seemingly derogatory catch - all for those who are defending detainees .
It was clear that at Gitmo , detainees are believed to be using lawyers in accordance with directives in an al - Qaeda training manual that was discovered in Manchester in 2000 : " Take advantage of visits with habeas lawyers to communicate and exchange information with those outside . "
5 . Reporters misrepresent Guantanamo .
The media arrive with ostensibly open eyes ,
yet graciously hosted from morning to night , they go home perversely refusing to be complimentary to their hosts .
They suffer from " the chameleon effect " , as I was told more than once , taking on the colours of betrayers , and " we just do n't understand it " .
6 . The detainees still possess valuable information .
Harris explained : " We have up - and - coming leadership in al - Qaeda and in the Taliban in Afghanistan , ( and ) we do n't know what they look like …
But their contemporaries … are quite often the same individuals that are in the camps here today …
Sketch artists will work with these detainees … and those pictures will be sent out to the forward fighting area . "
But how reliable would anyone 's memory be after five years of isolated detention ?
7 . Abandon individuality , on either side of the wire .
The prisoners were referred to by number .
8 . Hard facts are scarce .
" You 'll notice that we speak vaguely .
We can't be specific .
You will notice that we talk in approximate terms and estimates only .
Those are operational security measures . "
9. Guantanamo houses no contradictions .
Islam is treated with respect .
The prisoners ' food is halal .
Every prisoner , even the non-compliant , has a Koran if he wants it .
But if you ask about other basic rights , such as the presumption of innocence , a sergeant without a name will chastise you about the dangers posed by enemy combatants .
" We allow two hours of recreation a day in order to comply with the Geneva Convention , " we were told .
But an escort also pointed out that the authorities need prisoners " to go outside so that we can search their cells for weapons and contraband " .
Try to explore these differing motives and an officer will reprimand the guide for giving out " misinformation " .
10 .
One final lesson : visitors who fail to reproduce the official narrative will be punished .
" Tell it the wrong way and you wo n't be back , " one of our escorts warned me over lunch .
Only time will tell if I got it right .

Software Team Turnover : Why Developers Leave ( And What You Can Do About It )
Unplanned turnover hurts — especially when you lose top people .
Good developers are a rare breed .
If you ’ve ever hired a new software developer , you know how difficult it is to find people that are competent .
Good developers that work well with your existing team of developers are even harder to find .
Even when you find a person with the right skills , personality conflicts and other issues can arise to complicate the team dynamics and jeopardize the team ’s cohesion .
When a good team has finally been assembled , it ’s imperative to keep them together and working well .
In addition to the loss of team cohesion , the organization loses the intangible knowledge that good developers take with them when they leave .
Even with good documentation , developers possess undocumented knowledge about the product , the domain , and the designs that is essential to the project ’s completion .
The fact that most development efforts also suffer from less than adequate documentation compounds the impact that the loss a developer ’s product knowledge has on the overall outcome .
In addition to product knowledge , key developers have indispensable knowledge of the organization ’s processes , development tools , source code control , coding standards , and more .
All of this adds up to a very costly void that any company needs to fill when key developers jump ship .
Far too frequently a manager or executive will get caught up in the mindset that the salespeople are the most important cogs in the machine .
After all , the sales people are the ones bringing in the money , right ?
Well , yes and no .
Sales people are important , and a good sales staff is essential , but if you have no developers to build the product , what will the sales people sell ?
It sounds simple , but I ’ve been involved with far too many companies where sales people are treated like gold and developers are treated more like rusty iron .
Whether your organization is sales - oriented or not , if you depend on your software developers for success , you might be missing opportunities because of unplanned turnover that could have been avoided .
So the question then becomes :
How can you avoid developer turnover and keep key team members on staff for lengthy periods of time ?
Well , there ’s no simple answer , but I ’ve got some ideas to share with you .
All situations are different , and there are countless reasons why people may or may not seek a change .
I ’ll discuss the top three reasons why developers tend to look for greener pastures .
Considering these three areas and making some adjustments may help you hold on to key pieces of your puzzle .
Money
Easily one of the biggest issues that causes developers to look elsewhere is probably the first issue which causes managers to cringe .
That ’s right , most developers are just like everybody else in that they too exclaim the immortal words of Jerry Maguire , “ Show me the money ! ”
Unfortunately , most developers are painfully aware that the best way to get a raise is to simply get a new job .
A developer might be happy in all aspects of her job , but if she knows that her company is paying her below market rates , that fact might outweigh all the good .
There are few companies that are willing to give a good , yet underpaid , developer a raise that will exceed what the developer could get by jumping ship and landing in a new job elsewhere .
I know what you ’re thinking .
You ca n’t possibly afford to pay all your developers enough money to compete with any offer that may be out there on the horizon .
So what is the solution then ?
It ’s a good idea to ensure that all development team members are paid a competitive rate , but the key is to identify a small portion of your development staff as people who you decide to invest in long term , and to take care of them in a way that will make them never want to leave for monetary reasons .
There are numerous ways to let a developer know that you are interested in working with him long term , and not all of them involve monetary rewards .
Any kind of additional “ perk ” goes a long way towards making people happy .
These can involve non-liquid monetary assets such as stock options as well as perks like telecommuting , free lunches / snacks / sodas , good hardware , other gadgets ( cell phones , PDAs ) and so forth .
Keep in mind that many developers are “ geeks ” and often a cool PDA or a sweet workstation can go a long ways in this department .
There is a catch here , however .
While these kinds of incentives can go a long way towards pleasing employees , nothing can harm morale faster than broken promises .
That is , promising a bonus is great , but if the money is n’t available , or the rules are changed midstream , and the developers end up not getting the promised bonus , it does far more harm than never having promised a bonus in the first place .
Make sure that whatever you commit to is feasible and that you follow through with the promise .
Morale
If a good developer leaves the company for a reason that does n’t directly involve money , it is often some type of morale problem — one that may be more widespread than you think .
If people are n’t happy where they work , they will often leave for equal — or even less — pay elsewhere .
There are a few key things , especially when dealing with software developers , that can go a long ways towards keeping people happy and in turn , keeping them on your payroll .
I believe the biggest morale - related factor that causes good developers to look elsewhere boils down to the need for a new challenge .
Part of the problem with keeping a developer challenged is inherent in the way software projects are run .
For example , developers tend to learn on two different curves when landing a new development job which are pictured in Figure 1 below .
Figure 1 : Developer Learning Curves .
The dotted line represents the progression a developer ’s rate of learning and enhancing his or her technical skills .
When first hired , a developer learns at a rapid rate .
This is due to working with new people , new processes , new tools ( possibly new development languages ) , working with existing architectures , and so on .
At a certain point , that learning curve begins to level out because the developer becomes familiar with the work , the tools , the languages , etc .
At this stage the work can become a bit more routine and monotonous .
The solid line represents the rate at which the developer acquires domain knowledge while working on a given project .
For example , if a developer starts a new job in the public library domain , that developer will begin learning more and more about the operation and nuances of public libraries .
This curve tends to not level out as much or possibly not at all due to the fact that even though a software project may be released and completed , future research is spent on finding out ways to improve library operations and other user - related features that could be a selling point for the product .
As you can see from the graph , there is a certain point at which a developer starts learning more about the domain and not learning much , if anything , new technically .
For many developers this may not be an issue , but for other developers this can result in a loss of interest in the company , the product , or their job as a whole .
A developer may be seeking to improve their skills , and not care as much about domain specific knowledge .
If that is the case , this is the point at which a developer can become dissatisfied with his job and look on to bigger and better horizons .
The development of this situation is natural , but detecting it and doing something about it can be difficult .
Get to know each of your talented developers individually and find out their career goals and desires .
Each person is different , but a general theme you will encounter is that you need to keep your good developers technically challenged .
Actually keeping them challenged is the difficult part .
How to best go about it really depends on the individual developer — what challenges they seek and what motivates them individually .
By getting to know your developers , you will learn numerous ways that you can try to keep the technology learning curve from leveling out .
All developers are different and different things inspire and motivate them .
Find out what each person ’s motivating factor is , and then keep your good developers where they want to be .
You may even find that some of your best developers will actually prefer working on an existing project with familiar code as opposed to working on a new project with new technologies .
Try to keep your good developers working on projects they enjoy — whether that be an existing project a person has worked on for a long time , or a brand new system that needs to be designed , or something in between .
Moving developers to new projects can be difficult because as developers build up domain and project knowledge , your first instinct is to keep them on that project and hire new developers to work on new projects .
While that sounds like a good idea , it may or may not be the best solution for your developers and / or your company .
What often happens is employers will keep proven developers on existing projects and hire unproven ones to spearhead new projects .
While this may make sense from a business perspective in the short term , in the longer term — after the unproven new hire fails to develop a good product and the proven developer quits from boredom — it may not turn out so well .
When changing projects is not an option , there are also a number of other ways to allow developers to flex their brains now and then .
These can include offering training opportunities to train people on the latest technical tools , sending people to technical conferences or workshops , offering tuition reimbursement to allow developers to continue their educations , giving good developers the go - ahead to analyze and re-work existing architectures , and so on .
Be creative and let developers know that they are allowed and encouraged to further their own careers and not just your projects .
The bottom line here is to identify your good developers , the ones that you want to have around for a long time , and find out where they want to be and what they want to be doing .
Work with them to make them happy and to keep the company moving forward .
Even when you ’re not able to take the actions you ’d like to take , simply pulling a developer aside and taking the time to find out what makes him or her happy goes a long way , in and of itself , towards building good morale .
Burnout
Finally , I ’ll address the third major reason why developers tend to switch jobs : burnout .
Software development is a tedious business and a difficult task for all involved .
As projects near completion , work life is full of meetings , disorganization , overtime , and stress .
Even the standard day for a good developer is full of heavy thinking , problem solving , frustrating compilation errors , and the like .
Software development is not your standard “ sit at your desk ” job .
It ’s the equivalent of taking a difficult test 8 hours a day , 5 days a week ( plus overtime ) .
Burnout is a real issue and something that faces nearly every developer at some time in their career .
Often the thought is to change careers completely and get away from it all .
Some look to management positions , hoping for less stress .
More often than not , however , the “ solution ” is to look elsewhere for a new job thinking the immortal words , “ it ca n’t possibly be this bad over there . ”
The biggest thing that managers need to be able to do in order to prevent burnout is to allow their employees to have fun .
This is a very hard thing for a lot of development managers to do .
Taking 15 minutes to a half hour out of the day to have fun will seem superfluous to many .
But there is so much that can be accomplished in a simple activity that may last only as long as your average smoke break .
A team that has fun together is much more likely to work together well , enjoy working with each other and help each other .
Job satisfaction is increased when there is something other than work to look forward to as well .
The mental drain of a tough day of debugging can severely be lightened by a few minutes of entertainment .
What kinds of activities am I talking about ?
That ’s up to you .
People are different and different things work for different people so there is n’t any one clear answer to that question .
Many developers are computer gaming geeks as well so a quick match of Warcraft III or Unreal Tournament can serve to refresh a developer almost as well as a good nights sleep .
Others do n’t enjoy PC gaming , but will welcome other things , like a quick game of HORSE on the Nerf basketball hoop in the hallway .
One company set aside a few minutes every Friday morning for miniature golf .
Every person was responsible for setting up a miniature golf hole in their cubicle and then the team played a round of golf .
Another company had a racing course setup in an unused conference room for Friday office chair races .
Some companies have parties and luncheons to raise employee morale and give employees and occasional break .
Be creative and come up with something that will be entertaining for the team members while also being constructive toward building team morale and keeping everybody energized for the work ahead .
Keep in mind that it is far better to offer an activity that costs less and free to employees than to offer something more lavish and charge employees an admission fee .
For a team morale building exercise , nothing slaps you in the face as much as a money collector at the front door .
Imagine being that one employee that is just making it paycheck to paycheck and is then excluded from work activities because of the cover charge .
Not many things can destroy morale as quickly as that .
Conclusion
There are many other reasons why developers would lean towards moving on to greener pastures , but I ’ve touched on some of the biggest ones .
What this all really boils down to is managing a public relations campaign within your own organization in an effort to win over ( and keep ) your employees .
However , before looking to big , broad , expensive gestures and top - down morale improvement initiatives , look at the simple things first .
Things like getting to know your employees personally , using common sense in operations , and finding out what employees want from you and your company can go a long , long way towards helping you keep good people working hard in your organization .

About Dabo
Current Status Dabo is currently in maintenance mode .
Some initial steps at porting to Python 3 have been made , and things generally run OK , but not perfectly ( yet ! ) .
If you 'd like to help out , please let us know .
Desktop applications .
That 's what Dabo does .
It 's not YAWF ( yet another web framework ) .
There are plenty of excellent web frameworks out there , so if that 's what you are looking for , Dabo is n't for you .
But there are almost no desktop application frameworks out there , and if you want to create applications that run on Windows , OS X or Linux , Dabo is for you !
Dabo is a 3 - tier , cross - platform application development framework , written in Python atop the wxPython GUI toolkit .
And while Dabo is designed to create database - centric apps , that is not a requirement .
Lots of people are using Dabo for the GUI tools to create apps that have no need to connect to a database at all .
Background Dabo's authors , Ed Leafe and Paul McNett , have strong backgrounds in database application development using the awesome and underrated Microsoft Visual Fox Pro development environment .
While Visual FoxPro shines at developing data - centric applications , it has one limitation that cannot be ignored : it only runs on Microsoft Windows , and Ed and Paul both have clients that want their applications to run on Linux and Macintosh .
We are sure we are not alone in this regard : it is a multi- platform world with more diverse needs than one vendor can fulfill .
Ed and Paul got to talking one day : Paul had been researching various multiplatform GUI toolkits for about 18 months , and Ed has lots of experience developing the Visual Fox Pro Codebook framework .
We decided to work together to make a framework for developing robust data - centric applications for multi-platform deployment .
We 've come up with a design that is simple , flexible , and robust , and we 've begun developing our own client applications using the Dabo framework .
3 - Tier Design
We have taken what we 've learned from 25 combined years of Fox Pro database application development , and built an easy - to - use runtime framework that runs on all three major platforms .
Dabo consists of 3 logical tiers plus an umbrella application object .
The three tiers are :
Database MySQL ( already supported )
PostgreSQL ( already supported )
Firebird ( already supported )
MS - SQL and MSDE ( already supported )
SQLite ( already supported )
Oracle
DB2
Sybase
Berkeley DB
Business Objects
This tier is where all the business logic resides .
You simply subclass dBizobj , set a few properties , and override a few methods .
The dBizobj communicates with the database tier and the user interface tier , and enforces your business rules to your specifications .
This tier is where all the business logic resides .
You simply subclass dBizobj , set a few properties , and override a few methods .
The dBizobj communicates with the database tier and the user interface tier , and enforces your business rules to your specifications .
User Interface
You create your forms by laying out various controls or widgets , and setting properties to tell Dabo what bizobj and what field in the dataset the control represents .
There is no business logic at this level , and only minimal code will be entered here : it is mostly laying out your UI design and setting properties to tell Dabo how to connect to the business rules .
Multi-Platform Dabo applications are known to run on all flavors of Windows , all recent flavors of Linux , and Macintosh OS X 10.2 or higher .
Because Dabo is currently built on top of wxPython , which is built on top of wxWidgets , it probably runs elsewhere , too .
It also suffers from the same display limitations on some platforms ( most notably OS X ) , but these should improve as the underlying toolkits improve .
You can develop Dabo applications on all three supported platforms , and you can run your Dabo applications on all three supported platforms .
Flexibility is a really good thing .
A Mighty Heart
Angelina Jolie plays Mariane Pearl in Michael Winterbottom ’s docudrama about the kidnapping and murder of her husband , the journalist Daniel Pearl .
After United 93 and several other pointless exercises in dramatizing the “ War on Terror , ” you might ask : why bother ?
We all know what happened to Daniel Pearl– what ’s the use in rehashing the story ?
Is the agony of a pregnant widow - to - be really worth sitting through , even if it ’s portrayed by an A - list movie star ?
Fortunately , Michael Winterbottom , the prolific and versatile talent behind The Road to Guantanomo , 9 Songs , and Tristram Shandy , supplies a convincing answer .
As journalists , the Pearls believed that open dialogue would lead to better understanding .
Unlike United 93 , which was devoid of context and took liberties with known facts , A Mighty Heart , based on Mariane Pearl ’s book , constantly refers to events before and after , to people ’s motivations , to reasons , arguments , and possible explanations .
The film is dedicated to the Pearl ’s son Adam , and like the child that never met his father , we have much to gain from a better understanding of the complexities of what happened , and why .
In films like In This World and The Road to Guantanomo , Michael Winterbottom has perfected a semi- documentary style of filmmaking that relies on real locations , small crews , and serendipity to achieve an immediacy that ’s rarely seen on the screen .
A Mighty Heart was shot in Pakistan , and the presence of Angelina Jolie , in a wig and sans make - up , rarely distracts from the sense that we ’re watching real events .
From the teeming streets of Karachi , where Daniel ( Dan Futterman ) is last seen taking a cab to the guarded house where Mariane anxiously awaits his return , the texture of the film is full of impressionistic details that we could n’t have gathered from the news .
For some reason I can’t quite explain , I was especially touched by the way Daniel holds the microphone of his hands - free headset up to his mouth when he speaks to his wife .
The film narrates , from Mariane ’s perspective , the days after Daniel ’s disappearance on the way to a dicey interview on January 23 , 2002 until his death is confirmed nearly a month later .
The Pearl house quickly turns into the headquarters for the uneasy alliance of Pakistani and American agencies who are conducting a hectic search , along with journalists and editors from the Wall Street Journal .
Emails and documents are searched for clues .
A whiteboard fills with a tangled web of contacts , fixers , and mysterious sheiks .
Pearl ’s Indian colleague Asra ( Archie Panjabi ) is a accused of being an Indian spy .
A chef is brought in to keep pregnant Mariane well - fed .
Colin Powell announces that negotiating with terrorists is out of the question for the U.S. government .
Suspects are taken into custody and interrogated .
Mariane gives an interview on CNN but refuses to cry .
A Pakistani toddler plays in the yard , his arms hennaed with curly patterns .
The movie ’s frantic bustle releases into an explosion of grief when Mariane finds out what we already know .
A Mighty Heart opens next Friday .
A Mighty Heart .

Cheney 's office implies it has executive privilege of its own Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday July 18 , 2007 Print This Email This Enjoy this story ?

Weeks after claiming that it was not a part of the executive branch , the Office of Vice President Dick Cheney appears to be readying an independent assertion of executive privilege .
The move emerged in an exchange of letters with the Senate Judiciary Committee , which granted an extension for the White House to comply with a subpoena on documents related to President George W. Bush 's domestic spying program .
Counsel to the Vice President Shannen Coffin appeared to imply that Cheney 's office may assert executive privilege after it finishes reviewing documents that are responsive to the committee 's subpoena .
The documents are due today .
" While the Office of the Vice President reserves legal protections that apply in this matter , we look forward to working to meet the Committee 's needs for information and on legislative matters to protect the Nation , " Coffin wrote .
Coffin 's letter to the committee came with a similar letter from White House Counsel Fred Fielding .
In contrast , Fielding 's letter made no reference to any kind of ' legal protections ' or executive privilege .
Cheney 's attorney also seemed to suggest the President and Vice President 's offices were on the same plane .
" We continue our efforts to identify documents responsive to the subpoena and request an extension of time for response to the subpoena parallel to that afforded to the Office of the President , " she wrote .
Fielding , who is Bush 's attorney , contacted Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) to inform him that an extension on compliance was needed because of the wide variety of documents that needed to be reviewed .
" Since June 27 , we have been working diligently to assess your requests and identify and collect documents responsive to the subpoenas , " he wrote .
" However , it has become clear that we will not be able to come close to completing our review process by the July 18 return date . "
Leahy said he was willing to grant the extension .
" The Judiciary Committee is willing to accommodate reasonable requests and to work with the Administration on its response to these subpoenas , " Senator Leahy said in a statement responding to the request .
" I hope the White House uses this additional time constructively to finish gathering the relevant information and then works with us in good faith on ways to provide it so that we will have the information we need to conduct effective oversight at long last . "
The committee issued subpoenas late last month to the President , Vice President , and the National Security Council for the legal authorizations underlying the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping efforts , known also as the ' Terrorist Surveillance Program . '
When the committee authorized the subpoenas , they passed on a 13 - 3 vote .
Leahy did not appear to set a subsequent deadline for compliance .
The letters , and Leahy 's full statement , can be accessed at the Senator 's website .
Telecommuting provides employees with the flexibility and quiet they need to optimize their productivity .
Plus , it offers employers opportunities to save money and recruit workers from a more geographically diverse — and potentially cheaper — talent pool .
For IT professionals , telecommuting is certainly the best work / life option .
However , working from home is n't always easy for individuals or employers .
For telecommuting arrangements to work for both parties , employees need to be self - motivated , have access to the necessary technology ( such as a high - speed Internet connection and a VPN ) , and clearly define job duties that can be accomplished remotely .
At the same time , employers need to make their teleworkers feel like they 're a part of the team , integrate telecommuters into workflows and judge employee productivity by results rather than visual cues .

Financial Questions for Telecommuters and Managers
How to Negotiate a Flexible Work Schedule
But too often , IT management does n't understand the key issues that can affect productivity and team morale .
Managers can make painful and expensive errors even when their hearts are in the right place .
If you get telecommuting right , you 'll have a crew of independent technologists who get their jobs done efficiently ; if not , you 'll create dissension , distrust and workflow confusion .
You do n't have to repeat others ' expensive mistakes .
In this article , CIO.com presents input that several telecommuting IT professionals shared via e-mail about the benefits the practice brings to the enterprise , processes that help remote workers interact with other team members , and the irritations that twist telecommuters ' shorts in a knot .
Here 's what your employees truly want you to know about telecommuting .
Telecommuters also need to adopt techniques for working at home , both to keep their sanity and to move their career along .
See the accompanying article , Telecommuters Need to Develop Special Skills , for guidance on that subject .
1. Telecommuting Saves Money .
Truly .
Companies have the potential to benefit financially in a number of ways from supporting telecommuters .
First , fewer people in the corporate office means companies save money on such expenses as rent , furniture and facilities maintenance .
Second , companies open to hiring remote workers benefit from wider — and potentially cheaper — pools of applicants .
They can hire qualified workers without regard to their geographic location .
For example , a San Francisco Bay - area company can find a top - notch programmer to telecommute from Oklahoma for far less than the company would pay a local developer confronting Bay - area housing costs .
This " more diverse pool of applicants " includes disabled citizens , 70 percent of whom are unemployed , primarily due to the lack of accessible transportation to the workplace , especially in rural areas , according to Ed Dodds , a systems architecture consultant , who telecommutes for several different companies that have retained his services .
" Working from home offices outfitted with assistive technologies via broadband and VPN ' virtually ' eliminates this barrier , " he says .
Finally , a telecommuting bill in Congress , introduced by Sen. Sam Brownback ( R - Kan. ) and Rep. Lee Terry ( R - Neb . ) , promises tax incentives for employers who support remote workers .
The Parents ' Tax Relief
Act of 2007 suggests a vastly simplified home office deduction ( $ 2,500 or the profit from the home - based business , whichever is less ) and a telecommuting tax credit for employers of up to $ 2,400 per telecommuter .
In addition , employers that provide telecommuters with computers and broadband access equipment can write off the expense .
If it passes , this bill may make telecommuting more attractive to employers .
2. Telecommuters Really Can Be More Productive
One of the biggest barriers to telecommuting is convincing the boss that working remotely is not the same thing as slacking off .
Unfortunately , many managers are sure that someone who is n't visible is n't working , which creates a taboo around telecommuting .
ONLINE POLL
Do your workers telecommute ?
Take our poll , Road Rules : Telecommuting , and see how others have voted .
Katie Albers , a user experience consultant and project manager , wishes IT managers would get over their conviction that " face time = productivity . "
That just is n't so , she says .
" I 've telecommuted and worked in an office and in a cubicle farm .
I know that I got my best work done fastest when I telecommuted .
I could take breaks when my brain stopped being productive .
If the plumber came , it took 15 minutes to deal with him , not 45 minutes to get home , an hour and a half to stand around while I waited for the work to be done , and another 45 minutes to get back to work . "
Like Albers , most telecommuters believe they are far more productive at home than in the office .
Why ?
It 's quieter , with fewer interruptions .
The dozens of remote workers queried for this story repeatedly underscored this point .
Gloria Willadsen , a freelance UNIX application and embedded systems developer , says her productivity at home is double to triple what it is in the office because of the calm her home affords .
" I do heavy algorithm programming , and I need silence while this is happening .
We do n't have silence in our office , but in my home , I have places of perfect peace . "
Working from the comfort and quiet of home does n't mean telecommuters have to completely detach themselves from the rest of the team .
In fact , for telecommuting to work for the company — and for telecommuters to squash the idea that they 're goofing off watching Oprah during work hours — they have to be , and importantly appear to be accessible .
For that matter , it takes a particular kind of worker to be a successful telecommuter .
3. Telecommuting Does n't Work for Every Individual
Happy telecommuters are the first to tell you that the lifestyle is not for everyone .
Telecommuters need to be self - starters .
They need to find alternate ways to interact with peers , and they must believe that the advantages ( such as working with a cat on one 's lap ) far outweigh the disadvantages ( such as missing out on those " brownies in the second - floor kitchen " e-mail messages , or at least on the brownies themselves ) .
Some managers are resistant to home - based work arrangements because of a bad experience they had in the past .
They may have let someone work from home who lacked the necessary self - motivation to telecommute and were burned by it .
IT professionals who telecommute wish IT managers understood that one bad experience should n't be a reason to prohibit it entirely .
" Different people thrive in different environments , " says Kimberly Kohler , a Chicago - area manager and software developer .
" Just because telecommuting does n't work for you ( or your wife , husband , sister , best friend ) does n't mean it can't work for anyone . "
One apparent solution is to view telecommuting as a reward for productive office workers .
However , it does n't work that way .
Some people need the hustle and bustle of an office environment to function at their best and would pine away from loneliness when " rewarded " by working from home .
Instead , telecommuting is simply an option that needs to make sense to the IT professional who is aware of the best environment to inspire his productivity .
Steve O'Hara - Smith , a UNIX developer with 27 years in the trade , wants managers to make telecommuting an easy choice whenever it 's feasible , instead of " requiring extraordinary circumstances " before permitting it .
Telecommuting should n't be limited to situations in which the office is flooded , the IT professional breaks a leg and can't drive , or a railroad strike keeps people from getting to company headquarters .
The only reason why O'Hara - Smith could begin telecommuting was that he faced his own extraordinary circumstances — family health problems .
" Now that I am established telecommuting , and everyone is happy with the work I do , there is no pressure to stop it , " he says .
4. Trust Your People
Emotionally , trust is a key issue for telecommuters .
Its absence or presence makes a major difference in a telecommuter 's morale .
Melanie Archer , a freelance website developer in the San Francisco Bay area , says employers need to treat their telecommuters with respect .
" You 've hired a grown - up professional who knows how to manage her time .
If you treat her like a high school truant , she will seek other employment , " says Archer .
Kohler , the Chicago - based software developer , agrees that trust is critical to successful telecommuting arrangements .
It took years of pushing , but she finally got permission to work from home two days a week .
Unfortunately , her boss agreed grudgingly , and it shows in his behavior .
" This definitely affects my morale when working from home or the office .
I have been with the company 11 years and am well respected and trusted , yet I feel my telecommuting arrangement is met with suspicion , which makes me feel undervalued . "
5. Hone Management Skills for Telecommuting
Telecommuting is a true test of a manager 's skill .
It 's hard enough to measure employee output when the individual is in the office ; now supervisors need to add the complexity of doing it from a distance .
And not every manager possesses the necessary skills for keeping tabs on telecommuters .
Elizabeth Ross , director of technology projects execution at AMEC Earth & Environmental , has telecommuted and managed telecommuters .
She sees a direct relationship between the strength of a manager and the telecommuting experience .
" Managers who know how to manage resources , subcontractors , etc. , can make the situation work , sometimes exceptionally , " she says .
" Managers who do n't communicate well , [ who ] do n't know how to manage their own time well , etc. , do n't get around to checking in or managing the telecommuter very well ( if at all ) . "
It 's that latter kind of manager ( e.g. , the inept manager ) who 's typically the least supportive of telecommuting , according to Ross , because the work arrangement highlights the manager 's weaknesses and requires him or her to improve or change his or her style .
For that reason , user experience consultant Albers suggests that only managers " who have demonstrated extraordinary organization and leadership abilities " should be allowed to manage telecommuters .
Across the board , telecommuters agree that managers should focus on results .
Focus on managing the work rather than the workers , they say .
It 's important for managers who supervise telecommuters to clearly communicate a well - organized concept of tasks and target deadlines and their interdependencies .
That is , do n't just give the teleworker an assignment and due date ; make sure he knows its context in the project and where this task fits in its critical path .
Focusing on output is not simply a matter of looking for people who fail to produce .
It means being attuned to how people get work done .
For example , if a telecommuter finishes a project before the deadline , the employee 's manager should find out if the employee is ready to start on a new task or if she just spent a lot of time up front to have a couple of days free to do something else .
Someone who always meets deadlines early is obviously capable of working faster , a fact that can be used in planning ( and rewarded with additional compensation to acknowledge her capability ) .
By contrast , if someone is missing deadlines , the manager needs to identify the root cause of the problem ; do n't just assume employee incompetence .
6. Keep the Telecommuter in the Loop
With all that focus on tasks , do n't lose track of telecommuters ' human needs — especially if they rarely have the opportunity to interact with the rest of the staff .
That means taking the time to wish them a happy birthday ( even if just by e-mail ) , expressing concern for problems they encounter and sharing in their joys .
Do whatever you can , in small or large ways , to make telecommuters part of the team .
Lisa Curhan , an operations engineering manager at Sun Microsystems , telecommutes two or three times a month and manages other telecommuters .
She recommends that managers require a telecommuter to get a reasonable amount of face - to - face contact with the manager and the rest of the team to afford the type of communication that can be missed by telephone .
" For my staff , they ( without my prompting ) make sure they are in person for the weekly staff meeting and some key engineering meetings , " she says .
" If the telecommuter is quite remote , this need would probably be met by a quarterly in - person session .
Although some telecommuters only meet yearly in person with their managers , that would n't be my preference . "
Curhan also advises managers to set up regular one - on - one phone meetings — not for the purpose of micromanaging , she says , but to ensure that concerns about the remote management are aired .
Regular meetings , whether face to face or over the phone , give managers an opportunity to connect with their remote employees and provide mentoring , feedback or training .
Last week , the falafel - loving Bill O'Reilly declared a jihad against " the " Daily Kos , declaring it a hate site on par with the Nazis and the KKK .
And in keeping with his non-existent journalistic standards , he produced random posts that he mined from the thousands of comments made here every day ... check that .
He had had some low - level intern search for examples of hate from the thousands of comments made here every day and presented them as representative of Daily Kos .
Well , what 's good for the goose is good for the fried balls of spiced fava beans .
Here , presented for your consideration , are some deep thoughts from the denizens of billoreillydotcom , and following the logic of Bill O'Reilly , it means that :
Bill O'Reilly advocates an armed rebellion against our government :
Harry Reid playing politics ?
I wonder who 's pulling his strings ...
I am ready for the new surge .
Oh Keep your guns loaded .
Mine are .
If she wins which hopefully she wo n't .
My guns are loaded for the revolt are yours ??
President Hillary Rodham Clinton no way I am keeping my guns loaded if she is elected because there will be a civil war .
Bill O'Reilly thinks that President Bill Clinton will have Barack Obama murdered :
Is the US ready for a black President ?
You forget Hillary !
Obama should be in a car accident , or fall off a balcony , in about 6 months !
He 's dealing with Bill Clinton , who wants that Power back !
It 'll be interesting to watch what happens !
Bill O'Reilly believes that Barack Obama is unfit for any office because he is a closet Muslim :
Is the US ready for a black President ?
The question should be , during a time of war with terrorism , Is America ready for a MUSLIM president ?
Barak Hussein OBAMA .. it is the pride of Muslims to name their children OSAMA .. and the closest thing to OSAMA is OBAMA ...
Please ....
They will have pulled of the biggest HUDNA of all ... a MUSLIM president right under our noses .. in front of our eyes .. while he denies he 's a Muslim , he belongs to a very unconventional " christian " church .
A closer study of the man , his backers and his history should PREVENT him from ever holding HIGHER offices ...
lvs
And finally , Bill O'Reilly believes that all Democrats are the " death party people " :
They hate children - abortion - sexual perverts - hate the military thus hate us and the US .
Shocking , but true .
Bill O'Reilly advocates the violent overthrow of our government , believes that a former President of the United States is planning a murder , feels that a sitting Senator is unfit for any office because he is a fake Christian , and that millions of Americans are members of a party of death .
It must be true , because after all , it was posted at his website .
Update by kos : John Aravosis posted along similar lines , and thanks to his post and the efforts of blogger Lane Hudson , Bill O'Reilly 's anti-Hillary threats ( which are his according to his own standards ) are now being investigated by the Secret Service .
George Orwell Describes The Right Wing Blurghosphere
The Scott Beauchamp affair is reminding me of this , from 1984 :
A Party member ... is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors , triumph over victories , and self - abasement before the power and wisdom of the Party .
The discontents produced by his bare , unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes Hate , and the speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline ... called , in Newspeak , crimestop .
Crimestop means the faculty of stopping short , as though by instinct , at the threshold of any dangerous thought .
It includes the power of not grasping analogies , of failing to perceive logical errors , of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc , and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction .
Crimestop , in short , means protective stupidity .
At first it seems amazing that Orwell could have precisely described today 's right - wing blurgh world sixty years ago .
But the right - wing blurghs are just an outgrowth of human nature , which never changes .
( In particular I 'm always been struck by the consistency with which such people are unable to understand analogies . )

This image shows a very dark spot on an otherwise bright dusty lava plain to the northeast of Arsia Mons , one of the four giant Tharsis volcanoes .
This is not an impact crater as it lacks a raised rim or ejecta .
What 's amazing is that we cannot see any detail in the shadow !
Here we see this dark spot and a version that is “ enhanced ” to view the darkest area , yet we still cannot see details except noise .
The HiRISE camera is very sensitive and we can see details in almost any shadow on Mars , but not here .
We also can not see the deep walls of the pit .
The best interpretation is that this is a collapse pit into a cavern or at least a pit with overhanging walls .
We cannot see the walls because they are either perfectly vertical and extremely dark or , more likely , overhanging .
The pit must be very deep to prevent detection of the floor from skylight , which is quite bright on Mars .

Forged Credentials and Security
In Beyond Fear , I wrote about the difficulty of verifying credentials .
Here ’s a real story about that very problem :
When Frank Coco pulled over a 24 - year - old carpenter for driving erratically on Interstate 55 , Coco was furious .
Coco was driving his white Chevy Caprice with flashing lights and had to race in front of the young man and slam on his brakes to force him to stop .
Coco flashed his badge and shouted at the driver , Joe Lilja : “ I ’m a cop and when I tell you to pull over , you pull over , you motherf — – ! ”
Coco punched Lilja in the face and tried to drag him out of his car .
But Lilja was n’t resisting arrest .
He was n’t even sure what he ’d done wrong .
“ I thought , ‘ Oh my God , I ca n’t believe he ’s hitting me , ’ ” Lilja recalled .
It was only after Lilja sped off to escape — leading Coco on a tire - squealing , 90 - mph chase through the southwest suburbs — that Lilja learned the truth .
Coco was n’t a cop at all .
He was a criminal .
There ’s no obvious way to solve this .
This is some of what I wrote in Beyond Fear :
Authentication systems suffer when they are rarely used and when people are n’t trained to use them . [ … ]
Imagine you ’re on an airplane , and Man A starts attacking a flight attendant .
Man B jumps out of his seat , announces that he ’s a sky marshal , and that he ’s taking control of the flight and the attacker .
( Presumably , the rest of the plane has subdued Man A by now . )
Man C then stands up and says : “ Do n’t believe Man B .
He ’s not a sky marshal .
He ’s one of Man A ’s cohorts .
I ’m really the sky marshal . ”
What do you do ?
You could ask Man B for his sky marshal identification card , but how do you know what an authentic one looks like ?
If sky marshals travel completely incognito , perhaps neither the pilots nor the flight attendants know what a sky marshal identification card looks like .
It does n’t matter if the identification card is hard to forge if person authenticating the credential does n’t have any idea what a real card looks like . [… ]
Many authentication systems are even more informal .
When someone knocks on your door wearing an electric company uniform , you assume she ’s there to read the meter .
Similarly with deliverymen , service workers , and parking lot attendants .
When I return my rental car , I do n’t think twice about giving the keys to someone wearing the correct color uniform .
And how often do people inspect a police officer ’s badge ?
The potential for intimidation makes this security system even less effective .

The government offered drillers lucrative “ royalty relief , ” a holiday from the standard 12 percent royalty , as an incentive to increase exploration and production in waters that were thousands of feet deep .
But as a result of what investigators believe was bureaucratic bumbling , the leases for 1998 and 1999 omitted a standard escape clause that rescinded the special inducements if oil prices climbed above $ 34 a barrel .
Midlevel officials at Interior spotted the omission in 2000 , and quietly made sure to include the escape clause in all subsequent leases .
But no one tried to fix the leases that had already been signed , and almost no one talked about them until oil prices started to climb above $ 34 a barrel in 2004 .
At a hearing of the House Government Reform Committee last September , Ms. Burton testified that she had first learned about the problem in late 2005 or January 2006 .
Ms. Burton and other senior officials publicly confirmed the error in February 2006 , after The New York Times published an article about it .
But investigators have unearthed a series of e-mail messages by officials working under Ms. Burton in March 2004 .
At the time , energy prices had recently climbed above the thresholds that were supposed to stop the incentives , and oil companies were pressing the Interior Department to confirm how it would treat the leases from 1998 and 1999 .
Marshall Rose , chief economist for the Minerals Management Service , wrote the agency ’s associate director at the time , Thomas Readinger , that the decision had to be made by the “ directorate ” — Ms. Burton and her top deputies .
Mr. Rose told Mr. Readinger that he believed the leases entitled companies to the incentive regardless of oil price levels , and that he had told his own subordinates that “ you and the director were aware of the need to make a decision on this matter . ”
Mr. Readinger , who retired last year , responded to Mr. Rose a few hours later by writing , “ Sounds like we have an answer .
Let ’s go with it . ”

If it was really engineering , then you could apply known engineering techniques .
If software development was a matter of producing models , then you could spend your money developing models .
However , it is none of those .
Software development is a " game " , a game of speed and cooperation within your team , in competition against other teams .
It is a game against time , and a game for mind - share .
You should spend your money to win that game .
Viewing software development as a game gives you better ideas on where to spend your money , how to structure your teams , and how they should allocate their efforts .
It 's a fascinating , thought - provoking article on the essential nature of software development .
I can now see why Bill de hra calls Cockburn " the agile world 's best kept secret . "
I 've only quoted the conclusion ; I urge you read the complete article to get a full explanation of Cockburn 's rationale behind the game analogy .
This game model of software development has stood me in good stead recently , as I evaluate military software projects and open - source software development .
In some of the military software projects , what we see is predominance of the career and corporate - enhancing infinite games .
It is quite clear that delivery of the software is a secondary concern , and growing the company , growing personal influence , or growing the career is what is many people 's minds .
The logic of the funny contractor behavior does n't make sense until you realize they are playing a different game , in which different moves are called for .
Then it suddenly all makes sense - even if you do n't like it .
Open - source development is different because it is not a resource - limited game , nor is it finite and end - point directed .
Linus Torvald did not say , " We 'll make a shippable copy of Linux , and then we can all go home . "
No , Linus is around , and it will evolve .
The game is interesting as long as it is interesting .
Any number of players may show up , and they are not on a time - line .
The game will abandoned as soon as it stops being interesting for the players .
In that sense , it is much more like musicians playing together , or carpet - wrestling , or lego building .
It is a cooperative game that is not directed toward " reaching the goal " , and is not built around managing scant resources .
And so the moves that make sense in open - source development naturally do n't make the same sense for a standard resource - limited , goal - seeking software development project .
The idea that games can inform real world design problems is not a new one ; Damion Schubert 's presentation What Vegas Can Teach MMO Designers is full of similar insight .
Casinos are the original MMORPG spaces , as outlined in Damion 's presentation ( ppt ) .
The concept of software development as a collaborative game appeals to me .
It speaks to a deeper level of engagement in the process than " I get paid to do this . "
We play games because we derive some kind of essential satisfaction from playing them .
You might even say it 's fun -- either the explicit kind , or the implicit kind .
Fun may be more relevant than you think to your project .
Raph Koster is a notable game designer and programmer who writes entire books on the theory of fun .
Take a minute to read Raph 's classic theory of fun ( pdf ) presentation .
What you 'll eventually realize is that designing for fun is n't just important for game developers .
It 's important for all software developers .
Do users want to use your application , or are they forced to use it ?
In a recent ETech07 presentation ( also available as a PDF ) , Raph connects the dots more explicitly .
He deconstructs amazon.com , ebay.com , and linkedin.com for what they really are : massively distributed games .
You 'll want to read the transcript of the talk along with the sides to dig a little deeper into the concepts :
As you accomplish more , there need to be variant challenges .
Connecting to a CEO on Linked In vs. connecting to the pr dude = different .
What you want is for the game to acknowledge the fact that it 's tougher to get on Reed Hoffman 's linkedin rather than someone who sells ads .
Social media is about cooperation , but the core of games is competitive .
As soon as you give people a ladder to climb , they 'll climb it .
Ratings .
Metrics of contribution .
Other people need to see it to measure against it .
Software development is a collaborative game that you play , willingly or not , with your team and your users .
You might say the secret of the game , then , is learning how to play the game so that everyone is having fun .
Warning : no IT angle North Yorkshire police are on a state of high alert after a youth was spotted coupling with an English longhorn cow at a specialist breeder 's farm in Skipwith , The Sun reports .
The lad was clocked at 4.30 am , dressed only in black briefs , by a " shocked " passer - by who interruped proceedings by shouting at the nocturnal bovine botherer .
A 999 call alerted the authorities , but when officers arrived at the scene , the perp had made good his escape .
Farmer Richard Parish also declared himself " shocked " , adding : " English longhorns are lovely animals - but not that lovely .
My mates are having a right laugh and milking it for all it is worth . "
Parish believes he has identified the victim - one of three longhorns on the farm - as Blondie , described as the " friendliest " of the bunch .
The psychological effect on the animal is not noted , but Parish said : " I have got to be much more vigilant .
The cows do n't seem to be spending so much time outside and are happier inside the barn at night . "
Residents of Skipwith , population 300 , do not believe the outrage was committed by a local , and police night - time patrols are " on the alert in case he strikes again " .
They said : " We are treating this matter seriously . " ®

During times of economic hardship , people turn to the road to see if they can make their luck somewhere else .
As such , back in the days of the Great Depression , the U.S. saw an increase in the hobo population .
Walking along long roads or hitching rides on trains , these hobos would travel about , looking for a place where they could get lucky and find a better home .
Of course , such a life of wanderlust was difficult , especially since one has to travel without knowing anything of the landscape or local populace .
To combat this ignorance , the hobos came up with an ingenious sign language to communicate to each other along the way .
This is not like the sign language that hearing - impaired people use to communicate ; rather , it was markings and drawings that hobos would leave along the road for their fellow travelers .
Whether a sign told others of locations of important places in town , the attitudes of the locals to tramps , or the best places to beg , the hobo sign language helped many get by in hard times .
The variety of messages passed between hobos are incredible .
There are some basic traveling symbols such as “ go this way , ” “ do n’t go that way , ” or “ get out fast . ”
Then there ’s praises and warnings of the locals – “ doctor , no charge , ” “ police officer lives here , not kind to tramps , ” “ dangerous neighborhood , ” “ you may sleep in barn . ”
Some of my favorites messages I ’ve heard of are “ good lady lives here , tell a hard luck story , ” “ fake illness here , ” “ road spoiled , full of other hobos . ”
Hobo signs were typically drawn onto utility poles using charcoal or some other type of temporary writing material that would wash out in time with the weather .
Sometimes they would write on railroad trestle abutments , outcropping rocks , or even on houses when referring to those who lived inside .
Billboards , when they first appeared , were also prime places for signs .
When more automobiles , and consequentially more roads , were built , hobos created their own extensive system for charting routes for those who would travel the highway .
The hobo sign language was hardly a formal system , constantly in flux , thus much of the hobo sign language has been lost to time .
The signs had to keep up with new ways of life ( such as the addition of roads ) , and like most languages it had its own dialects in different parts of the country .
Also , the signs were often changed when it became evident that locals were writing hobo signs for their own amusement .
One had to keep meeting up at hobo gathering spots to stay on top of the current system .

Gauging the Bush administration ’s true intentions toward Iran is not easy .
Each week brings a new story that hints at a struggle between the hardliners who ’d like to take down one more point on the Axis of Evil and the realists who prefer one disastrous Middle East conflict at a time .
Given the administration ’s track record , uncoordinated and sporadic attempts by members of Congress to prevent an attack on Iran will restrain it no more than would cobwebs .
Yet Congress does possess the power to stop a war — if it chooses to exercise it .
If we wake up one morning to find cruise missiles flying , the responsibility will not be Bush ’s alone .
It will also belong to a Democratic - controlled Congress that could have acted but decided not to .
What , then , would a serious congressional strategy to block a war with Iran look like ?
Constitutional scholars and congressional staff agree there ’s no one magic answer .
The alarming truth is that 220 years after the adoption of the Constitution , there are few settled answers about what legal powers the executive branch possesses to start a war .
But there are several steps Congress could take to make a war with Iran politically very difficult for the White House .
Unfortunately , the Constitution is n’t much help here .
It does state that Congress alone has the ability to declare war , but precedent , inertia , and technology have eroded this power almost to naught .
( In the age of intercontinental ballistic missiles , the commander in chief can launch an apocalyptic nuclear strike without so much as a courtesy call to the speaker of the House . )
The 1973 War Powers
Act requires the president to “ consult ” Congress before launching military action ; if he does n’t receive further authorization , he must cease operations within 60 days .
But this leaves the door wide open for all sorts of attacks — a massive bombing campaign could certainly be carried out within two months .
Bill Clinton arguably breached the War Powers Act during his 78 - day Kosovo bombing campaign , without consequences .
The limiting factor on a determined president , then , is not whether an attack is legal .
Rather , it is how high a political cost he ’s willing to pay .
Just because Bush can launch an attack on Iran in the absence of congressional action does not mean he can legally do so in contravention of congressional action .
If Congress specifically forbids Bush from attacking Iran , and he does so anyway , it would precipitate a political crisis .
Fortunately , Congress has some powerful tools at its disposal .
Here ’s what it could do :
Cut Off Funding
Congress ’ biggest constitutional bargaining chip is the power of the purse .
It could send an extremely strong message by stipulating in future supplemental defense appropriations bills that none of that money could be spent on attacking Iran .
Freshman Sen. James Webb ( D - Va. ) tried to add such a restriction to the $ 93 billion in supplemental appropriations that went before Congress earlier this year .
There is an inexact precedent for this in the 1982 Boland Amendment , which prohibited U.S. intelligence agencies from covertly spending money to overthrow the Sandinistas in Nicaragua .
The Reagan administration ’s attempts to circumvent this law became the genesis of the Iran - Contra scandal .
The Bush administration might well claim such a requirement was an unconstitutional infringement on the president ’s authority to defend the country and the troops from Iranian “ meddling ” in Iraq , and proceed with an attack on Tehran anyway .
To prevent this , Congress could make such a funding prohibition “ non-severable ” from the rest of the appropriations bill .
This means that if the president ignored that particular section of the bill , the entire bill would become inoperative .
Congress also could prohibit Bush from using any other funds to attack Iran , essentially challenging the administration to blatantly violate federal law .
Close the Loopholes
Both of the Authorizations to Use Military Force ( aumfs ) passed by Congress — in September 2001 for Afghanistan , and October 2002 for Iraq — contain language that might conceivably be used to justify an attack on Iran .
The 2001 aumf authorized the president to use force not just against the perpetrators of 9/11 but also against anyone who “ harbored such organizations or persons . ”
After the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan , Iran arrested several senior members of Al Qaeda .
Though they are apparently being held as bargaining chips with the United States , someone could argue that Iran is in fact “ harboring ” them .
Attacking Iran under the 2002 AUMF , which gave the president power to defend against “ the continuing threat posed by Iraq , ” is even more of a reach .
But squaring that kind of circle is what executive branch lawyers are for .
As a former Bush administration official told me , “ If I had to make the case for war with Iran , I would definitely look to the 2002 authorization .
So that ’s one loophole Congress would want to nail shut . ”
Congress would be prudent to rewrite both AUMFs to explicitly exclude action against Iran .
Get Good Intel
There ’s already been some congressional push - back on the administration ’s murky claims that Iran is behind attacks on American troops in Iraq .
That is a start , but ongoing , aggressive oversight of how the White House is using intelligence about Iran is critical .
The most recent National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iran ’s nuclear capability , completed in 2005 , judged that Tehran could not build a nuclear bomb much earlier than 2015 .
A new NIE is near completion but may be held up by the administration , because its findings will likely echo those of the 2005 NIE and should reflect the CIA ’s reported inability to find conclusive evidence of any Iranian nuclear weapons program .
So , despite what the Bush administration says , there ’s plenty of time to strategize .
The congressional intelligence committees should demand that the new NIE be finished , and then hold high - profile hearings on its findings , with witnesses explaining why there ’s no cause for panic .
Congress could also commission an nie that examines the possible consequences of an American attack on Iran .
Its findings would likely dampen war fever .
Do n’t Get Fooled Again
We now know that in early 2002 , President Bush authorized the CIA to smuggle exiles into Iraq , where they would announce a coup , forcing Saddam to attack them in violation of the southern no - fly zone , and providing the United States with a pretext to invade .
This plot was never executed , but it raises questions about whether the administration might be planning a similar provocation against Iran .
According to The New Yorker ‘s Seymour Hersh , the White House is running clandestine operations in Iran without the legally mandated congressional oversight .
Vice President Cheney and his staff are reportedly avoiding oversight requirements by running the operations through the Pentagon rather than the CIA and using Saudi funding rather than money appropriated by Congress .
Congress must immediately demand answers about what the administration is doing now in Iran .
Only a coordinated congressional effort can uncover the truth and help Americans understand how they could be bamboozled into yet another war .
Of course , the unfortunate reality is that without public pressure , the Democratic leadership is unlikely to take most or even some of these actions .
It does n’t help that Democratic presidential candidates have been echoing the administration ’s refrain that “ all options are on the table ” regarding Iran .
If the Democrats continue to sit tight as the White House decides its next move , the administration will have won the first battle of the next war without firing a single shot .
Robert Masello used to laugh at his parents when he went out to eat with them .
If the restaurant had a menu with pictures , his father would point to any vaguely appealing image .
For his farsighted mother , Mr. Masello , in his teens at the time , would hold the menu up from across the table .
Oh , how the tables have turned .
Now when Mr. Masello , 54 , goes out to restaurants with friends , especially places with lighting that is easy on wrinkles but hard on vision , “ it looks like an all - night study group , ” said Mr. Masello , a novelist in Santa Monica , Calif .
“ We ’re taking off our glasses and rubbing our eyes , hunching over the menus with puzzled expressions , signaling the waiter for flashlights and candles . ”
As baby boomers grope their way through middle age , they are encountering the daily indignities that accompany a downward slide in visual acuity : trying to read a road map in a car at night ; cellphones designed for 20 - year - old eyes ; the minuscule letters on a bottle of aspirin ; nutrition information squeezed onto a bag of peanuts .
And unlike their parents and grandparents , they are not shy about expressing their displeasure , in some cases , taking matters into their own hands or prompting some companies to pay attention .

That is the distilled essence of David Weinberger 's theory about how we create meaning and understanding for ourselves in these times .
Weinberger 's provocatively titled new book , Everything Is Miscellaneous : The Power of the New Digital Disorder , has been widely praised and may take it 's place alongside The Long Tail as an epoch - defining tome .
Weinberger was also a co-author of the notorious boom - era best seller , The Cluetrain Manifesto .
A fellow at Harvard Law School 's Berkman Center for the Internet and Society , Weinberger is now doing a regular podcast for Wired News called The Berkman / Wired Miscellaneous Podcast .
The interview was originally conducted via Skype for NeoFiles .
When I first saw the title of your book — Everything Is Miscellaneous — I immediately thought of my old friend Ted Nelson .
He had a saying : " Everything is deeply intertwingled . "
Sure enough , as I got into the book , you beat me to it .
You actually deal with this quote in the book .
How does Nelson 's idea relate to your idea ?
Nelson 's idea is that the world is intertwingled .
That 's just a great , made - up word that says that things do n't come in neat categories .
Sometimes we need to put things into very strict categories , and we manage to do that .
If you 're working at the Department of Motor Vehicles and somebody comes in with a boat trailer , you 've got to decide :
Does it or does it not belong in the category of licensed vehicles .
We have to make these sorts of decisions .
But that 's not the normal case .
The meaning of most things is linked , loose and ambiguous .
The category systems that we 've had in the past , the taxonomies – each with its experts — have not generally reflected that intertwingularity .
But the web , with its link structure , and with its messy , ungoverned , permission - free link structure , perfectly represents the intertwingularity .
In the world of atoms as opposed to the world of material stuff , it 's easier to make all that intertwingling available .
It seems almost like we 're in a virtual " Six degrees of Kevin Bacon " world .
Everything is six clicks away .
Yes .
The internet works that way .
And there are so many different links and ways to get to things because the significance of our world works that way .
That 's why things on the web have accumulated so many messy , unpredictable links .
Lots of people have seen lots of ways in which things are related , and we can express that on the web .
We do n't have to minimize it .
You know , in a library , a physical book has to go on only one shelf under one category .
That 's not a natural restriction ; a single book is about many different things .
But even when you try to make up for that restriction with the catalog card , which is a very reduced form of meta - data for the book , the size of the card is dictated by the inconvenience of atoms .
The size of the card means that you can't put in very many of those references .
But on the web , everybody can put in his or her own references .
We can have hundreds or millions of references and links and connections of meaning linked to a single resource .
There 's no limit .
So , in some ways , the web reflects better the complexity of the linked nature of the world .
The massive hyperlinked web of correspondences and information that Nelson talked about with his Project Xanadu in the 1960s is happening , but it 's sort of self - assembling .
There 's a sentence in your book that 's unobtrusive — or you might say it 's miscellaneously in the middle of a paragraph somewhere — but I picked it out because it seems to go right to heart of what you 're saying .
This is the quote : " A big part of miscellaneous information contains relationships beyond reckoning . "
I think it's the " contains relationships " part that 's important – because although everything is miscellaneous , we 're not just talking about noisy chaos .
No , we 're not .
I 'm admittedly using the word miscellaneous in a slightly extended sense .
The value is not that it stays miscellaneous , and we can never find or make sense of anything .
Quite the opposite .
It 's all there as potential .
We can mine knowledge and information from it .
But I do n't think that 's all that interesting .
What 's interesting is that we can also discover meaning and its significance — stuff that actually matters to us .
So every time we sort through the stuff , we cut through it and see the connections that are interesting to us .
And depending on what we 're trying to do , we see the world in a new way .
We can now do this quite fluidly , and we 'll get even better at it over .
The order is found by the end user .
A friend of mine has a business and his slogan is " living à la carte " .
That seems to be kind of what we 're doing with information , and so many other things .
Yes , but when you order à la carte , everybody orders individually , based upon their tastes .
I would n't want to leave it there !
The most exciting and important advances in how we 're making sense of this miscellaneous soup is that we 're doing it socially .
We 're doing it through social networks ; through recommendations from our friends , from sites that do that more formally ; and from what shows up in our inbox .
So this is not the Daily Me constituting the world based on our own individual interests .
It 's the " Daily Bunch - of - Us . "
It 's loosely defined groups of people making this happen .
So this is not the wisdom of the individual or the wisdom of the crowds , but the wisdom of small social networks ?
Yeah .
It 's the wisdom of the group .
The crowd actually turns out to be quite lumpy .
We know some people better ...
I know that this person over here is really useful and knowledgeable about FCC rulings , but I would n't ask about cars !
But this other person loves talking about cars .
In Ethan Zuckerman 's blog post about your book , he asks : " If knowledge is a pile of leaves instead of a tree , how does the shape of knowledge change ? "
Do you have an answer for that ?
Yeah !
First , there 's the tree - like structure of knowledge , in which categories are carefully arranged .
So there 's a root and then there are branches , and every thing has to be neatly on one branch and only one branch .
Each thing has a special spot and only one spot .
And that shape is very useful for some types of thinking .
It 's certainly the shape that you use to divide up your laundry .
You divide it by person , and then by body part and so forth .
So you are constructing a tree .
It represents how we sort and order physical objects and it's very useful .
But when we make things miscellaneous , we get to shape it the way that we want .
And frequently , the shape is going to be a tree .
And sometimes the shape is going to be a cluster in which there is overlap .
It 's every type of human relationship .
It 's every possible shape and so there is n't a shape .
It 's this potential we have before us that we can shape in ways that make sense to us at the time .
And the " us " is — in fact — a social group .
You refer to this miscellany as a " third order . "
Can you explain a little bit about this idea ?
In the First Order , you organize the things themselves .
An example would be the physical books on the shelves .
In the Second Order , we do something that we 've gotten very good at over the past couple thousand years — we separate meta -data about the stuff in the First Order .
So we 're still dealing with physical objects .
In terms of books , it 's the card catalogue .
We 're separating the meta -data .
We 've reduced the amount of information we 're dealing with to what fits on the 3 x 5 card .
It 's much less than all the information about the book .
But with the Second Order , you now have a few different ways of sorting ( or categorizing ) .
For instance , you can sort by author , title , and subject .
In the Third Order , everything becomes miscellaneous — both the data and the meta - data ; the content and the information about it .
The principles that guided the organization of the first two orders no longer hold .
So are you saying that the first order is basically pre-taxonomy ?
And the second order brings that into being .
And then , the third order changes how taxonomy operates – or are we leaving taxonomy behind ?
We 're not leaving taxonomy behind .
Rather , we are embracing every possible way of organizing — every shape of organization that works .
And sometimes taxonomies are exactly what we need .
So we have taxonomies , we also have playlists .
Playlists are not really taxonomies .
They 're just lists .
( I guess you could say they 're the edge case of a taxonomy . )
Playlists are really useful for some things .
They 're really useful for music , for example , or for syllabi .
But they 're not a very good way of organizing a complex library , because the list gets too long .
We will use every type of organization we need , including taxonomies , when they make sense .
I guess if you label your iPod music lists — say , " anti- War songs " or something like that — then that becomes a sort of taxonomy .
A little mini-taxonomy .
In some ways , it seems like we 're really obsessed with classification these days .
You have things like the human genome project .
There are various projects to catalogue biological life forms .
And apparently Edward O. Wilson is now doing some kind of an encyclopedia of all life .
Where do those types of projects fit into your schemata , if they do ?
They do , because we are developing knowledge out of a pre-existing taxonomy .
We make links !
Let 's just limit the discussion to tags — we are not doing that because we have an existing taxonomy , but we may be able to generate a taxonomy based upon the set of tags .
In fact , the most important thing is that you can generate lots of taxonomies based on a single set of tags .
So it is useful to have an order of species .
And scientists have been arguing about the nature of species and how you cluster them since Darwin .
The argument over what constitutes a species continues among biologists still .
Sometimes you 'll define a species , and thus a set of categories ; and then the relationship of those categories , because you 're interested in the history of their actual descent .
But sometimes you 'll be interested in how populations — within isolated areas separated from each other — work .
At that point , their common ancestry may not be as important to you in your categorization scheme .
So sometimes it will be more useful to cluster things in ways that look at their functionality as opposed to their DNA .
So there are all these potential ways of organizing species .
The great thing is that now we can have them all .
It 's all miscellaneous .
If we 're doing epidemiology work , one sense of species may be more important to us than another .
We can have it all !
Can you conjecture about the personality changes that might happen with people whose ability to organize the chaos of information is being democratized ?
Is there any danger of a sort of virtual narcissism ?
I'm a little less concerned about that than some other are because I think this activity is as social as language is .
In fact , it 's very closely related to language .
Actually , the old idea that you could sit down and organize the universe by creating a taxonomy seems to me far more narcissistic than the bottom - up stuff that we 're doing now , which is more democratizing .
Do you think people are empowered by it ?
Do you think it might be a sort of evolutionary step for human beings ?
I do think it 's an evolutionary thing and I do think that people are being empowered by it .
But I sort of think those two things separately .
Taxonomies are power .
With a centralized top - down taxonomy , one problem is that somebody gets to say what you are .
And lots of people will inevitably disagree with the categorization .
A really bad example of this is what happened to a popular musician living under apartheid in South Africa , By the time he was fifty , he had become a different race five times because the law had changed .
And once , he had to leave his wife and family because of it .
So taxonomy is power .
It 's not always that gross .
But let 's say you 're trying to decide where Scientology or Jews For Jesus or Baha 'i goes in the category of religions .
Are they at the same level as the big ones ?
Power resides in that decision .
Now that we can create local clusters of meaning , local taxonomies , categorizations — a lot of that power dissipates .
That 's a good thing .
Not only can we democratize the taxonomies that are created , we can locate new taxonomies , in a sense .
We can have lots of them , as per Wikipedia .
Yes .
And furthermore , what works about Wikipedia is the fact that just about every other word is linked .
That 's more important than the categories .
The categories of Wikipedia are really more like tags – and that system totally sucks !
It 's broken !
It 's barely usable .
( Maybe they 'll fix it . )
But the fact that every article is penetrated by link after link after link going everywhere says that this messy web of meaning is more important than coming up with a nice set of categories .
How would you compare what you 're saying with Everything Is Miscellaneous to the two big tech business memes of the times — Web 2.0 and The Long Tail ?
Do you feel you 're extending that ?
Are you taking it a little further out ?
How would you relate to all that ?
Well , from a point of view of authors ' narcissism , I started working on this before either of those things came along .
So I 've watched them , and I do think there are relationships among all three of them .
Clearly , the long tail is about how content and ideas and stuff is spread out rather than centralized .
If you 're doing long tail economics or long tail business , you 've got to wonder how you are ever going to provide a single categorization scheme for your products that is going to work for the entire long tail .
Because , in terms of big topics , the long tail is n't actually interested in anything .
The consumers on the long tail are interested in their own quirky individual things .
That 's the power of the long tail .
So I think you want to move towards a miscellaneous way of thinking through how your customers are going to find what you want .
So it 's a good match .
Web 2.0 is , of course , a notoriously free term .
In some ways , it 's a set of examples , things that you point too .
You say , " Blogs are happening , and Wikis are happening , and APIs are opening up , and there are greater mashups of information . "
Many of those things enable the representation and use of miscellaneous data so it all pretty much fits the miscellaneous model .

What a shame this is .
I do n’t really know what to say , this story speaks for itself .
I truly empathize with the offended and feel embarrassed for the offender .
I grew up facing racism and faced similar accounts .
I myself have grown to a point not to take such actions personally .
I realize that it is a result of the offenders own ignorance , fear and / or insecurity .
Never the less it is imperative for all those who face these adversities to stand up and bring these issues to the forefront of social discourse .
More so , it is important for he or she who was not personally offended to rally in support of the offended .
Christian , Muslim , Hindu , Jew , or Buddhists no matter ; check the Good Samaritan parable Luke 10:25 - 37 .
We live a life where no one man is above the other , we are all interdependent and the world is round .
It is for this reason why Rastafari say I and I , not me and you .

Just for the record , I have negotiated a payment of more than $ 5,000 in one evening with your establishment , on behalf of my employer , which I recommended .
I visited your establishment on the evening of Saturday , April 28 , 2007 to help celebrate a birthday of a friend , and stood in line for approximately one hour .
Although this may be something your clients complain about , I
actually did not mind as I understood you were quite busy .
However , what occurred afterwards was something I have never experienced in my 25 years in North America .
As I was close to the entry point of your establishment , one of your employees ( doorman ) approached me and stated that customers with headwear were not allowed into the restaurant .
Your employee was referring to my
turban , which is a required article of faith for my religion ; I am a proud turban - wearing Sikh .
I did not immediately take offense to his request , and attempted to convince him that my turban should not be considered as typical headwear , such as a hat or baseball cap .
As you may know , Sikhs are a vital part of the proud Canadian community .
Your employee mentioned he was only following orders given to him by the owner / manager of the establishment .
Rather than causing a confrontational scene at your establishment ( where many South Asians along with others who respected Sikhs were standing ) , I requested to speak with the person who gave the order .
Your doorman was kind enough to introduce me to the person who gave the order .
The owner / manager was an older gentleman who I shook hands with immediately .
I mentioned that I was a regular patron who regularly
conducted business with the restaurant on behalf of my employer , and tried to convince him that my headgear was a religious article , and should not be discriminated against .
In fact , I let the owner / manager know that I , along with many of my turban - wearing friends , had frequented the venue numerous times in the past and were welcomed .
However , your owner / manager eventually stated that this was his “ sandbox ” and he could do what he pleased .
I was offended , as a Canadian citizen , and trust you can empathize with my experience .
I have never been targeted prior to tonight , as someone who should not receive standard client treatment , specifically because of my faith .
I have traveled across the globe and I am sad to admit that the only location I have ever received such treatment was the country where I am a proud citizen of .
There was no other reason , other than my religious head
covering , that I was not admitted into your venue , and your owner / manager openly agreed to that notion .
Please allow me to reiterate by stating that your owner / manager stated the restaurant ’s policy was not to grant access to anyone who wears any type of head covering .
I will be glad to provide you with photographs of turban wearing Sikhs at your restaurant from just a
few weeks ago .
I discussed the situation with your owner / manager like a gentleman , and let him know that I no longer wanted to gain entry to his venue .
I did not cause a dramatic scene in front of those still waiting to gain entry into your venue , although many did overhear the discussions and agreed that your owner / manager was wrong .
My friends , who are non-turban wearing Canadians , were also quite offended and proceeded to speak with York Regional Police Officers who happened to be close in proximity .
Everyone agreed that your owner / manager was wrong in denying me entry due to my religious head covering .
Please also be aware that patrons who were standing in line who witnessed the interactions , have taken the time to track my friends and volunteered to come forward with their account of the event .
These individuals are non-turban wearing Sikhs who I have never met before .
I appreciate you reading my full communication with you , as I wanted to paint an accurate picture of the night ’s event .
However , before I escalate this matter to the media , I want to give your owner / manager an opportunity
to apologize to me along with ensuring that no other proud turban - wearing Sikh must go through the humiliation that I endured tonight .
The Sikh religion teaches forgiveness , and I wish to extend my hand to the person who wronged me tonight , even though it was in front of many people .
Hence , I request that you forward this email to your owner / manager and request that he reach out to me at the contact information listed later in this message .
I would like to speak with him personally and educate him about the Sikh faith , along with explaining to him the contributions
Sikhs have made to Canada in breaking discriminatory barriers that apply to many immigrants .
I am forwarding this letter to two prominent Members of the Canadian Parliament to this message ; Navdeep Bains and Lui Temelkovski .
I want them both to know of this incident , and invite them to a meeting with your
owner / manager so we can put this matter behind us .
In addition , I have also forwarded this email to the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund for their references .
Moreover , I have also submitted this letter to
the Ontario Human Rights Commission .
I strongly suggest you read the section regarding religious rights that is found on the Ontario Human Rights Commission web site .
Furthermore , I am distributing this letter to
my friends and family , so they can learn about my experience .
I will not escalate this matter to the media until Friday , May 4 , 2007 .
Your owner / manager must make contact with me before the aforementioned date and schedule a meeting to discuss the matter mentioned above .
If your
owner / manager invites me to a meeting with the presence of the aforementioned Honorable Members of Parliament along with my legal counsel , I will delay any discussion with the media .
Please forward this to your owner / manager at your earliest convenience , as failure to do so will cause me to defend my integrity by making the media aware of your policies .
My goal is not to defame your establishment , but
instead , to simply ensure that Canadian citizens are aware of your discriminatory policies .
I look forward to your response in a timely fashion .
Sincere Regards ,
Gaurav Singh ”

Update
As some of you might ’ve already guessed , I quit my restaurant job .
To protect my anonymity I ’ll just say I quit before Mother ’s Day .
To reveal any other time details might risk exposing me and the restaurant I was working for .
And to answer the question before it ’s asked , no , I did n’t murder Javier .
The end came when I was working a Saturday double .
After an agonizingly slow lunch shift the head waiter stuck me in a paltry three table section for dinner .
When I protested my exile into the Special Ed section , the head waiter countered by saying I was “ too slow ” to work a full section on a busy night .
When I reminded her I worked a regular section when a server called out sick just that previous Saturday , the head waiter threw me a “ who gives a shit ? ” look and walked away .
That was the straw that broke the camel ’s back .
Realizing that I would n’t clear $ 100 working a 16 hour day , I threw down my apron and walked out .
Despite my earlier prophesying , I did not scream “ fuck this place ” at the top of my lungs .
I have more class than that .
What am I doing now ?
Since the due date for my book manuscript is fast approaching , I ’ll be giving that project my undivided attention for the next few months .
At some point I ’ll get another job somewhere , but right now I ’m chained to my laptop .
I ’ll post news about my book ’s march toward publication as events warrant .
Wish me luck .
Waiter Rant is where everything began and I ’m not about to abandon it .
In order to shake things up a bit I ’m thinking about letting other writers occasionally “ guest blogger ” and post their restaurant stories on my site .
I ’m also toying with the idea of starting a “ Dear Waiter ” column where I ’ll answer restaurant questions ( in my own unique way ) submitted via email from the dining public .
Do n’t worry .
I ’m not going “ Hollywood . ”
I ’ll keep posting my own stories as long as you guys keep reading them !
That ’s the update everybody .
Thanks again for all the encouragement , constructive criticism and support over the past three years .
I have some of the best readers in the blogsphere !
I ’ll post a story in the next few days .
Until then , remember to tip your server !
PS .
Kelly !
I want my T - shirts !
More Google Gears Terms and Conditions madness .
Gears is licensed under New BSD terms ; yet before you can install the runtime you have to agree to onerous terms and conditions .
Here ’s clause 2 :
2. Accepting the Terms 2.1
In order to use Google Gears , you must first agree to the Terms .
You may not use Google Gears if you do not accept the Terms .
2.2
You can accept the Terms by : ( A ) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms , where this option is made available to you by Google in the user interface for any Services ; or ( B ) by actually using Google Gears .
In this case , you understand and agree that Google will treat your use of Google Gears as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards .
2.3
You may not use Google Gears and may not accept the Terms if ( a ) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Google , or ( b ) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services .
I ’m puzzled .
If Gears is BSD licensed , how can Google insist that the mere act of using it binds me to these terms ( which I dislike for other reasons too ) ?
And 2.3 is bewildering : you may not use Google Gears apps if you are not an adult ?
What if someone else installs Gears on your machine , and you then use a Gears - enabled app ?
How can terms like this possibly apply in such cases ?
Note that the agreement does not refer only to installing Gears , but specifically to using Gears .
By the way , you can download the source for Gears , and compile it if you can figure out how , without assenting to any such agreement .
I think Google is letting its legal team get out of hand .

Getting Serious about Preserving Behavior
by Michael Feathers
August 3 , 2006
Summary
In this blog , I describe ' sensing variables ' , and how you can use them to make large method refactoring easier .
I also discuss the potential for tools which could achieve the same effects in a nicer way .
Advertisement
I spend a lot of time looking at ugly code .
Sometimes it makes me angry .
I see horrible swirls of chaos and it seems that the people who wrote the code just did n’t care .
At other times , though , I ’m deeply sympathetic .
I see deep dark edifices of code with little bright spots , places where it ’s obvious that the programmers did care , but they were dealing with something insurmountable , something that they were deeply afraid of , and fear won the day .
I ’m not going to get on my hobby horse about writing tests in this blog .
If you ’ve read my blogs , or heard me talk , you know that I continually point out that work in code covered with tests is qualitatively different .
When your code is surrounded with tests , there ’s much less fear .
Tests are a huge behavioral invariant which gives you feedback when you change your code .
They make aggressive refactoring possible ...
Code can actually get better ...
Well , enough of the rant .
The thing that I 'm trying to say is that I believe that this problem , the problem of knowing whether we are changing behavior in unexpected ways when we refactor is a core problem in software engineering .
Forget testing for a second , what we really want to know is whether we are making unintentional behavioral change in our systems when we modify them .
Imagine a world in which we see the effects of most changes we make in our systems immediately , where we ’re able to decide whether we like them or not and then move on .
Test - Driven Development gives us that model of development , but I wonder if we can do more .
Maybe we can move to a model where we ’re able to “ checkpoint ” behavior directly in a language or an IDE .
In this blog , I ’ll talk about how we can do that sort of checkpointing using a manual technique .
In a subsequent blog , I ’ll talk about how we can move toward tooling that helps us do the same thing more easily .
Sensing Variables
I few years ago , I wrote up a technique that I called using sensing variables .
It ’s an incredibly simple technique , but it can be very handy .
Here ’s an example .
void process ( int id , long location ) { int value ; Dispatcher dispatcher = new Dispatcher ( location ) ; if ( ... ) { if (... ) { // imagine 500 lines of ugly code here ...
String baseMessage = “ @ ” + getLastMessage ( ) ; dispatcher.send( artLevel , 3 ) ; baseMessage += getMaxRate ( ) + “ “ + value + “ .optkey ” ; // imagine 500 lines of ugly code here ... }
Let ’s say that we have a large ugly method and we want to do some refactoring within it :
One of the things that we ’d like to do is take all of that work we do to calculate baseMessage and move it into another method but there are some things in the code that get in the way ; the call to send ( ) on dispatcher for instance .
It occurs right in the middle of our calculation of baseMessage .
If we could move that line , dispatcher . send ( artLevel , 3 ) , down a few lines , we could have this :
String baseMessage = “ @ ” + getLastMessage ( ) ; baseMessage += getMaxRate ( ) + “ “ + value + “ .optkey ” ; dispatcher.send(artLevel , 3 ) ;
And it would be pretty easy to extract all of the baseMessage calculation into a method named getBaseMessage ( ) .
Can we make that change ?
Well , we can if there are n't any unpleasant side - effects .
If send ( ) does n’t affect the result of getMaxRate ( ) in the next line , then we could move the dispatcher .
send ( artLevel , 3 ) statement below the calculation of baseMessage .
How can we tell ?
One simple way is to introduce a new variable , a variable that we can use to sense the value of baseMessage and a particular point in the method 's execution :
public String calculatedBaseMessage = ” ” ; void process ( int id , long location ) { int value ; Dispatcher dispatcher = new Dispatcher ( location ) ; if ( ... ) { if (... ) { // imagine 500 lines of ugly code here ...
String baseMessage = “ @ ” + getLastMessage ( ) ; dispatcher.send( artLevel , 3 ) ; baseMessage += getMaxRate ( ) + “ “ + value + “ .optkey ” ; calculated BaseMessage = baseMessage ; // imagine 500 lines of ugly code here ... }
Now that we have that variable , we can write tests using it :
void testProcessLocal ( ) { final int ID = 12 ; DispatchCommand command = new DispatchCommand ( ) ; command.process ( ID , LOCAL_LOCATION ) ; assertEquals ( “ ” , command.calculatedBaseMessage ) ; } void testProcessRemote ( ) { final int ID = 12 ; DispatchCommand command = new DispatchCommand ( ) ; command.process ( ID , REMOTE_LOCATION ) ; assertEquals ( “ ” , command.calculatedBaseMessage ) ; }
Notice that we ’re just checking for an empty string in each of these tests .
Once we run the tests , we will get failures which will show us the calculated value of baseMessage for particular inputs .
Then we can adjust the tests so that they pass .
When we do , we ’ll have a set of tests that pin down the existing behavior :
void testProcessLocal ( ) { final int ID = 12 ; DispatchCommand command = new DispatchCommand ( ) ; command.process ( ID , LOCAL_LOCATION ) ; assertEquals ( “ @ red 10.3 3.44 .optkey ” , command.calculatedBaseMessage ) ; } void testProcessRemote ( ) { final int ID = 12 ; DispatchCommand command = new DispatchCommand ( ) ; command.process ( ID , REMOTE_LOCATION ) ; assertEquals ( “ @ red 11.4 4.55 .optkey ” , command.calculatedBaseMessage ) ; }
Now , we can try to move that line of code and see what happens :
public String calculatedBaseMessage = ” ” ; void process ( int id , long location ) { int value ; Dispatcher dispatcher = new Dispatcher ( location ) ; if ( ... ) { if (... ) { ... String baseMessage = “ @ ” + getLastMessage ( ) ; // dispatcher.send(artLevel , 3 ) ; baseMessage += getMaxRate ( ) + “ “ + value + “ .optkey ” ; calculated BaseMessage = baseMessage ; dispatcher.send( artLevel , 3 ) ; // Moved from above ( see commented - out line below declaration of baseMessage ) ... }
When we run the tests , we ’ll know whether send ( ) had a side - effect that affected our refactoring .
If the tests fail , it did .
If they pass , we can have some confidence that the move was safe .
Now , if you ’re seeing this for the first time you might be thinking one of two things .
One is that you could probably use a debugger for this .. you could set a watch on baseMessage and debug to find out what happens to it .
That ’s fine as far as it goes , the problem is that debuggers carry us through one path of execution for one set of input values .
Sensing variables can be used across many paths of execution with many different input values .
We can use them to write several tests against a chunk of code and effectively pin it down from several different directions .
The other thing that you might be thinking about is that it just feels wrong to introduce variables into production code specifically for testing .
Frankly , I feel the same way and that ’s why I use sensing variables as a temporary technique .
I use them to pin down some behavior , then I add code or refactor .. then I delete them .
Often , I can alter the tests that used them so that they are still useful after my refactoring .
For instance , if I extracted all that code for baseMessage into a method , I can alter the tests I wrote above so that they look like this :
void testLocalBaseMessage ( ) { DispatchCommand command = new DispatchCommand ( ) ; assertEquals ( “ @ red 10.3 3.44 .optkey ” , command.getBaseMessage(“ red ” , “ 10.3 ” , “ 3.44 ” ) ) ; } void testRemoteBaseMessage ( ) { DispatchCommand command = new DispatchCommand ( ) ; assertEquals ( “ @ red 11.4 4.55 .optkey ” , command.getBaseMessage(“ red ” , “ 11.4 ” , “ 4.55 ” ) ; }
These tests test essentially the same behavior , but in a narrower sense .
They test it directly on the new method we extracted not on the method it came from .
I ’ve used sensing variables in a variety of projects .
They 're useful but they are a little tedious to set up .
In my next blog , I ’ll show a little tool that you can use to make the use of sensing variables easier , and I 'll describe how languages and IDEs could give us direct support for them .

The Joomla Project is pleased to announce the availability of the Joomla 4.0 Beta 4 release , and the second Alpha of Joomla 3.10 .
Details Category : Project Release News Created : 26 August 2020
With Joomla 4.0 beta being released a few weeks ago , we enter into a phase of stabilization .
Joomla !
4.0 is feature complete , that means , no new features are going to be added to Joomla 4.0 .
The focus is on fixing the last bugs to get Joomla !
4.0 out as soon as possible .
But what will happen until the release and afterwards ?
Obviously we do n’t want to stop new feature development , which is why we would like to refine our development strategy for upcoming versions .
Whenever we start the work on a new minor version , we plan to define the subsequent two minor releases
This results in a more reliable release cycle and a more consistent road map .

Back in January at this year 's Consumer Electronics Show , Intel was showing off a rig in their booth dubbed the " V8 " .
It was essentially a dual - socket workstation platform outfitted with a pair of quad - core Xeon processors for a total of eight cores - hence the ' V8 ' .
In their demo , Intel ran the CPU benchmark built into 3DMark06 and as was evident in the signage over the rig , proudly boasted that it was capable of a CPU score of 6,089 points .
Today we 've actually got the parts in house to assemble a similar rig , but ours is configured with considerably more powerful hardware ...
What you 're looking at here is one of Intel 's workstation - class S5000XVN dual - socket motherboards , coupled to a pair of Xeon X5365 processors , 4GB of Samsung DDR2 - 667 FBDIMMs , and a GeForce 8800 GTX .
The motherboard is based on Intel 's 5000X chipset and the processors are clocked at 3.0GHz a piece , riding on a 1.33 GHz front side bus .
We did some preliminary testing on this rig and wanted to share some of the juicy details with you before our full article is complete .
These tests were run on Windows XP Professional SP2 , with the latest Intel chipset and NVIDIA Forceware graphics drivers installed .
SiSoft SANDRA XI SP1 - CPU , Multimedia , and Memory Bandwidth Benchmarks
Quad - Core Intel Xeon X5365 x 2 , 4GB FBDIMM 667 , GeForce 8800 GTX
If you flip through the SiSoft SANDRA screenshots above you see just how much raw horsepower is lurking under this rig's hood .
The Processor Arithmetic and Multimedia benchmark scores are more than double those of a Core 2 Duo QX6800 .
And the Memory Bandwidth benchmark reported maximum bandwidth scores in the neighborhood of 4GB/s , which is low by today 's standards and about 1 GB /s off the mark set by the QX6800 .
We also ran a default 3DMark06 test and a multi- threaded Cinebench v9.5 benchmark on this rig and were thoroughly impressed .
The overall 3 Dmark06 score was 13,002 ( SM2.0=5,104 / HDR & SM3.0=4,932 ) ; the CPU score was 6,556 - almost 500 points higher than the rig Intel was showing off at CES .
And the rig completed the Cinebench rendering pass in only 10 seconds , which is about 4 - 5 seconds faster then a quad - core Core 2 Extreme QX6800 .
A new study by the US Institute for Peace ( USIP ) of polling data from fourteen different Muslim countries finds that support for a role for Islam in politics strongly correlates with more likely support for terrorism .
This statistical analysis is certain to draw protests from the usual propagandists of radical Islam in the US , even though the USIP can hardly be considered a neo-conservative institution .
Ever since recent release last month of the Pew poll on American Muslim attitudes , the Islamist propagandists and their media establishment allies have been working feverishly to avoid the implications of those findings by citing another study purportedly showing Americans more in favor of attacks on civilians than Muslims in the US and around the world , claims rebutted in my American
Thinker article last week , " Lies , Damned Lies , and CAIR 's Statistics " .
The current report in question , " Correlates of Public Support for Terrorism in the Muslim World " by Ethan Bueno de Mesquita of Washington University in St. Louis , also examines data gathered by the Pew Research Center and finds a broad range of opinions and attitudes in the Muslim world .
For instance , support for terrorism was extremely high in Lebanon ( home of Hezbollah ) and extremely low in Uzbekistan ( an allied partner with the US in the War on Terror ) .
The support for terrorism is also dispersed in the Muslim world : of the top five countries in the fourteen surveyed , two were in the Middle East ( Lebanon and Jordan ) , two were in Africa ( Nigeria , Ivory Coast ) and one was in Asia ( Bangladesh ) .
It should be noted that Egypt refused to let the question be asked as part of the survey , and other presumably high terrorism support areas , including Syria , Iran , Iraq , the Palestinian Authority and Saudi Arabia , were not included in the poll .
The standout finding of the USIP study is that support for an increased role for Islam in politics is correlated with greater support for the use of terrorism , even in countries that already adhere to political Islam :
People who support a strong role for Islam in politics are more likely to also support terrorism .
Perhaps more surprisingly , people who perceive Islam to play a large role in the politics of their home country are also more likely to support terrorism .
( p. 7 )
The USIP study also busts the bubble of radical Islamic apologists who claim that support for terrorism is driven by people living under Islamic dictatorships .
What the data shows is that dissatisfaction with Islam 's role in internal politics has very little correlation to attitudes on terror .
The study finds that
... dissatisfaction with the role of Islam in one 's own country 's politics is much more weakly correlated with support for terrorism then raw attitudes toward to role of Islam . ( p. 7 )
Perhaps even more important , the data shows that in these countries the perceived threat to Islam posed by the government plays virtually no role at all in support for terrorism .
( p. 7 )
To get at what might possibly drive support for terrorism , the study 's author looked at respondents opinions on possible threats to Islam .
What he discovered is that the perceived threat to Islam by their home government had very little impact in their support for terrorism , but instead , " those who believe the United States and the West pose such a threat are particularly likely to support terrorism . " ( p. 8 ) In fact , the perceived threat by the US to Islam correlates higher than any other factor in justifying the use of terrorism .
( p. 9 )
There are several other surprising findings in the USIP report :
Respondents in these Muslim countries that believed they had some degree of freedom of speech were found to be more likely to support terrorism .
( p. 28 ) As a possible interpretation for this effect , one explanation offered by the study 's author is that " when people perceive themselves to have freedom of expression , they are more inclined to admit their support for terror . " ( p. 29 )
In line with the findings of other surveys , support for terrorism is constant across education groups ( p. 35 ) It 's not just that education plays little role in justifying terror , but that the relationship is non-existent : " Not only is the relationship statistically insignificant , but by and large the point estimates are zero . " ( p. 36 )
Perception of the state of the country 's economy was basically uncorrelated with support for terrorism .
( p. 30 ) This finding undercuts the argument that Islamic terrorism is driven by poverty in the Muslim world .
Women are more likely to be weak or strong supporters of terrorism than men . ( p. 37 )
Age is negatively correlated to support for terrorism , meaning that the older one gets , the less likely he will justify the use of terrorism .
( p. 38-39 ) The study 's author suggests this might be due to a real age effect ( views moderate for all ages as they get older ) , or a generational effect ( people born in the 1940s vs. the 1980s ) .
Marriage was also a negative factor in supporting terrorism , though the relationship was found to be statistically insignificant .
( p. 40 )
As stated earlier , the strongest correlated factor in the support for terrorism is anti-Americanism and the perceived threat to Islam from America in the West .
The study 's author explains the critical role this plays in the support for terrorism in the Muslim world :
It may well be that people support terrorism because they perceive there to be a threat to Islam from the United States .
But the relationship could also work the other way .
Terrorism is , among other things , a tool of propaganda .
One of the key messages of Islamic terrorists is anti-Americanism .
Thus , if terrorism is an effective tool of propaganda , it may be that people who support terrorism ( for whatever reason ) end up having strongly anti-American sentiments because they are persuaded by the terrorists ' message .
Another , related , explanation argues that people who support terrorism have a psychological need to justify this support .
As a result , they adopt views that " rationalize " their support for terrorism .
Thus , while they may perceive their support for terrorism to be caused by their anti-American views , the opposite might be the case - they may have adopted anti-Americanism to justify support for terror .
Under either of these alternative interpretations , anti-Americanism does not cause support for terror , support for terror causes anti-Americanism . ( p. 41 -42 )
Terrorists have a vested interest in ratcheting up anti-America rhetoric as part of their hate propaganda campaign .
Terror and hatred of America and its values go hand - in - hand in the Muslim world unlike any other factor yet studied .
Because these two are so strongly correlated , this tells us something about those quick to indict American society and our government 's policies .
This new study also shatters the myth of the supposedly peaceful Muslim world advanced recently by CAIR , ISNA and the Orwellian - named Terror Free America .
If these organizations are really concerned about combating terror and improving American - Islamic relations , this study clearly demonstrates that they had better start working on the Islamic side of the equation .

The Tropical Eastern Pacific , a discrete biogeographic region that has an extremely high rate of endemism among its marine organisms , continues to yield a wealth of never - before - described marine animals to visiting scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama .
Alicia Hermosillo , researcher at the Universidad de Guadalajara in Mexico , and Angel Valdes , assistant curator of Malacology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County , describe five newly discovered species of nudibranchs , two of which Hermosillo collected in Panama , in Volume 22 of the American Malacological Bulletin .
Nudibranchs — a group of mollusks lacking outer shells — have developed sophisticated chemical defense mechanisms , which is particularly important because promising industrial and medicinal products have been isolated from known species .
New species may provide cures for diseases that are currently untreatable .

Working from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute ’s Research Vessel , the Urraca , in Panama ’s Gulf of Chiriqui and from the M/V Destiny in Mexico , Hermosillo and other scientists collected sea slugs , aeolid nudibranchs in scientific parlance , between 2001 and 2005 .
Funding for the research was provided by private donors Roberto Chavez , Steve Drogin and Buceo Vallartech , a dive shop in Puerto Vallarta .
and by STRI staff scientist D. Ross Robertson .
It took Hermosillo and her collaborators two more years to identify the animals in the new collection by comparing them to existing collections , consulting specialists and using a scanning electron microscope to examine the jaws and other hard parts of the nudibranchs that distinguish species .
This was part of the formal project “ Phylogenetic Systematics of Nudibranchia , ” sponsored by a National Science Foundation grant to Terrence M. Gosliner , senior curator for Invertebrate Zoology and Geology at the California Academy of Sciences and to Valdes .
The microscope work also was supported by the NSF through a grant to Valdes and collaborators .
A list of the new species ( and one still to be classified ) that are completely described in the publication follows :
-- Cerberilla chavezi sp. was collected from the Bahia de Santiago , Colima in Mexico and is named for Roberto Chavez , who provided assistance during fieldwork and suggested dive sites .
-- Cuthona destinyae came out of hull scrapings from the M/V Destiny in La Gordornia , Guerrero , Mexico , and thus , is named for the boat .
-- Cuthona millenae , named for Sandra Millen for her knowledge of Pacific nudibranchs , was collected from under a rock at 19 m depth in the Bahia de Banderas , Jalisco - Nayarit , Mexico .
-- Cuthona behrensi , a beautiful white specimen with white - tipped rhinophores named for nudibranch specialist Dave Behrens , who supported the research effort , was found by Alicia Hermosillo under a rock at 13 m depth at Los Frailes , Golfo de Chiriqui , Panama .
-- Eubranchus yolandae was collected from Los Arcos , Bahia de Banderas , Jalisco - Nayarit , Mexico , from a rock wall at a depth of 17 m .
This species was named for Yolanda Camacho - Garcia for her contributions to the knowledge of Pacific opistohbranchs .
-- Herviella sp. , was photographed and collected by Alicia Hermosillo from a floating buoy southeast of Isla Coiba , Coiba National Park , Panama .
The new species status and naming of this animal awaits the discovery of additional specimens .

Food safety experts have advised parents to eliminate a series of additives from their children 's diet while they await the publication of a new study that is understood to link these ingredients to behaviour problems in youngsters .
The latest scientific research into the effect of food additives on children 's behaviour is thought to raise fresh doubts about the safety of controversial food colourings and a preservative widely used in sweets , drinks and processed foods in the UK .
But the Guardian has learned that it will be several months before the results are published , despite the importance of the findings for children 's health .
Researchers at Southampton University have tested combinations of synthetic colourings and preservative that an average child might consume in a day to measure what effect they had on behaviour .
A source at the university told the food industry 's magazine the Grocer last week that their results supported findings first made seven years ago that linked the additives to behavioural problems , such as temper tantrums , poor concentration and hyperactivity , and to allergic reactions .
Both studies were conducted for the Food Standards Agency .
The latest results were considered by the FSA 's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food ( CoT ) in a closed meeting on March 20 .
The CoT , whose meetings are usually open , noted " the public health importance of the findings " , but the results will not be released to the public or acted on until they have been published in a scientific journal , a process that will take several months .
The FSA and Professor Jim Stevenson , who led the project , said they could not discuss the results before then .
It took the CoT more than two years to release its views on the earlier research because it was waiting for publication in a scientific journal .
Independent experts say that consumers should consider removing these additives from their children 's diets now .
The colours , tested on both three - year - olds and eight - to - nine year olds in the new study , were tartrazine ( E102 ) , ponceau 4R ( E124 ) , sunset yellow ( E110 ) , carmoisine ( E122 ) , quinoline yellow ( E104 ) and allura red AC ( E129 ) .
The preservative tested was sodium benzoate ( E211 ) .
Although these additives are widely used in the UK and are approved as safe and legal by the EU , some of the colours are banned in Scandinavian countries and the US .
Campaign groups such as the Hyperactive Children 's Support Group have argued for years that children 's behaviour is improved by removing artifical colourings and other additives from their diets .
Vyvyan Howard , professor of bio-imaging at Ulster University and one of the experts on FSA 's additives and behaviour working group , said it was important that the new research was published in a scientific journal but that consumers had a choice .
" It is biologically plausible that there could be an effect from these additives .
While you are waiting for the results to come out you can choose not to expose your children to these substances .
These compounds have no nutritonal value and I personally do not feed these sorts of foods to my 15 - month - old daughter . "
Another member of the working group , Dr Alex Richardson , the director of Food and Behaviour Research and senior research scientist at Oxford University , said : " There are well - documented potential risks from these additives .
In my view the researchers had done an excellent piece of work first time round and there was enough evidence to act .
If this new study essentially replicates that , what more evidence do they need to remove these additives from children 's food and drink ? "
The FSA has been considering the safety of these additives since 2000 , when it received the results of the first trial known as the Isle of Wight study .
That research concluded that " significant changes in children 's behaviour could be produced by the removal of colourings and additives from their diet [ and ] benefit would accrue for all children from such a change and not just for those already showing hyperactive behaviour or who are at risk of allergic reactions . "
The CoT , however , decided in 2002 that this study was inconclusive - although parents , who did not know whether their children were on a placebo or not , observed significant behavioural changes in those given the additives , other observers did not find the same changes when children were assessed in a clinic using computer games to measure inattention .
So the FSA set up the new study to provide conclusive evidence , with a working group of independent experts giving advice on how best to design it .
If the findings of the new research do confirm the Isle of Wight work , " the implications would be enormous " , said Tim Lang , professor of food policy at City University , in London .
" The stakes are very high ; these are additives that children have been exposed to for years .
I can understand the FSA wanting to be sure no one can accuse it of breaking scientific protocols but these findings need to come out quickly , " he added .
A spokeswoman for the FSA said the agency was " committed to handling science in the proper scientific way " and hoped the findings would be published in a matter of months .
She added that all the additives involved " are approved for use in the EU and are safe " .
With Kameraflage , now you 'll be able to plant subliminal messages on T - shirts , movies and billboards that can only be seen with digital cameras .
This context - sensitive display technology , developed by Sarah Logie and Connor Dickie , works by using colors that are invisible to us but easily picked up by the cameras ' silicon chips .
As you can see , the lovely model above is wearing a shirt that only reveals that cloud 's lightning bolt when seen through an iPhone 's camera , although any ordinary unmodified digicam would get the same result .
She just as easily could have placed her phone number in that cloud .
Hmm .
Let 's think of some other uses for this cool tech .

Another use for the technology would be to watermark video and filmed content , so when pirates try to videotape movies by sneaking a camcorder into the theater , there could be a big bunch of funky - looking text all over it .
Enabling this is a clever trick using a patented invisible light projector developed by Logie and Dickie .
More Kameraflage clothing will be demonstrated at the ACM SIGGRAPH Unravel fashion show on August 6 in San Diego .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
The leaves of Aspilia africana , a plant used in African traditional medicine , can stop bleeding , block infection and speed wound healing , a new study from Nigeria confirms .
The leaves and flowers of A. Africana , a bristle - covered herb known as the “ hemorrhage plant , ” have been used to stanch bleeding , remove foreign bodies from the eyes , treat scorpion stings , and for several other purposes across the African continent , note Dr. Charles O. Okoli and colleagues at the University of Nigeria .
Dr. Okoli is currently located in Sydney , Australia at the University of New South Wales .
To test the plant ’s medicinal properties , Okoli and his team performed a series of lab and animal experiments comparing the effects of an extract of the powdered leaves in methanol , and two different portions or fractions containing hexane or methanol .
They report their findings in BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine .
The extract and the fractions of the plant significantly reduced bleeding and clotting time in rats , the researchers found , with the methanol fraction having the strongest effect .
All components also slowed the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Staphylococcus aureus , two common wound - infecting bacteria , and reduced wound healing time .
For both halting bacterial growth and speeding healing , the methanol fraction again had the most powerful effect .
Analysis of the plant extracts and fractions identified a variety of plant components that could be responsible for its medicinal properties , Okoli and his colleagues note , including saponins and tannins .
“ The results of this study indicate that extracts of leaves of A. Africana have good potentials for use in wound care and further provide a rationale for the use of the leaves of this plant in wound management in traditional medicine practice , ” they conclude .

Click to viewLike most great ideas , the concept behind Justin.tv is simple : a video stream , anytime , anywhere .
But the hardware behind it all was n't so easy to make , so Justin called up a friend , Kyle Vogt , to hand - build version 1.0 from some off - the - shelf parts , a grip of EVDO cards and some " borrowed " equipment from MIT .

How did you meet up with these guys ?
Justin Kan and Emmett Shear recently created Kiko.com , one of the first AJAX based Web calendars .
Google calendar came out a couple months later and snatched away many of their users , so they sold Kiko on eBay for a quarter million bucks .
They recruited their friend Michael Seibel from Yale and came to MIT to look for a hardware hacker [ to help them build a 24/7 portable live video streaming system ] .
I was convinced these guys were on to something , so I dropped out of MIT and joined Justin.tv .
What were some of the camera specs in terms of battery requirements and network ?
It had to send video to our website from wherever Justin went during his day - to - day life , and it had to last most of the day without being recharged .
I needed some type of wireless network to transmit the video data , but WiFi and satellite Internet were out of the question .
Fortunately , Sprint rolled out a high - speed EVDO Rev .
A network just in time ( and an unlimited data plan ) , so I bought a USB modem and focused my efforts on building a camera .

How about the camera itself ?
Anything special ?
The camera setup included a Viosport analog headcam , an MPEG4 video encoder , a small Linux computer , and a huge lithium - polymer battery .
I picked low power components when possible so that everything would work for 8 hours on a single battery charge .
A friend and I snuck into the basement of the MIT Media lab and used a laser cutter to build an enclosure to hold the electronics .
I bolted the electronics in place and stuffed everything in a backpack .
After a couple weeks of hacking in my apartment in Boston , I mailed the functional camera prototype to Justin.tv headquarters in San Francisco .
It was a good start , and our investors were pleased .
It worked first try ?
The team was pretty happy to finally have a camera in their hands , but the video was choppy and cut out quite a bit .
I did n't want to let the team down , so I promised TV quality video within a couple weeks .
My plan was to stripe the video data over several Sprint data modems .
That did n't work out as well as I had hoped .
How 'd you fix it ?
I moved San Francisco so I could be closer to the rest of the team .
I mean really close .
The four of us lived and worked out of a small two - bedroom apartment .
I spent my time becoming an expert in Linux socket programming , cellphone data networks and realtime data protocols .
Four data modems in close proximity just do n't work well together , so packet loss was as high as 50 % .
I fought with these modems for weeks but finally managed to wrestle them into a single 1.2 mbps video uplink .
The new camera emerged from the pile of Radio Shack parts , computer guts and hacked - up cellphones that had accumulated on my messy desk .
It uses thousands of lines of Python code , a custom realtime protocol , connection load balancing and several other funky hacks .
Pretty cool .
What are you improving now ?
Version 1.0 was the state of the art camera with 4 x bandwidth , but it was really expensive .
We 're working on using more standardized equipment like UMPCs (w /
built - in EVDO ) and webcams , better codecs , all running on Windows .
This is so Justin and all the lifecasters can easily get geared up .

Facebook AMSTERDAM , Netherlands  Seventeenth - century masons built Amsterdam on a foundation of wooden poles planted in soggy , sandy ground , leaving behind a beautiful architectural museum — but one with walls prone to sinking or crumbling without warning .
So how do you dig a subway under it ?
Very carefully .
Construction of a new " North - South " line for this city of canals and rivers began in 2003 , and is presenting Dutch engineers , famed for their ingenuity in keeping this waterlogged nation dry , with devilish challenges .
" The politicians told us : ' We want a subway , we 're prepared to pay for it and accept some disruption , but the one thing we absolutely do n't want is any damage to the city , " ' said Johan Bosch , the project manager .
" We need a system so that if things do n't go as expected , we do n't find out after the damage is irreparable . "
The solution : 7,000 mirrors hung in clusters of three on buildings along the 2.4 miles of the route that 's underground .
Measuring devices shine infrared beams onto each mirror once an hour , measure the reflection , and feed data into a central computer .
After triangulating , the computer raises the alarm if any building shifts more than 0.5 millimeters in any direction .
A millimeter is the thickness of a paper clip .
The system , unique on such a large scale , has already told townspeople something they may have guessed but could n't know for sure : that theirs is a city in motion .
" We now know that whole segments of the city move by themselves , a number of millimeters over the course of a season , " Bosch said .
Scheduled for completion in 2013 , the $ 2.4 billion project stretches 5.9 miles in all and will transport an estimated 200,000 people daily , adding a new dimension to Amsterdam 's traffic of bicycles , trams , cars , taxis , buses and boats .
The biggest technical challenge is building a subway stop directly beneath the city 's main train station — a landmark 19th century building — while it remains in use .
A quarter of a million travelers pass through Central Station every day and few of them realize construction is happening beneath their feet .
" It 's probably better that people do n't see this , " said Bert van de Zande of Strukton , the contractor responsible for this part of the project , pointing to I - beams supporting the building 's main columns .
Strukton workers eventually will dig a 60 - foot - deep trench under the station , and connect it to the Ij River which flows directly behind .
" It 'll be the world 's most expensive covered canal , " Van de Zande said .
When all is ready , a segment of concrete tunnel 450 feet long will be buoyed with air like a submarine , floated into the trench , and then allowed to settle gently into place .
And they expect that to work ?
" We have n't missed a deadline yet , " Van de Zande says .
This fall , two drills , each 23 feet in diameter , will begin tunneling through the city like huge metallic moles pulling the contraption that lays concrete tunnel walls .
Archeologists can't wait for the tunneling to begin at the Damrak , which was once the harbor where the Amstel River met the Ij , leading out to the North Sea .
In the 1600s , countless ships returning from the East Indies docked there , making Amsterdam — the dam on the Amstel — one of the world 's wealthiest cities .
The initial segment where the drills will descend into the earth is being built using the " caisson " method .
The sealed segment , or caisson , is constructed above the spot where it must go .
Workers operate in a pressurized air pocket directly beneath it , using hoses and pumping mud upward through a pipe so that the caisson slowly sinks .
Because the streets of Amsterdam are below sea level at high tide , the air pocket is increasingly pressurized as the caisson descends to a final depth of 82 feet .
Workers must rest in decompression chambers after their shifts in order to avoid getting " caisson disease , " the divers ' ailment otherwise known as the bends .
The subway stations are being built before the tunneling starts , using an innovative method intended to minimize disruption to street traffic : the walls are built first , then the roof , and the rest of the work can proceed underground .
There are always surprises .
Workers digging space for a wall at the Rokin station were alerted by the mirror monitoring system that buildings on a nearby street began to sway back and forth .
On further inspection , they found they had run into a layer of horizontal poles at a level where they expected to find sand .
Eventually , Bosch said , workers got through the layer using 36 - foot steel tubes with drill bits welded to the end , chewing up the wood and sucking it out as if through a straw .
" It did n't seem prudent to keep on going , so we had to find another way , " Bosch said .
" I 'm sure it wo n't be the last time we have to improvise . "

A while ago , while surfing the web I found an interesting idea for an oscilloscope clock .
I have spend some time thinking about it first , and finally decided to make one myself .
First I made a crappy version with a R2R resistor ladder network for a DAC to test the idea .
The next improvement was to use a real DAC that works a lot better .
The results were so good that I decided to make this project available as a kit .
The idea is to display a working clock on the surface of a CRT tube as used in most oscilloscopes .
It 's not easy to find large numbers of identical CRT tubes , so I only made a kit that provides the x-y signals .
You can connect this kit to any oscilloscope that supports x-y display .
Practically any two - channel oscilloscope can handle that .
There is no need for Z-modulation ( intensity of the beam ) as the trace moves very fast between the various parts of the picture .
Credits go to the fast settling dual DAC , the most expensive part of the design .
The image is very crisp , but remember to put the input channels in DC mode for the best result .
This is how it looks on the oscilloscope .
I used an old TRIO 20MHz oscilloscope to make the picture .
The text ' www.franktechniek.nl' can be changed to your own personal text .
If you want to use this kit to make a dedicated oscilloscope clock , it might be an idea to find a cheap second hand oscilloscope on Ebay .
In that case you get all the important parts you need , the transformer , high voltage circuit , the deflection circuits and last but not least the CRT tube itself .
You could remove the frontpanel , put everything in a new enclosure , and thus build your own unique oscilloscope clock .
The circuit is build around an Atmel microcontroller AtMega8515 .
It drives a dual DAC to generate the x and y voltages .
It has provisions for a DS1302 Real Time Clock too , so it can keep time while the power is off ( RTC option ) .
The board also has provisions for a programming interface , in case you want to develop your own software .
I used the free GCC / AVR C compiler to develop the software .
The software mainly runs around in circles , pumping out the commands to the dual DAC as fast as possible .
Both outputs are updated at the very same moment , resulting in a nice sharp image .
I used large portions of my nixie clock software , so it more or less works and behaves in the same way .
The clock can be calibrated and will run very accurate , typically within 2 - 3 seconds a week .
All settings are done with a single button , in much the same way as with my nixie clocks .
However , with this clock it 's even easier as it presents a nice menu on screen , see below .
The thin horizontal and vertical black lines that we see here , are the oscilloscope 's graticule , not some quirk in the software or electronics .
The kit can be ordered in my web shop .
Also consider the RTC option .
I tried to keep the price low , but making kits in these very low quantities does not allow for a really low price .
On the other hand , this is a rather funny gadget for the home lab .
The software does not have support for a DCF77 signal decoding ( Europe 's atomic radio clock ) because of the limited 2 K program memory .
Perhaps I can add that later , after some optimizations , but I strongly doubt it .
I 've included a day - of - week computation too .
I think it is a very nice kit , and if you can build it into an old oscilloscope , you can be the proud owner of very unique clock .

The letters are Mr. Peavoy ’s only link to his former pen pal .
They never visited or exchanged a single phone call during their four years of college .
They lost touch entirely after graduation , except for the 30 - year reunion of the Maine South High School class of 1965 , held in Washington to accommodate the class ’s most famous graduate , whose husband was then serving his first term in the White House .
“ I was on the White House Christmas card list for a while , ” Mr. Peavoy said .
Besides a quick receiving - line greeting from Mrs. Clinton at the reunion , Mr. Peavoy has had just one direct contact with her in 38 years .
It was , fittingly , by letter , only this time her words were more businesslike .
In the late 1990s , Mr. Peavoy was contacted by the author Gail Sheehy , who was researching a book on the first lady .
He agreed to let Ms. Sheehy see the letters , from which she would quote snippets in her 1999 biography , “ Hillary ’s Choice . ”
When Mrs. Clinton heard that Mr. Peavoy had kept her old letters , she wrote him asking for copies , which he obliged .
He has not heard from her since .
“ For all I know she ’s mad at me for keeping the letters , ” said Mr. Peavoy , a pack rat who says he has kept volumes of letters from friends over the years .
A Democrat , he said he was undecided between supporting Mrs. Clinton and Senator Barack Obama .
Ms. Rodham ’s letters are written in a tight , flowing script with near - impeccable spelling and punctuation .
Ever the pleaser , she frequently begins them with an apology that it had taken her so long to respond .
She praises Mr. Peavoy ’s missives while disparaging her own ( “ my usual drivel ” ) and signs off with a simple “ Hillary , ” except for the occasional “ H ” or “ Me . ”
As one would expect of letters written during college , Ms. Rodham ’s letters display an evolution in sophistication , viewpoint and intellectual focus .
One existential theme that recurs throughout is that Ms. Rodham views herself as an “ actor , ” meaning a student activist committed to a life of civic action , which she contrasts with Mr. Peavoy , who , in her view , is more of an outside critic , or “ reactor . ”

“ Are you satisfied with the part you have cast yourself in ? ” she asks Mr. Peavoy in April 1966 .
“ It seems that you have decided to become a reactor rather than actor — everything around will determine your life . ”

For as long as I can remember , there ’s been an ongoing conflict in my family regarding the complex moral issue of whether toilet paper ( and paper towels ) should be installed in a dispenser so that it rolls over or under .
Some family members feel very strongly about one orientation ; others feel equally strongly about the other .
So whenever someone visits a relative ’s house where the paper is rolling the “ wrong ” way , they ’ll change it — prompting considerable ire from whoever lives there .
Me ?
I ’m agnostic .
I roll both ways .
I suppose if someone twisted my arm and demanded a decision , I ’d side with the “ over ” camp , but it ’s just not something I can get terribly worked up about .
I ’ve read lots of newspaper and magazine articles about this debate over the years , and I think the issues have been explored adequately elsewhere .
What I have not , however , read enough about is how toilet paper ( in the form in which we now know it ) came to exist in the first place .
For most of us in the modern western world , toilet paper is such a basic necessity of life that we simply can’t conceive of how we would function without it .
But in fact , it ’s not that old — and it has a rather interesting history .
This is , I realize , a rather delicate topic , but one well worth a few minutes of consideration .
Stocking the Reading Room
Before toilet paper came into widespread use in the late 19th and early 20th centuries — yes , that recently !
— personal hygiene was typically performed using materials that were a bit less soft and absorbent .
Newspapers , catalogs , and similar reading materials were as likely as they are now to appear in bathrooms , but much less likely to leave the room ( or outhouse , as the case may be ) intact .
Further back in history ( or when paper was otherwise unavailable ) , such items as rags , leaves , and even stones were used .
The ancient Romans reportedly used sponges on sticks .
Perhaps as far back as the sixth century CE , paper was sometimes used for sanitary purposes in China — at least among the wealthy .
In the late 14th century , toilet paper of a sort was made for the Chinese emperor — in large , 2 foot - by - 3 foot ( 0.6 x 0.9 m ) sheets .
But almost 300 years after the invention of the flush toilet in 1596 , there was still no such thing as commercially produced paper designed exclusively as a toilet accessory — and certainly no paper that could safely be flushed .
Paper Trail
When it comes to the origin of what we would today recognize as toilet paper , the historical accounts are hopelessly inconsistent .
( The web , of course , is of little help , since — as usual — most accounts are plagiarized . )
Here are what I believe to be the verifiable facts :
In 1857 , Joseph Gayetty ( not “ Gayette ” or “ Cayetty , ” as his name is often misspelled ) produced the first commercially available toilet paper in the United States .
The tissue was moistened with aloe and sold in packages of 500 individual sheets — each one with a watermark bearing Gayetty ’s name .
It was sold as a medical product , and was not terribly successful .
Brothers Edward , Clarence , and Thomas Scott began selling some kind of toilet paper from a push cart in Philadelphia in 1867 .
( I have been unable to determine what sort of paper this was or where they obtained it , but I assume it was not rolled , perforated paper — they most likely would not have had the means to manufacture it and I could find no record of other companies making it at that time . )
In 1879 , Edward and Clarence Scott founded the Scott Paper Company ( the third brother , Thomas , went into the publishing business instead ) .
Scott toilet paper was sold in rolls that were , apparently , unperforated in the early years .
In addition , the company did not market their products under the Scott brand initially — not wanting to , ah , soil the family ’s good name .
The British Perforated Paper Company began selling some kind of toilet paper — probably not rolled — in England in 1880 .
By 1883 , at least one patent had been issued for a toilet paper roll holder that had a serrated cutting blade .
The Albany Perforated Wrapping ( A.P.W. )
Paper Company was selling rolled , perforated ( and medicated ) toilet paper by 1885 — and possibly as early as 1877 .
A 1935 ad for Northern Tissue boasted that it was “ splinter - free , ” but this does not in any way suggest that all toilet paper prior to that time had splinters !
The first two - ply paper was sold by St. Andrew ’s Paper Mill in England in 1942 .
The biggest uncertainty in this timeline is whether the Scott brothers or the A.P.W.
Company can lay claim to the first sale of the ubiquitous perforated roll .
( Some sources , incidentally , claim that Scott did n’t begin selling rolled toilet paper until 1890 — but also claim they were the first to do so . )
In any case , by the early 1900s — at which time , not coincidentally , flush toilets began to achieve popularity — toilet paper as we now know it was easily found in both the United States and Europe .
And in the 1990s , history came full circle ( so to speak ) as several major toilet paper manufacturers began offering their latest “ innovation ” — toilet paper treated with aloe .
Progress rolls on .

This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on May 7 , 2005 .
Old Wars and New Estonians Accuse Kremlin of Cyberwarfare
A massive denial - of - service attack on Estonian servers has brought down Web sites belonging to government ministries , banks and news outlets .
Russia denies waging cyberwar , but the assaults look connected to a real - world spat between Moscow and its former satellite state .
Dr. Jack Kevorkian has finally completed an eight year prison term .
For what exactly ?
For helping a terminally ill and suffering man exercise his right to a have a dignified and peaceful death .
I find it very irritating that the media has given Dr. Kevorkian the nickname â€ œDr. Deathâ€ as if he were some kind of serial killer .
Dr. Kevorkian has done our society a great service by bringing this issue into the national debate .
On what basis can society deny a person his or her right to die ?
If we truly believe that every individual has the inalienable rights of life , liberty , and property , then the individual cannot be denied this right on any of these measures .
The individual has the right to life but this does not mean that government can force an individual to live .
The individual has the right not to exercise his or her rights .
The individual has the right to keep and bear arms but the government cannot force an individual to own a gun .
The individual has the right to his or her liberty ( provided he or she does not infringe on the liberty of others ) but he or she can willfully surrender his or her liberty to be subjugated to a cult or religion .
The individual has a right to his or her property ( which would include his or her body by the way ) which means he or she can do with it whatever he or she wishes ( again , provided he or she does not infringe on the life , liberty , or property of others ) .
Thomas A. Bowden has an excellent piece on this issue at Capitalism Magazine .
The Declaration of Independence proclaimed , for the first time in the history of nations , that each person exists as an end in himself .
This basic truth–which finds political expression in the right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness–means , in practical terms , that you need no one ’s permission to live , and that no one may forcibly obstruct your efforts to achieve your own personal happiness . [ â€ ¦ ]
For these reasons , each individual has the right to decide the hour of his death and to implement that solemn decision as best he can .
The choice is his because the life is his .
And if a doctor is willing ( not forced ) to assist in the suicide , based on an objective assessment of his patient ’s mental and physical state , the law should not stand in his way .
The fear by those who oppose the inherent right to die is that the government would eventually start killing those who are suffering regardless of the wishes of the individual .
But upon closer inspection , recognizing an individualâ€™s right to choose his or her manner of death is protecting the individualâ€™s right to life .
The individual does not live for the purpose of pleasing society or the religious sensibilities of others .
Mathematician John Paulos has been working hard to help us imagine the amount of money spent to invade and occupy Iraq .
Many experts suggest that it has cost $ 700 billion in direct costs and probably twice that much if you include the indirect costs .
Others estimate the cost at $ 2 trillion .
Paulos asks us to assume that the amount is one trillion , then sets out to help us imagine what one trillion is :
Another way to get at the $ 1 trillion cost of the Iraq War is to note that the Treasury could have used the money to mail a check for more than $ 3,000 to every man , woman and child in the United States .
The latter alternative would have an added benefit : Uniformly distributed and spent in this country , the money would have provided an economic stimulus that the war expenditures have not .
Alternatively , if the money was spent in an even more ecumenical way and a global mailing list was available , the Treasury could have sent a check for more than $ 150 to every human being on earth .
The lives of millions of children , who die from nothing more serious than measles , tetanus , respiratory infections and diarrhea , could be saved , since these illnesses can be prevented by $ 2 vaccines , $ 1 worth of antibiotics , or a 10 - cent dose of oral rehydration salts as well as the main but still very far from prohibitive cost of people to administer the programs .
How about illustrating a trillion by reference to time and money :
It would take almost three decades to spend a trillion dollars at $ 1,000 per second , and if spending at this rate occurred only during business hours , more than 120 years would be required to dispense the sum .
[ These photos are from the March 2007 St. Louis protest of U.S. military action in Iraq ]
Is there any story behind them ?
Were they Onion employees ?
Were they actors ?
Were they just stock photos ?
Were they just folks they found on the street in the early days of the Onion online ?
Does anyone know who these people are , does anyone ever see one of them randomly in the street , and have they ever made public statements in reference to being immortalized in this fashion ?
I have posed several different questions above , but any kind of detail would be quite fascinating after staring at these people 's mugs for so many years .
You know the fake man -on - the - street quotes that the Onion has been doing every week for years ?
There are six different people 's photos they 've used , and I would like to know more .
the asparagus test
Sometimes it ’s hard for us to know when something that used to be a harmless habit is sliding gradually into the area of becoming a real problem .
This simple test from Caroline Knapp ’s book Drinking , A Love Story , can help you decide if you need to take action and change a few things .
She tells the story of a chef friend of hers who discovered that she was alcoholic this way .
Every morning she ’d get up and get ready for work , and one day she was in the shower doing your basic shower - related things , and the entire time she was thinking about the first drink she ’d have that night .
Would it be bourbon , or maybe some wine , or what about a beer … beer is good … do we have enough wine for tonight , or do I have to buy some more , because we do n’t want to run out , GOD that would be terrible … and maybe beer , I should pick up some more beer , too , and …
and so on .
And suddenly she realized that this was how she spent her days .
All day .
Every day .
And it had seemed so , so normal to her .
She thought “ if I replace the alcohol names with “ asparagus ” instead , does it sound a bit crazy ? ”
Every morning she ’d get up and get ready for work , and one day she was in the shower doing your basic shower - related things , and the entire time she was thinking about the first asparagus spear she ’d have that night .
Would it be white asparagus , or maybe some green asparagus , or what about peeled asparagus … peeled asparagus is good … do we have enough green asparagus for tonight , or do I have to buy some more , because we do n’t want to run out , GOD that would be terrible … and maybe peeled asparagus , I should pick up some more peeled asparagus , too , and …
Yes , it sounds a bit crazy .
This is your red flag , your indication that it ’s probably high time you did something about that seemingly - harmless little habit .
That is , of course , the first step of an important journey , and this blog and others can help you find out resources that will support you in your quest .
If you have a habit , be it chemical , physical , mental or digital , take the asparagus test and see how the change in perspective makes you feel and think about the issue .
As always , if you blog it do keep a thought for your privacy when you post .

In our society , the study of language and literature is the domain of poets , novelists , and literary critics .
Language is considered a decorative art , fit for entertainment and culture , but practically useless in comparison to the concrete sciences .
Just look at the value of a college degree in English versus one in computer science or accounting .
But is this an accurate assessment of value ?
Language is the primary conductor between your brain and the minds of your audience .
Ineffective language weakens and distorts ideas .
If you want to be understood , if you want your ideas to spread , using effective language must be your top priority .
In the modern world of business and politics this is hardly ever the case .
In many instances , imprecise language is used intentionally to avoid taking a position and offending various demographics .
No wonder it ’s hard to make sense of anything !
This is hardly a recent problem , and as George Orwell wrote in his 1946 essay , Politics and the English Language , the condition is curable .
By following Orwell ’s 5 rules for effective writing , you ’ll distinguish yourself from competitors and clearly communicate your ideas .
1 . Never use a metaphor , simile , or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print .
This sounds easy , but in practice is incredibly difficult .
Phrases such as toe the line , ride roughshod over , stand shoulder to shoulder with , play into the hands of , an axe to grind , Achilles ’ heel , swan song , and hotbed come to mind quickly and feel comforting and melodic .
For this exact reason they must be avoided .
Common phrases have become so comfortable that they create no emotional response .
Take the time to invent fresh , powerful images .
2 . Never use a long word where a short one will do .
Long words do n’t make you sound intelligent unless used skillfully .
In the wrong situation they ’ll have the opposite effect , making you sound pretentious and arrogant .
They ’re also less likely to be understood and more awkward to read .
When Hemingway was criticized by Faulkner for his limited word choice he replied :
Poor Faulkner .
Does he really think big emotions come from big words ?
He thinks I do n’t know the ten - dollar words .
I know them all right .
But there are older and simpler and better words , and those are the ones I use .
3 . If it is possible to cut a word out , always cut it out .
Great literature is simply language charged with meaning to the utmost possible degree ( Ezra Pound ) .
Accordingly , any words that do n’t contribute meaning to a passage dilute its power .
Less is always better .
Always .
4 . Never use the passive where you can use the active .
This one is frequently broken , probably because many people do n’t know the difference between active and passive verbs .
I did n’t myself until a few months ago .
Here is an example that makes it easy to understand :
The man was bitten by the dog .
( passive ) The dog bit the man . ( active ) .
The active is better because it ’s shorter and more forceful .
5 . Never use a foreign phrase , a scientific word , or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent .
This is tricky because much of the writing published on the internet is highly technical .
If possible , remain accessible to the average reader .
If your audience is highly specialized this is a judgment call .
You do n’t want to drag on with unnecessary explanation , but try to help people understand what you ’re writing about .
You want your ideas to spread right ?
6. Break any of these rules sooner than saying anything outright barbarous .
This bonus rule is a catch all .
Above all , be sure to use common sense .
These rules are easy to memorize but difficult to apply .
Although I ’ve edited this piece a dozen times I ’m sure it contains imperfections .
But trust me , it ’s much better now than it was initially .
The key is effort .
Good writing matters , probably more than you think .
I hope you find these rules helpful , and through their application we ’re able to understand each other a little bit better .
If you enjoyed this post , be sure to read Orwell ’s original essay .
It contains many helpful examples and is , of course , a pleasure to read .
One research center here in Newcastle is putting marine devices to the test in a wave pool , and another is deploying them in the roiling ocean off the Orkneys , the low islands off northernmost Scotland .
The Scottish government has pledged to generate 18 percent of its energy from renewable resources by 2010 .
If marine energy replaces the burning of some fossil fuels like coal , it can help reduce overall carbon dioxide emissions and possibly increase the diversity and security of energy supply , said John Spurgeon , a marine energy specialist in the British Department of Trade and Industry .
Since 1999 , the government has committed more than $ 47 million to research and development , $ 93 million to commercialize that research and additional money to bring the energy into the electrical grid , Mr. Spurgeon said .
No energy source is perfect , though , and marine energy developers are running into some hurdles .
While such generators do not emit smoky pollutants or leave behind radioactive waste , the machines are not small or delicate , and can be an eyesore .
To draw energy from the ocean , they often need to be rooted on sea floors relatively close to shore , or mounted on rocks on the shore — places that have not traditionally been used for energy generation .
And despite their green - friendly intentions , inventors are finding some of the stiffest resistance is coming from environmental groups .
Take the case of Verdant Power , Mr. Corren ’s company , which has been trying for years to erect a small field of tidal turbines in the East River — a project that may finally get started this fall .
Mr. Corren , the company ’s technology director , first developed the turbines as part of a New York University project in the 1980 ’s and planned to attach them to the Roosevelt Island Bridge .
After the school pulled the plug on the project , the design team spent years trying to find a new home .
One executive even brought a prototype to Pakistan , but the data it collected was lost when the computers and instruments went missing .
Verdant embarked on a new East River turbine project in 2003 , but it has taken two and a half years to get regulatory approval for the project from environmental agencies and the United States Army Corp of Engineers .
The issue was not blocking the river to boat traffic , or how it would hook up to the electrical grid or even how it might mar the view , because it is mostly underwater .
It was the fish population of the East River .

Whether you run an entire office or are just the king of your cubicle , there are some pretty easy things that you can do to help make your work space a more environmentally place .
Since it looks like being green is here to stay , it ’s probably about time that you jumped on the bandwagon and took advantage of some simple ways to help reduce your office ’s carbon footprint :
Turn off your computer when you leave for the day .
Unless you ’re planning on coming back in the middle of the night and you absolutely have to have your computer already up and running , go ahead and power down for the night .
.

Turn off the lights in common areas once everyone leaves .
There ’s no point in leaving the light on in the copy room if it ’s going to sit unused for 13 or 14 hours each night .
Same goes for every other common area in your office .

Get some small indoor plants .
If you ’re lucky enough to have an office with a window , most any plant should do ok .
However , if you do n’t have a window , make sure you do a little bit of research and check out which plants can survive in your office without lots of direct sunlight .

Use Energy Star certified equipment .
From your monitor , to your copier to the vending machines in the lunchroom , make sure that all of the equipment you use in the office is Energy Star certified .
Energy efficient 1st replacement windows are another alternative to save you money .
Look for the AAMA Certification .

Start a recycling program .
Get some plastic , glass and aluminum bins for the lunch room , and put recycling boxes in printing rooms .
It ’s pretty easy to do and it might even show that you have some initiative .
That being said , you ’re going to want to make sure that you do n’t recycle company sensitive information ; you ’ll definitely want to shred that instead .

Do n’t print if you do n’t have to .
The biggest use of trees is for paper , so theoretically , if we reduce the amount of paper we use , we ’ll reduce the amount of trees that get cut down .
And if you have to use a ton of paper , go the green route and buy recycled office paper .

Bring in a coffee mug .
Instead of getting a new styrofoam or disposable cup each day , bring in a regular coffee mug from home and just rinse it out at the end of each day .
This is a great and simple way to reduce needless trash .
While this certainly is n’t the be all , end all of ways you can make your office more environmentally friendly , this list is a pretty good place to start .
And the best part is , doing many of these things wo n’t really put you out or force you to change too many habits .
I know it sounds pretty cliche , but if each of us would do just a couple of small things to reduce our impact , we could probably do a lot to help stave off the global environmental crisis .
A photo of Mount Kilimanjaro stripped of its snowcap for the first time in 11,000 years will be used as dramatic testimony for action against global warming as ministers from the world 's biggest polluters meet on Tuesday .
a wake up call
because of global warming
an example of the impact of climate change
The New York Times
Campaigners from Greenpeace , the environmental group , scaled the mountain in November 2002 and held a news conference via satellite with reporters at climate - treaty talks in Morocco .
Last October , Senator John McCain , the Arizona Republican who is co-author of a bill to curb greenhouse gases , displayed before - and - after photographs of Kilimanjaro during a Senate debate .
A British scientist proposed hanging white fabric over the glacier 's ragged 10 - story - tall edges to block sunlight and stem the erosion .
An Inconvenient Truth
R&D
Most scientists attribute the reduction to the effects of global warming
Salon
another unbearable loss of an overheating planet .
global warming
is happening -- and having serious consequences -- right now
Warming and resultant drying soils have decreased snowfall atop the mountain
The researchers attributed the ice decline to complex interacting factors , including the vertical shape of the ice 's edge , which allows it to shrink but not expand .
Decreased snowfall , which reduces ice buildup and determines how much energy the ice absorbs , also plays a role .
Much of Kilimanjaro 's ice is vanishing by sublimation -- where ice at very low temperatures converts straight to water vapor without going through a watery phase -- rather than by melting , the scientists said .
Fluctuating weather patterns related to the Indian Ocean also could affect the shifting balance between the ice 's increase , which might have occurred for decades before the first explorers reached Kilimanjaro 's summit in 1889 , and the shrinking that has been going on since .
Indeed , warming fails spectacularly to explain the behavior of the glaciers and plateau ice on Africa 's Kilimanjaro massif , just 3 degrees south of the equator , and to a lesser extent other tropical glaciers .
The disappearing ice cap of the " shining mountain , " which gets a starring role in the movie , is not an appropriate poster child for global climate change .
Rather , extensive field work on tropical glaciers over the past 20 years by one of us ( Kaser ) reveals a more nuanced and interesting story .
The role of solar radiation in shaping the ice edges is evident in other features as well .
As the ice retreats horizontally , it can leave behind knife - thin vertical remnants that eventually become so thin that they fall over and disintegrate .
Like other explorers who came before them , Kaser and Hardy also noted the sculpted features called penitentes in the Kibo ice cap on several occasions .
Penitentes are seen also in many places in the Andes and the Himalaya , where they are sometimes much larger .
These finger - like features arise when initial irregularities in a flat surface result in the collection of dust in pockets , which accelerates melting in those places by enhancing absorption of solar radiation .
The cups between the penitentes are protected from ventilation even as wind brushing the peaks of the developing spires enhances sublimation , which cools the surface .
If infrared radiation and sensible heat transfer were the dominant factors , these sculpted features would not long survive .
Solar radiation and sublimation are sculptors ; infrared radiation and sensible heat transfer are diffuse , coming equally from all directions , and so they are smoothers .
The prevalence of sculpted features on Kilimanjaro 's peak provides strong evidence against the role of smoothers , which are energetically closely related to air temperature .
Ironically , substantial global warming accompanied by an increase in precipitation might be one way to save Kilimanjaro 's ice .
Or substantially increased snowfall , like the 2006 - 07 snows , could blanket the dark ash surface so thickly that the snow would not sublimate entirely before the next wet season .
Once initiated , such a change could allow the ice sheet to grow .
If the Kibo ice cap is vanishing or growing , reshaping itself into something different as you read this , glaciology tells us that it 's unlikely to be the first or the last time .
It ’s no secret that I am an AGW skeptic .
That is I ’m not convinced that there is anthropogenic global warming .
That does n’t mean one who says there is no warming merely one who thinks it is not human induced .
So get out the stakes and pile up the fire wood .
A heretic needs to be burned .
One reason , but not the only one , that I ’m a skeptic is I do n’t trust the other side .
They consistently exaggerate , distort or even lie .
I ’ve documented many of those lies in this blog .
And here is another one .
Consider this story from Reuters
They quoted Steve Howard of the Climate Group lobby saying : “ This isand an unequivocal message that a low - carbon global economy is necessary , achievable and affordable . ”
Reuters directly stated that the picture showed “ Kilimanjaro almost bare of its icecap . ” Maybe Climate Group is just a small fringe group .
But World Wildlife Fund released their own “ report ” .
As the BBC reported : “ As , WWF says that the ice - cap on Mount Kilimanjaro has shrunk by more than 80 % since 1900 .
” At a symposium on climate change Professor John Harte of the University of California presented numerous scary scenarios of global warming .
And one he mentioned was : “ By 2020 , the snows of Kilimanjaro could be no more . ”
But as we ’ve already seen Harte was n’t alone with this assertion .
Al Gore used pictures of Kilimanjaro in his doomsday docudrama .
He said the receding snows were caused by global warming .
magazine told readers “ Scientists now expect the snows to be gone completely by 2015 . , to which humanity ’s industrial energy consumption is at least a partial , if not a major contributor . ” magazine , in co-operation with National Public Radio ’s “ Living on Earth ” and U.C. Berkeley ’s Graduate School of Journalism did a series “ Reports From a Warming Planet ” which stated that the shrinking ice on Kilimanjaro is “ WorldChanging warned us that photos of Kilimanjaro “ are useful for making visceral the often - academic discussion of carbon and timelines , and for driving home the point thatis n’t a problem off in the future , but it .
” One university student who saw Gore ’s docudrama wrote that he was “ particularly moved by the scene depicting the melting snows of Mount Kilimanjaro . ”
He says the “ documentary ” caused him “ to connect some thematic dots in my mind ” .
And he got the message Gore intended .
The snows were melting and he knows why .
“ What caused this decline ?
What concurrence happened in the last 100 years ?
The answer : the Industrial Revolution and global warming .. ”
And on this he says there “ is no doubt in the scientific community .
” Apparently he and Gore and many others are wrong .
The consensus has fallen apart .
Of course those insane warming skeptics have been saying that the decline of the snows on Kilimanjaro were not related to warming .
But the media cranked up their scare stories , Al Gore released his film , and numerous environmental groups all said the skeptics were merely in the pay of Big Oil .
How many times have we heard that line ?
Now it should have been obvious that global warming had nothing to do with the change in snow levels .
The summit of the mountain is so high the temperature rarely gets above freezing .
But over and over the environmental doom sayers were arguing that warming was the culprit .
Now CNN reports that “ the disappearance of Kilimanjaro ’s ice is driven by solar radiation . ”
And this is not the first time that claims of warming induced melting have proven less than accurate ( also see here ) .
They report : Mote and Kaser say that Kilimanjaro ’s images in Gore ’s film startled the audience , as the college student mentioned above illustrates .
But they also say Indeed Kilimanjaro “ has gained and lost ice through processes that bear only indirect connections , if any , to recent trends in global climate . ”
They also find that “ lines of evidence do not suggest that any warming at Kilimanjaro ’s summit has been large enough to explain the disappearance of most of its ice , during the whole 20th century or during the best - measured period , the last 25 years . ”
But increased solar radiation “ in conditions of very light wind ... allows a warm layer of air to develop just next to the ice .
” Now the following quote is important .
So the presence of these penitentes is evidence of solar induced melting not temperature - related melting .
And they are also found in the Andes and Himilaya ranges as well .
That would appear to mean that some melting seen in those massive mountain ranges , which have also been used to “ prove ” AGW theory , is not due to warming either .
Here is the bizarre aspect of all of this .
Global warming might be a necessary ingredient to save the snows of Kilimanjaro .
Part of the problem for Kilimanjaro is that the ice has formed into steep walls .
This makes accumulation of new snow difficult or impossible .
New snow disappears in a few days .
If the glacier shape were different snow could accumulate and the mass would grow .
And a warmer mountain would change the shape of the snow pack .
The authors note that this warmer climate “ would gradually erode the sharp corners of the ice cap ; gentler slopes would quickly develop . ”
And the change in the slope would “ permit the ice cap to grow . ”
They conclude : The disappearance of the snows of Kilimanjaro is not related to global warming at all .
But global warming might be their salvation .
Ironic indeed .

Travelers Beware : Or Be Caught in a Bureaucratic Nightmare
Brian Tamanaha
If you plan to travel abroad any time in the next six months , read this post .
On April 4th , my wife and I went to the post office with all the documents required to renew our seven - year - old son ’s passport .
After waiting only an hour and a half in line , the courteous clerk efficiently handled the paperwork and assured us that we would receive the passport by mail within eight weeks .
That was almost three months ago .
My wife is taking the kids to visit her family abroad .
The departure date is this Sunday , July 1 .
We have paid for non-refundable tickets in the amount of $ 2,400 .
Everyone is excited , especially her parents , who see their grandchildren only once a year .
The only problem is that the passport has not arrived .
About two weeks ago we became a bit concerned , and began calling the toll free number for the passport agency .
Many times when you call the message will tell you that they are too busy to receive your call , and it hangs up .
We went on the passport internet site and registered our request , receiving an assurance that we would get an update within days ( still waiting for that ) .
Finally , after calling many times ( and after being on hold for many minutes ) , last Tuesday we reached a live person .
What a relief !
She cheerily told us that she would indicate on our file that the passport must be expedited , and she assured us we would receive the passport by express mail within three days .
Great !
That was n’t so bad after all .
It did n’t come .
Last Friday night , now truly concerned , we reached another live person .
She told us that there was no indication in the file that anything had been done on the passport , and she said that we should call again on Monday .
I asked her if we could go into the passport office ( in Manhattan ) to get the passport in person .
She said that they would only see us within three days of the scheduled departure date , so we had to wait until then to try that approach .
Monday arrived and , you guessed it , no passport .
We reached a live person again ( after many calls and much waiting ) .
The apologetic fellow told us that nothing had been done on the passport .
After almost three months and several calls and assurances , it sits without movement in Stage One ( “ received but not processed at all ” ) .
My guess is that it takes about five minutes at most to verify and input the information necessary to renew a passport , so they must be busy .
It is possible to get a passport in person if you are near an office .
But you are allowed entry into the passport office only if you have an appointment .
Unfortunately , as we learned today , the soonest available appointment is several days after the scheduled departure date .
Had the first person we talked to advised us to try and get an appointment immediately , we might have had a chance .
Now it is too late .
Despite being told that we must wait until three days before departure , as it turns out there is no special allowance for people within three days of departure .
Trip in a couple of days , applied three months ago , but no appointment , so too bad .
I asked the nice fellow on the line whether it would help if we showed up at the office with kids in tow and plane tickets in hand , our desperation showing on our faces ; he said that they “ almost certainly ” would not let us in .
We have decided to try anyway .
He sounded sympathetic , but assured me that there was nothing he could do .
When I asked him to be honest about our prospects , he said it “ looks rough ” ( meaning : virtually no chance in hell you will get a passport before your scheduled departure ) .
There was little point in being angry , so I thanked him for his candor , and that was it .
It ’s depressing to have done everything right in ample time , and yet be in this position .
Fortunately , I am comforted by knowing that my country loves me , and is doing everything it can for me .
Meanwhile , we have to tell the grandparents that they wo n’t see their grandchildren next week ( and probably not this summer ) because it takes more than three months to get a passport renewed in the U.S.
I prefer not to think about the money we have lost on the tickets through no fault of our own .
Just imagine how bad things must be for people who live in a place less efficient than our own great country .
Anyone out there who is scheduled to travel and needs a new passport , take my word for it :
Do n’t believe what you are told .

A friend recently lent us her DVDs for the first season of Numb3rs .
We watched the pilot episode last night , which was quite enjoyable .
In one scene , an older scientist is telling the younger that geniuses ( in the science field ) usually make their large discoveries over a short period of time – maybe 5 to 8 years of their entire career , which may last many decades .
I ’ve heard this more than once .
I ’ve also heard that this genius period for scientists usually occurs quite early on – most likely while the person is in their 20’s .
I do n’t know if either of these statements are true .
But let ’s assume they are and see if we can come up with reasons as to why .
And maybe even how we may maximize our probability of genius .
Hey , it ’s pure speculation , but this ai n’t the New England Journal of Medicine …
IEEE Standard Poodle ( har , har … )
Question # 1 : Why does this genius period not usually happen before the 20’s ?
If youth and neuroplasticity were the prime prerequisites for scientific breakthroughs , it would seem that geniuses would be more likely to do better work in their teens , rather than their 20’s .
Sure there are long lists of child prodigies , but are prodigies geniuses ?
Consult the Holy Book of Wiki ( recognizing that many do not have complete faith in the accuracy of these scriptures ) .
According to Wikipedia , a child prodigy is someone who masters one or more skills at an earlier than average age .
On the other hand , it says that a genius is someone who displays great intelligence and originality in thinking .
That ’s not quite the same thing ( at least to me ) , though the entry does claim that many geniuses start off as child prodigies .
I ’m more inclined to assign “ genius ” status to those who make significant intellectual breakthroughs and contributions to scientific knowledge – not those who just blow through school fast enough to enter university at age 11 ( maximum respek , though… ) .
So here ’s my answer for Question # 1 .
One reason why the genius “ breakthrough ” period may not occur earlier , is because you have n’t yet had higher education in your chosen field , and therefore do n’t possess the theoretical “ toolbox ” ( i.e. fundamentals of the discipline ) in order to have a decent framework from which to attack problems .
Sure Wiki says that many genii begin as child prodigies and they no doubt start filling their toolboxes earlier , but the key word is “ many ” , not “ most ” .
Our premise was that most geniuses make their breakthroughs in their 20’s .
So assuming this theoretical toolbox is so important , that leads to …
Question # 2 : Why are n’t great discoveries continuously made by genii after the 20’s ?
Could it be that most scientists in their 20’s only recently completed university and therefore the fundamental theorems are still fresh in their minds ?
We science types know that once we leave academia for industry , most of what we learned in college is quickly forgotten .
Maybe … but it seems to me that most brilliant people end up having university and / or research related careers .
If it ’s soley the theoretical toolbox that ’s important , research types only continue to add to their toolbox each year .
Therefore you ’d expect the number of great discoveries per decade to increase as these people worked through their 30’s , 40’s , 50’s , and beyond .
But we ’re told that ’s not the case .
Now I ’m sure that neuroplasticity plays some role , but I ’m betting with Question # 2 that something else may ( also ) be at work – the so - called beginner ’s mind .
When you ’re in your 20’s , you have enough of a theoretical framework to keep you from completely stabbing in the dark while you problem - solve , but your theory is n’t so solid that you immediately rule out “ crazy ” , “ unreasonable ” , or “ previously disproven ” ideas that your more experienced ( older ) collegues automatically would .
“ In the beginner ’s mind there are many possibilities , but in the expert ’s mind there are few . ” – Shunryo Suzuki
Likewise , as a beginner you do n’t yet completely trust the few fundamentals you do have in your toolbox .
Part of being open to possibilities includes doubting – doubting whether what others accept as true ( those fundamentals ) , might in fact be wrong .
Do n’t many breakthroughs come from disproving what was , up until that point , unquestionably true ?
Final question …
Cognitive Prodigy
Question # 3 : Are we doomed to low probability of insightful breakthroughs after we leave our 20’s , or is there something we can do to improve our odds ?
Well we could always read and ponder Suzuki ’s Book , and try to keep a fresh , open mind .
But I ’d be leading you astray if I told you to look there .
The book was n’t really meant to be a How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci .
More of a “ How to Keep Your Meditation Practice Productive ” .
But I think there ’s a lot of crossover potential in the basic idea …
Here ’s an alternative suggestion .
Make sure you do n’t stay at the same job for too long .
It ’s one thing to attempt to cultivate a beginner ’s mind when it ’s SSDD ( and that ’s not “ single sided , double density ” ) , but quite another to be thrown into beginner ’s mind and unable to escape it , when you find yourself , once again , truly a newbie .
For all of you graduate degree - ers out there ( who had honest advisors ) , were n’t you told it would be best for your growth to leave your undergraduate alma mater and go somewhere else for graduate work – so that you ’re exposed to new ideas and new ways of thinking ?
Four or five years in the same place – then on to somewhere new .
That ’s sounds about like the right time frame .
I made an employment change recently after 7 years and now realize I stayed about 2 years too long .
Just something to ponder – especially if you ’re bored , unchallenged , or just plain unhappy at your job but still find yourself showing up at the same place to do it year after year .
Let ’s close with some quotes from the Suzuki book .
Sure he ’s talking about Zen , but you know it applies elsewhere :
In the beginner ’s mind , there are many possibilities .
In the expert ’s mind there are few .
If your mind is empty , it is always ready for anything .
It is open to everything .
This is also the secret of the arts .
Always be a beginner .
It is the open mind , the attitude that includes both doubt and possibility , the ability to see things always as fresh and new .
It is needed in all aspects of life .
If you discriminate too much , you limit yourself .
And for the truly brave and adventurous out there , how can you take this idea to the Green Beret level ?
You not only periodically change jobs , but occasionally change careers . 😉
In a broadly worded legal opinion , the Justice Department has concluded that President Bush ’s former top lawyer , and possibly other senior White House officials , can ignore subpoenas from Congress to testify about the firings of U.S. attorneys .
The three - page opinion raises questions about whether the Justice Department would prosecute senior administration officials if Congress voted to hold them in contempt for not cooperating with the investigation into the firing last year of eight top prosecutors .
The opinion was prepared this week by the department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , in response to questions from former White House Counsel Harriet E. Miers , who was subpoenaed to testify today before the House Judiciary Committee .
Miers told the panel in a letter faxed Tuesday night that she would not appear , citing the Justice memo and advice from the White House .
Under the law , the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia decides whether to pursue contempt of Congress cases .
Though that official can exercise independent judgment , some legal experts said it might be hard to ignore the opinion from the legal counsel office , whose decisions are often viewed as controlling throughout the federal government .
Advertisement
Others said that , as an alternative , lawmakers might seek the appointment of an independent special counsel to investigate any contempt charges .
The legal opinion surfaced as another former White House official , Sara M. Taylor , testified Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the U.S. attorney case .
Taylor was the White House political director and reported to longtime Bush advisor Karl Rove .
Like Miers , Taylor was ordered by the White House earlier this week not to answer Congress ’ questions concerning internal deliberations about the fired prosecutors .
During her appearance , however , and periodically consulting with her attorney , she tried to walk a legal tightrope , answering what she described as “ fact - based ” questions , in an apparent effort to dissuade committee members from finding her in contempt .
Advertisement
She testified , for example , that she had never discussed the firings with Bush or attended meetings with the president where the issue was discussed .
“ I do n’t believe that anybody in the White House did any wrongdoing , ” she said , describing the firings as “ awkwardly handled . ”
Taylor , 32 , said she did not personally add or remove names to the list of prosecutors to be dismissed .
But she declined to answer when asked who was responsible for preparing the list .
She said she received complaints from persons outside the White House about U.S. attorneys but could not recall specific phone calls .
She acknowledged writing an e-mail in which she called one of the fired U.S. attorneys “ lazy . ”
She testified that she regretted the remark .

Democrats said that they found answers of the former aide to be self - serving , and that they were still considering holding Taylor in contempt .
“ You seem to be selective in the use of the presidential privilege , ” said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin ( D - Md. ) .
“ It seems like you ’re saying that , ‘ Yes , I ’m giving you all the information I can , ’ when it is self - serving to the White House , but not allowing us to have the information and make independent judgments . ”
House members were hoping that , like Taylor , Miers would choose to answer some questions .
They said her decision not to appear was unexpected .
Correspondence released by the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday showed that Miers , through her attorney , had asked White House Counsel Fred F. Fielding whether she had to attend the hearing to personally assert the privilege .
After consulting the Justice Department , Fielding wrote back saying that Miers had “ absolute immunity from compelled Congressional testimony ” and that “ the president has directed her not to appear . ”
Advertisement
The position prompted an angry response from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) and Rep. Linda T. Sanchez ( D - Lakewood ) , chairwoman of the commercial and administrative law subcommittee .
“ We are aware of absolutely no court decision that supports the notion that a former White House official has the option of refusing to even appear in response to a congressional subpoena , ” Conyers and Sanchez wrote to George T. Manning , Miers ’ lawyer .
“ A refusal to appear ... could subject Ms. Miers to contempt proceedings . ”
Miers , who left the White House in January , was counsel to the president in the winter of 2005 when the fate of the U.S. attorneys in Bush ’s second term was first being discussed .
The White House has said that Miers once suggested that all 93 U.S. attorneys be dismissed .
Some legal experts said they disagreed with the sweeping privilege that the administration was claiming .
Advertisement
“ The privilege does not entitle you to refuse to appear .
The privilege entitles you to refuse to answer questions when you appear if those questions call for privileged information , ” said Stephen Gillers , a legal ethics professor at New York University law school .
“ No one can claim the privilege entitles you to ignore the body that subpoenas you . ”
“ Miers should show up , ” said Mark J. Rozell , a political science professor and expert on executive privilege at George Mason University .
“ There is no reason that she cannot answer questions about matters unrelated to presidential confidentiality and then refuse certain questions that she believes violate that principle .
“ Besides , the White House dumped a lot of the burden for this fiasco on her shoulders , so she has the most incentive to talk and clear herself . ”
The Justice Department memo cited a 1999 opinion of then - Atty .
Gen. Janet Reno in which Reno concluded that the White House did not have to turn over documents to Congress about a decision by President Clinton to commute the prison sentences of 16 members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group convicted of bomb - making and other crimes .
Advertisement
Reno held that because the pardon power was an exclusive right of the executive branch , Congress had no right to the documents .
Though Bush has the power to hire and fire U.S. attorneys , some observers said the two cases were not necessarily comparable .
Unlike the pardon power , Congress has “ constitutional authority to create and regulate the general conditions of appointment and removal for U.S. attorneys , ” said Peter M. Shane , a professor at Ohio State University law school .
“ Moreover , it is entitled to investigate whether executive branch officials who have already testified under oath have testified truthfully . ”
The Justice Department memo underscores inherent conflicts of interest in possible prosecutions arising from the firings .
Paul D. Clement , a senior Justice official who has been designated the acting attorney general for purposes of the investigation , has already advised Fielding on his view of the breadth of executive privilege .
Advertisement
The latest memo “ gives them some cover to avoid pursuing prosecution , ” Rozell said .
There ’s “ probably little chance ” that the Justice Department will follow through and prosecute , said Louis Fisher , an executive privilege specialist at the Library of Congress .
“ But that does n’t save Miers from the awful ordeal of a contempt [ proceeding ] by one of the chambers . ”
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment about how the agency would handle such a referral .
“ The question is a hypothetical , so we wo n’t speculate , ” Erik Ablin said .

The documents also show that derailing enemy propaganda was important to senior Marine commanders , including Col. Stephen W. Davis , a highly regarded regimental commander under General Huck , who played down questions about the civilian killings from a Time magazine reporter last year , long after the attacks and the civilian toll were clear to the military .
“ Frankly , what I am looking at is the advantage he ’s giving the enemy , ” Colonel Davis said of the reporter , Tim McGirk , whose article in March 2006 was the first to report that marines had killed civilians in Haditha , including women and children .
In their sworn statements , General Huck and his subordinates say they dismissed Mr. McGirk ’s inquiries because they saw him as a naïve conduit for the mayor of Haditha , whom the Marines believed to be an insurgent .
Four officers were charged with failing to properly investigate the civilian killings .
The first hearing against one of the officers , Capt .
Randy W. Stone , is set for Tuesday morning , in a military courtroom at Camp Pendleton , Calif .
Three enlisted marines are charged with the killings .
Their hearings , to determine whether the charges warrant general courts - martial , are set to begin in the coming weeks .
As Marine Corps prosecutors prepare their evidence against Captain Stone and his fellow officers , the unclassified documents suggest that senior Marine commanders dismissed , played down or publicly mischaracterized the civilian deaths in ways that a military investigation found deeply troubling .
The documents suggest that General Huck ignored early reports that women and children were killed in the attack , and later told investigators that he was unaware of regulations that required his staff to investigate further .
The documents , including a report by Maj. Gen. Eldon A. Bargewell of the Army , copies of e-mail messages among Marine officers in Haditha and sworn statements from several ranking officers , focus only on how the Marine chain of command handled the killings and have not been made public .
Portions of the report and commanders ’ reactions to the killings were reported by The Washington Post in January and April .
The documents were provided to The New York Times by people familiar with the investigation only on condition that they not be identified .
Captain Stone , 34 , of Dunkirk , Md. , is accused of failing to investigate reports of the civilian deaths .
In an interview that repeated similar frustrations voiced by lawyers for other accused officers , Captain Stone said he did not investigate the killings because his superiors told him not to .

Over the past couple of months , the British public have been subject to a widespread poster campaign , imploring them to join the " Information Revolution " .
Posters have appeared in train carriages , buses , and restrooms , plastered in self - consciously militant leftist graphics , demanding freedom of expression and choice .
Initially , the posters appeared with no indication of who was behind them , perhaps in the hope that some would be sufficiently naïve about advertising finance to believe this was a genuine guerrilla movement .
Sadly not .
It is just very naïve guerrilla marketing .
The instigators came out of the bushes a few weeks ago .
To the surprise of nobody , it turned out to be one of Google 's competitors .
Ask.com is one of the many search engines that has been pushed to the margins since Google came to dominate the web in the late nineties .
Ask.com believes that a single dominant search engine threatens the cosmopolitanism of the public sphere , citing Karl Popper 's notion of the " open society " as the best basis for building new , more inclusive norms for the digital age .
Oh all right , they do n't .
But they 'd quite like a few more click - throughs .
The Information Revolution campaign betrays an innocence about the twenty - first century economy that is both embarrassing and dumb .
Let 's take embarrassing first .
You say you want a revolution
When Thomas Frank coined the phrase " the conquest of cool " in his 1997 book of the same name , he was referring to the way radical ideas , icons , and movements were being co-opted into the advertising strategies of multinational companies .
Companies like Nike and Apple invited people to stand out from the crowd , do their own thing , resist convention .
Management consultancies entered companies , telling people to embrace chaos , over - turn hierarchy , be creative .
It was all a great new way of making money .
These strategies are only sinister when they work .
One of Apple 's best campaigns included a vast black and white photograph of a young Miles Davis holding his trumpet , above their old slogan , " Think Different " .
What was so troubling about it was the photo was so beautiful .
It tugged at one 's desire to be like that .
It made you want to buy an iMac .
How dare they ?
By contrast , the Information Revolution posters are like a suburban uncle who turns up to a fancy - dress party dressed as Rambo .
Its website includes the cringe - inducing sub- headings " The Movement " , " The Word on the Street " , and " Join Us " .
Click on the latter and you find the cry " The Internet needs YOU !
Fight the mind control !
Do n't worry you do n't all have to take to the streets ( you can if you want to , but we wo n't pay your bail - and we 're happy with sofa - bound revolutionaries as well ! ) " .
Ouch .
Alain de Botton , writing in The Architecture of Happiness ( Pantheon Books , 2006 ) has a section on elegance that any software designer will find familiar .
He compares the Salginatobel Bridge , in Switzerland …
… to the Clifton Suspension Bridge , in England :
… in one of the most amazing books about architecture I ’ve ever read :
“ Both Robert Maillart ’s Salginatobel and Isambard Brunel ’s Clifton Suspension bridges are structures of strength ; both attract our veneration for carrying us safely across a fatal drop — and yet Maillart ’s bridge is the more beautiful of the pair for the exceptionally nimble , apparently effortless way in which it carries out its duty .
With its ponderous masonry and heavy steel chains , Brunel ’s construction has something to it of a stocky middle - aged man who hoists his trousers and loudly solicits the attention of others before making a jump between two points , whereas Maillart ’s bridge resembles a lithe athlete who leaps without ceremony and bows demurely to his audience before leaving the stage .
Both bridges accomplish daring feats , but Maillart ’s possesses the added virtue of making its achievement look effortless — and because we sense it is n’t , we wonder at it and admire it all the more .
The bridge is endowed with a subcategory of beauty we can refer to as elegance , a quality present whenever a work of architecture succeeds in carrying out an act of resistance — holding , spanning , sheltering — with grace and economy as well as strength ; when it has the modesty not to draw attention to the difficulties it has surmounted . ”
In that context , I ’d like revisit my recent themes of choices and simplicity and add a third concept , elegance .
People , for the most part , are not playing with their software because they want to .
They ’re using the software as a tool to accomplish something else that they would like to do .
Maybe they are using a chat program to try and seem witty , in hopes that the person they are chatting with will want to spend time with them , so that , ultimately , they have a better chance of getting laid , so that , ultimately , their selfish DNA will get to replicate itself .
Maybe they are using a spreadsheet to try and figure out if they can afford a bigger apartment , so that , ultimately , dates will be more impressed when they come over , increasing their chance of getting laid , again , benefitting the DNA .
Maybe they ’re working on a PowerPoint for the boss so that they will get a promotion so that they ’ll have more money which they can use to rent a larger apartment that would attract mates , thus increasing their chance of getting laid , ( getting the idea yet ? ) so the selfish DNA can replicate .
Maybe they are looking for a recipe for goat cheese ravioli on the Internet , etc. , etc. , … DNA .
Unless they ’re software reviewers for a living , they do n’t really care about the software itself , and the more they notice it , the more annoyed they ’re going to be .
Choices , therefore , can be good or bad .
They ’re good when they support the task the user is trying to accomplish fairly directly .
I want to be able to choose who to chat with ( duh . )
They ’re bad when they represent an intrusion into the user ’s actual DNA - replication goals .
Every few days some crappy software I can’t even remember installing pops up noisy bulletins asking me if I want to upgrade something or other .
I could not care LESS .
I ’m doing something .
Leave me alone !
I ’m sure that the team at Sun Microsystems who just released this fabulous new version of the Java virtual machine have been thinking about the incremental release night and day for months and months , but the other 5,000,000,000 of us here on the planet really do n’t give a flying monkey .
You just cannot imagine how little I want to spend even three seconds of my life thinking about whether or not to install that new JVM .
Somebody out there is already firing up Gmail to tell me that the JVM must n’t just upgrade itself “ because that might break something . ”
Yeah , if the entire collective wisdom of the Java development team does n’t know if it ’s going to break something , how am I supposed to know ?
Sheeesh .
If you ’re using the term simplicity to mean “ grace and economy ” or “ elegance , ” that ’s terrific .
A great example of this is the difference between the way you search for music on Rhapsody and the way you search for music on iTunes .
Rhapsody makes you decide if you want to search for albums , tracks , or artists .
iTunes does n’t give you any choice : it just searches all fields , which works just as well and is easier .
Economy means power , in this case , and it ’s a feature .
On the other hand , if you ’re using simplicity to mean a lack of power , a lack of features , that ’s fine , if you want to be in the paper clip business , good luck with that , but the chances that your product will solve my exact problems starts to shrink and your potential market share does , too .
You want a scapegoat for the dollar ’s almost daily decline - the Chinese water torture on the U.S. economy ?
I blame Steve Jobs .
I mean Apple is the worst offender in the decline of U.S. manufacturing .
Their well paid engineers sit around in air - conditioned offices on streets with cutesy names like Infinite Loop in Cupertino , California and have others make stuff for them .
They imported some 2 million iPods assembled by thousands and thousands of Chinese workers just last quarter - an almost $ 1.5 billion annualized trade deficit in iPods alone .
Those in Washington that can do something about this – former railroaders and soon breakfast cereal moguls , are so worried about trade deficits that they refuse to defend the once mighty greenback , even begging the Chinese to unpeg the renminbi from the dollar so we can decline against it as well .
We ’re in a place called Vertigo .
Economists weep every news cycle that foreigners will no longer fund our spending and that America surely has peaked .
The dollar is destined to the depths of despair until it drops so low that we get those manufacturing jobs back .
Gee , thanks Steve Jobs .
A $ 1.5 billion trade deficit increases wealth in the U.S. by some $ 16 billion – I ’ll take that trade any day .
I checked my wallet and realized that I own dollars , including my bank account , house and stocks .
Lowering them in value hurts every American .
I was in such a funk thinking about all this that I played my own infinite loop of Muddy Waters and B.B.
King on my appropriately blue iPod mini .
While needlessly fidgeting , I happened to turn it over and read the fine print .
Sure enough – it says “ Assembled in China . ”
But it also says “ Designed by Apple in California . ”
In the middle of the song “ Trouble No More , ” it all started making sense .
Over the last year , two things have happened .
First , Apple has increased their sales by over a third , almost all of it from increased sales of iPods – those 2 million of them at $ 265 each last quarter and another 100 million songs sold via their iTunes service .
An iPod is just the combination some Apple software , cheap disk drives and a $ 12 chip a Silicon Valley company named PortalPlayer .
I calculated that Apple pays $ 200 each per iPod to Chinese assembler Inventec to slap it all together .
Even with cheap labor , Inventec has almost no profits , I ’d bet under $ 10 , probably more like $ 4 .
PortalPlayer , by the way , emails their design to Taiwan to be fabricated , with profits of some $ 5 per chip .
The second change since a year ago is that Apple ’s stock has gone from $ 21 to $ 64 .
Pretty cool , capitalism at its best .
Why ?
Because Apple keeps $ 65 per iPod - money chases profits !
If you assume the stock increase is all due to the iPod ( it is ) , then that business is worth some $ 15 billion .
Add in PortalPlayer ’s market value of almost $ 1 billion and you start to get a feel for how the world works .
A $ 1.5 billion trade deficit increases wealth in the U.S. by some $ 16 billion – I ’ll take that trade any day .
So will all the holders of the retirement accounts at Vanguard and Fidelity and Janus and Lord Abbett who own Apple ’s stock .
Why am I caring about deficits again ?
Trade deficits are just an economic construct , and lowering the dollar wo n’t solve a thing .
We are already moving low margin , low paying jobs overseas , but fortunately , are left with high margin , high paying intellectual property jobs .
Would you rather own Apple making a margin of $ 65 or Invetec with $ 4 , on the same product ?
Me too .
We may have trade deficits of $ 550 billion this year and , but we enjoy a huge margin surplus .
The very illogical way ( so no one believes it ) to get this all back in balance is for the dollar to RISE - require more TVs and BMWs to pay for our intellectual property .
A lower dollar means foreigners get a needless discount on our productive stuff - Pentiums and iPods and Windows XP and Oracle databases and Cisco routers .
They have to buy them anyway to run their economies ( well , maybe not iPods ) so why the discount ?
Add non-productive but life enhancing intellectual property to complete the sweep - drugs and Hollywood movies and U2 .
A weak dollar wo n’t bring back manufacturing jobs – with $ 20 / hour manufacturing jobs in the U.S. vs. $ 2 in China , the dollar would have to drop an unlikely 90 % .
And why should we be encouraging low paying jobs in this country ?
Foreigners buy our Treasury bonds they own 43 % of them in effect so we do n’t have to .
Who wants 3 % returns ?
We can and should own stocks of the high margin companies that benefit from this design vs. manufacturing divide .
As we move to an intellectual property economy , our wealth will come from exporting our profitable designs and importing more finished goods .
Its higher salaries and our stock market that balances this all out as those dollars flow back in .
Of course , bean counters can’t find the money that flows into the stock market , it is just bean dip .
$ 4 + trillion in trade deficits since 1976 has been matched by an $ 11 trillion increase in value of our stock market .
That ’s about all you have to know .
Plus , as Jack Nicholson might say , they ca n’t handle our dollars .
Too many dollars in foreign central banks leads to over - lending by their banks to wasteful domestic companies .
Japan is just emerging 15 years later from a non-performing loan hangover – China is face first in the punch bowl with potentially half their bank loans uncollectible .
If their currency spikes , it might go to 100 % .
Rather than debase our wallets , Japan and China and even Europeans have to buy dollar assets to keep their currencies from rising too much if they want to continue to sell us their industrial output , while of course , we get rich selling them the tools to do it productively .
I ’d suggest thanking Bono , er , Steve Jobs for the iPod economy .
Andy Kessler is the author of Running Money ( HarperBusiness , 2004 )
Mick Jagger , Profit Maximizer
Today is the birth date of Michael Philip Jagger , known to the world as Mick .
As true fans know , Jagger is n’t just the long - tenured front man of the Rolling Stones ; he was also a student of finance and accounting at the London School of Economics .
He did not graduate from LSE , however ; he attended for just a short time .
I have read that he was asked to leave after riding a motorcycle through the library , but I doubt this is true — not just because it seems very unlikely , but because Jagger has never been as wild as his image .
I mean this as a compliment .
Notwithstanding his short tenure at LSE , I do believe that Jagger is supremely smart when it comes to running a business .
And that is what the Rolling Stones have primarily been for the past 20 or 30 years : a business , and a very well - run one .
I have always thought that Jagger ’s talents as CEO were overlooked — which probably suits him just fine , considering that when you are a rock singer , there ’s some significant value in seeming more reckless and wild than a typical CEO .
The smartest thing about the Rolling Stones under Jagger ’s leadership is the band ’s workmanlike , corporate approach to touring .
The economics of pop music include two main revenue streams : record sales and touring profits .
Record sales are a ) unpredictable ; and b ) divided up among many parties .
If you learn how to tour efficiently , meanwhile , the profits — including not only ticket sales but also corporate sponsorship , t- shirt sales , etc. , — can be staggering .
You can essentially control how much you earn by adding more dates , whereas it ’s hard to control how many records you sell .
The other thing about touring that ’s nice for a band like the Rolling Stones is that it gives the non-songwriters a chance to make some real money .
I ’m sure that Charlie Watts , Bill Wyman , and Ronnie Wood made nice money from record sales over the years , but probably a lot less than you ’d think .
Jagger and Keith Richards , meanwhile , earn a lot more because they also earn a songwriting royalty .
I have no idea whether Jagger pays Watts , e.g. , as much as he pays himself for touring , but if one mark of a good CEO is providing an opportunity for everyone in the company to prosper , then Jagger is indeed a pretty good CEO .
materialistic naturalism
1 . Under the standard of sufficient impartial scrutiny , any allegedly supernatural things do n't demonstrably exist .
And even if one or more are still assumed to exist , none have demonstrable relevance on how the universe operates .
( But these ideas may nevertheless affect culture , behavior , and thought , like many other mistaken ideas have . )
2 . Moreover , all existing natural things come from , are composed of , participate in , and will eventually wear down into , material stuff : physical substances acting according to consistent forces .
Exploiting Concurrency Vulnerabilities in System Call Wrappers
Robert N. M. Watson
First presented at the WOOT '07 First USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies .
Abstract
System call interposition allows the kernel security model to be extended .
However , when combined with current operating systems , it is open to concurrency vulnerabilities leading to privilege escalation and audit bypass .
We discuss the theory and practice of system call wrapper concurrency vulnerabilities , and demonstrate exploit technques against GSWTK , Systrace , and CerbNG .

Inside the Kriterion cinema in central Amsterdam on a sodden summer evening , a birthday party is getting under way .
The music is thudding out , skinny - jeaned students are edging their way on to the dancefloor , and the bar staff are run off their fashionably attired feet .
Only one thing is peculiar about this event .
The entity whose birthday is being celebrated tonight is n't a person .
It 's a typeface .
People have been pouring into the building all evening to attend the Dutch premiere of a biopic with a difference , a documentary about the life of a font , Helvetica , which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year .
You may not know the name , but you 'll almost certainly know the face : Helvetica , the typographic identity of Orange and Muji , of British Gas and US Mail , of United Van Lines as well as the United Nations , is probably the most popular font in existence .
Even so , is n't a special birthday bash in its honour a little , well , extreme ?
The film 's creator and director Gary Hustwit , a small - set , close - cropped 42 - year - old , smiles at my incredulity .
" Oh , that was nothing , " he grins when we meet for lunch the next day .
" In Zurich , which was the European premiere , they brought out a huge cake and 800 people sang happy birthday . "
Really ?
" Oh , yeah , " he says , chewing thoughtfully on his burger .
" And when we showed the film in Philadelphia there was a giant H made out of Swiss cheese . "
If Hustwit looks chuffed , it 's easy to understand why .
His first attempt at a full - length documentary , shot on a credit - card budget and made up of interviews with designers and typographers , has somehow become a global phenomenon .
Since March , when the film premiered in Austin , Texas , it has been shown in cities from Auckland to Vancouver , Cologne to Santa Fe , and new dates are being added almost daily .
Released in time for Helvetica 's 50th anniversary , it 's been screened at Zurich 's Helvetica50 celebrations and also at a commemorative exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
The film will hit Britain at Oxford 's Britdoc festival later this month , with a three - week run at London 's ICA slated for early September .
On the face of it , such demand seems hard to explain .
Typography , the art of crafting letters , numerals and symbols and arranging them in communicable patterns , is among the more recondite and poorly understood aspects of design .
Most of us comprehend what it is architects and engineers do each day , just as we 're used to grappling with the applied design that rules our daily lives , whether it's the shape of a kettle or the operation of a photocopier .
But about typographic design , whether good or bad , we 're clueless .
Design a building and it's headline news .
Design some text and barely anyone notices .
For all that , typography is ubiquitous .
We require text , text requires form , form requires design .
Since the invention of the printing press , the stuff has been everywhere .
The idea for the film came , Hustwit says , when he was wandering the streets of New York , observing the way urban and typographic design collide and collude .
" I was walking around , looking at the type and the way people interacted with it , and I just saw the whole film in my head .
I wanted to do a documentary about graphic design , and I thought - well , Helvetica is the most ubiquitous typeface in our lives , why not that ? "
In one of the film 's most brilliant sequences , one of Hustwit 's interviewees , the writer Lars Müller , takes a similar stroll around London , a city that , it turns out , is nearly as full of Helvetica as New York .
Pointing gleefully at traffic signs , shopfronts and notices that " Posters Will Be Prosecuted , " Müller pays tribute to what elsewhere he has called " the shift worker and solo entertainer of typefaces " , the font that moonlights on the glossiest of corporate identities as well as the scummiest of homemade signs .
If you can't think what Helvetica looks like , glance around you : chances are it's somewhere in your field of vision , whether whistling past on the television news or staring out at you from the local dry cleaners .
( Though no longer does it star on the pages of this newspaper - after 17 years ' service , the font was retired in 2005 , when the Berliner format was launched , and replaced by Guardian Egyptian . )
Nor is Helvetica confined to the western alphabet : a Cyrillic version now exists , as do variants in Greek and Chinese .
It is , I am slowly beginning to comprehend , the world 's font .
For all that , and as the film reveals , Helvetica is indelibly associated with the country whose Latin name it pays tribute to : Switzerland , where a new movement in graphic design first took root in the 1950s .
Energised by advances in typesetting technology , Swiss designers were hungry for typefaces embodying the principles of modernism - clean , crisp , neutral - and type foundries reciprocated with a wave of fresh designs .
One of the first was Univers , an austere but elegant sans - serif face drawn up by Adrian Frutiger that appeared in 1956 .
It became an instant classic , its 14 different weights , ultrathin to über - bold , painstakingly numbered to offer technicians greater flexibility .
Univers was followed just a year later by a rival typeface designed by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffman of the Haas foundry in Münchenstein - the working drawings for which , annotated with Hoffman 's pencil adjustments , appear in the film .
Their new font was initially christened Neue Haas Grotesk but rapidly renamed Helvetica - a last - minute publicity decision that had far - reaching ramifications .
Marketed as a symbol of cutting - edge Swiss technology , Helvetica went global almost at once .
One man at the heart of this revolution was Massimo Vignelli , the Italian - American designer who used Helvetica for an iconic American Airlines logo in 1966 , distilling the company 's forward - looking philosophy so brilliantly that it has remained unchanged ever since .
Hustwit managed to interview Vignelli , and like the other typographers and technicians he spoke to , found him passionate about the social significance of his craft .
" The life of a designer is a life of fight , fight against ugliness , " Vignelli exclaims at one point in the film , " just like a doctor fights against disease . "
Small wonder that when he came to develop a new identity for the signage of New York 's ailing subway system in the early 1970s , Vignelli reached yet again for Helvetica - this time stark white text on an unyielding black background , iconography as bold and brash as the city itself .
Part of the point of making a documentary about all this , Hustwit explains , is to put faces to the names of great designers such as Vignelli whose work surrounds us every day but whose identities remain more or less unknown .
" When I started this project , " he says , " I could n't believe that a film like this did n't exist already , because these people are gods and goddesses .
What they do is more than just logos and corporate branding - they design the type that we read every day in newspapers and magazines , onscreen and on television .
Fonts do n't just appear out of Microsoft Word : there are human beings and huge stories behind them . "
Microsoft Word and the revolution in desktop publishing are , of course , part of the reason that audiences who would n't otherwise know their glyphs from their descenders are flocking to see a documentary devoted to the history of typography .
Graphic design is no longer the province of specialists , but available to anyone with a word processor .
" All these things that were the realm of professional designers 10 years ago are now being done by eight - year - olds , " says Hustwit .
" The more people are exposed to graphic design , the more they appreciate it . "
· Helvetica is showing at BritDoc , Keble College , Oxford , July 25 - 27 ( details : britdoc.org ) ; and at the ICA , London , from September 7 ( details : ica.org.uk/020-7930 3647 ) .
50 Years of Helvetica is at MoMA , New York until March 31 2008 .
A human cell contains an enormous 1.8 metres of DNA partitioned into 46 chromosomes .
These have to be copied and distributed equally into two daughter cells at every division .
Condensation , the shortening of chromosomes , allows the cell to handle such huge amounts of genetic material during cell division and helps preventing fatal defects in chromosome separation .
Now researchers from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory ( EMBL ) for the first time tracked chromosome condensation in mammalian cells over the entire course of cell division .
What happens when chromosomes are not correctly separated and distributed during cell division we know very well ; two daughter cells with either broken chromosomes or different numbers of chromosomes result and severe diseases including cancer can arise .
But so far we know only little about condensation , a process crucial to the successful separation of chromosomes .
Using powerful microscopes , researchers led by Jan Ellenberg at EMBL looked at living mammalian cells to find out how and when chromosomes shorten during cell division .
Condensation begins early , when the cell starts preparing for division , and the chromosomes become shorter and shorter until they are about to separate and migrate towards the poles of the cell .
“ It is at this stage that textbooks say chromosomes are shortest .
Then , after separating they would expand again , ” says Ellenberg .
“ But we found something very different .
Shortly after they finish separating , chromosomes actually condense even further .
This makes sense , because in this way they are shortest when the physical division of one cell body into two takes place .
Like this , no long chromosome arms extend over the plane of division , because that could expose the DNA to serious mechanical damage . ”
The extreme condensation of chromosomes towards the end of cell division can also serve as a safety net if something goes wrong with chromosome separation in earlier phases of division .
When the researchers added chemicals to the cell to block the late condensation , more separation defects appeared .
“ Sometimes chromosomes get stuck and cannot be fully separated by the spindle that normally distributes them into the daughter cells , ” says Felipe Mora - Bermúdez , who carried out the experiments in Ellenberg ’s lab , “ we think that the ‘ super condensation ’ at later stages helps to disentangle such chromosomes and acts as a back - up mechanism to rescue separation defects . ”
The EMBL researchers found that an enzyme called Aurora kinase is crucially involved in this process .
Blocking this enzyme abolishes late condensation of chromosomes .
They now hope to uncover the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the late shortening of chromosomes .
This could further advance our understanding of cell division and the risk factors that lead to defects in chromosome separation and their dramatic consequences .

Most of us do n't like to shell out $ 20,000 or more for a new car or truck , and it 's tempting to believe that we can buy a model that 's a few years old and get something that 's almost as good as new , for a lot less money .
There 's no doubt this can happen , but it 's by no means a sure thing .
A crafy consumer who sets out to buy a used vehicle knows that the first thing to do is to check out the best - known foibles of the models he 's likely to come across in his search .
You wo n't find this information in the reviews that were published when the car or truck was introduced , and it 's not likely you 'll find it in auto magazines .
You most certainly wo n't find it out from the dealer .
So , where can you find it ?
On the Internet , of course , where consumers go to vent , probe and share information .
We combed through ConsumerAffairs.com 's database of more than 215,000 complaints to find the ten recent - vintage models that consistently bedevil their owners with one or more serious shortcomings .
Admittedly , this is n't a scientific sample but behind every complaint we receive is a consumer who would have been a lot happier -- and a lot richer -- if he or she had picked a different model when out shopping around .
Caveat :
We hear more about the most popular models , the ones that sell hundreds of thousands of units .
Thus , while a Ford Expedition may be more reliable than a Maserati , there just are n't enough Maseratis out there to generate a large number of complaints , no matter how infernally frustrating they may be .
1. Ford Expedition ,
2. Ford F - 150 and Super - Duty Trucks
Ford truck owners are usually fiercely loyal to their Blue Oval powerhouses -- until one of them spits a spark plug .
The Ford Motor Co. has turned an automotive backside to almost every customer complaining of a spit spark plug , leaving them the option or repairing the truck and keeping it or dumping the vehicle on the used - truck market .
ConsumerAffairs.com recommends that you avoid the 1998 through 2003 Ford Expedition no matter the guarantee or promise that accompanies the truck .
Thousands of first and second Expedition owners have suffered a spit spark plug and paid Ford thousands of dollars to repair the defect .
Fixing the damage does not guarantee it wo n't happen again .
Many consumers have told us they have fixed a blown plug only to have the engine spit a second or third plug .
More and more Ford mechanics and technicians are siding with consumers , charging that the troubled automaker is fully aware of a major flaw in Ford engines that causes the power plant to spit out spark plugs at random and without warning .
The mechanics complain that Ford is covering up the defect while squeezing and short - changing technicians and mechanics tasked with repairing the problem for Ford consumers .
The trouble is , no one is listening to the warning and Ford continues to stonewall and cover up the spit spark plug hazard , according to one Ford technician .
A Master Ford Technician told ConsumerAffairs.com that the situation regarding these engines and the spark plugs blowing out is not unknown to Ford .
Quite the contrary , they are well aware of it and have been since the 5.4 liter Triton engine was released , this Ford mechanic said .
This same concern also affects other engines in Ford 's modular engine family , such as the 4.6 liter single overhead cam V - 8s and the 6.8 liter single overhead cam V - 10 , he warned .
Ford dealerships routinely insist to consumers complaining about a spit spark plug that they have never heard of such a thing happening .
Many
Ford models are also prone to catch fire while parked , so if you buy one , park it outside .
And never leave children , pets or disabled people alone inside -- even for a minute .
3. BMWs with Automatic Transmissions
The popular German car is easily found around prestige used - car lots because so many people lease the luxury cars , turning them back to BMW when the lease is over .
The automaker then sells the used vehicle -- often as a " certified " cream puff -- adding to an already profitable transaction .
The people who lease the car new are the ones who got a good deal : they drove the car of their dreams for a few trouble - free years at a relatively inexpensive price .
But second and third owners are finding the automatic transmission in the German car to be unreliable and expensive to repair .
Our readers report that the automatic gear box is causing no end of trouble and BMW has left them high and dry with several thousands of dollars in repair bills .
To date , the highly profitable automaker has refused to accept any responsibility for the mounting number of failures , even telling some consumers the company has never been seen the failure .
" We are unaware of any widespread concern regarding the transmission .
However , the actual length of life of any given vehicle part is dependent on a number of factors including care , maintenance , use , and climate , " BMW AG wrote to the owner of a 2002 3 - series sedan .
The complaints being filed with ConsumerAffairs.com are similar and describe a transmission that hesitates or refuses to be shifted into reverse .
" Lost reverse gear on my 2001 330 Ci convertible at about 53,000 miles , " wrote Don from Dayton , Ohio .
" The car has an automatic transmission and repair costs at a local dealership was $ 4,048 , " he told ConsumerAffairs.com .
Don wrote to BMW " several times but got no resolution to the problem , " he said .
" Numerous other people have complained of this problem with BMW automatic transmissions but BMW refuses to correct the problem , " he told us .
BMW owners report that the expensive transmission failures show up most often in 3 series cars as well as the X3 and X5 BMW SUVs .
Buy a second - hand BMW with automatic transmission at your own risk .
Despite the hundreds of reports citing similar problems , BMW stands by its denial .
" During the life of a vehicle , it is natural to expect that some parts may have to be replaced due to mechanical failures , or normal wear and tear .
For this reason , we do not have an estimated life expectancy for components or parts of a vehicle , " the company said .
That includes the transmission , according to the official BMW company line .
4. Toyota Prius
The Toyota Prius is proving to be a good , solid car but as the hybrid approaches 100,000 miles a number of odd problems are popping up that ought to be cause for concern among consumers shopping for a secondhand hybrid .
The Japanese automaker began selling gas - and - electric cars ten years ago and is now the acknowledged hybrid leader in the automotive industry .
But a growing number of ConsumerAffairs.com readers are reporting that the Prius hybrid technology is not aging well .
With some Prius models in the U.S. on the road now for eight years and approaching 100,000 miles , owners are beginning to encounter problems that are unique to the hybrids .
One reader reported to us that in her 2004 Prius the hybrid display began to malfunction and did not work with the result of being unable to get gas into car . "
A California reader told us that the monitor is also failing in his Prius and said that Toyota is unwilling to provide any assistance because the monitor is no longer covered by the Toyota warranty .
There is a technical service bulletin out on it from Toyota which tells the dealer how to repair the problem but only if the car is under factory warranty , he said .
My car has 49,000 miles on it and is out of warranty .
A Texas Prius owner with 91,000 miles on his hybrid said that " the dashboard lit up with multiple warning lights .
The dealer picked it up and said that the transmission went out and it would cost $ 6,000 to fix and the Prius was out of warranty .
Toyota allowed no coverage , not even partial help even though the transmission was part of the Hybrid Power train covered for 5 years and 100,000 miles .
A southern California Prius owner told us that his car has died on the freeway four times .
The second time the dealer had the car for 53 days waiting for parts .
The growing number of complaints and problems owners of aging Prius hybrids are encountering suggest that a wary consumer ought to look long and hard before becoming the second owner of one of these hybrids .
Toyota warrants the hybrid drive system for 100,000 miles , but as Danny in San Antonio discovered , there can be some uncertainty as to which of the Prius components are considered part of the hybrid drive and which are not .
5. Ford Focus
The Ford Focus ignition switch is among the most bitter of lemons facing consumers because its ornery behavior can recur .
The switch is known to break again and again ... and sometimes even again .
Consumers have complained for years , but Ford is standing firm with its corporate back turned on Focus owners .
Carrie in Grand Haven , Michigan " was stranded at a friend 's house until the early hours of the morning . "
Joel in Oak Park , Illinois says he has seen it all before .
" My 2000 Ford Focus ignition switch has failed and wo n't turn for the second time in 80,000 miles .
Heather in Wahiawa , Hawaii summed up her problems with her car this way : " My 2000 Focus is a piece of junk .
The ignition switched has been replaced three times and is jamming again .
Ford continues to insist that I pay for these replacements , " she wrote .
Helene was " stranded in a seedy part of town unable to start my car " in Colorado .
Dalila and her daughter were stranded in 101 - degree heat in the summer while she was pregnant .
The faulty ignition is the most nagging unresolved problem with the Focus .
Many Focus consumers have even had a broken ignition repaired under the Ford warranty only to have to replace the locking mechanism themselves once the warranty has expired .
The replacement cost can exceed $ 500 each time the lock fails -- a lot of money for something that 's supposed to be an economy car .
Our advice :
When you see a Focus for sale , try to focus on something else .
6. Dodge Durango
The recall of 328,424 Durango SUVs because of the risk of overheating makes the DaimlerChrysler SUV one of the most troubled vehicles for sale in the U.S. today , according to readers of ConsumerAffairs.com .
So it stands to reason that the SUV is no prize on the used market either .
The most recent recall covers 2004 to 2006 model year Durango SUVs , according to Chrysler .
The Durango , which has a base price of $ 27,055 , has now faced 7 recalls in the past year while generating hundreds of complaints from ConsumerAffairs.com readers .
The recalls include incorrect airbag restraint controllers and faulty automatic transmissions that may not be able to shift into " Park . "
Anti-lock brake software on the Durango was recalled in 2006 .
Some of the SUV's rear suspension components were damaged during assembly and became part of a major recall .
The truck was recalled for defective front windshield - wiper motors , malfunctioning turn signals , and headlights as well as windshield wipers .
So far in 2007 ConsumerAffairs.com readers have reported sludge buildup in the motor that required replacement of $ 1,800 in engine parts and $ 400.00 in labor and shop supplies to clean the sludge from the engine .
Paul in Youngsville , Louisiana says a new engine for his Durango will cost $ 6,000 .
In Jefferson , Maryland Eric did not mince words about his Durango .
Oil pressure shoots to zero , ruins engine , out of warranty , 4200 dollars to replace engine .
Larry in Kremmling , Colorado reports that sludge is a problem Durango owners just have to become wary of .
" I have close to 200,000 miles and have always had this sludge problem from the very first oil change , he wrote ConsumerAffairs.com .
Sheri paid more than $ 1,800 to rebuild the transmission in her Durango SUV .
Only 15 months later , the transmission has failed again .
We are now out more than $ 2,000 in repairs and cannot afford to get a different vehicle .
Nancy encountered the Durango transmission failure in Port Matilda , Pennsylvania .
The transmission has now gone out .
Something blew apart in it .
I called the Dodge Corp. and they said that there is nothing they can do . "
Nancy discovered her transmission failure is just one of many with the Dodge Durango I have done some digging and found out that there have been thousands of these with this problem .
Dodge has refused to fix it .
The Durango is not the only Dodge truck with a heavy history of recalls .
The Dodge Ram Pickup with a base price of $ 22,170 was also recalled 7 times in the past year .
On the recall list for the Ram Pickup : faulty anti-lock brake electronic control units , defective front suspensions , airbags that could deploy with excessive force , transfer cases on four - wheel drive models that may inadvertently shift to neutral and cause parked vehicles to roll away , seatbelts that may not be able to secure certain child seats , missing pieces of exterior lighting and defective rearview mirrors .
If shopping for a second - hand SUV , keep on shopping .
7. Ford Taurus
8. Mercury Sable
The old reliable Taurus and its Mercury cousin , the Sable , turn out not to be so reliable after all .
Consumers tell us every week of a spring breaking in the car , sometimes shredding a tire .
Here is a typical Taurus story :
My 2002 Ford Taurus is in tip top shape , or so I thought .
While driving in a low - speed area my front tire sounded like a gunshot then the car fell to the ground .
The mechanic said they cannot believe that this could happen .
I had no choice but to replace all my coil springs , because I fear for the safety of my family .
There are so many issues with this car yet Ford refuses to help .
What can we do ?
There may not be much the current owner can do , but if you are looking for a low - price second - hand family sedan , stay away from the Taurus or the Sable .
There are plenty of dull , dependable cars out there .
Why settle for something that 's dull and undependable ?
9. Toyota Engine Sludge
Many older Toyotas have a chronic problem with engine sludge which can cost an unwary second owner thousands of dollars at the hands of a seller unwilling to disclose the sludge problem .
We bought a 2004 Toyota Corolla S new in 2004 , a consumer wrote us .
I did the oil changes in it up to date , I did not keep the receipts from the oil and oil filter purchase .
I recently took it to the dealer because of oil consumption , he said .
I then received a call stating that the engine was full of the jelled oil because I did the oil changes myself .
The Toyota owner can replace the engine which will cost thousands of dollars or attempt to sell the car .
Summary :
Be very careful buying a used Toyota .
Have the engine examined and the oil tested .
10 . General Motors and Dex - Cool
Secondhand General Motors products deserve attention here because ten years after GM began using Dex - Cool as an antifreeze in most of its cars and light trucks , GM car and truck owners continue to complain that the coolant corrodes and clogs radiators and radiator caps , erodes water pumps , rots radiator hoses , causes chronic overheating and engine damage while leading to leaky engine gaskets .
Patricia in Barberton , Ohio , feels cheated by the automaker .
" I have had 2 intake gaskets replaced on my 1997 Pontiac Grand Am .
The gaskets cost me close to $ 1,000 and they told me there is no guarantee it wo n't happen again , " she wrote in a complaint to ConsumerAffairs.com .
" I just recently saw about the Dex - Cool problems and that is what I have been using in my vehicle since that is the kind that is required from the automakers , " Patricia said .
Dex -Cool is now used in almost 40 million vehicles sold by GM since 1996 .
On its web site , GM claims Dex - Cool will last 5 years or 150,000 miles but a steady stream of consumers insist the product is defective and has damaged their vehicles .
That did not work for Rob in Mount Laurel , New Jersey .
My 2001 Malibu with 35,000 miles needs a intake manifold gasket replacement .
In addition , my 2001 Olds Aurora with 52,000 miles also has leaking gaskets GM should be responsible for these repairs since they are all Dex - Cool related , he said .
Consumers looking at used General Motors vehicles should pay additional attention to the engine and have an trusted mechanic examine the cooling systems and engine gaskets .
Good Hunting
While this list is far from exhaustive , it hits the trouble spots we 've heard most about .
Of course , all used cars are potential trouble .
If you can swing it , it 's better to buy a new model , even if you get one that 's stripped down .
With gas prices higher than ever , most of us would be better off with a small four - cylinder sedan , preferably with a manual transmission .
One last word of caution :
While the Internet is a valuable place to research cars , it 's a terrible place to buy them .
You should only buy a car you have examined in person .
Ideally , you should take it to an experienced mechanic for a complete inspection .
Whatever you do , never buy a car sight unseen on the Web .
You 're likely to get a flood car , or something even worse .

TUESDAY , April 17 , 2007 ( HealthDay News ) --
While smoking marijuana is never good for the lungs , the active ingredient in pot may help fight lung cancer , new research shows .
Harvard University researchers have found that , in both laboratory and mouse studies , delta - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) cuts tumor growth in half in common lung cancer while impeding the cancer 's ability to spread .
The compound " seems to have a suppressive effect on certain lines of cancer cells , " explained Dr. Len Horovitz , a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City .
According to the researchers , THC fights lung cancer by curbing epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , a molecule that promotes the growth and spread of particularly aggressive non-small cell lung cancers .
" It seems to go to ( EGF ) receptor sites on cells and inhibit growth , " said Horovitz , who was not involved in the study .
The findings are preliminary , however , and other outside experts urged caution .
" It 's an interesting laboratory study ( but ) you have to have enough additional animal studies to make sure the effect is reproducible and to make sure that there are no overt toxic effects , " said Dr. Norman Edelman , chief medical officer of the American Lung Association .
" It 's a little more than tantalizing because it 's a compound that we know has been in humans and has not caused major problems . "
The findings were to be presented this week at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research ( AACR ) in Los Angeles .
Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in the world .
Lung tumors that over - produce the EGF receptor tend to be extra-aggressive and do n't respond well to chemotherapy .
THC is the main active ingredient of Cannabis sativa -- marijuana .
It has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in cancer , but specific information on its action against lung cancer has so far been limited .
In the new study , the researchers first showed that two different lung cancer lines , as well as samples from patient lung tumors , produced the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 .
Endocannabinoids -- cannabinoids produced naturally in the body -- are thought to have an effect on pain , anxiety and inflammation when they bind to cannabinoid receptors .
Next , the researchers injected standard doses of THC into mice implanted with human lung cancer cells .
After three weeks of treatment , tumors shrank by about 50 percent in animals treated with THC , compared to those in an untreated control group , the researchers reported .
The findings may shed light on a question that has been puzzling Horovitz :
Why has n't there been a spike in lung cancer in the generation that smoked a lot of marijuana in the 1960s .
" I find it fascinating , wondering if the reasons we 're not seeing this spike is that THC inhibits lung cancer cells , " he said .
" It would be very ironic , although you certainly would n't tell somebody who smoked cigarettes to add marijuana . "
A second set of findings presented at AACR suggested that a viral - based gene therapy could target both primary and distant tumors , while ignoring healthy cells .
When injected into 15 mice with prostate cancer , this " smart bomb " therapy eliminated all signs of cancer -- effectively curing the rodents .
Researchers at Columbia University , in New York City , said the therapy also worked in animals with breast cancer and melanomas .
And in a third hopeful trial reported at the meeting , German researchers at University Children 's Hospital , in Ulm , said they 've used measles viruses to treat brain tumors .
In mouse experiments , the virus attached to the tumor from the inside out , the team said .

Eclipsing the Rings
Credit & Copyright : Pete Lawrence ( Digital - Astronomy )
Explanation : The March 3rd total lunar eclipse was widely viewed by denizens of planet Earth .
But only a day before , well placed observers could also watch a lunar occultation of Saturn as the planet passed behind the nearly Full Moon .
From Selsey , UK , astronomer Pete Lawrence actually saw Saturn graze the lunar limb , the Moon 's bright surface dramatically eclipsing a substantial part of the gas giant 's spectacular rings .
In this summary view of the grazing occultation , south is up and Saturn 's position is shown every 90 seconds in a composite of images constructed from video frames .
The frames were all recorded near the occultation event , then combined and adjusted to compensate for the large difference in brightness between Saturn and the lunar surface .

Can a dead person star in a movie ?
Well , if a star unexpectedly dies before film production is complete , what 's the studio supposed to do - pass up a great opportunity for free publicity ?
Not a chance .
Big Time
In 1970 a filmmaker named Raymond Chow quit his job at Shaw Brothers Studio , Hong Kong 's largest film studio at the time , and formed Golden Harvest Studios .
Not long afterward he signed an up - and - coming young martial artist to play the lead in his first movie .
The actor was Bruce Lee and the movie , The Big Boss , was his first feature - length kung fu film .
The Big Boss shattered Hong Kong box - office records when it premiered in 1971 .
Lee 's follow up film , Fist of Fury , was even more successful .
His third film , The Way of the Dragon , did better still when it was released in 1972 .
These three blockbusters put Golden Harvest on the map and helped introduce the Hong Kong film industry to the international market .
In 1973 Golden Harvest became the first Hong Kong studio to partner with a major Hollywood studio when it collaborated with Warner Bros. on Lee 's fourth and " final " film , Enter the Dragon .
Today Golden Harvest is Hong Kong 's largest and most successful movie studio .
They owe much of their success to Bruce Lee .
The Clone Wars When Lee died suddenly in July 1973 , only four weeks before Enter the Dragon debuted on the silver screen , how did the studio honor him ?
By cashing in on the publicity surrounding his death , of course .
And they were n't the only ones : Hong Kong studios flooded the market with Bruce Lee knock - off films as fast as they could make them - movies with titles like New Fist of Fury , Bruce Lee Fights Back from the Grave , Exit the Dragon , Re-Enter the Dragon , Enter Another Dragon , and Enter the Fat Dragon , starring kung fu copycats like Bruce Le , Bruce Li , Bruce Liang , and Dragon Lee. Unfinished Business Game of Death ( 1978 )
But by far the strangest of these films was Game of Death , which Lee started but did not live to finish .
The only parts that he completed were the fight scenes , including one with pro basketball player Kareem Abdul - Jabbar .
There was no plot line in any of the finished scenes , but Golden Harvest plowed ahead anyway , taking just 11 minutes of the original fight footage and creating an entirely new movie around it , using a body double to play Bruce Lee 's character Billy Lo , a movie star who refused to submit to gangsters who control the Hong Kong film industry .
Problem Solving
How do you make a movie using a dead actor ?
Golden Harvest tackled the problem in a number of different ways :
Lee 's double was filmed in wide angle shots , from behind , or in the dark whenever possible .
Reaction shots of the real Bruce Lee , recycled from his earlier films , were spliced into the scenes with Lee 's double .
In one scene they literally cut out a still photograph of Bruce Lee 's head and pasted it on the screen over the double 's head .
In scenes where the double does show his face , he wears a large pair of dark sunglasses and sometimes even a fake moustache and beard .
In other scenes he wears a motorcycle helmet with the darkened visor pulled down .
The plot was written to explain the character 's changed appearance : Early in the film a gangster tried to kill Billy Lo by shooting him in the face .
Lo survives , but undergoes plastic surgery to repair the damage , and emerges from the hospital literally a new man .
Some Thanks Had Golden
Harvest left it at that , Game of Death would hardly be worth anyone 's while .
But they did n't .
When Billy Lo gets shot and is rushed to the hospital , he decides to fake his own death and even arranges his funeral , so that his assailants wo n't know he 's still alive and coming after them .
Golden Harvest added this element to the plot to give them an excuse to incorporate footage of Bruce Lee 's actual funeral , including close - up shots of the open casket as mourners file past .
For a brief moment the camera even peeks inside the coffin , showing Lee 's embalmed face - probably the only time in history that a movie star 's cadaver appears in his own feature film .
Tragic Coincidence
When the gangster shoot Bruce Lee 's character Billy Lo , they do it by sneaking onto the movie set where he 's filming a gun battle and fill the gun with real bullets instead of blanks .
Moments later , Billy is " accidentally " shot while filming the scene .
Fifteen years after Game of Death premiered , in March 1993 , Bruce Lee 's only son , 28 - year - old Brandon Lee , died on the set of the movie The Crow .
While filming a scene in which his character is shot and killed , the prop gun , supposed to be loaded only with blanks , was loaded with a real . 44 - caliber slug .
Police concluded it was an accident resulting from the film crew 's negligence : Sometimes " dummy " bullets - real bullets with the gunpowder and primer removed - are used to make it look like a gun contains real bullets .
On this occasion one of the dummy bullets apparently came apart inside the gun , and a slug remained lodged in the barrel .
Nobody bothered to make sure the barrel was clear before blanks were loaded into the gun .
When the gun was fired at Lee , the slug shot out and struck him in the lower abdomen .
He died in surgery 12 hours later .
Lesson Learned Game of Death was unfinished when Bruce Lee died and was later finished without him .
Similarly , The Crow was unfinished when Brandon Lee died and was later finished without him , using computer - generated special effects .
This time the Lee family approved , believing that Brandon would have wanted the film to be completed .
The footage of him being shot was left out .
In fact , mindful of the way Bruce Lee 's death had been exploited in Game of Death , the family had the footage destroyed .
As a family spokesperson put it , " they did n't want it to fall into the wrong hands . "

Via ProgressiveU and Watchtower Documents ( linked by Cult News Network ) :
A new compact disc containing over 5,000 pages of damning court documents about suppression of accusations child abuse within the Watchtower Society has been made available for sale by researcher Barbara Anderson :
Primarily of interest at this point are the nine lawsuits settled in early 2007 between Jehovah ’s Witness victims of molestation and Defendants ’
Jehovah ’s Witnesses , et al .
However , also included are the court records from two other lawsuits that were settled by Watchtower , one in 2000 and the other in 2006 .
Court records from a third lawsuit , filed in 2004 by a victim of molestation , were included only because the information contained in the records are another example of the pervasive cover - up of molestation in the Watchtower organization when the predator holds a supervisory position within the group .
( In this particular case , the molester was given a life sentence in prison . )
The lawsuit was dismissed in 2004 without prejudice , meaning the plaintiff can file the matter again .
Over all , the facts are common to all of the nine lawsuits involving sixteen victims which were settled in 2007 .
These cases were filed from 2003 through 2006 by the law firm , Love & Norris , located in Fort Worth , Texas .
The primary defendants were the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York , Inc. ; one Oregon congregation of Jehovah ’s Witnesses ; one Texas congregation of Jehovah ’s Witnesses ; six Northern California congregations of Jehovah ’s Witnesses , and one Southern California congregation of Jehovah ’s Witnesses .
There were eight abusers , all Jehovah ’s Witnesses , who were co-defendants .
The Jehovah ’s Witness Defendants , unlike the Catholic Church , secretly settled these nine lawsuits .
The majority of the nine were settled at the end of January and then dismissed in mid-February and a few in early March , 2007 .
In October 2006 , I was given the impression that cases involving sixteen victims would soon be settled .
In early February , I , as well as Bill Bowen ( silentlambs.org ) , learned that these cases had been settled .
We were provided with no additional information other than learning that Plaintiffs and Defendants were not in favor of any publicity .
Bill and I had a verbal agreement not to go public with the information at that time because I wanted time to peruse court records for more information to offer the public about the lawsuits .
Inasmuch as Bill did not want to wait any longer to announce the settlement , he held a press conference on May 10 , 2007 and the Associated Press carried the story on May 11 , 2007 .
Jehovah ’s Witnesses confirmed the settlement .
However , Bowen had few facts to report , although , he did provide proof each case was settled by posting on his website , silentlambs.org , a copy of a dismissal notice for each of the nine cases .
These documents proved all cases were dismissed with prejudice , which means that both sides agreed that no more legal action could be taken .
Such an agreement usually indicates a financial settlement paid by Defendants , in this case , Jehovah ’s Witnesses .
Like the Catholic Church , the Watchtower Society willfully and knowingly protected child molesters ( child abuse was not reported to police ) , gave them continued access to children , transferred rather than prosecuted them , and insisted on a “ two - witnesses ” rule before reporting or pursuing cases of molestation ( from promo copy for the court transcript disc ) :
It is the Governing Body of Jehovah ’s Witnesses who establish the policies and who dictate practices for Jehovah ’s Witnesses .
That Body operates through various corporate entities , primarily Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York , Inc. , and Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania , Inc .
The Plaintiffs charged in their lawsuits that the Jehovah ’s Witnesses assumed a duty to protect children in their organization but they failed to exercise reasonable care and common sense policies in fulfilling that duty .
For example , they failed to enact a policy forbidding unsupervised one - on - one contact between elders or ministerial servants and children .
They permitted children to go out in door - to - door ministry alone with male members and encouraged parents in the congregations to allow their children attend un-chaperoned Bible study with adult males ( elders / ms ) and allowed these men to “ counsel ” children without any supervision .
See how Plaintiffs ’ attorneys presented these assertions in a factual way .
The Watchtower undertook the responsibility to instruct Jehovah ’s Witness elders as to what to do when they received allegations of child sexual abuse .
They promulgated policies directing elders to call Watchtower ’s “ Legal Department ” for direction about whether to report allegations of sexual abuse to law enforcement .
However , these policies were designed to avert cooperation with secular investigators .
For example , elders were sometimes instructed to make anonymous calls from telephone booths so that law enforcement authorities would be unable to contact them for more information .
Never before have we actually seen this discussed in a document before , but you can see the documents for yourself .
The Defendant Watchtower required Jehovah ’s Witness elders to investigate allegations of child sexual abuse .
Elders were required to apply the “ two witness rule ” which under Jehovah ’s Witnesses ’ internal policy and doctrine , relegates allegations of child molestation to a notation written in a confidential file , if the perpetrator does not confess the crime , but pleads innocence .
See a secret Watchtower form that is filled in with the name of the molester who , the document said , was disfellowshipped , not because he confessed , but because there were two witnesses proving the factualness of this rule , yet there is no record of the sexual abuse being reported to the authorities .
Elders were required to gather evidence , question witnesses and render judgments about what internal punishment , if any , would be imposed on a child abuser .
They were forbidden from revealing the results of their investigations to law enforcement authorities .
Read from the deposition of one highly placed Watchtower official admitting there was no policy in place to report child abuse .
See secret forms which contained questions elders were to be asked by staff in the Watchtower ’s Legal Department .
The questions on this form are indicative of the investigative nature of the process elders were to go through when there was an accusation of child molestation .
Shockingly , one inappropriate question asked was if any of the elders believed the child victim of molestation was “ somewhat at fault ” for their own sexual victimization .
Religious authorities should not be allowed to operate outside the law .
Punishment should be swift and severe .
When they demonstrate such blatant and brazen disregard for the law , I think it would be appropriate for the government to use RICO to shut them down , and possibly seize their assets .
Knowingly harboring child molesters is n’t on the list of RICO offenses .
But when it involves a willful and well - documented conspiracy , it should be .
This victimization of children is shocking but not surprising .
Though the WTS is much smaller , its conduct possibly exceeds the outrageous behavior of the Catholic Church during their pedophile scandal , based on the sheer hubris and flagrance of the violations , and WTS ’ shameless attempts to cover them up with secret out - of - court - settlements .
Earlier this year , I posted another example of JW ’s reckless disregard of the welfare of children , in this case church member Eunice Spry , who was able to systematically torture three foster children in her care for nearly 20 years , without anyone in her church congregation taking the slightest notice ( previous post ) .
Scientists will outline dramatic evidence this week that suggests a comet exploded over the Earth nearly 13,000 years ago , creating a hail of fireballs that set fire to most of the northern hemisphere .
Primitive Stone
Age cultures were destroyed and populations of mammoths and other large land animals , such as the mastodon , were wiped out .
The blast also caused a major bout of climatic cooling that lasted 1,000 years and seriously disrupted the development of the early human civilisations that were emerging in Europe and Asia .
' This comet set off a shock wave that changed Earth profoundly , ' said Arizona geophysicist Allen West .
' It was about 2 km - 3 km in diameter and broke up just before impact , setting off a series of explosions , each the equivalent of an atomic bomb blast .
The result would have been hell on Earth .
Most of the northern hemisphere would have been left on fire . '
The theory is to be outlined at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Acapulco , Mexico .
A group of US scientists that include West will report that they have found a layer of microscopic diamonds at 26 different sites in Europe , Canada and America .
These are the remains of a giant carbon - rich comet that crashed in pieces on our planet 12,900 years ago , they say .
The huge pressures and heat triggered by the fragments crashing to Earth turned the comet 's carbon into diamond dust .
' The shock waves and the heat would have been tremendous , ' said West .
' It would have set fire to animals ' fur and to the clothing worn by men and women .
The searing heat would have also set fire to the grasslands of the northern hemisphere .
Great grazing animals like the mammoth that had survived the original blast would later have died in their thousands from starvation .
Only animals , including humans , that had a wide range of food would have survived the aftermath . '
The scientists point out that archaeological evidence shows that early Stone Age cultures clearly suffered serious setbacks at this time .
In particular , American Stone Age hunters , descendants of the hunter - gatherers who had migrated to the continent from Asia , vanished around this time .
These people were some of the fiercest hunters on Earth , men and women who made magnificent stone spearheads which they used to hunt animals including the mammoth .
Their disappearance at this time has been a cause of intense debate , with climate change being put forward as a key explanation .
Now there is a new idea : the first Americans were killed by a comet .
It was not just America that bore the brunt of the comet crash .
At this time , the Earth was emerging from the last Ice Age .
The climate was slowly warming , though extensive ice fields still covered higher latitudes .
The disintegrating comet would have plunged into these ice sheets , causing widespread melting .
These waters would have poured into the Atlantic , disrupting its currents , including the Gulf stream .
The long - term effect was a 1,000 - year cold spell that hit Europe and Asia .
The comet theory , backed by observational evidence collected by the team , has excited considerable attention from other researchers , following publication of an outline report of the work in Nature
' The magnitude of this discovery is so important , ' team member James Kennett , of the University of California , Santa Barbara , told the journal .
' It explains three of the highest - debated controversies of recent decades . '
These are the sudden disappearance of the first Stone Age people of America , the disappearance of mammoths throughout much of Europe and America and the sudden cooling of the planet , an event known as the Younger - Dryas period .
Various theories have been put forward to explain these occurrences , but now scientists believe they have found a common cause in a comet crash .
However , the idea is still controversial and the theory is bedevilled by problems in obtaining accurate dates for the different events .
' We still have a long way to go , ' admitted West .
' But we have a great deal of evidence , from many sites , so this is quite a powerful case that we are making . '
On another explosive front , a lawyer writes :
I have spent much of today watching the webcast of the Judiciary Committee hearings with the dismissed US Attorneys - from California , New Mexico and Arkansas .
The testimony has been the most riveting I can remember in many years , and what 's coming out is shocking .
Remember , all of these US attorneys are highly qualified , smart , professional REPUBLICANS .
People who expect to have a career in elective politics , usually picked , among other things , for their long - term potential as political candidates .
No problem with that after all .
And that 's what makes their testimony so compelling .
Because they 're portraying Alberto Gonzales and his deputy Paul J McNulty like figures out of a play by Bertolt Brecht .
The key is crude political direction of the prosecutorial service - go get Democrats , and do it in a way to get maximum electoral benefit ; lay off the corrupt Republicans ; use your prosecutorial authority for voter suppression projects targeting minorities .
This is exactly the sort of conduct that the system is constructed to make impossible .
For three years now I 've heard a steady flow of whispers from DOJ professionals that this sort of stuff is going on , and even I ( certainly no friend of the Administration ) kept thinking : no , it ca n't be .
But it is .
This will call for very stringent action : the appointment of a special prosecutor , an independent investigation , and certainly the dismissal of Gonzales and McNulty .
Ultimately perhaps their prosecution .
CLIMATE change may have a graver effect on Africa than any other continent , if the predictions of the most recent report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change hold true .
It predicts a minumum increase in temperature of 2.5 ºC by 2030 , and dry areas will expand .
Around 600,000 square kilometres of cultivable land may be ruined .
Rising sea levels would threaten coastal infrastructure in Egypt , Senegal and the Gulf of Guinea , an important oil - producing region .
Another study by the University of Pretoria estimates that $ 25 billion may be lost in crop failure because of rising temperatures .

Moments ago , Republican Senator David Vitter held his first press conference since his admission that he cheated on his wife by using an escort service in Washington D.C. .
Vitter claims he is the victim of his political enemies and just like all good , hypocritical Republicans these days , he 's not going to the right thing .
Instead of resigning the disgraced Senator , who called for President Clinton to resign in 1998 because of an extramarital affair , is going to fly back to Washington D.C. and act like nothing happened .
He also disputed claims that he visited a brothel in New Orleans , saying the reports were " not true . "

His wife , Wendy Vitter also spoke , saying she has forgiven him and that their marriage fine .
I do n't have a problem with that , but as I wrote in a past post , Senator Vitter does n't work for his wife , he works for the people of Louisiana and all Americans in the U.S. Senate .
The D.C. Madam , Debra Jean Palfry has called for Vitter to be prosecuted and I think at the very least Senate leadership needs to take a look at Vitter 's actions .
This is a long post but it ’s worth the read .
In short , Google and Dell have teamed up to install some software on Dell computers that borders on being spyware .
I say spyware because it ’s hard to figure out what it is and is even harder to remove .
It also breaks all kinds of OpenDNS functionality .
At the end , I ’ll tell you what we ’re doing about it .
About a year ago Google and Dell announced a partnership to include the Google Toolbar on new Dell computers .
At the same time , Google was trying to convince the Department of Justice that changing the default search engine in the ( then ) new IE7 was too difficult ( when in reality it ’s really simple ) .
Installing the toolbar meant that users would have Google as their default search engine in IE7 .
It also meant that Dell and Google would share some of the revenue from the advertising clicks that resulted from these installations , much like The Mozilla Foundation does with its Firefox browser .
The computer hardware business has razor - thin margins which means making a profit is tough .
So the opportunity for Dell to get a recurring revenue stream from an existing customer long after the sale of the computer is more than just enticing , it ’s huge .
It also means a couple other things :
Dell and Google have an incentive to make it very hard for users to turn this off .
Because users ca n’t get rid of it , Dell and Google can get away with putting more ads on the page and pushing user - relevant content off the page .
They ’re now doing both of these things .
The screenshot below shows what the Dell - branded Google search results page looks like when you make a typo in your address bar .
You ca n’t even see the search results in the picture ( 800×600 resolution ) because the entire top of the page and right side are plastered with ads .
This page is n’t being shown to Dell owners just because they have the Google Toolbar .
In fact , uninstalling the Google Toolbar wo n’t get rid of it .
Dell and Google are now installing a second program on computers that intercepts all sorts of queries that the browser would normally try to resolve .
This program has no clear name and is very hard to uninstall .
In some circles , people would call this spyware .
Google tries to explain the hidden software with this ambiguous statement :
Wow .
Are you kidding me ?
In order for a user to get rid of this brokenness the person has to remove a piece of software called “ Browser Address Error Redirector ? ”
That barely makes sense to techies and it makes no sense to normal people .
Would your Mom uninstall something with a name like that ?
I do n’t think so .
Not only that , but due to some support inquiries we ’ve gotten it seems like this software is being installed on older Dell computers that use some sort of automatic update service from Dell .
Is this thing spreading ?
Ugh .
How bad is it ?
Let ’s see what happens with certain queries and what shows up above the fold .
For good measure , I ’ve included what we do too , for comparison .
Typed Dell / Google OpenDNS Digg.xom Paid results Automatically typo-corrected Digg Paid results Shortcut / Search results Digg , com Paid results Search results
As an aside , for every single one of these pages , OpenDNS provides an unpaid link at the top of the page asking , “ Did you mean Digg.com ? ”
If Google and Dell were really trying to give users a good experience , they would offer that , at the very least .
They are certainly smart enough .
Is Google being true to their roots ?
I love Google ’s technology , do n’t get me wrong .
But I think Google has turned a page here .
They have now enabled a piece of software that is hard to remove and forces users to look at a really bad page .
In fact , Google knows that this provides users with a dramatically worse experience .
Here ’s a press release that talks about what people look at while using Google .
( You can be sure Google uses similar technology internally . )
Here ’s a screenshot , with a red - line indicating what is below the fold .
The Dell - branded page does n’t look anything like that at all .
If you were to put a heatmap on the Dell - branded page … well , users can only look at ads .
Dell and Google ’s behavior here is n’t okay .
Users never asked for this experience and they ca n’t get rid of it !
Moreover , this new “ functionality ” breaks things .
Instead of making DNS requests , the address bar now sends single word queries to Google .
This application breaks a lot of OpenDNS functionality our users love .
Typo correction ?
Broken .
Shortcuts ?
Broken .
Google ’s application breaks just about every user - benefiting feature we provide with client software that no user ever asked for .
We enjoy challenging problems at OpenDNS .
But we ’d rather spend our time making the Internet better rather than solving problems that should n’t have been created in the first place .
We know that Google is capable of launching great products and services , but this is n’t one of them .
How is OpenDNS solving this problem ?
Fortunately , we have a fix which does not require more client software .
OpenDNS applies intelligence to the network , and we ’ve stretched a bit beyond DNS itself to work around Google ’s mis-directed efforts .
Before I get into that , let me digress for a second :
Many of you have toolbars installed on your computer .
Some of you have the Google toolbar , some have the Yahoo toolbar , and some of you have Zwinky ( Do n’t ask … I think little kids use it ) .
These toolbars are able to see every single website you visit when you surf the web .
Most report your surfing habits back to the company that operates the toolbar .
Toolbars are something worthy to be concerned about , if only because so little attention is paid to them .
Okay , back to our solution .
We did not want to enter the toolbar market .
We do n’t have any interest in it , and we do n’t believe more software installations are the answer .
The solution to this problem was to route Google requests through a machine we run to check if the request is a typo or one of your shortcuts .
If it is a typo or shortcut then we do what we always do , just fix the typo or launch your shortcut and send you off on your way .
If it ’s not one of those two things , we pass it on to Google for them to give you search results .
This solution provides the best of both worlds : OpenDNS users get back the features that they love and Google continues to operate without problems .
I want people to know ( and be sure ) that we are n’t doing anything shady .
We ’re not spying on you .
We do n’t care what websites you visit .
( Check our privacy policy . )
Solving the issue like this allows us to fix the problems with Google ( and future similar services ) without having to route all your traffic through a toolbar or other service .
Below , there is a mini-FAQ .
Update : Danny Sullivan has a great write - up on this too .
Mini-FAQ
Will this make Google slower ?
No .
We are doing this URL redirection on all of our servers in all of our locations .
Loading Google should take no longer than it took before we made this change .
Also , all of Google ’s other domains like like gmail.com and even subdomains like reader .
google.com still work as they did before .
We do n’t re-route any of those .
Are you tracking or keeping a log of my searches ?
No way .
Absolutely not .
We do n’t keep copies of your cookies , your search history or anything else that would cause an AOL Search disaster .
Any logs we have for technical debugging are wiped within an hour of the request , usually much sooner .
We also are n’t in a position to log it for the government , and we are n’t a front for the CIA .
“ The Feds ” already know that if they want to know what websites you visit they can just talk to your ISP , unfortunately .
Does this break anything ?
Nope , but let us know if you see anything awry .
What about secure logins to Google ?
Can you see them ?
No .
Typically when people try to proxy SSL pages it creates an error .
We did n’t want that to happen so we did something we think is pretty clever .
We actually just forward your packets on to Google when you are doing anything that is secure .
This keeps your data encrypted and ensures we can’t perform a Man in the middle attack on you .
Does Google know about this ?
We contacted a couple of friends who work on the security side of things at Google to give them a friendly heads up .
They said it ’s not a technical or security problem on their end .
Based on that we do n’t think Google has any problem with it .
The technology we ’re using is pretty standard stuff .

An ingredient in curry may help stimulate immune system cells that gobble up the brain - clogging proteins that mark Alzheimer ’s disease , U.S. researchers said on Monday .

An ingredient in curry may help stimulate immune system cells that gobble up the brain - clogging proteins that mark Alzheimer 's disease , U.S. researchers said on Monday .

They said they isolated a compound in turmeric , a yellow spice that gives Indian curry powder its distinctive color , that appears to stimulate a specific response against Alzheimer ’s symptoms .
It may be possible to infuse this compound into patients and treat the incurable and fatal brain condition , Dr. Milan Fiala of the University of California Los Angeles and colleagues said .
Other research has shown that curcumin , an antioxidant found in turmeric , can help prevent tumors from forming in the laboratory and in rats .
Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Fiala ’s team said they had shown earlier that curcumin may affect the brain cells of Alzheimer ’s patients .
But they wanted to pinpoint the precise factor in curcumin , which is a complex compound .
They isolated bisdemethoxycurcumin and determined it was the most active ingredient in curcumin .
Using blood samples from Alzheimer ’s patients , they found that bisdemethoxycurcumin boosted immune cells called macrophages to clear a protein called amyloid beta , which clogs the brains of Alzheimer ’s patients and kills brain cells .
Macrophages are the immune cells that literally engulf and destroy deformed cells and attack invaders , like bacteria or viruses .
The researchers said it is not clear if people can eat enough curcumin to get this level of activity , but said bisdemethoxycurcumin was active at a level that could easily be achieved by infusion .
Some studies have suggested that people who eat a lot of curry may be less prone to cancer and Alzheimer ’s , but whether curry is responsible is unclear .
Companies are working to make an Alzheimer ’s vaccine that would stimulate the production of antibodies against amyloid beta .
This approach would stimulate a different type of immune response and might be less likely to cause harmful side effects , like brain inflammation , the researchers said .
“ Our results may provide an entirely different direction to therapeutic opportunities in Alzheimer ’s disease through the repair of the functional and transcriptional deficits of Alzheimer ’s disease macrophages by curcuminoids , ” the researchers wrote .
The early findings of a study comparing the experiences and views of teenagers in 1986 and 2006 reveal that the number who say they have no best friend they can confide in has risen from around one in eight to almost one in five .
The conclusion , submitted to the Good Childhood Inquiry , a two - year independent investigation of modern childhood overseen by the Children 's Society , will prompt fresh concern over increased pressures and mental distress among children and young people in Britain .
The latest findings , from a YouthTrends study funded by the Nuffield Foundation , compare a 1986 survey of 16 - year - olds tracked under the British Cohort Study with 700 of the same age group questioned in 2006 .
They reveal that the proportion who say they have no best friend they can trust has risen from 13 % to 18 % .
The change is being seen as significant by the Good Childhood inquiry team because friendship is so closely linked in a wide range of research to children 's happiness .
Submissions to the inquiry by children , published today along with other evidence on friendship , also reveal they rated friends more highly than any other factor when asked what makes a good childhood , and were deeply concerned about bullying .
Children wanted to be able to spend time with their friends , and regarded them as an important source of support .
Judy Dunn of the Institute of Psychiatry at King 's College London and chair of the inquiry , said : " Adults often underestimate the importance of friendship for children , and how friends help them to adjust to school , the arrival of new siblings and the experience of being bullied . "
Being separated from friends was often " a deeply unhappy experience for children " which could harm their mental health , she said , while being rejected by other children was closely linked to problems such as depressive moods and aggressive , antisocial and delinquent behaviour and a cycle of exclusion .
The apparent decline in close friendships among teenagers over the past two decades will add to concerns that the quality of childhood is also diminishing .
Stephan Collishaw of the Institute of Psychiatry , author of the YouthTrends study , said the research was at an early stage , but described the findings as " worrying " .
He said : " There is a lot of research showing that friendship is important for children 's happiness .
Separation from a best friend can contribute to poor mental health , and if children are experiencing stressful circumstances such as problems at school or home , having a best friend helps them cope and increases their resilience to overcome them . "
An earlier study by the institute published in 2004 concluded that young people 's wellbeing has declined over time , reflected in an increase in mental health problems , drug use and suicide .
Researchers will now examine the relationship between the fall in close friendships and the decline in happiness .
The Good Childhood Inquiry , launched last autumn with backing from the Archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , is studying friendship as one of six themes , together with family , health , learning , lifestyle and values .
Jackson man wants to recall Walberg from congressional seat
8/7/2007 , 3:37 p.m. EDT
The Associated Press ADRIAN , Mich . ( AP ) — A Jackson resident has gotten approval to begin a recall campaign against U.S. Rep .
Tim Walberg , but Walberg 's campaign attorney says the Republican congressman may challenge the recall in court .
James Carr has 90 days to collect at least 50,000 signatures to hold a special election against the freshman lawmaker , whose 7th District stretches from Adrian in Lenawee County west and north to Battle Creek .
And the reason for the action ? :
Carr , 77 , said his recall takes aim at Walberg 's support of the Iraq war .
" How can you fight a war and spend billions of dollars and not pay for it ? "
Carr said of the mounting war debt being passed on to future generations .
" That 's one thing my conservative father taught me : You pay your bills . "
Sounds reasonable to me .
If you agree and are in that area ( I am not ) I would encourage you to seek out Mr. Carr and see how you may be able to help to get signatures .
UPDATE : Since two commenters have said that this is unconstitutional , I will add one more quote from the article :
But state Elections Division director Chris Thomas said Tuesday that state law allows for such recalls .
" Our law says you can , and no one has issued an opinion saying that you can 't , " he told The Associated Press .
Thomas said he could not remember any previous recall efforts against a member of Congress being filed with his office .
I can't say whether or not it is constitutional .
But the County Elections commission approved the petition , and the state Elections Division director did as well .
For what it is worth .
George W. Bush is churning out executive orders and Presidential directives just as fast as Dick Cheney 's lawyers can fill up yellow legal pads .
The power that he is asserting -- no , grabbing -- with these executive orders is astonishing and alarming .
Such power imperils our liberties and our democratic system of government .
Two weeks ago , Bush issued an extraordinary executive order entitled , “ Blocking Property of Certain Persons Who Threaten Stabilization Efforts in Iraq . ”
It gives to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to freeze the property of people who are engaging in violence or who " pose a significant risk " of engaging in violence against the Iraqi government or the economic and reconstruction plan for Iraq .
It also bans donations of “ food , clothing , and medicine , intended to be used to relieve human suffering ” to anyone whose property has been frozen .
On August 1 , Bush issued a similar executive order , this one entitled , “ Blocking Property of Persons Undermining the Sovereignty of Lebanon or Its Democratic Processes and Institutions . ”
Syrian meddling in Lebanon constitutes an " unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States , " Bush asserted , adding , " I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat . "
This executive order is even more sweeping .
Where the one on Iraq applies to people who engage in violent acts or pose a significant risk of engaging in violent acts , this one does n't even bother to limit it to that .
Anyone who engages in any act -- violent or nonviolent -- against the government of Lebanon can now have his or her property frozen .
And it also gives the Treasury Secretary the authority to freeze the assets of " a spouse or dependent child " of any person whose property is frozen .
What 's next ?
Impounding the family dog ?
The executive order on Lebanon also bans food , medicine , and humanitarian aid to anyone whose property is frozen -- and that includes the " dependent child " mentioned above .
Representative Dennis Kucinich denounced the new executive order as " reckless and dangerous . "
He said it is part of a strategy to " generate more turmoil " in the Middle East .
And amass more power in the Executive Branch .
Osteocalcin produced by cells in bone interacts with beta cells in the pancreas and fat cells to improve the body 's ability to handle sugar and keep fat mass low .
Credit : Nancy Heim , Columbia University Medical Center , August 2007
Bones are typically thought of as calcified , inert structures , but researchers at Columbia University Medical Center have now identified a surprising and critically important novel function of the skeleton .
They ’ve shown for the first time that the skeleton is an endocrine organ that helps control our sugar metabolism and weight and , as such , is a major determinant of the development of type 2 diabetes .
The research , published in the August 10 issue of Cell , demonstrates that bone cells release a hormone called osteocalcin , which controls the regulation of blood sugar ( glucose ) and fat deposition through synergistic mechanisms previously not recognized .
Usually , an increase in insulin secretion is accompanied by a decrease in insulin sensitivity .
Osteocalcin , however , increases both the secretion and sensitivity of insulin , in addition to boosting the number of insulin - producing cells and reducing stores of fat .
In this published research , authors show that an increase in osteocalcin activity prevents the development of type 2 diabetes and obesity in mice .
This discovery potentially opens the door for novel therapeutic avenues for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes .
“ The discovery that our bones are responsible for regulating blood sugar in ways that were not known before completely changes our understanding of the function of the skeleton and uncovers a crucial aspect of energy metabolism , ” said Gerard Karsenty , M.D. , Ph.D. , chair of the department of Genetics and Development at Columbia University Medical Center , Paul Marks Professor in the Basic Sciences , and senior author of the paper .
“ These results uncover an important aspect of endocrinology that was unappreciated until now . ”
Karsenty and his colleagues had previously shown that leptin , a hormone released by fat cells , acts upon and ultimately controls bone mass .
They reasoned that bones must in turn communicate with fat , so they searched bone - forming cells for molecules that could potentially send signals back to fat cells .
The researchers found that osteocalcin , a protein made only by bone - forming cells ( osteoblasts ) , was not a mere structural protein , but rather a hormone with totally unanticipated and crucial functions .
Osteocalcin directs the pancreas ’ beta cells , which produce the body ’s supply of insulin , to produce more insulin .
At the same time , osteocalcin directs fat cells to release a hormone called adiponectin , which improves insulin sensitivity .
This discovery showed for the first time that one hormone has a synergistic function in regulating insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity , and that this coordinating signal comes from the skeleton .
Additionally , osteocalcin enhances the production of insulin - producing beta cells , which is considered one of the best , but currently unattainable , strategies to treat diabetes .
People with type 2 diabetes have been shown to have low osteocalcin levels , suggesting that altering the activity of this molecule could be an effective therapy .
That hypothesis is supported by the Columbia research , which showed that mice with high levels of osteocalcin activity were prevented from gaining weight or becoming diabetic even when they ate a high fat diet .
Analysis of mice lacking the osteocalcin protein showed that they had type 2 diabetes , increased fat mass , a decrease in insulin and adiponectin expression , and decreased beta-cell proliferation .
This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health , the American Diabetes Association , the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science , and the Pennsylvania Department of Health .
The researchers are now examining the role of osteocalcin in the regulation of blood sugar in humans and are continuing investigations into the relationship between osteocalcin and the appearance of type 2 diabetes and obesity .

( CNN ) -- Osama bin Laden stresses the importance of martyrdom for Muslim causes in a videotape that purportedly contains a 50 - second message from the al Qaeda leader .
Osama bin Laden appears on videotape saying that martyrdom is a worthy goal for every Muslim .
The 40 - minute videotape , whose audio was being translated from Arabic by CNN , was intercepted before it was to appear on several Islamist Web sites known for carrying statements from al Qaeda and other radical groups .
The videotape , titled " A Special Surprise from As - Sahab .
Heaven 's Breeze Part I , " was made in the last four weeks , but the clips appear to be old , said Octavia Nasr , CNN 's senior editor for Arab affairs .
There is no indication of where it was shot , and CNN cannot verify its authenticity .
" We 're aware of the tape , " a government official , who did n't want to be identified , told CNN .
The official agreed that the tape 's content is not necessarily new .
" There has not been , over time , a one - to - one correlation between release of a tape and any significant operation or attack afterward , " the official added .
Bin Laden , with a bodyguard standing directly behind him , is looking down slightly in the video , appearing to address an audience below , which is unseen .
Watch the al Qaeda leader »
He says that the Prophet Mohammed wanted to be a martyr , and that is a worthy goal for every Muslim .
" So be alert , be wise and think .
What is this status that the best of mankind wished for himself ?
He wished to be a martyr .
He himself said , ' By him in whose hands my life is !
I would love to attack and be martyred , then attack again and be martyred , then attack again and be martyred . '
" So this whole broad life is summarized by him who was inspired by God , the Lord of the heavens and earth , praised and exalted is he .
This glorious prophet who was inspired by God summarized this entire life by these words .
He wished upon himself this status .
Happy is the one who was chosen by God as a martyr . "
Bin Laden was one of several men appearing and speaking on the tape .
They include Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq who was killed in a U.S. airstrike June 7 , 2006 .
The video was branded by As - Sahab Media , the company that traditionally handles al Qaeda communications to the public .
The environment shown is similar to that on releases made before the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , in which bin Laden is seen in the company of some of the hijackers , Nasr said .
Some of the backdrops also resemble those shown in videos when the U.S. attacks against the Taliban in Afghanistan began not long after the 9/11 attacks , she added .
The last time a recording of bin Laden was made public it was an audiotape , with an Arabic transcript , released on June 30 , 2006 .
For several weeks , radical Islamist Web sites have been announcing that there would be " good news soon from Sheikh Osama bin Laden . "

There 's an interesting post on the Haskell group about Minix and the possibility of writing OS core components in Haskell for it .
Minix is an open source operating system that 's been around for quite some time .
I first tried it out sometime in the early 90's after downloading over some very slow dialup connection connected to a BBS .
From the post :
Andrew Tanenbaum said that it is important for a language like OCaml or Haskell to get more visibility among the OS developers ; and Minix offers a very good way to do that .
Minix3 is based on micro-kernel ; all of the OS services ( memory manager , file system , all the drivers , etc. ) run as regular processes communicating through a well - defined protocol .
It is irreleveant what language these services are written in , so long as they obey the protocol .
The poster goes on to suggest a way of slowly migrating the system routines to Haskell :
Skeletal systems is a original idea of Michael Paulus , in which he took popular 22 past and present cartoon characters and gave them their own skeletal system based on his own imagination as how they would have looked .
I was really impressed when I stumble upon his page , and could n't resist posting the pics of some of my favourite cartoon characters here .
CALIFORNIA HAS sometimes been referred to as “ the Great Exception , ” but for better and worse , this term applies quite well to all of our United States .
We commenced our independence as the nation that overthrew a government of men for a government of laws .
William
Blake wrote poems about us ; the French Revolution was in part inspired by us .
Like all institutions , we often fell short of our best possibilities , but bit by bit , falteringly and over decades and centuries , we improved ourselves .
Belatedly and grudgingly , we abolished slavery ; still more belatedly , we admitted that equality of representation included women as well as men .
There are places on this Earth that have not yet achieved this much .
Nor did we rest there .
I have visited any number of countries where free speech is not even a dream .
In America , I can rail against my government to my heart ’s content , knowing that there will be no midnight knock at my door .
If some bully in uniform does pick on me , I have a decent chance of legally escaping his clutches .
Not only has America striven intermittently to be fair and even good , it remains an excellent place to make and keep money .
It is , as they say , the locus of the easy life .
And so , in spite of Native American genocide , Jim Crow , ruthless monopolism , etc. , we became and for a very long time remained an ideal for ourselves and others .
I remember an old man from what used to be called Czechoslovakia ; he escaped the communist regime by skiing over many mountains , and he finally found haven in California .
I ate at his restaurant 40 years later .
He told me that he had always dreamed of living in America .
He still considered America the best place on Earth .
In so many countries — from Kazakhstan to Colombia to Afghanistan — I have met people like him , people who long to be saved by going to America .
I remain grateful to have been born an American .
As I get older , I admire our Constitution more and more .
But what I love the most about my experience of American - ness is our famous individualism .
Not everyone needs to like me , but I assume , with some correctness , that my eccentricities will be tolerated .
I am my own person — and sometimes lonely for that , but that is the price that an American pays .
I am , as you are , an exception in a crowd .
We are Americans , and so until recently , we knew that we were the best .
Because so many people wanted to be us , we could act as we pleased — and we did , because we were the Great Exception ; we were America the Blessed .
Hence our complacent belief , so long borne out by the facts , that American movies and American brands would always sell .
Hence also our comforting faith that the Kyoto Protocol did not apply to us , so that we could spew out all the greenhouse gases we liked , and use a pig ’s share of the world ’s resources .
( Just this week , I learned of the U.S. ’ new plan for energy independence : coal plants , subsidized for the next 25 years . )
Being America the Perfect , we invented the doctrine , even before 9/11 , that we could seize war criminals in any part of the globe and whisk them off to The Hague .
Of course , we insisted that should we ever commit war crimes , we would remain immune to prosecution in that court .
Well , after all , how could Americans do any wrong ?
Our current administration of torturers ( this word sounds so shrill , so preposterous in relation to the America I believe in , that I have to remind myself over and over that it is literally accurate , that this president and his two attorneys general have quite literally legalized torture ) has gone further in this direction than I ever could have imagined .
President Bush ’s modus operandi is this : Bull your way ahead .
If you meet obstacles , overcome them with arrogant bluster .
If this fails , proceed to vicious , mendacious brutality .
I wish I could blame him alone for the degradation of the America I loved .
Unfortunately , Americans not only voted for this man , but after he proved himself to be a criminal , they reelected him .
As one of my friends replied when I asked why we should attack Iraq when Iraq had done nothing to us : “ Why not attack Iraq ? ”
We were Americans , you see .
Why not do whatever suited our whims ?
And now what ?
“ They hate us , ” we whisper to one another in amazement .
In another decade , we might even begin to wonder about the degree of our exceptionality .
What if we had to follow the rules that everyone else does ?
Well , why not put off that pain as long as possible ?
It ’s much more fun to remain the Great Exception .
Alas , while we hunker down behind the drawbridge , awaiting our next 9/11 , we do n’t even take the trouble to be united .
Exceptionalism undermines us from within .
Alaskan towns are tilting in the melting permafrost , but who cares down in the Lower 48 ?
Republicans and Democrats hate each other .
Automobiles isolate us .
Generations of advice - givers have made us believe that profit best defines the successful life , and so the white - collar crooks of Enron and the ghetto thugs who murder as they please celebrate their own exceptionalism against the rest of us .
Exceptionalism may be understandable and even excusable , but it should not be eternally acceptable .
All - white juries have unjustly convicted black defendants in this country , and that makes me ashamed ; but the notion that a 21st century criminal trial cannot be fair unless at least some jurors are the same race as the defendant is of a piece with the idea that men and women will never understand each other , that Muslim cab drivers can refuse to pick up passengers who carry liquor and that right - to - life pharmacists can refuse to fill a desperate woman ’s prescription for the morning - after pill .
Let ’s pander while Rome burns !
I ’m not worried ; I ’ll never catch fire .
Like each and all of us , I ’m my own favorite exception .

Never heard of him . " - Rush Limbaugh
Introduction : we ’ve had smarter language wars than this
Judging from the blogs — at least from Reddit , which is where I get my daily dose of blog — functional programming is frankly on the rise .
Part of it probably is due to OOP ’s failure to materalize its promise of easy - to - maintain , flexible , reusable code .
Part of it is also the rise of FP - centered languages around relatively recent developments in theoretical computer science — like the MLs and Haskell , a little further away from academia , Erlang .
There ’s finally the visible hand of Moore ’s Law making high - level languages ever more practical .
Also judging from the blogs there ’s a distinct zeitgeist of rejecting “ static ” languages in favor of “ dynamic ” ones .
This is partly an artifact of fast computers finally making serious work in dynamic languages feasible , but also a rejection of the Big Architecture discipline of the C ++/ Java weltanschauung .
Being as easy as it is to make noise with a blog , this has led to a lot of uninformed ranting .
Even Steve Yegge , who ’s supposed to be a smart programmer with a track record that shames mine , has done his share of pointless rambling on how “ static ” languages compile to ‘ hardware ’ , to ‘ Pinocchio ’ - like wooden boys that are n’t “ real ” , while dynamic languages yield “ living ” software somehow .
This , of course , makes absolutely no sense .
The Either / Or approach to classifying computer languages
First of all , this dichotomy mixes up type - checking strategies with evaluation models .
Dynamically - typed languages check types at runtime , while statically - typed languages do some form of type - checking that ensures no type error will arise once a program manages to compile .
On the other hand , statically - compiled languages yield an executable that does what it needs to do , while dynamic languages are either interpreted — that is , require a separate runtime environment that parses source in text form — or allow some form of pseudocompiling that mangles source into some form of object code and bundle a runtime environment .
This distinction deserves repetition .
type-checking
at compile - time at run-time compilation to a ‘ native ’ executable “ static ” languages ( C , C++ , Haskell ) ???* to object code for some runtime “ VM ” static languages ( Java ) “ Dynamic ” languages
(* To the best of my knowledge , that ca n’t be done .
How would you do runtime type checking without a runtime environment ? )
Evidently , there ’s some empirical correlation here — enough to cause massive conceptual confusion in Steve Yegge ’s brain .
The table above nevertheless represents the standard wisdom about conceptual dimensions to be emphasized ; this is supposed to be a technical choice based on pros and cons of each approach :
static typing dynamic typing static compilation PRO : computationally most efficient ; amenable to engineering at all levels .
Safe safe safe !
CON : major loss of flexibility .
Slower development time .
Broken type systems in most languages have no concept of inference — and worse yet , often allow type casts .
PRO : designing one is likely to get you big bucks , a McArthur Genius Award or even beatification by the Roman Catholic church .
CON : Probably does n’t exist .
Interpreted / bundled runtime PRO : portability without sacrificing safety .
CON : Interpreted languages are generally inefficient ; bundled runtimes are generally humongous ; ultimately no control of what the virtual machine / interpreter at the user ’s side might choose to do .
PRO : Faster development process .
In noncrippled languages of the type , metaprogramming .
Maximum flexiblity !
Agility !
Ooh , aah !
CON : Computationally inefficient .
Hard to catch bugs before they happen in the wild .
Architecture is a matter of faith .
Haskell hackers mock you .
Conventional wisdom holds that once you choose what to do about compilation and type - checking strategies , you ’ve basically bound yourself to the above pros and cons .
Fortunately , the conventional wisdom is essentially wrong .
Is type - checking really this much of an issue ?
Why do computers bother to have the concept of a type ?
At some point , machines mangle around bytes , but even in the lowest - level user languages , some facilities to deal with numbers , strings , etc. become desirable — to the point there are even typed assembly languages .
Given that , there ’s no algebraically correct method for summing a number and a string .
None .
The best you can do is to arbitrarily overload the “ + ” operator to become “ concatenate .
toString ” so " Oh bitty box ! " + 2 becomes " Oh bitty box ! 2 " , but that wo n’t map so easily to the rest of the ordinary operations over numbers .
Worse yet , numbers no longer are a ring , nor an integrity domain , nor an abelian group ; mathematicians , who know this stuff better than us , have decided we do n’t want to live in a world where ordinary numbers are not an integrity domain .
What I ’m trying to tell you here is that computers choke at machine type mismatches , and that ’s a fact of life .
All the available dynamic languages wo n’t help you the least when you try to divide a floating point number by a string .
To be feasible , a computation must first make sense .
When you see things from this point of view , does it make sense not to try and detect all possible machine type clashes at compile - time so nothing sad happens at compile - time ?
It does if the type model your language offers you is inconvenient enough .
First of all , digital computers being discrete , finite machines , they ’re not good at handling numbers in the sense we ’ve accustomed ourselves to deal with in real analysis at all .
At the machine level , computers can’t handle the real continuum , or abitrarily large numbers as a type because they ’re supposed to enclose values in fixed - sized boxes so memory can be managed .
That is , computers do n’t deal with “ numbers ” in the flexible sense we use — they deal with variations of floating point numbers and bounded integers .
When computer languages reflect this fact — and it ’s often useful that they do ; declaring all numbers to be the largest , most precise floating - point type would lead to imprecisions and waste memory space — you often find out you ca n’t add two numbers !
int a = 2 ca n’t be summed with float b=2.0 .
That has to be a drag , which makes run-time type checking more attractive : just let code compile , and let ’s decide at runtime what machine type this “ 2 ” will correspond to .
This , in guidospeak , is “ duck typing ” : if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , then it ’s a duck .
2.0 + 2 will still fail to run , though — implicit type casts are evil .
Second of all , in the type model available to most languages , you have to explicitly declare every type .
This is very , very boring .
This is the stuff that makes for entire lives spent in quiet desperation .
Does static typing have to be like this ?
Not at all ; none of these problems relate directly to the fact that machine types are checked at compile - time .
The first problem has to do with the fact that most languages have no concept of “ type classes ” built around common operations .
In a language with a good type model , I can just say
double x = 2*x
The type of this will be ( Num a ) =>a-> a , which means this function is correct for every type that implements the operations of Num .
The second problem has to do with compilers for static languages being bone - headed ( or actually , the typing models not being smart enough to allow for smart behaviour ) .
We ’ve stated the type of double above ; does anyone really think that applies to a string ?
Why ca n’t compilers know this ?
Well , this is 1958 1969 1978 1985 1987 1998 2006 already : they can !
Given this , the only advantage of dynamic typing is that it lets you compile massively broken code , only to see it break when people attempt to run it .
I can only attribute the fact that people prefer to catch bugs at runtime rather than at compile - time to the fact that they ’ve learned that static typing means boring , repetitive , soul - crushing grunt - work .
Except there has been a mathematical theory of type - inference since the late 50s , it ’s been perfected for decades to the point of a great piece of art — and most programmers do n’t know about this !
Instead , they rely on unit tests like an engineer who , for lack of knowing that differential calculus does half of his physics for him , runs extensive simulations for months on end before trusting something .
How many roads must a program construction calculus walk down before you call it a language ?
Python ’s signature war cry is “ batteries included ” .
That ’s supposed to mean that it includes many nice libraries with common operations for everything from scientific computing to web development .
Python goes further than that , though : Python — as many other like - minded dynamic languages — is soup - in - a- cup .
The word “ Python ” refers to ( a ) a programming language standardized in Neuron # 385978 inside Guido van Rossum ’s brain — that is , a formal system one can specify computations in — ( b ) a system for manipulating programs in Python — which makes it a dynamic language in the sense of not being statically compiled ( c ) an object system over Python and ( d ) an interpreter .
You ca n’t have some of it .
Your soup - in - a - cup comes with carrots , deal with it .
You ca n’t decide you do n’t need the benefits of metaprogramming and would rather have a faster program .
You ca n’t decide to use an alternative interpreter , because no one really knows what Python is supposed to work like except the core development group .
You ca n’t even decide to compile it because metaprogramming is bolted - on : every compiled program written in Python would have to include an interpreter because you might want to use “ eval ” at some point .
In comparison , a Haskell environment of comparable power is a tower of separable pieces .
First , you have the core language — not defined in a fanboy mailing list , but in a congress of top academics evaluating the contributions made to the language by recent research .
Second , there are Haskell interpreters and compilers around that formal specification — possibly including extensions that are enable if you politely ask it to use - fglasgow - exts or something equivalent to that .
Third , if you want metaprogramming — if you want to write programs that manipulate Haskell programs — you have Template Haskell , which basically converts between standard , meant - for - humans Haskell syntax and an Abstract Syntax Tree , not too different from what ’s available in the Lisp world , which you can manipulate at will to spit out Haskell source .
Fourth , if you want that generated code to be dynamically - loaded — if you want “ eval ” — you have hs - plugins , which is roughly equivalent to the “ bundle an entire interpreter with the program ” strategy of many Lisp and Scheme pseudocompilers .
And if you really want to defer type - checking to runtime , you can always use Data .
Dynamic .
As I ’ve said before , you can go all the way from defining a type model that matches the algebraic semantics in your head — using the deep mathematics of type inference to do part of the grunt work for you — to relying on products and sums from machine types and using type checking just so there is n’t a mortal blow at runtime when the computer tries to divide a date by a string .
Haskell gives you choices : you can prepare the strict meal , with a ritual involving several plates served in order , and you can prefare the free - wheeling buffet , with a bunch of yummy edible stuff laid on a table on the corner of your party .
You can even serve them soup - in - a - cup .
It ’s very convenient , I know .
Mark Klein , a retired AT&T technician , sits quietly at the center of a high - profile legal storm hitting the nation 's largest telecommunications companies for allegedly helping the government spy on American citizens ' phone and internet communications without court approval .
In 2006 , Klein stepped forward and handed sensitive AT&T documents to the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a civil liberties group that was preparing a class - action lawsuit against the telecommunications giant .
That case and more than 50 similar suits have been consolidated into five master complaints that are now proceeding in a federal court in San Francisco .
This summer , the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear AT&T 's appeal of a key ruling that rejected the government 's national security concerns and allowed the suit to continue .

Mark Klein's Insider Documents
Those documents are under seal , but Wired News independently acquired and published a significant portion of them last year .
They show that AT&T built a network - monitoring facility in a nondescript room at an internet switching hub in San Francisco , at 611 Folsom St. Diagrams in the document show that AT&T technicians split fiber - optic cables handling AT&T 's WorldNet internet service – as well as traffic to and from other major ISPs – diverting copies of the traffic into the room , which was packed with internet - monitoring equipment .
In this rare interview , Klein supplies details of how he first learned about the secret room even before being transferred to the Folsom Street office .
He also lashes out at Congress for failing to hold hearings , and says he wo n't be satisfied until he can visit the AT&T building and see that the room has been dismantled .
Wired News :
How did you first find out about the special room at the Folsom Street building ?
Mark Klein :
In 2002 , we – the union technicians – were notified by support that the ( National Security Agency ) was coming to interview someone for a special project .
That 's when I got wind of something .
I though it was odd that the NSA was coming to a phone company because I thought they were n't supposed to be spying domestically after the law was changed in the 1970s .
They told us ( it was ) because the place was small and we had to know to let the person in .
I happened to answer the door and I directed him to the guy he was interviewing for this special job .
( Editor 's note :
This took place at the Geary Street central office in San Francisco , where Klein worked before he was transferred to the Folsom Street office . )
In January 2003 , as we gradually moved under a Folsom Street supervisor ....
The Geary Street technicians had a tour of the Folsom building , and one of the technicians on the tour pointed at a door and said , " That 's the new secret room and only one guy is allowed in there . "
In a small office word gets around .
People called it So - and - So 's secret room and So - and - So worked at my office .
( Klein declined to identify the person who worked in the room . )
WN : What did you think about the room at the time ?
Klein : I thought , this is not right .
But we were in a tough situation at Geary Street and the company kept making cutbacks , and if I made things worse I might not have had a job .
Four jobs were in jeopardy at Geary and I saved my job by getting into Folsom ....
Who the hell am I ?
Who was going to listen to me ?
So I decided to stay quiet and just take notes .
WN : How did you get the three documents ?
Klein :
Two had been given to the techs when they did their cuts .
( Editor 's note : " Cuts " here refers to splitting optical fiber . )
One guy whose job I was taking on was cleaning out his desk and was about to throw them out , and he said , " Hey , do you want these ? "
The third document was one a management technician left lying around on top of a router .
WN : How many people worked in or on that room ?
Klein :
Two people worked in the secret room , and they were management technicians .
The first was downsized out of his job at the end of 2003 , and was replaced by a second .
A third management tech did not work in the secret room but knew what was going on .
I knew all three of them .
These guys would occasionally stop by the water cooler to chat with the union technicians in their office area on Folsom Street and they said things they probably should n't have .
WN : How did you learn more about the room ?
Klein :
Another guy – he was bragging one day and he pulled out a batch of keys hanging on a chain from under his shirt .
And he started saying " this one is for San Diego " and " this one is for Seattle . "
Later on , I was trying to troubleshoot the network .
And I found that when I bypassed the splitter ( into the secret room ) the network would work .
They were screwing up their own network .
They were degrading their own network .
I called the support line for help and told her what was happening with the cabinet and she said , " That 's odd .
They are having the same thing at the other offices . "
I said , " What other offices ? " and she said , " San Diego , Seattle , San Jose . "
I got her information first , so that information matched with the key guy .
And I realized this was bigger than I thought .
WN : Wired News published some of the documents you provided to other sources .
How much did we miss ?
( Editor 's note : Parties in the AT&T case are forbidden from discussing or sharing the documents , but neither Wired News nor Klein is under a gag order . )
Klein : I think you got the essence .
WN : What information have people missed about the documents ?
Klein : J. Scott Marcus ( who served as the FCC 's senior adviser for internet technology from July 2001 until July 2005 ) actually knows more about AT&T at the high - level internet engineering level than I do .
( Editor 's note : Marcus filed an independent analysis on behalf of the Electronic Frontier Foundation . )
In the redacted declaration ( .pdf ) , at pages 10 - 11 , Marcus says that the documents confirm this is not just for network security , and that it is for government spying .
He argues that the unit installed has its own backbone .
You would n't need a separate backbone for network security – but for government surveillance they do .
WN : What made you decide to go public ?
Klein :
What got me back interested was The New York Times ' story in December 2005 .
( Editor 's note : The Times reported that the government had been secretly monitoring Americans ' phone calls and e-mails that crossed the nation 's border since shortly after 9/11 without getting approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , or FISA . )
The president admitted the program existed , but only admitted that part which had been exposed – and he avoided talking about the part that was n't , which was the internet .
The administration sent officials out to defend the program , including ( Vice President ) Dick Cheney , and they said they did n't think they had to obey FISA ....
This was the defense of the indefensible .
So I decided if they are going to perpetuate this fraud then I 'm going to blow their cover .
( Editor 's note : Klein gave the documents to several civil rights groups , the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times .
Former Los Angeles Times editor Dean Baquet killed reporter Joseph Menn 's story on the documents and allegations after meeting with then - director of national intelligence John Negroponte and then - NSA chief Michael Hayden . )
Baquet 's argument for killing it was weak – that they did n't understand the documents because they were too technical .
That 's what outside experts are for .
That 's what the New York Times did when they got the documents .
They were basically afraid to touch it after the government suggested they should n't .
WN : Has AT&T been in contact with you ?
Klein :
They have n't done anything to me , which is confirmation to me that they are doing this .
Qwest did the right thing .
They asked for a legal document and when the government would n't give them one , they said no .
The other companies volunteered – that 's my speculation .
Maybe they did get some document , but I am skeptical .
WN : What do you want to happen now ?
Klein : I want this program ended .
I will be satisfied when I can get a tour of the Folsom Street building and I can see the equipment has been ripped out .
I want to see the physical stuff ripped out .
I will not be satisfied with assurances from the government that this program is stopped or being overseen by a court .
They have embedded spying into the infrastructure of the internet .
I 'm not sure people are fully conscious of what is going on , and I want it exposed and stopped .
WN : Have you tried to talk with members of Congress ?
Klein : I 've called and sent letters to senators and Congress members .
They have n't called back .
I do n't think they want to pursue it .
They want to talk about this behind closed doors .
These days I am angry at Congress for helping them keep it secret .
They could hold hearings and subpoena people and give them immunity .
Right now there are people who could come forward and say what they know , but they need immunity .
That 's the bottleneck .
I do n't see a resolution coming from this Congress .
It 's a conspiracy against the American people .
WN : Were you scared when you decided to come forward ?
Klein : I was concerned about taking on the government by myself .
When I heard the director of national intelligence was getting involved , that 's when I decided to get a lawyer .
( Editor 's note : Klein is now represented by a team of four lawyers .
All four formerly worked as federal prosecutors . )
WN : Have you heard from former co-workers after you came forward ?
Klein :
Some of the people I used to work with , I would exchange e-mails or see them when someone retired .
But I 've cut myself off .
I have n't wanted to put them in jeopardy , especially the ones that still work there .
I still consider them friends .
But I 'm not lonely .
I have other friends .
It is important to realize that the way we power our vehicles today is based on the legacy of energy discoveries of the 1800s .
Oil was first taken out of the ground in Pennsylvania in the 1860s .
When the automobile industry came into being some four decades later , petroleum was the first candidate for the energy source .
Even though the quintessential American inventor Thomas Edison did build an electric car , electricity was not as wide spread as it soon would be , so the power of the Rockefeller oil cartel won the day .
Today we are using the energy source discovered 150 years ago to get us to work and to the grocery store .
Do we use candles to light our homes ?
Do we use tubes to power our radios and TVs ?
Do we cool our houses with blocks of ice ?
No , no and no !
So why do we continue to blindly define transportation energy on an 150 year old discovery that we know is causing climate change , funding terrorism and is in finite supply ?
In the last few decades , Western Science has , as it has penetrated ever smaller particles , come to the conclusion that everything is energy .
Taking a look at energy from this point of view it strikes me as incredibly narrow to think of fuel , or energy as fossil fuel .
That is just a small slice of what is available .
If everything is energy then let ’s look elsewhere , everywhere .
There are people around the world who are doing just that .
A French company called MDI has partnered with an Indian company Tata Motors , to bring to market a car that runs on compressed air .
That ’s right , air .
The power source is air and the waste product is air .
A visionary inventor and entrepreneur , Guy Negre , the founder of MDI , has developed a compressed air engine that has the potential for being one of the great inventions of this century .
Negres ’s compressed air car can travel 120 miles between refueling .
That is significant because more than 50 % of Americans live 20 miles or less from work , and the average daily mileage per car is less than 40 miles a day .
The cost to operate is low , about one dollar per hundred miles .
The compressed air only car will need to go to compressed air fueling stations for a compressed air refill .
Once these retrofitted gas stations are in place , a refueling will take 3 minutes , will cost about $ 2 and will allow the driver to drive 125 - 175 before needing to refuel .
Alternatively , there are engines being developed that either switch over to electric or gas power allowing the car to continue to be driven , while at the same time operating the compressor to refill the tank with compressed air .
This model car could be driven from L.A. to New York on a single tank of gas .
Because there is no heat generating combustion in the engine , changing the oil , vegetable oil at that , needs to be done only once every 30,000 miles .
What is not to like about this ?
Cars that are pollution free , basically petroleum free , low cost to purchase [ estimates are less than $ 20,000 ] , low cost to operate and capable of handling most of our driving needs .
Sure if you want to pull a boat or rumble around in a big SUV or pick up this vehicle is not for you , but for commuting and running errands , the overwhelming amount of vehicular use in the U.S. , the compressed air car is just fine .
What the compressed air car points to is the fact that humanity has the technological capability of solving our energy problems as they relate to transportation .
Combined with the coming electric cars in the next few years , it is possible that by 2020 we could primarily be free of our reliance on the internal combustion engine .
Now that is the potential and clear possibility .
Do we have the social and political fortitude to make this a reality ?
Will our government see the clear opportunity or will it succumb to historical habit and inertia and cave to the well funded industry lobbying efforts that have influenced energy and transportation policy for the last 100 years ?
The presidential candidates in 2008 could campaign on an “ Energy Independence by 2015 ” platform , calling for government supported mass production of electric cars , compressed air cars and basically create a nation - wide Apollo project for the replacement of the internal combustion engine in a decade .
The technology is soon to be in place , so it is up to us , all of us , to make utilize the compressed air car and all such emerging new technologies to make it a reality .

Espin rejected her wealthy upbringing to join the revolution
She was a key figure in the Cuban revolution and the long - standing head of the Cuban Women 's Federation , which works to advance women 's rights .
Born into a wealthy family , she fought as a guerrilla alongside Fidel Castro and his younger brother Raul in the Sierra Maestra mountains .
She married Raul in early 1959 and was often described as Cuba 's " first lady " .
Espin reportedly died after a long battle with illness .
The Cuban authorities have announced an official mourning period , which will last until 2200 on Tuesday ( 0300 GMT Wednesday ) , with national flags on all public buildings and military bases being lowered to half mast .
Her name will be linked eternally to the most significant achievements of Cuban women through the Revolution
Cuban government statement
" Her name will be linked eternally to the most significant achievements of Cuban women through the Revolution , " a government statement , quoted by the Associated Press , said .
The daughter of an executive at the Bacardi rum distillery , Espin grew up in comfort in the eastern town of Santiago .
Equality campaigner
She was one of the first Cuban women to earn a degree in chemical engineering and did post - graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
However , she turned her back on her upbringing in the 1950s , joining the armed struggle against right - wing dictator Fulgencio Batista and adopting the nom de guerre Deborah .
She married Raul in 1959 after Batista was forced to flee and the rebel fighters made their triumphant entry into Havana .
The couple went on to have four children .
In 1960 she founded the Cuban Women 's Federation , a mass organisation with the objective of achieving full equality for women , which currently boasts 85 % of Cuba 's women as members .
Espin was a member of the Communist Party 's Central Committee since its creation in 1965 .
Her husband Raul has been serving as Cuba 's temporary president since July 2006 when his brother Fidel underwent gastric surgery .
Owais Mughal
Some of the public parks in Pakistan are one of their kind .
Few months ago we had introduced the Haunted House of Hill Park , and today we will introduce Mumtaz Mahal located inside the Karachi Zoo .
Karachi ’s zoological gardens ( also called Gandhi Gardens ) has many animals to boast about .
Animals are however not the only creatures at display here .
For the past 35 years a ‘ maa - fauq - ul - fitrat ’ ( super natural ) character is also kept in captivity here .
This creature has a head of a lady and body of a fox .
It is kept in a special pavilion called Mumtaz Mahal .
Inside the zoo , it is easy to find Mumtaz Mahal as the organisers use megaphone to invite you to see it .
Zoo ’s entrance ticket does not cover the visit to Mumtaz Mehal therefore one has to buy a separate ticket to see it .
Once inside the pavilion , you will see a fox ’s hide placed on a table .
Suddenly a woman ’s head appears out of this hide in bright lipstick and heavy make - up .
Small children in the audience are usually spell bound at this stage .
The creature then talks with following starting line :
I was born like this in Africa 35 years ago , and live on cake , juice , and fruits …
This woman - fox creature also tells visitors their destiny and can allegedly answer your questions in any language of the world .
I ’ll leave the proof of this claim to our readership , who should visit Mumtaz mahal and ask this creature a question themselves .
I ’ve read on a website that people ask this creature all kinds of questions about their destiny .
Somebody even asked about when will he get a work visa for Dubai .
The reality of Mumtaz Mehal is of course a big joke or hoax .
The lady face is actually an enunch who has been doing this job for many years .
The effect of fox body is created by optical illusion using mirrors .
One thing I do want to mention is eventhough I wrote off Mumtaz Mehal as a big joke , it is still very popular among visitors .
I also have many fond memories of going to the zoo for day field trips with my primary school classes and family .
I must admit , at younger age I used to be scared to go to Mumtaz mahal and look at this creature .
Following distant shot of Mumtaz Mahal pavilion shows the complete name of this creature as ‘ Mumtaz Begum Africa wali . ’
I ’ll now end this post with a very short history note .
Actual Mumtaz Mahal was the nickname of Arjumand Bano Begum ( 1593 - 1631 ) who was the wife of Mughal emperor Shah Jehan and in whose loving memory Taj Mahal was built .
While doing a web search today I found this interesting video where “ Mumtaz Begum Africa wali ” is being interviewed by some TV Channel .
Reference : ‘ Foxy Lady ’ is the title of a famous psychedelic rock song by Jimi Hendrix which came out in 1967 .

Introduction
Never ascribe to malice , that which can be explained by incompetence .
Napoleon
In the interests of creating employment opportunities in the Java programming field , I am passing on these tips from the masters on how to write code that is so difficult to maintain , that the people who come after you will take years to make even the simplest changes .
Further , if you follow all these rules religiously , you will even guarantee yourself a lifetime of employment , since no one but you has a hope in hell of maintaining the code .
Then again , if you followed all these rules religiously , even you would n't be able to maintain the code !
You do n't want to overdo this .
Your code should not look hopelessly unmaintainable , just be that way .
Otherwise it stands the risk of being rewritten or refactored .
General Principles
Quidquid latine dictum sit , altum videtur .
Whatever is said in Latin sounds profound .
He views your code through a tube taken from the centre of a roll of toilet paper .
He can only see a tiny piece of your program at a time .
You want to make sure he can never get at the big picture from doing that .
You want to make it as hard as possible for him to find the code he is looking for .
But even more important , you want to make it as awkward as possible for him to safely ignore anything .
Programmers are lulled into complacency by conventions .
By every once in a while subtly violating convention you force him to read every line of your code with a magnifying glass .
You might get the idea that every language feature makes code unmaintainable -- not so , only if properly misused .
Naming
" When I use a word , " Humpty Dumpty said , in a rather scornful tone , " it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less . "
Lewis Carroll -- Through the Looking Glass , Chapter 6
Much of the skill in writing unmaintainable code is the art of naming variables and methods .
They do n't matter at all to the computer .
That gives you huge latitude to use them to befuddle the maintenance programmer .
AS much as Paul Hardin wants you to buy his products , he hopes you never have to use them .
That ’s because more than half of the people who do turn on his outdoor rescue devices “ are at the point of death , ” he said , and are otherwise out of options .
The products , called personal locator beacons , “ are really devices of last resort , ” said Mr. Hardin , vice president for sales and marketing for A.C.R.
Electronics , a leading manufacturer of the beacons , which give lost hikers or stranded climbers a way to alert search - and - rescue teams at the push of a button .
After years of being used by private pilots and boaters , the beacons were approved by the Federal Communications Commission for use on land in 2003 .
But until recently , they have not sold well .
The recent spike in demand followed two fatal headline - making events in Oregon last year : the deaths of three climbers on Mount Hood and the death of James Kim , who left his stranded family in the frigid , rugged mountains of southern Oregon to seek help on foot .
Even with the increased demand , there were only 18,006 of the devices registered in the United States at the end of last year , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association , which administers the rescue program .
I happen to see an interesting post in the Python mailing list .
The question was to know who uses Python , other than sys- admins and web developers .
And here is a consolidation of the replies till now .
For login scripts , locking down PCs , automating backups , GIS , and more .
Electrical engineering .
It ’s pretty handy for writing programs to talk to embedded systems using various protocols / interface ( async - serial , ethernet , etc. ) .
It ’s also good for analyzing communications , analyzing performance tests for analog instruments , and so on .
The Technical Artists are using Python more and more for development needs .
For digital art ( music visualization ) .
It ’s excellent for data analysis ( I ’ve done everything from stats on lines in an SQL database to mining flat text files of data for statistical projections of MLB baseball player performance ) .
I know a couple of
people who sell a double - entry accounting system written in Python , which is presumably “ finance ” .
Web analytics is very common ( I ’ve seen several such projects )
people who sell a double - entry accounting system written in Python , which is presumably “ finance ” .
Web analytics is very common ( I ’ve seen several such projects ) we use Python for controlling fully automated logistics solutions ( conveyors and stacker cranes ) , for generating PLC code etc .
There is also a very long reply on how Python has been used for Railway Computer - control Simulation which lists the use of Python 2.5 as ,
The main database where all states are kept ( signal aspects , given and actual turnout states , track occupation … ) .
It ’s a simple binary protocol using TCP ; the server maintains string : int pairs in a Python dict .
It ’s made with Twisted and running under twistd .
The automatic drive controlling software of the model trains .
It listens for changes of signals and track occupation and controls the model trains using a commercial digital model railroad controller attached to / dev/ttyS0 .
Also using Twisted / twistd , and
pyserial .
Various helper scripts and little servers for small functional units ( tramway reverser , level crossings )
This is the latest one I read ,
To manage the database application , data integration , and reporting
to shuffle and sort important files around , to convert reports into formats necessary for various import and export functions , to reconcile data between database systems , and to maintain little text databases for various business processes .
Some other common replies includes text search , data mining and biotechnology .
Nice to hear about some real time uses of Python , different from the usual administration and web stuffs . 🙂

Alpha -male pheromones cause females to make brain cells .
Mouse pheromones stimulate the brain ’s smell and learning centres .
Getty
Female mice make new brain cells when they detect a dominant male 's urine , researchers have found .
The discovery gives a clue as to how the chemical messages shape their receiver 's taste in mates .
Urine is rich in the sex pheromones that many animals use to recognize and choose their mates .
But how they work is unclear .
So Samuel Weiss from the University of Calgary in Alberta , Canada , and his colleagues looked at their effects on the brain .
The team housed adult female mice with soiled litter for a week .
Animals exposed to urine from dominant males showed around a 25 % increase in new neurons in two brain regions .
Those exposed to clean bedding , or urine from females or subordinate males showed no such increase .
The results , published in Nature Neuroscience1 , suggest that pheromones from dominant males stimulate the female brain to make new neurons .
Female mice prefer dominant males , but females given a chemical that blocks neuron production became indifferent to status .
" Adult neurogenesis may be involved in female mate selection , " says Weiss .
Select by smell
Neurons grew in the hippocampus , a brain region involved in learning and memory , and the olfactory bulb , which is involved in smell .
Both regions make new neurons throughout life ; events such as running , learning and mating trigger increases in one area .
This is the first study to find both regions responding to the same stimulus .
" Seeing an increase in both areas at once was surprising , " says Weiss , " but then mate selection is an intrinsically important behaviour . "
Weiss thinks that the pheromones bind to specialized receptor proteins , which then signal to another brain region called the hypothalamus , triggering the release of hormones that cause the birth of new neurons .
" This mechanism is likely to be just one piece of the puzzle , " says pheromone researcher Barry Keverne from the University of Cambridge , UK .
Keverne has shown that male mouse urine can also trigger the production of new neurons inside a female 's vomeronasal organ , a sense organ thought to aid pheromone detection in some mammals .

We do n't know whether pheromones trigger neuron formation in humans , although we do have receptors similar to those found in mice .
It 's possible that some types of human sexual behaviour could be affected by pheromones , says Zhengui Xia from the University of Washington in Seattle , who studies neuron production .
But whether a subconscious whiff of an alpha - male 's urine could turn a woman 's head is still a matter of speculation .
" Olfaction is a subtle and underappreciated sense , " says Weiss .
" Maybe we 've underestimated its importance . "

Fox News hosts initially got a laugh out of recent allegations by a professor at Louisiana State University that tv personality Mr. Rogers produced a generation of kids who believe that " you 're special just for being who you are " and therefore feel no need to work hard .
However , a follow - up segment reported more ominously that " the signs of narcissism in this society have been growing for 25 years , " before quoting readers ' letters blaming parents and Dr. Spock as well as Mr. Rogers .
A recent study suggested that 30 % more college students display narcissistic attitudes today than when the study began in 1982 .
Mr. Rogers ' Neighborhood , which was broadcast nationally from 1968 to 2001 , was at its peak of popularity in 1985 - 86 .
Fox then brought up the same claims yet again , asking stress expert and WNBC " lifestyle contributor " Dr. Georgia Witkin , " Do you believe his philosophy destroyed a generation ? "
Witkin giggled before responding that it " did n't hurt many people , but it did n't help either . "
The following video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast on July 6 .
The south facade of Sir Christopher Wren 's masterpiece , St Paul 's Cathedral , has finally emerged from under scaffolding following months of restoration work .
The side of the building facing London 's Millennium Bridge has been treated to a £ 4.2 m facelift as part of a £ 40 m cleaning and repairs campaign , due to be completed in 2008 .
The landmark is being restored to its former glory in time for the cathedral 's 300th anniversary next year .
Here 's how it has looked through the ages ...
かつて、老人は敬うものという価値観が日本にはあったのかもしれない。まだそういった価値観が残っている国・地域は残存しているものの、儒教圏か否かに関わらず、老人への尊敬というものはだんだん目減りしているように思える。“老人を敬う”という精神が、前提ではなく限定へ、そして衰退へと向かっている背景にはどのようなものがあるのか？価値観の変容を促した要因にはどんなものがあるのか？この文章では、“老人が持つvalueの低下”という視点から幾つかの要因を考えてみる。
post - hoc redaction , tu quoque , exaggeration to the point of misrepresentation , and ad hoc rationalizations that give rise to implications which no Christian would accept for any similar action today .
But even given that , there is one last approach , a final fallback position to which Christians can cling to even in the face of unbearable violence and disgusting exploitation :
Yahweh approved it .
Ironically , what would seem to be the ultimate condemnation of Old Testament ethics from the atheistic perspective is actually the strongest rationalization for it from the Christian perspective .
The argument proceeds thusly from several premises :
The first set gives rules for determining if a commandment is legitimate .
Although in the previous two entries in this series , I showed that the common rationalizations ( " blame the victim " and " it could have been worse " ) fall flat once the textual basis for these approaches show evidence ofredaction , , exaggeration to the point of misrepresentation , andrationalizations that give rise to implications which no Christian would accept for any similar action today .
But even given that , there is one last approach , a final fallback position to which Christians can cling to even in the face of unbearable violence and disgusting exploitation : Ironically , what would seem to be the ultimate condemnation of Old Testament ethics from the atheistic perspective is actually the strongest rationalization for it from the Christian perspective .
The argument proceeds thusly from several premises :
The first set gives rules for determining if a commandment is legitimate .
If a commandment is given in an undeniably genuine manner , then it is from Yahweh If a commandment is consistent with Yahweh 's nature and decrees , then it is from Yahweh .
If a commandment can be appraised through the revealed parameters of the Bible , then it is from Yahweh .
If a commandment is from Yahweh , then it is perfectly good .
If a commandment is from Yahweh , then it must be carried out .
Problem # 1 : This is a viciously circular method for appraising commandments which are recorded in the Bible .
The Bible is the standard of good because it records Yahweh 's commandments .
Yahweh 's commandments are good because they 're in the Bible .
Thus , appealing to the Bible as any kind of standard in a matter which questions commandments that are recorded within its pages is a hopeless task .
Aside from the first premise in the first set , which advocates a verification principle that is not only completely subjective but epistemologically worthless ( what conditions are necessary for " undeniably genuine " communication from the divine ? ) , the rest illustrate a completely circular approach to justification .
If the Bible is used as the standard by which we determine the " nature " and " decrees " of Yahweh , and also gives us the parameters by which we can judge any future perceived commandments from the deity , then we are precluded from analyzing the morality of actions which are recorded in the Bible .
To show this a bit more obviously , examine the following : Thus , appealing to the Bible as any kind of standard in a matter which questions commandmentsis a hopeless task .
Problem # 2 : This same line of reasoning is applicable to any religious system , betraying a hollow moral content .
Although most parents use the " because I said so " approach of justification for many moral commandments levied against their children , those same children are provoked to frustration because they are acutely aware that although the same rationalization is used with the same force by others ' parents , the relative commandments vary from household to household .
Not to take to task those parents who are too morally uninformed , naive , or busy to explain their moral reasoning to their children , but I think it provides a telling example of what can happen when a deity effectively tells his worshipers " because I said so . "
One could easily replace " Yahweh " with the name of any deity in the above premises , including Allah , Vishnu , or Geusha .
If the average Christian would hope for a more substantial moral foundation from a pagan holy warrior than " Zeus told me to , " then I would also expect Christians to be able to provide something more meaningful .
Problem # 3 : In order to accept atrocities as moral , the Christian has to give up moral autonomy .
This is the most troubling problem , as I see it , and follows undeniably from the premises above .
If the premise that any commandment from Yahweh is perfectly good , then we 're back on the horns of Euthyphro 's dilemma , impaled on the moral impotence of the typical Christian response that the nature of their deity is perfectly good .
If , as Christians say , their deity is sovereign and executes perfect wisdom when he issues commandments , then it is implicit that no Christian can morally validate or invalidate any such commandments - that is to say , no Christian can conclude , based on anything other than the premise that Yahweh is perfectly good , than any particular commandment can be either good or evil .
The value of a commandment is n't even up for consideration - the Christian is in a state where any commandment , no matter how superficially horrible and violent ( like genocide or the organized rape of young girls ) HAS to be good , definitionally .
This , then , is the place where Christians give up their moral autonomy , where they lose the ability to decide if something is good or evil based on their own faculties and reasoning .
I see this as a very dangerous place to be , because any system which discourages individuals from acting as moral agents is one in which immorality can thrive .
And , to look at the Bible , it would seem that it has .
Conclusions :
It 's clear to me that , just as the defense of " I was just following orders " does n't carry much weight for war criminals in modern times , it should n't be applicable to ancient murderers like Moses .
Fortunately , an analysis of the source texts for these atrocities shows that not only were the stories cobbled together to make a confused patchwork of scripture for the sole purpose of providing a mythological explanation for the political realities of the ancient Middle East , and all archaeological evidence to date strongly points to the fact that these stories were nothing more than wishful retrojections of a priestly and scribal effort to document what were essentially " Paul Bunyanesque " tall tales of the ancient Israelite mythological characters , rather than a historical reflection of actual events .
So even though the stories themselves are horrific , they 're no more accurate than the Odyssey accounts of men being eaten alive by a Cyclops or transformed into pigs .
It 's also somewhat heartening to know that even as Christians are eager to justify these stories within their context , they 're just as eager to assure themselves and others that such a context no longer applies to them .
Most Christians will argue that since the ancient Israelite theocracy has come and gone , they no longer are bound by the genocidal directives that created and sustained it .
They 're also eager to argue that Christians are directed to engage in spiritual , not physical warfare .
While I do n't agree that their arguments for these latter points are meaningful , I can at least appreciate the humanistic ethical pangs that I suspect underlie their eagerness to distance themselves from a barbaric religious heritage .
The second set gives rules for addressing the legitimate commandments .
Thus , if any perceived commandment can be first determined to be genuine according to the first three premises , then the last two assure one that not only are these commandments perfectly moral , but they must be carried out unquestionably .
The problems with this approach should be obvious , but I 'll point them out explicitly .
The charities say young boys need positive role models
Childrens ' charities NCH and Chance UK also say almost one in five men do not come forward because they would have to undertake a criminal records check .
More volunteers will have to be checked because of a new child protection law being introduced next year .
The survey found 69 % of men do not give up their time to help youngsters .
The charities organised the Volunteer Survey 2007 , which interviewed 1,019 adults .
Work commitments were given as a reason by 59 % of those who did not volunteer , and 68 % said they did not have enough time .
In all , 13 % of the men questioned said they would not choose to volunteer to work with children due to fear of being perceived as a paedophile .
Mentoring plea
Both the NCH and Chance UK are calling for men to come forward and mentor boys aged five to 11 .
The NCH 's chief executive , Clare Tickell , said : " Many children , especially boys , are desperately in need of a male mentor , which is why we urgently need men to come forward despite any fears they may have about public perception .
" We work hard to ensure volunteers are checked by the police , trained and monitored , which we hope encourages men to come forward and helps assuage the public 's concern . "
Jo Hobbs , development manager at Chance UK , said : " Male volunteers are more difficult to recruit , yet positive male role models can make a huge difference to the lives of challenging children and young people .
" We urge anyone out there interested to get in touch to find out more . "
The Live Earth concerts taking place across the planet over this 24 - hour period will undoubtedly highlight two inconvenient truths about our world .
The first will be the ineluctable fact of climate change .
The second will be our apparent inability to understand a point unless a celebrity is making it - usually fairly badly .
" We are all fucking conscious of global warming , " Bob Geldof claimed charitably this week .
" It 's just an enormous pop concert or the umpteenth time that , say , Madonna or Coldplay get on stage . "
A privilege as it always is to take a lesson from Sir Bob on naive initiatives , this is as ill - informed as it is unfair .
Mori research this week revealed that the majority of people on our relatively savvy shores still believe scientists are debating whether human activity contributes to climate change .
And so it is that Live Earth overlord Al Gore has judged that you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs , which is why private jets , helicopters and limos are being fired up to ferry our well - meaning artistes to various stages .
There is no question that awareness will be raised .
But it seems worryingly simplistic to think that there is not a trade - off between raising awareness and using people whom many know to be hypocrites to do so .
There has always been something faintly Marie Antoinettish about rock stars ' understanding of green issues .
Recently , Jo Wood - self - styled environmentalist wife of Rolling Stone Ronnie - was asked by this newspaper what skills she possessed for a post - oil world .
Her answer began : " I come from a family of model makers , artists and sculptors ... "
The Rolling Stones will not be stamping another of their legendary carbon footprints on humanity 's face this weekend , but to pluck an example from those acts who will , let 's consider Sting , whose band the Police play at the New York concert .
Not long ago , this fabled eco-warrior could be found advertising the biggest gas - guzzling Jaguar of them all .
To clarify : Sting 's personal wealth is estimated at £ 185 m - £ 185 m !
You have to ask that if people this rich appear unconvinced that they have enough money to say no to another wedge on principle , then what hope is there that some cash - strapped Chinese worker will start giving serious thought to the kind of fuel choices he 's making ?
As for Sting 's wife , Trudie Styler , it is difficult to know where to start with her recent 80 - mile helicopter journey for a weekend at the estate of fellow environmentalist Zac Goldsmith .
It beggars belief that these people can continue to be taken seriously by anyone remotely serious ; yet there they are , still in the vanguard of celebrity activism alongside London headliner Madonna , whose carbon footprint last year is estimated as the worst of all the artists on the bill .
When considered in this context the kind of bargain required to make the Live Earth concerts happen tends toward the Faustian .
Writing on our engagement with environmental issues in G2 yesterday , George Marshall , the director of the Climate Outreach Information Network , voiced the fear that " we are locked into patterns of collective denial and have adopted a wide range of strategies to avoid accepting personal responsibility " .
The clear danger with allowing luminously compromised famous folk to front your message is that it allows both them and their audience to reason their way out of changing their behaviour to any significant degree .
Your celebrities feel that they have put something back by the very act of donating their services , while your audience can feel justified in thinking - as they trudge toward Wembley tube with Genesis 's private jet darkening the skies above them - that they are the least of the planet 's worries .
Yet how , when celebrity advocacy has become realpolitik , can Gore 's vital message avoid being compromised in this way ?
For my money , the former next president of the US should play much harder ball with these stars .
When Geldof was organising Live Aid , he 'd announce the addition of bands to the line - up before even speaking to them .
When their managements called yelping that they had n't committed , Geldof would explain icily that were they not to do so , he would announce that they had pulled out of helping millions of starving children with flies round their mouth ( I paraphrase slightly ) .
With the exception of a very few acts , who were publicly pilloried for their selfishness , they opted to remain on the bill .
Given his former line of work , Gore is well versed in the dark arts of campaigning .
He should inform as many carefully chosen celebrities as he pleases that he has Swat teams of graduate researchers working round the clock to expose their bad environmental habits , and unless they put paid to them swiftly and publicly , he will use the increasing momentum of his relatively untainted movement to name and shame them .
Harsh , you may say , but it 's perfectly fair .
It 's not as if they 'll go hungry .
If we are truly to live in a world where celebrities are the medium , then they should pay a little more genuine and practical heed to the message , or forfeit the chance to boost their record sales in front of a global audience of billions .

Last December , DISCOVER celebrated three researchers for the remarkable ways they were changing the world and our place in it .
We named Jay Keasling , a pioneer in synthetic biology , our Scientist of the Year ; neuroscientist John Donoghue and geneticist Svante Pääbo were runners - up .
When we recently checked back with them , each had already pushed his work into new , even bolder territory .
Jay Keasling
When he received his DISCOVER award , Keasling was rejiggering microbes ’ DNA to manufacture a cheap , effective treatment for malaria .
Now the Department of Energy has given Keasling another world - rescuing task : Engineer similar microbes to spit out environmentally friendly fuel .
As director of the new DOE Joint BioEnergy Institute at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California — one of three upcoming national Bioenergy Research Centers — Keasling will head the institute ’s efforts to support President Bush ’s goal of reducing U.S. gasoline consumption by 20 percent within 10 years .
“ We can use the technology that we ’ve developed already in my lab to produce something akin to the gasoline that you pump into your tanks right now , ” Keasling says , “ only produce it from a renewable source . ”
It took millions of years of unrelenting heat and pressure to turn buried decomposing organic matter into fuel , but Keas­ling hopes to accomplish the same basic feat within a few hours in a fermentation tank .
All he needs is the right mix of matter and microbes .
At his institute , agronomists will work on identifying or creating the fuel crop of the future , while bio - prospectors will hunt for enzymes that quickly convert tough , indigestible cellulose into sugar .
Keasling ’s contribution to the work is to engineer microbes so they can turn that sugar into transportation fuel .
He can already make some molecules — like alkanes and long - chain alcohols — that look as if they might work well as components of a good gasoline substitute .
Meanwhile , Keasling ’s fight against malaria continues unabated .
Last year his team found that yeast is more efficient than E. coli as a microbial chemical factory to churn out artemisinin , a potent antimalarial drug .
Keasling is now sorting through proposals from pharmaceutical companies that want to make the drug using the new technology .
The winning partner will forgo the lab ’s shaker flasks and hot plates in favor of giant vats .
One studio - apartment - size fermentor running 24/7 could make enough artemisinin to treat the entire world .

John Donoghue
In 2005 , with the help of a Donoghue - devised brain chip , a quadriplegic man used a robotic arm to pick up a piece of candy .
The chip was the most sophisticated brain - computer interface ever tested in humans .
In 2007 the device is on the way to going wireless .
No more will a chip - assisted patient have a fat black cable sticking out of his skull and running to an amplifier the size of a cigar box .
At Donoghue ’s Brown University spin-off , Cyberkinetics Neurotechnology Systems , engineers have shrunk the amplifier to the size of a thick postage stamp and will implant it under the scalp .
The amplifier translates electrical impulses of the brain into flashes of light that shine through the scalp , where they are picked up by a tiny magnetically attached receiver .
Donoghue is also using the chip to detect brain signals that give him detailed information about brain function .
By sticking the chip into different spots on patients ’ heads while they are having unrelated neurosurgery , he is eavesdropping on brain activity , looking for clues such as what might precede an epileptic seizure .
He dreams of minuscule drug pumps or implanted electrodes that could tickle the brain back into shape before a seizure occurs .
Svante Pääbo Last year Pääbo announced a plan to sequence the entire Neanderthal genome by 2008 and compare our extinct relative ’s genes with the genes of chimpanzees and humans .
But doing biology on a 40,000 - year - old is difficult .
A lab tech ’s sneeze could contaminate the caveman ’s DNA , making our genomes look falsely alike .
Long - buried genes could decompose , making our genomes look falsely different .
From the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany , Pääbo reports progress on both fronts .
Over the past year , archaeologists in protective suits , gloves , and face masks have begun collecting DNA straight from a fossil excavation site in Spain , drastically reducing the possibility of contamination .
And back at the lab , Pääbo has found that the Neanderthal genetic material has degraded only at the edges of the DNA , so distinguishing evolutionary changes from physical damage really is possible .
In May the team — 36 scientists from 12 groups in the United States and Europe — assembled at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York .
To date , they have sequenced 30 million base pairs , up from one million last year .
That still leaves 2.97 billion base pairs to go .
Will they finish before next year is out ?
Well , Pääbo says , “ a rough draft . ”

After World War I , the French were understandably worried about another invasion .
They had suffered many losses in the first world war and wanted to prevent future defeat from their rivals .
The general consensus in France was to build a defensive wall – and thus the Maginot Line was built , named after French minister of defense André Maginot .
It was a series of fortifications along the French borders with Germany and Italy ; its chief design was in preventing future invasions .
The line itself was a pinnacle of modern defenses .
Instead of a single wall , it was a series of over five hundred buildings – some key forts , others small bunkers , all designed to slow the advance of an enemy .
The bunkers themselves were large – some over six stories deep – and had all living necessities , plus hospitals and trains to get from bunker to bunker .
This is to say nothing of the impressive armaments put on the line .
If the next great war were to become dependent on the trenches , as in World War I , then the French would be ready .
Yet on May 10 , 1940 , Germany invaded France .
Within two months France surrendered .
What had gone wrong ?
France ’s first mistake was depending too much on the Maginot Line without mobile forces .
There were two main thoughts on the future defense of France : many had learned their lesson from the first war , with its endless trench battles .
If France were to fall in another trench war , they would be much better defended with stronger fortifications on their side .
However , a few men , such as Charles de Gaulle , argued that more mobile units were needed , such as tanks and aircraft .
Their protests went unheeded .
This lack of a strong mobile force caused France to become stymied in the face of a German blitzkrieg .
The second , and much more damaging problem , was France ’s disregard of defense around the Ardennes Forest and Belgium .
It was believed by the French that tanks could not navigate the forest , so it was left out of the Maginot Line .
Belgium and France were in an alliance at the time of the Maginot Line ’s conception , so it was left largely undefended as well .
Unfortunately for France , German forces cut through the country from Belgium , the Netherlands , and most damningly the Ardennes Forest .
Germany managed to get to the core of France without ever having to deal with the Maginot Line .
Many cite the Maginot Line as the ultimate act of hubris – that simply building a wall is not enough to defend oneself against an obvious threat such as Germany .
However , in its defense , it did serve its main purpose – to slow down the attacking force .
It successfully repelled the Italians until Germany came , and even then the Maginot Line never actually fell to Germany – it was simply bypassed , and eventually had to surrender with the rest of France .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Bombs laid waste to crowded markets in central Baghdad on Monday killing 88 people as Iraqis marked the first anniversary of a Shi’ite shrine bombing that pushed the country to the brink of civil war .
The blasts took place about the time Shi’ite Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , in remarks commemorating the bombing of the Samarra mosque , warned that Iraq had no future unless a U.S. - backed offensive against militants in Baghdad succeeded .
In the deadliest attack , simultaneous blasts pulverized Shorja market , Baghdad ’s oldest , killing 79 people , destroying vendor stalls and setting ablaze an eight - story warehouse .
Police said 165 people were wounded .
The Shorja market , the main supplier for countless small shops in Baghdad and central Iraq , has been bombed frequently .
A separate roadside bomb at the Bab al - Sharji market , also in central Baghdad , killed nine people and wounded 21 .
The timing of the noon bombings , on the anniversary by the Islamic calendar of the destruction of the Golden Dome Mosque , appeared aimed at fanning sectarian strife as U.S. and Iraq forces step up a security plan in the capital , seen as a last chance to avert all - out war between majority Sh’ites and Sunnis .
An Interior Ministry spokesman said three car bombs exploded in quick succession at Shorja .
However , Major - General Abdul Rasool al - Zaidi from the Civil Defense Authority told state television the carnage was caused by five simultaneous roadside bombs around the warehouse .
Huge clouds of black smoke and flames belched from the building , which houses wholesale clothing merchants , turning a cloudless day into night in the debris - strewn street .
The blasts echoed across Baghdad and reduced stalls to mangled wrecks .
People with wooden carts carried wounded survivors with bandaged legs , arms and heads .
By nightfall columns of thick smoke still loomed over the city .
There were reports that the blasts had ignited a plastics market .
“ I saw three bodies shredded apart .
Paramedics were picking up body pieces and human flesh from the pools of blood on the ground and placing them in small plastic bags , ” said witness Wathiq Ibrahim .
“ The smoke turned the place dark . ”
The Interior Ministry spokesman said three suspects had been arrested .
One old woman cursed Maliki ’s government .
“ They ’ve killed all our sons .
What have they left for us ? ” she shouted .

RESTRAINT URGED
Maliki , who has pledged to crush militants regardless of their sect , said Iraqi security forces were gradually stepping up their deployment in Baghdad .
“ We have a great confidence that Iraqis have realized that no one has a future in this country if we do n’t terminate the terrorists , ” he said after holding 15 minutes of silence in remembrance of the Samarra bombing , which under the Gregorian calendar occurred on February 22 , 2006 .
Slideshow ( 18 images )
President Bush has said he will send 21,500 more troops to Iraq .
Most of them will head to Baghdad to help strengthen Maliki ’s fragile grip on the lawless city .
Previous attempts to halt bombings and death squad killings in the capital have failed .
Earlier , Iraq ’s top Shi’ite cleric , Grand Ayatollah Ali al- Sistani , urged followers not to seek revenge against Sunnis .
Sistani said the Samarra bombing , blamed on Sunni militants , had plunged Iraq into a cycle of “ blind violence ” .
Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed in a wave of sectarian attacks triggered by the destruction of the Samarra mosque , one of the holiest in Shi’ite Islam .
Hundreds of thousands have been displaced to flee sectarian cleansing .
“ We call on the believers as they mark this sad occasion and express their feelings ... to exercise maximum levels of restraint and not to do or say anything which would harm our Sunni brothers who are innocent for what happened and who do not accept it , ” Sistani said in a statement .
The reclusive Sistani , who lives in the holy city of Najaf , is regarded as a voice of moderation .
Sistani , who heads the Shi’ite religious establishment , or Marjaiya , has repeatedly urged Shi’ites not to get sucked into sectarian conflict .
Sick of paying hundreds of dollars for toys your kids do n't play with ?
Tired of the latest toy catching your child 's attention and having it turn out to be something you consider offensive ( Bratz ) or impossible to acquire ( break dancing Elmo ) ?
Advertisement
Never fear .
These classic toys and activities can be created with stuff you probably already have lying around your house .
Plus , they will entertain your kids for hours and when they are done , you can chuck 'em without feeling bad you spent your Christmas bonus to get them .
Plus , studies show a child will remember a toy you both created far longer than a store bought toy .
Here are the top 10 ways to entertain your young child for $ 1 or less :
Large cardboard boxes - Perfect for making houses and small castles .
A large cardboard box can entertain an imaginative child for hours .
Make sure you are nearby to take pictures and plenty of door knocking .
Hint : look for an appliance store in your area .
They often have many of the large boxes they are willing to give you as opposed to putting in the trash .
Rubber band and pencil crazy bot - A simple toy you probably remember from elementary school .
Take two unsharpened pencils and wrap a rubber band around the center .
Twist the pencils lengthwise against each other ( as you would wind a propeller on a toy plane ) .
Set down flat on a table and let the jumping begin .
Teach your child not to twist the rubber band too tightly or it will break .
Make sure to have plenty of extra rubber bands handy just in case .
Make a paper popper -
What do kids like more than birthday cake ?
Noise of course .
Here 's a little noisemaker you remember from grade school .

Fold a sheet of copier paper lengthwise down the middle - open the sheet back up and lay flat Fold all four corners of the paper inward toward the center crease
Fold the sheet of paper in half the other way keeping all four corners folded inward - you will end up what looks vaguely like a stealth aircraft
With the point facing away from you , grab the right side and fold it upward so the bottom is parallel with the crease
Do the same with the left side Unfold so you are back to the stealth fighter Using the crease as a reference , tuck the upper right hand corner into the popper .
Repeat with the other side .
It will look like a diamond .
Lastly ,
Fold it one more time so it looks like a triangle .
Hold from the bottom and as if you were pitching a baseball , flip the popper rapidly through the air .
The inward folded corner will " POP " out making a fun and satisfying sound .
Home Depot Kids Workshop -
The huge hardware conglomerate is a great refuge for Dads everywhere , but now they offer kids workshops one Saturday per month ( check your local Home Depot for time and location ) .
At the workshop kids learn how to build birdhouses , bat houses , stock car racers , airplanes , wooden flowerpot holders and more .
It 's a great Saturday morning activity where your kids can learn the skills necessary to fix your roof when you get too old to climb up there .
Plant something - A simple way to teach young children how to take care of a living organism is to plant something .
You can use containers made of old plastic cups with holes in the bottom or you can plant outdoors depending on the season .
Digging in dirt is great fun for a child .
They are also thrilled when the little baby plant awakens from the soil .
Suddenly , they have something fragile to take care of .
Hint : I find that planting green beans provides the quickest results .
Bean plants begin to poke their heads through the soil in just a few short days .
Water sprinkler -
While watering the lawn , water your kids too .
On a hot summer day , your grass needs 30 minutes of water .
Send your kid out in a bathing suit and you 'll kill two birds with one stone .
Bubbles bubbles everywhere - Kids and adults alike love to blow bubbles .
Mix up your own batch by pouring a teaspoon or so of dish soap into a cup and adding approximately 3 teaspoons of water .
Stir and then test .
You can make a free bubble wand by unbending a large paperclip and folding it back into a triangle with a small handle .
You may need to add a little more soap or water to get the perfect bubble .
Hint : pour the bubble solution into a small plate so it 's easier to get the bubble film onto the bubble wand .
Catch Fireflies -
As a kid , I remember fond days of catching fireflies and putting them into a mayo jar with holes punched in the lid .
Your kids will love it too .
If you do n't have wooded areas in your yard , you can find a park .
The fireflies should begin to light the sky around dusk .
Teach your kids how to gently catch them by letting them land in their hand .
You can collect them into a jar , but please be sure to let them go at the end of the evening so they do n't die .
( This teaches responsibility and respecting nature . )
Paper airplanes -
Up in the air with the greatest of ease .
Teaching your child how to make and fly a paper airplane is one of the childhood rights of passage .
It can foster a love of origami as well as a Lifehacker mindset of building your own toys .
Simple airplane instructions ( see pictures ) : Lifehacker photo galleries require Javascript ; if you 're viewing this in an RSS reader , click through to view in your Javascript - enabled web browser .
Fold a piece of copier paper in half lengthwise
With the crease closest to you , fold the top right corner down so that it lines up with the bottom crease .
Do the same thing on the other side .
Grab the top corner on one side and bend it downward so the crease on top of the paper is lined up with the crease at the bottom .
Turn the plane over and fold the other side the same way .
Fold it in the same manner one more time , by taking the top crease and lining it up with the bottom crease and folding .
Lather rinse , repeat on the other side .
Then fold the last two creases outward perpendicular to the bottom of the plane .
Fly away !
Tin can and string telephone -
You do n't necessarily need tin cans for this project .
Two plastic or styrofoam cups and some twine will do .
Using a tack or the end of a pin , punch a hole into the center of the bottom of each cup .
Cut a piece of light string 25 feet or longer .
Feed one end of the string through the hole of one of the cups
Tie a large knot on the string so it does n't fall back through the hole .
Feed the other end of the string through the other cup and tie a knot like you did for the first cup .
Now give the cup to your child and walk away from each other until the string is tight .
Now you can whisper back and forth into your child 's new telephone .
This project gets your child 's physics education off to a great start by teaching vibration and harmonics .

TIME Magazine asked me to write an entry on Richard Dawkins for “ The TIME 100 ” this year .
After their editing , it came out rather more insipid than I wrote it .
They asked for 400 - 500 words , but pared it down to 187 — and that ’s after adding their own phrases ( e.g. , “ deeply unsettling to proponents of intelligent design , ” “ the rigor he brings to his thinking , ” “ the Bible advises us , ” etc . ) !
The entry , as I originally wrote it , follows below :
Of his nine books , none caused as much controversy — or sold as well — as last year ’s The God Delusion .
Yet the leading light of the recent atheist publishing surge , Oxford University ’s Richard Dawkins , has always been a man driven by the big questions .
Born in Kenya in 1941 of British parents , he received a mild Anglican upbringing .
But at the age of sixteen Dawkins discovered Charles Darwin ’s theory , and thought he ’d found a pearl of great price .
His academic career as an evolutionary biologist got off to a fast start in the 1970 ’s with his first book , The Selfish Gene , which argued a then - unfashionable notion : like many politicians in Congress , individual genes of a genome are looking out just for their own good .
So if somehow an unconscious gene mutated to be copied more effectively , it would outcompete its fellow DNA fragments .
The fundamental idea of this “ gene - centered ” view of evolution had been proposed by other researchers .
But , using his remarkable gift of scientific exposition , Dawkins painted the abstruse concept so clearly , and drew out the logic of its problematic premises so brightly , that it quickly became evolutionary orthodoxy .
Dawkins pushed the old idea in new directions .
He argued that genes shape not only the body of an animal , but also its external environment : the imagined genes that move a beaver to build a dam are working for their own survival no less than the genes that shape the beaver ’s tail .
Even human thoughts were fitted to the Procrustean mold .
He coined the word “ meme ” to denote fragments of ideas , such as cultural fads or music lyrics , that might replicate within brains like genes in a cell .
And into the disreputable category of meme he firmly placed religion , calling it a virus of the mind .
With the big questions of life and mind supposedly solved in principle , Dawkins has in the past several decades abandoned research , and turned instead to persuading society of the correctness of his views .
It was for Dawkins that computer software billionaire Charles Simonyi endowed the Oxford Chair of the Public Understanding of Science , freeing Dawkins to write newspaper articles , produce films , and travel the world to spread the meme that , “ The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is at bottom no design , no purpose , no evil and no good , nothing but pointless indifference . ”
A stark message , certainly .
But true , thinks Dawkins , and he will not shrink from saying so .
The God Delusion , which deals more with philosophy than science , has been panned as amateurish by academic reviewers .
Yet even a Roman Catholic intelligent design proponent like myself , who thinks Dawkins ’ conclusions follow much less from his data than from his premises , has to admire the man ’s energy and determination .
Concerning those big questions , Someone once advised us to be either hot or cold , but not lukewarm .
Whatever the merit of his ideas , Richard Dawkins is not lukewarm .

A woman who had complained to her GP of severe headaches for almost a year collapsed and died of an undiagnosed brain tumour .
Jennifer Bell , 22 , had been told she was suffering from stress but after months of illness had finally been referred to a neurologist .
She then faced a 13 - week wait before a ' relatively urgent ' MRI scan could be carried out .
Three days before the longawaited appointment she collapsed at home and died later in hospital .
Her parents , Colin and Joyce Bell , want to know why Jennifer 's MRI referral was logged only as ' relatively urgent ' .
Yesterday at an inquest in Norwich , Coroner William Armstrong agreed that an early scan would have led to much faster intervention .
Jennifer , of Thorpe End , Norwich , developed severe headaches , nausea , a stiff neck and diarrhoea in August 2005 .
Her health became so poor she gave up her job as a passenger service agent at Norwich airport .
She visited her GP for the first time on November 4 , 2005 .
Between then and April 10 , 2006 , she had five GP appointments .
She also had six physiotherapy sessions .
Her GP , Dr Helene Barclay , of Thorpe Medical Group , had recorded her symptoms as stressrelated .
But eight months on and still no better , Jennifer was referred to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital .
There a neurologist discovered that her periods had stopped , a symptom not usually associated with headaches and decided she needed a scan .
But on July 3 last year - only three days before her appointment , Miss Bell collapsed at home .
She was taken to the N&N hospital and then transferred to Addenbrooke 's Hospital , Cambridge , where she died .
At the inquest , Dr Barclay defended her decision to prescribe painkillers and physiotherapy for Miss Bell 's stiff neck .
" She did not show any sensory symptoms and I feel the routine referral to the N&N was appropriate , " she said .
Dr Jeffrey Cochius , consultant neurologist and clinical director at the N&N , said it was a credit to the neurologist who had referred Jennifer for the MRI as many would not have asked questions about her menstruation .
Coroner Mr Armstrong recorded a narrative verdict , saying : " I think there is no doubt that the tumour caused her death but it is also quite clear that early detection would have resulted in medical intervention of some kind .
" The expression ' relatively urgent ' is inherently ambiguous and the hospital might consider whether its use is helpful or appropriate .
" Jennifer died as a consequence of a progressive undiagnosed brain tumour of a rare type and location
urgent is a dangerous term because it is a contradiction . "

George lives at the Charles Darwin Research Station
More details
" Lonesome George " was thought to be the only survivor of a tortoise species native to the isle of Pinta .
Now , the journal Current Biology reports the discovery of a hybrid - the offspring from the union of a Pinta tortoise and another island species .
The " new " animal thus shares about half its genes in common with George .
Unfortunately for efforts to get George to reproduce , this hybrid tortoise , recently found on Isabela isle , is also a male .
Nonetheless , its discovery in a relatively small sample of tortoises raises fresh hope for the future of George 's species ( Geochelone abingdoni ) .
A more thorough sampling of the 2,000 tortoises living on Isabela could yet reveal a genetically pure Pinta tortoise , say the researchers .
Population revival ?
But even if they did find one , getting George to mate with it could be an uphill struggle : he has a stubborn aversion to the opposite sex .
After 35 years , he has failed to produce any offspring ; though , admittedly , none of these tortoises has belonged to George 's species .
Surprising find
The researchers , led by Michael Russello from the University of British Columbia Okanagan , Canada , took DNA samples from tortoises living around Wolf Volcano on Isabela .
Most of these tortoises are thought to belong to a distinct species called Geochelone becki .
The scientists analysed 89 of these tortoises and compared their genetic codes with those of other Galapagos tortoises that are held in a database .
' LONESOME GEORGE ' SPECIES
Size : 102 cm across shell , 88kg in weight ; not the biggest Age : Not known exactly , but probably 60 - 90 years Whalers and sealers destroyed the Pinta population Invasive species have since disturbed the natural habitat
Genetic analysis revealed that one of the Isabela animals was a first - generation hybrid between native tortoises from the islands of Isabela and Pinta .
" It 's extraordinary .
I , and everyone involved with George , never imagined that something like this could happen , " said Henry Nicholls , who has written a biography of the octogenarian tortoise called Lonesome George : The Life and Loves of a Conservation Icon .
" It is surprising to find a hybrid on Isabela .
It raises questions about how it got there , " he told the BBC News website .
Whaling link
According to Dr Nicholls , none of the prevailing sea currents would be capable of carrying tortoises from Pinta to Isabela .
But , Dr Nicholls added , any project to search for a pure Pinta tortoise on Isabela , or other hybrids , would be expensive and time - consuming .
" The continuing saga surrounding the search for a mate has positioned Lonesome George as a potent conservation icon , not just for Galapagos , but worldwide , " said Dr Russello .
Upwards of 50,000 people visit George each year at his home on the Charles Darwin Research Station .
The collapse of the giant tortoise population on Pinta is thought to have been due in large part to whaling activities in the Pacific during the 18th and 19th Centuries .
Sailors would preferentially take female animals to store as food on their ships - the females of the species were smaller and easier targets in lowland areas during the egg - laying season .
By the middle of the 20th Century , only male giant tortoises were left on Pinta .
George is thought to have been born in the 1920s .
The following guest post has been submitted by Leo Babauta from Zen Habits .
Too often it seems that we bloggers get caught up in worrying about monetizing our blogs , or the design of the blog , or SEO techniques — but although it may sound trite , the major focus of our time should be on our writing .
I ’m often asked how I got 12,000 readers for my blog , Zen Habits , and made it into the Technorati Top 500 in 5 months — other bloggers seem think I have some secret that I can impart upon them , but I do n’t .
I follow the same advice given here on ProBlogger , and by many of the other top blogs : create valuable content and good writing , and the readers will come .
Content is king , as they say , and that should be the focus of all your efforts .
I write about this topic more on NorthxEast , a new blog with great weekly articles for bloggers , but the key is to focus on your readers and give them what they want .
Why Not Much Else Matters
Are there other things that matter in creating a successful blog ?
Sure there are , but they do n’t matter nearly as much as some people think they do .
Let ’s take a look at a few examples :
Design –
While the look of your site may be attractive and very usable , you wo n’t attract any readers from design alone .
You need to attract them with good content … and then hope your design does n’t scare them away .
But content is really what matters here .
If the design is n’t great , but the content is insanely useful , they ’ll come , and they ’ll stay .

But content is really what matters here .
If the design is n’t great , but the content is insanely useful , they ’ll come , and they ’ll stay .
SEO – While I agree that SEO techniques can help , what matters most in SEO is getting links .
If you do n’t get a bunch of links , all the SEO optimization in the world wo n’t do you a bit of good .
SEO really makes the biggest difference when the page in question has a bunch of links coming to it — SEO does n’t change the ranking of a page with 1 inbound link .
So how do you get those quality links ?
Great content , and nothing else .

Great content , and nothing else .
Social media – Digg , Delicious , Reddit , Stumbleupon , Netscape … these kinds of sites can help your traffic tremendously .
And sure , it helps to have friends and be active on these sites .
But all of that does n’t matter a lick if you do n’t write a knock - out post .

But all of that does n’t matter a lick if you do n’t write a knock - out post .
Monetizing –
All the monetizing in the world wo n’t get you a dime unless you get traffic , and that traffic wo n’t come until you start creating a destination site , with amazing content that attracts the readers and keeps them reading .
In fact , a site with ads that are n’t optimized can make more money than a site with optimized ads if the traffic is much higher from great content .
Am I saying that none of this stuff matters ?
Again , these things are useful , but they are not nearly as important as the content .
Which leaves us with the question : how do you write great content ?
It ’s actually very simple in concept , but takes a lot of practice to perfect .
I ’m still trying to perfect these things myself , but in general , there are four pillars of exceptional blogwriting :
Pillar 1 : Be extremely useful .
It all starts with the topic of the post .
You need to consider your reader , and center the topic of your post on your reader — not on yourself , your ads , your blogger friends , or anyone else but the reader .
What are his needs , wants , hopes and dreams ?
What problems does he have in his daily life that you can solve ?
Now choose a topic that will solve one of his problems , help him achieve something he ’s always wanted to achieve .
Create a resource for him : an extremely useful set of practical tips , links , tools to solve that problem .
The more practical your tips , the better .
It ’s not enough to say that the keys to losing weight are eating less and exercising more .
Those are both difficult things to do .
Give the reader extremely useful ways of doing those things , and you ’ve created a resource .
Pillar 2 : Write great headlines .
Once you ’ve got a useful topic , crystalize your main point in the headline .
You should write the headline first ( and then come back to it to make it better later ) so you know in your mind the main point of the post .
It helps you keep the post focused .
The few words that make up the headline are the most important few words in your post .
Why ?
Because most readers will read your post in a feed reader ( think Bloglines or Google Reader ) or come across it on a site like Digg or another blog that links to your post .
In all of these examples , just about the only thing they ’ll see before making a decision about whether to read the post is your headline .
If the headline is catchy , they ’ll read more .
If it ’s not , you ’ve just lost a reader .
How do you write a great headline ?
It ’s not an exact science , but I ’d recommend Copyblogger ’s Writing Headlines That Get Results , and my post , The Sexy Art of Writing Headlines that Kill .
Pillar 3 : Make the post scannable .
You ’ve got your great topic , your killer headline , and an extremely useful post .
Your reader decides to give your post a few seconds of his time .
But then he comes upon the post , and it ’s a huge block of undifferentiated text , and he thinks to himself , “ This is going to take a good chunk of my time . ”
Your reader , of course , is a very busy person , and does n’t have 20 minutes to devote to each post .
In fact , even if he does have a spare 20 minutes to spend on a single post , he wo n’t give those 20 minutes to yours unless he ’s convinced that it ’s going to be extremely useful — and he ca n’t do that unless he knows what ’s in the content .
Do n’t make your reader dig through paragraph after paragraph to know what your post has to offer .
He wo n’t do it — he ’ll move on quickly to the next item in his feed reader .
Make your post scannable — your reader should be able to quickly glance through the post and pick up the main points without reading too deeply .
The best ways to do that are with lists , but other great methods are subheds ( the smaller headlines for sections within a post ) , block quotes , images and graphics , and the use of bold or italics .
Pillar 4 : Write in a plain , concise , common - sense style .
Once your reader decides to spend some time with your post , he ’s going to want to get through it without too much work .
The key to that : simplicity .
The great writing manual , The Elements of Style by Strunk and White , instructs us to write in a way that comes naturally .
It also says to avoid fancy words and to omit unnecessary words .
Readers enjoy writing that is conversational , without being wordy .
Write in a way that speaks to your reader , not down to him , and does n’t confuse him with jargon and acronyms and technical stuff .
Pretend that you ’re having a conversation with a friend , and write like that .
Then go back and edit out sentences and words that are unnecessary , and revise sentences that are n’t clear .
Your blog become more powerful if you omit the noise and leave the signal .
Do this , and your reader will not only read the post , but will likely stick around long enough to become a long - term reader .
Terrorism , Part II
On the very first day that our blog was hosted by the New York Times , I wrote a post that generated the most hate mail I ’ve gotten since the abortion - crime story first broke almost a decade ago .
The people e-mailing me ca n’t decide whether I am a moron , a traitor , or both .
Let me try again .
A lot of the angry responses make me wonder what everyday Americans think terrorists do all day .
My guess is that they brainstorm ideas for terrorist plots .
And you have to believe that terrorists are total idiots if it never occurred to them after the Washington , D.C. , sniper shootings that maybe a sniper plot was n’t a bad idea .
The point is this : there is a virtually infinite array of incredibly simple strategies available to terrorists .
The fact that it has been six years since the last major terrorist attack in the United States suggests either that the terrorists are incompetent , or that perhaps their goal is n’t really to generate terror .
( A separate factor is the prevention efforts by law enforcement and the government ; I ’ll address that later . )
Many of the angry emails I received demanded that I write a post explaining how we stop terrorists .
But the obvious answer is a disappointing one :
If terrorists want to engage in low - grade , low - tech terror , we are powerless to stop it .
That is the situation in Iraq right now , and , to a lesser degree , in Israel .
That was also more or less the situation with the IRA a while back .
So what can we do ?
Like the British and Israelis have done , if faced with this situation , Americans would figure out how to live with it .
The actual cost of this low - grade terrorism in terms of human lives is relatively small , compared to other causes of death like motor - vehicle crashes , heart attacks , homicide , and suicide .
It is the fear that imposes the real cost .
But just as people in countries with runaway inflation learn relatively quickly to live with it , the same happens with terrorism .
The actual risk of dying from an attack while riding a bus in Israel is low – and so , as Gary Becker and Yona Rubinstein have shown , people who have a lot of experience riding Israeli buses do n’t respond much to the threat of bombings .
Similarly , there is little wage premium for being a bus driver in Israel .
Beyond this , I think there are a few more prospective things we can do .
If the threat is from abroad , then we can do a good job screening risky people from entering the country .
That , too , is obvious .
Perhaps less obvious is that we can do a good job following potential risks after they enter the country .
If someone enters on a student visa and is n’t enrolled in school , for instance , he is worth keeping under close surveillance .
Another option is one the British have used : putting cameras everywhere .
This is very anti-American , so it probably would never fly here .
I also am not sure it is a good investment .
But the recent terrorist attacks in the U.K. suggest that these cameras are at least useful after the fact in identifying the perpetrators .
The work of my University of Chicago colleague Robert Pape suggests that the strongest predictor of terrorist acts is the occupation of a group ’s territory .
From that perspective , having American troops in Iraq is probably not helping to reduce terrorism — although it may be serving other purposes .
Ultimately , though , it strikes me that there are two possible interpretations of our current situation vis-a - vis terrorism .
One view is the following : the main reason we are n’t currently being decimated by terrorists is that the government ’s anti-terror efforts have been successful .
The alternative interpretation is that the terror risk just is n’t that high and we are greatly overspending on fighting it , or at least appearing to fight it .
For most government officials , there is much more pressure to look like you are trying to stop terrorism than there is to actually stop it .
The head of the TSA ca n’t be blamed if a plane gets shot down by a shoulder - launched missile , but he is in serious trouble if a tube of explosive toothpaste takes down a plane .
Consequently , we put much more effort into the toothpaste even though it is probably a much less important threat .
Likewise , an individual at the CIA is n’t in trouble if a terrorist attack happens ; he or she is only in trouble if there is no written report that details the possibility of such an attack , which someone else should have followed up on , but never did because there are so many such reports written .
My guess is that the second scenario — the terrorism threat just is n’t that great — is the more likely one .
Which , if you think about it , is the optimistic view of the world .
But that probably still makes me a moron , a traitor , or both .
Are you a sentient being that has internal experiences and conscious awareness ?
If so , you may enjoy this post !
( If , instead , you are a philosophical zombie , devoid of any internal experience , you 're still welcome to read it anyway ...
Just be sure you properly pretend you enjoyed reading it ) .
In this post , I 'm going to use cartoons to explain what that feeling of " conscious awareness " is that we have in our heads .
This sensation of internal awareness is an incredibly weird thing , and appears to be completely distinct from other artifacts of our world .
How can it arise from physical matter ?
Why is it so hard for us to converse about it between ourselves , using language ?
Does it have an evolutionary purpose ?
In this post , I am going to try and get to the bottom of these questions .
Our exploration of consciousness is going to proceed in two stages : First , we need to think about what it means for something to be " real " .
Second , we 're going to look at the key steps in the evolution of the brain , and why these steps make it difficult for us to appreciate the true nature of our internal subjective experience .
Base Reality vs. Story Reality
" We do n't exist inside the physical world .
We exist inside a story that the brain tells itself . "
– Joscha Bach
All of us are familiar with the concept that we do n't experience the external world directly , but are instead insulated from that world by the processing of information that takes place in our sense organs .
However , if we want to really understand just how distant the operations of our minds are from the external world , we need to go much further than thinking merely about the obvious perceptual separation : there are far more profound barriers between our minds and the physical world than the separation introduced by our sensory system .
In fact , our minds are so far removed from the real world that it is best to think of it as residing in an entirely different type of reality .
Consider , for instance , this person visiting a grocery store on a typical day :
On the left , we see a picture of some random person 's everyday reality : a human being is making decisions as they are walking through a grocery store .
Inside that human 's brain , different information processing modules are performing the many tasks that are needed for the activity of purchasing groceries .
This process involves analyzing visual information , making purchasing decisions , as well as activating modules that weigh the importance of the current activity against other potential activities the human could be doing instead .
( I crudely indicated the processing modules that perform such sub - tasks by drawing little colored dots on the brain in the left panel ) .
This left panel shows us the concrete physicality of the grocery store , and shows us that the human brain delegates tasks to different modules of the brain .
However , these things are only distantly related to a person 's internal experience .
If we want to know what it truly feels like to shop for groceries , we need to look at something more akin to the panel on the right , where I have reinterpreted the same scene in terms of how objects in the grocery store , and the goals that the shopper is setting for themselves , exist within that person 's mind .
A person 's internal experience differs greatly from any concrete description of physical reality : inside a person 's brain , information generated by disparate brain modules is " stitched together " into a very coherent and integrated story , designed to allow that person to make decisions as effectively as possible .
This is what I 've attempted to draw in the right panel .
A person 's mind , as they are shopping for groceries , is filled with distinct and well - delineated impressions of objects in the world ( in the picture the person is considering the box of Chex and the shopping cart ) , which are seamlessly combined with internal mental artifacts ( such as the person 's annoyance at not finding a large box of Chex , or their anxiety about being late for work ) , in a way that allows the person to effectively perform many tasks , including shopping for groceries .
The critical goal of these panels is to illustrate the way in which our minds do not strictly exist in base reality .
Instead , our minds exist primarily inside a story that the brain creates for itself .
As a computer programmer might say , our minds are a reality " emulated " by the brain , which makes it fundamentally distinct from ordinary reality : the way time , space and external information are experienced by the mind is greatly warped from how those things exist in the base reality .
Also , just as one would find in an emulated computer program , the way our thoughts are assembled and organized in our minds probably bears little resemblance to the way those thoughts were generated by the modules of our brain .
At a fundamental level , the way information is organized in base reality vs. story reality differs significantly .
The biggest difference is that these differing realities have greatly divergent priorities : in the " story reality " the most important thing in the universe is YOU .
The story reality exists exclusively in order to let YOU gather information and to let YOU perform actions .
Of course , your brain tries to hide this fact from your mind , because a mind that is too self - absorbed would negate the evolutionary advantages that caused the brain to create the mind for itself in the first place .
The True Nature of Physical Reality
You may have objections to the notion that there are two such distinct realities at play .
For instance , you might argue that " it is incorrect that my mind experiences time and distance and objects in a completely different way from how those concepts exist in the real world .
For instance , if Event A precedes Event B in the real world , my mind will also unfailingly experience those events in the same order . "
First of all , some scientific experiments suggest that the order in which our minds experience sequential events can be highly inconsistent ( for instance , consider the classical experiments with brain stimulation done by Benjamin Libet ) .
But more importantly , if you believe this you are in fact overlooking an important truth that your brain is concealing from you : our minds were created through adaptive evolution , and in that context the mind 's purpose is to act as an efficient decision - making mechanism for tasks within the " real world " .
To this end , you are right that our minds duplicate some aspects of base reality in an extremely precise way .
However , duplicating all the details would be very inefficient and counterproductive .
In fact , the facsimile of the world that we see in our minds is rather crude : the truth is that the physical world , as it truly exists , is extremely different from what our minds think it is .
This is what the real truth of our world looks like :
In the left panel , I made an attempt to illustrate the physical world as it really is :
It is , in many ways , completely different from the way it appears to our minds .
For one , physicists tell us that base reality differs greatly from our folk conceptions of reality : i.e. , it is composed of quantum fields represented by wave functions , instead of the simpler , 3 - dimensional Newtonian world that appears obvious to us .
Secondly , base reality does not organize atoms into distinct objects such as " table " or " floor " , but treats each atom as a distinct entity .
The idea that the floor or a table are distinct objects are merely notions existing in our minds ( though certainly very convenient notions , from an evolutionary survival perspective ) .
Thirdly , the information we receive from the outside world , for instance in the form of photons hitting the retina of our eyes , is extremely chaotic and noisy , but we are shielded from this fact .
You 'll have to excuse my drawing abilities , because these are all things that are impossible to draw , so my cartoon above makes a rather feeble attempt to illustrate it .
The point is , if we could experience base reality as it really is we would find it to be very alien , harsh , and mostly incomprehensible .
In the right panel , we can see how this reality is instead perceived by our mind : in essence , given a theater performance within the " story reality " , where objects in base reality are replaced by crude facsimiles that our mind lazily accepts as real .
( Have you ever wondered why dreams are so easily accepted by our minds as real ?
As Joscha Bach has observed , this is because this same mechanism is at play during our dreams ) .
Our brain orchestrates a bunch of actors , somehow implemented through special modules in our brain ( illustrated as purple wizards in the picture above ) , that act out the real world in front of our mind , and in exchange the mind then makes behavioral decisions that confer survival advantages to the organism within base reality .
In short , our mind exists in a sort of " safe space " in which it receives highly - edited information about base reality .
Specifically , this information has been edited in a way that strips out as much information as possible , while still allowing the mind to perform its valuable decision - making activities .
Through millions of years of evolution , our brains have evolved to heavily edit this information to maximize efficiency , but brains have to be careful not to edit it too much , or the decisions made by the mind based on that information would no longer provide a survival advantage .
Note that this concept of the mind I 'm presenting differs substantially from that proposed by popular philosophers such as Daniel Dennett , who explicitly deny the existence of a " mind 's eye " or internal homunculus .
In their view , it is nonsense to think that there 's an internal viewer that 's experiencing reality as a sort of " theater " that 's being performed on its behalf .
Here , I claim the opposite : if we had such a theater it would offer an immense survival advantage , and precisely such a theater is taking place every waking hour ( and dreaming hour ) of our lives .
There was a recent movie which did a very good job of encapsulating the difference between " base reality " and " story reality " .
Can you guess which movie I 'm referring to ?
Anybody ? ...
It was the 2019 movie " Us " by Jordan Peele .
( Skip the next paragraph if you want to avoid some mild spoilers for this excellent movie ) .
[ SPOILERS START ] .
The horror at the heart of " Us " is of course that we are actually the people in the tunnels , not the people on the surface .
The people in the tunnels represent our minds , whereas the people on the surface represent our physical bodies .
Do you remember towards the end of the movie , how the underground people were acting out scenes on the surface as if in a stupor ?
How they were miming out riding on a roller coaster or eating a meal ?
This is Jordan Peele 's vision of what our " story reality " looks like , basically the exact same concept as the right panel in the picture above .
The only part the movie got wrong is that the surface is actually the more horrifying place –
If the movie had been more realistic , it would have shown the people on the surface fighting to enter the tunnels and enjoy their psychological comfort ... not the other way around !
[ SPOILERS STOP ] .
Why It 's Okay that Conscious Experience Seems Magical Alright , let 's suppose my claim is true , that our minds do not reside in base reality , but instead reside in a different " story reality " that is only distantly connected to our notion of " base reality " ... does this get us closer to understanding the notion of consciousness ?
I would argue that it does , because it means we no longer need to consider consciousness as a sort of distinct entity that exists in base reality .
In short , we naively tend to view consciousness as a sort of " magical experience " that transcends normal physical reality , an experience for which normal laws of physics lack any explanatory power .
But if , instead , our consciousness is a component of " story reality " , then this apparent magic is no longer an explanatory barrier : in the emulated story in which our mind resides , there is no inherent limitation that prevents the existence of " hyperphysical " artifacts .
( To phrase it in " hacker speak " : the x86 instruction set includes MMX vector instructions that do not exist on an ARM processor , but if an ARM processor is emulating an x86 program , it has no difficulty at all in emulating MMX instructions as well , even though MMX instructions do not exist in the " base reality " of an ARM CPU ) .
I will concede that this argument feels a bit like a cop-out : the explanation for consciousness we 've developed so far fails to address core questions you likely have , such as , " Why does the color red feel different to me from the color blue ?
Why would evolution require me to experience feelings , instead of simply existing as a mechanical zombie that is devoid of emotional states ? "
To address this next level of questions , we need to explore the evolution of our brains in more detail .
The Evolution of the Brain Let us divide the evolution of the human brain into three phases .
It 's possible that the three phases of brain evolution I present in this post deviate from the way our brains actually came about , but that 's okay : here , we are merely going to discuss what biologists refer to as a " just - so story " .
A " just - so story " means we 're going to make logical guesses about what happened in prehistory , without meaningful empirical data to support those guesses .
For our purposes , such historical speculation will be fine .
We are n't concerned about accurately characterizing the brain 's history , but are merely building a narrative to characterize the design that the brain manifests in the present .
The three phases of brain evolution I 'm going to be discussing are the reflex brain , the stateful brain and finally the modeling brain .
Each one of these represented a major innovation in the design of animal brains .
The Reflex Brain
The simplest type of animal brain is the version of the brain that you will read about in any biology textbook .
Roughly , this is the version of a brain you might imagine a fish would have .
This type of brain operates at the level of reflexes , and uses many hard - wired connections .
For example , let 's think about how a fish brain might decide if the fish should eat a donut , such as a raspberry jelly donut :
First , its brain needs to decide if the fish is physically capable of eating the donut : it accomplishes this through a circuit that combines sensory information arriving from the eyes ( shown in green in the upper panel ) as well as basic decision - making circuits in the brain itself that determine if the item to be consumed is not too big or too small .
In order for the fish to undergo the motions to eat the donut , this circuit has to say , " Eat it ! "
Anyone familiar with evolutionary theory can easily imagine how such a circuit would evolve and how the circuit would " know " what the right food size is for the fish : in the past , many fish likely ate potential food items that were too large and choked to death , leading to evolutionary pressure to avoid such objects .
Another neural circuit a fish brain is likely to have is a circuit attached to the fish 's gut which determines if the fish is still digesting previously - consumed food , essentially a circuit that tells the brain if the fish is hungry .
Only if the gut is empty and this circuit yells , " I am hungry ! " should the fish consume the donut .
Based on this concept of a simple fish brain relying solely on these types of concrete reflexes , we can already think of the fish as having a mind with a " story reality " , but for a simple fish it would be an extremely boring reality :
As you can see in this " warped version " of reality , a version of reality that looks at the world from the perspective of the fish 's mind , we can see the simple artifacts of " hunger " and " jelly donut " , but they are wrapped in a layer of green , which is my attempt to represent the sensory and motor neuron layers that lie between the fish 's mind and the external reality .
What this green barrier is illustrating is that in order for the fish 's mind to interact with the food item , the fish needs to use its neurons connected to its eyes to inspect the donut , or use neurons to activate its muscles to eat the donut .
The same is true of its perception of hunger , which requires the fish mind to make use of neurons connected to the gut .
The Stateful Brain
The " reflex brain " of a fish has a simple design , but also a rather inflexible one : this is because it relies on concrete connections between inputs ( from eyes and neurons monitoring the gut , etc. , ) and outputs ( animal behavior ) .
The next stage in brain sophistication is to add a layer of indirection between inputs and outputs to create a more general , multipurpose neuronal architecture .
With this type of design , an animal 's eating behavior is n't just directly triggered by neurons monitoring the gut .
Instead , the brain can now think " Animal is hungry ! " and maintain that as an ongoing fact to guide behavior .
As a programmer would say , the brain can process information more efficiently by maintaining " state " to represent properties about itself and of pertinent objects in the outside world .
This type of approach is more flexible and efficient for multiple reasons .
First of all , it allows the animal to take noisy signals it receives from its internal and external sensors and " smooth them out " , instead of relying on continuous sampling of its sensors .
In this way , an animal can maintain " object permanence " and not forget that it 's hungry as its hunger pangs come and go , or forget that it saw a food source , even if it is temporarily obstructed from view .
Secondly , having an internal representation of itself and its environment allows an animal to reuse brain circuits for multiple purposes , without needing to evolve each of them independently .
This means the brain can think " Animal is scared ! " and flee a predator , no matter how this fear developed - Regardless of whether the animal was bitten or saw a predator with its eyes , the same evasive actions can be taken .
In short , if the brain has an internal representation of the identity of the animal and of important objects in the environment , it can evolve higher - level circuitry that benefits from the simplification provided by this representation .
This stage of brain development , which I call the stateful brain , is where a " story reality " truly starts to take shape : once the brain has state management to represent the animal 's identity and the identity of significant objects in the external world , the " theater of the mind " can really begin to take shape .
It is hard to say when animal brains first developed notions of object permanence with internal state management , but I imagine that the stateful brain is what a mouse might experience .
Here is how we might illustrate the " story reality " of such a mouse :
Notice that artifacts in this reality are now wrapped by layers of two different colors .
As before , we have a green layer representing the barrier of sensory and motor neurons separating the mouse 's mind from the donut and perception of hunger .
But also , we now have an additional layer of indirection introduced by the brain 's state machinery , which maintains its own facsimile of the donut / hunger to improve object permanence .
This is the layer that is performing the theater on behalf of the mouse 's mind .
The state machine of the mouse now also makes it possible for the mouse 's brain to maintain more general abstract notions that are NOT directly tied to its senses , i.e. , the mouse 's story reality can now contain artifacts without a " green layer " .
This includes notions such as " fear " and " anger " , which can persist over time without requiring continuous sensory input .
The Modeling Brain
The final major leap in brain development is when animals developed the ability to model the world across time .
Again , it is hard to say exactly when this ability developed , but certainly monkeys and apes seem to possess an ability to model the outside world .
When an animal with a modeling brain sees a donut , it not only thinks of it as an object in the outside world with properties ... it also can make inferences about the past and the future of the donut .
For instance , it can speculate that a human likely placed the donut there , and can predict what it would feel like to eat the donut , or what the donut might look like if it was left , untouched , for [ what humans call ] a month .
Humans have mastered the art of looking at the world from a modeled perspective , and the ability to model has become integral to how we think .
Additionally , our social nature has reinforced this ability to model , since we use language to encode the models of our external world and can discuss them with other humans .
The ability to model the world is something that is deeply integral to how our brain works , something that was introduced into the brain ( once again ) through millions of years of evolutionary pressure .
The purpose of modeling the world is to enhance our ability to make decisions by predicting likely future events in the external world .
This is what the " story reality " of an ape might look like :

News has a very curious story today about software fights plane hijackers .
Essentially , some 30 European businesses and research institutes are working to create software that would make it possible from a distance to regain control of an aircraft from hijackers .
The system " which could only be controlled from the ground would conduct the aircraft posing a problem to the nearest airport whether it liked it or not , " according to extracts from next Monday 's Der Spiegel released Saturday .
" A hijacker would have no chance of reaching his goal , " it said .
The project costs 36 million euros ( 45 million dollars ) , of which the
European Commission is contributing 19.5 million euros , and involves aircraft maker Airbus , electronics giant Siemens and the Technical University of Munich .
The first results should be presented in Britain in October , the magazine said .
The system would be designed in such a way that even a computer hacker on board could not get round it .
Straight talk ?
Try crazy talk .
The man just accused the overwhelming majority of the American people of hating the troops .
When in the end , they 're simply going to hate John McCain .
" This is a vote of no confidence in both the mission and the troops who are going over there , " [ McCain ] said .
It is absolutely a vote of no confidence in the mission and the commander in chief , and nutjobs like John McCain who think that genuflecting to a disaster will somehow make it better .
As for dissing the troops , no one does that better than John McCain , George Bush and Joe Lieberman .
You three are sending American troops to die for a lie , for a lost war , for your mistakes , FOR NOTHING .
Sending someone to face sure disaster and die for your ego and your presidential ambitions is about as big a vote of no confidence in our troops as I can imagine .
So spare us the " you hate the troops " crap , crazy man .
Because j'accuse .

This weekend the Washington Post ran a story about Richard Barlow , a Pentagon whistle - blower in the late 1980s who tracked Pakistan and A.Q. Khan 's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons .
The U.S. government wanted to sell F - 16s to Pakistan to help the mujaheddin fight the Soviets in Afghanistan .
But Congress had prevented the sale of any equipment that could deliver nuclear weapons .
Barlow pointed out that selling the jets to Pakistan would violate non-proliferation laws and complained that the Pentagon was misleading Congress on the issue .
From the Post :
" Barlow wrote an analysis for then - Secretary Dick Cheney that concluded the planned F - 16 sale violated this law .
Drawing on detailed , classified studies , Barlow wrote about Pakistan 's ability , intentions and activities to deliver nuclear bombs using F - 16s it had acquired before the law was passed .
Barlow discovered later that someone rewrote his analysis so that it endorsed the sale of the F - 16s .
Arthur Hughes , the deputy assistant secretary of defense , testified to Congress that using the F - 16s to deliver nuclear weapons ' far exceeded the state of art in Pakistan ' – something Barlow knew to be untrue . "
Twisting the truth to support policy in the Middle East ?
Never !
When Barlow complained , he was instantly fired and stripped of his security clearance .
His intelligence career was ruined .
He now lives in a trailer in Montana and , even though Congress ' investigative arm backed up his position , is still fighting for a government pension that he feels is due .
And what happened to Dick Cheney and Barlow 's other higher - ups – Paul Wolfowitz and Stephen Hadley , among others ?
We do n't think they 're worrying about pensions .

A lot of software developers do n’t come from a Computer Science background .
I think in the long run this does n’t matter , since I ’ve seen a lot of CS grads who have completely forgotten things that are supposed to set them apart from the rest of us ( “ Lisp ?
You mean that AI language with a lot of parentheses ?
Yeah I used it before in uni . So ? ” ) .
Besides , a lot of CS grads ca n’t program anyway .
Plus , if one really cares about the programming craft , during his / her journey of ever improving his / her efficiency and effectiveness as a software programmer , one tends to come full circle and go back to the root , which is made of the stuff CS grads are forced to read about in university .
Now one of the thing that I find really interesting , yet had baffled me for a long time , is the Y Combinator ( no , not Paul Graham ’s company ) .
Maybe CS students eat Y Combinator for breakfast .
But I graduated as an electrical engineer .
It ’s only recently , when my programming self - improvement routine brought me to study Lisp , Scheme , and recursion in greater details , that I came across this strange Y thing that so many very smart people , like this guy , this guy , and this guy have written about .
Before this I ’ve never heard of it in my life .
It ’s like I ’m trying to digest what I think is a very cool and profound concept , and then I come across these mental landmines like “ pass the function as the first argument to itself ” , and my brain will just explode and I have to restart all over again .
What is Y Combinator , exactly ?
Why does it work ?
I do real - world applications in Java / C#/C++/JavaScript or whatever , I do n’t do Scheme for a living .
What ’s in it for me ?
Is it just a cool idea with no practical applications whatsoever ?
I find that the best way for me to understand something is to write about it .
So here it is .
JavaScript : Lisp in C’s Clothing
All examples will be in JavaScript .
Examples in Lisp / Scheme can be difficult to read , especially when you ’re not used to the language yet .
Writing the examples and illustrations in the familiar C- syntax will make it easier for me ( and you , if you ’re one of the two or three people who are reading this ) .
The examples wo n’t be in Java , because Java ’s obsession with nouns will make it awkward to write them .
The fact that functions are first - class in JavaScript makes things a LOT easier .
( If you need a short intro of JavaScript ’s true capabilities , I ’d shamelessly recommend this article . )
So , with that out of the way , let ’s start !
The Problem
Let ’s start by a simple basic recursive function : factorial .
Simplest function in the world , right ?
It ’s like the Hello World of recursion .
function factorial ( num ) { if ( num < 2 ) { return 1 ; } return num * factorial ( num - 1 ) ; }[/sourcecode ] < span style = " font - size:10 pt ; font- family : ' Courier New ' ; " ></ span>Of course , functions are first - class in JavaScript , so we could 've written it like this : var factorial = function ( num ) { if ( num < 2 ) { return 1 ; } return num * factorial ( num - 1 ) ; };[/sourcecode ]
But now we have a potential problem , do n't we ?
The recursive call to factorial within the method only works because we happen to name the variable " factorial " as well .
Should we name the variable differently , say , " fact " , instead of " factorial " : [ sourcecode language= ' jscript ' ] var fact = function ( num ) { if ( num < 2 ) { return 1 ; } return num * factorial ( num - 1 ) ; } ;[/sourcecode ]
Then we get an error , because when we call " factorial ( num - 1 ) " , the name " factorial " is not bound to anything .
We can fix it for this case by changing the call to " fact ( num - 1 ) " , of course , but this approach is a quick fix that does n't work , because this function can be assigned to any variable of any name .
We have a problem that can be summed up thus : < i >< b> a recursive function is a function that calls itself .
But an anonymous function has no name .
So ... how is it supposed to call itself for recursion ?
</b></i> < h4 > First Attempt </h4 >
( If you 're thinking : " Just give the bloody function a bloody name so you can make it recursive and get on with your life ! " , I can't say I totally disagree with you at this point .
But anyway . )
So what can we do here ?
Well for one , we can keep the function anonymous , and get the name for recursion from a parameter passed to the anonymous function , like this : var fact = function ( forRec , num ) { if ( num < 2 ) { return 1 ; } return num * forRec ( forRec , num - 1 ) ; };[/sourcecode ]
Then when we want to use it , we just pass the name of the function to itself , like this : < big > < code > js > fact ( fact , 0 ) 1.0 js > fact ( fact , 1 ) 1.0 js > fact ( fact , 2 ) 2.0 js > fact ( fact , 3 ) 6.0</ code > </big>No matter what the name is , as long as we keep passing the same name as the first parameter , we 'll be OK -- the anonymous function will be correctly calling itself .
< h4 > But ... OK , Second Attempt </h4 >
The solution < i> kinda </i > works .
But it 's not nice , requiring your users to your function name twice everytime they want to use it .
Besides , now the code becomes less clear -- everybody knows factorial , but this self - passing - to - self business is obfuscating the code .
I believe we can do better .
Let 's try to separate the " passing a function to itself " bit from the " calculate factorial of " bit , by currying it .
Like this : var createFact = function ( forRec ) { return function ( num ) { if ( num < 2 ) { return 1 ; } return num * ( forRec( forRec ) ) ( num - 1 ) ; } ; } ; [ / sourcecode ] ( < a href = " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying
">Currying , or Schönfinkelisation </a > , is a lesson to all of us to choose names that are easy to spell , remember , and pronounce .
Or else you may invent something and the other guy with the catchier name -- who can compete with Curry ? -- gets the credit . )
In the snippet above , the outer anonymous function ( the one with forRec as a parameter ) returns another anonymous function ( the one accepting parameter num ) .
The latter is very similar to our original factorial function ( remember that our objective is to separate the passing - function - to - itself bit from the factorial bit ) , except for the bit in green : < span style = " font - size:10 pt ; font- family : ' Courier New ' ; color : green ; " >( forRec( forRec ) ) < / span >< span style= " font - size:10 pt; font- family :' Courier New ' ; color : #5c5c5c ; " >(</ span >< span style= " font - size:10 pt; font- family :' Courier New ' ; color : black ; " >num </ span >< span style= " font - size:10 pt; font- family :' Courier New ' ; " > < span style= " color : #5c5c5c ; " >-</ span > < span style= " color : #004080 ; " >1</ span >< span style= " color:#5c5c5c ; " >) ;</span></span>
That line is where the inner function needs to recurse .
But instead of requiring a name to recurse , it calls the outer function ... which returns the inner function itself .
And that returned inner function is in turn called , with " num - 1 " as its argument .
There we have our recursion .
So now we have a slightly cleaner solution .
We can use the outer function to create the inner function like this : < big > < code > js > var factorial = createFact ( createFact ) ; js> factorial ( 10 ) 3628800.0</code ></big > < big >< code ></code></big>
Note that this is equivalent to this one - liner : < big >< code>js > createFact( createFact ) ( 10 ) 3628800.0</code > </ big > Hmmm .
The code for the factorial function is still polluted , though .
Let 's try to take out the anonymous recursion part from the factorial function entirely .
< h4 > Third Attempt : Wrap , and wrap , and wrap , and wrap ...</ h4 > Our second attempt is still not as clean as we want it to be .
Ideally , we want to separate the part that takes care of the anonymous recursion , from the part that actually does the factorial computation .
Let 's see our last function again : var createFact = function ( forRec ) { return function ( num ) { if ( num < 2 ) { return 1 ; } return num * ( forRec( forRec ) ) ( num - 1 ) ; } ; } ;[/sourcecode ]
The only difference between the inner function and a typical factorial function is the recursive part .
Let 's try to take that forRec ( forRec ) bit out -- that is , instead of doing it inside , let 's see if we can do it outside and pass it in as a parameter .
Here 's the function again , with the forRec( forRec ) taken out of the picture : [ sourcecode language= ' jscript ' ] var fact = function ( rec ) { return function ( num ) { if ( num < 2 ) { return 1 ; } return num * rec( num - 1 ) ; } ; } ; [ / sourcecode ] < span style = " font - size:10 pt ; font- family : ' Courier New ' ; " ></ span > < p class= " MsoNormal " >< span style = " font - size:10 pt ; font- family : ' Courier New ' ; " >
</ span></p> < p class= " MsoNormal " >
And like I said above , we do the forRec ( forRec ) outside , and then pass it to the fact function : </ p> var recur = function ( forRec ) { return function ( n ) { return fact ( forRec( forRec ) ) ( n ) ; } } ;
Then we use it like this : js > var factorial = recur( recur ) ;
js > factorial ( 6 )
720.0
Or , as we ’ve seen above :
js > recur ( recur ) ( 6 )
720.0
Did you follow what happened during the recur( recur ) call this time ?
From recur ‘s definition , a call to recur( recur ) returns an anonymous function like this ( substituting the parameter with the actual argument ) :
function ( n ) { return fact ( recur ( recur ) ) ( n ) ; }
Let ’s see what happens when this anonymous function is called : it returns the result of calling fact ( recur ( recur ) ) with argument n.
Now what does fact ( recur ( recur ) ) evaluate to ?
If we go back to the definition of fact , it returns the following anonymous function :
function ( num ) { if ( num < 2 ) { return 1 ; } return num * recur ( recur ) ( num - 1 ) ; } ; [ / sourcecode ] which does the actual computation of the factorial .
And when we reach this line : < span style = " font - size:10 pt ; font- family : ' Courier New ' ; " ><b>< span style= " color : #0000c0 ; " ></ span></b></span><span style= " font - size:10 pt; font- family :' Courier New ' ; " ><b>< span style= " color : #0000c0 ; " > return </ span></b> < span style= " color : black ; " >num </ span > < span style= " color :#5c5c5c ; " >*</ span > < span style= " color : black ;" >recur ( recur ) </ span >< span style= " color : #5c5c5c ; " >(</ span >< span style= " color : black ; " >num </ span > < span style= " color :#5c5c5c ; " >-</ span > < span style= " color : #004080 ; " >1</ span >< span style= " color:#5c5c5c ; " >) ;</span></span> < p class= " MsoNormal " > We see that we have < code ></ code >< code> recur</code>< code>(</code>< code>recur</code>< code>)</ code >.
Which we have shown above , to eventually evaluate back to this factorial - computing anonymous function itself .
In other words , it is calling itself .
Ladies and gentlemen , we have recursion !
</p> < h4 > Okay ... So What ?</h4 > Indeed .
So what ?
In the last attempt , we still have to call recur( recur ) before using it ?
Well , the difference is that we have separated the anonymous recursion mechanism from the factorial logic .
So for instance , instead of hard - coding the call to < code > fact </ code > inside recur , we can make it a parameter , like this : var recurWrapper = function ( f ) { var recur = function ( forRec ) { return function ( n ) { return f( forRec( forRec ) ) ( n ) ; } } ; return recur( recur ) ; } ;
Then we can use it like this : js> recurWrapper ( fact ) ( 6 ) ;
720.0
Eh , that ’s better !
No more of this passing self to self bit ( because it ’s wrapped inside the wrapper ) .
And now we can tidy up recurWrapper a bit .
Shortening parameter names a bit and naming the recur function ( instead of assigning the anonymous function to a variable called recur ) gives us this :
var recurWrapper = function ( f ) { function recur( forRec ) { return function ( n ) { return f( forRec( forRec ) ) ( n ) ; } } ; return recur( recur ) ; } ;
There is a better name for recurWrapper , and that is Y :
function Y( f ) { function recur( r ) { return function ( n ) { return f( r ( r ) ) ( n ) ; } } ; return recur( recur ) ; }
which is really the JavaScript version of the ( applicative - order or not ?
we shall see ) Y Combinator .
And it works with any single argument anonymous function that is supposed to be recursive .
For example , here ’s Y with a function to compute the Fibonacci number :
var fibo = Y( function ( f ) { return function ( n ) { if ( n <= 2 ) { return 1 ; } else { return f(n - 1 ) + f( n - 2 ) ; } } } ) ; [/ sourcecode ] < h4 > Applicative Order Y Or Not ( And What The Heck Is That ? ) ?</h4 > < a href= " http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node85.html "
>
Here 's a good explanation < /a >.
In short , there are two ways of evaluation in programming languages .
< i>Applicative order </i > is eager evaluation : arguments to a function are evaluated first before the function itself is executed .
Whereas the < i> normal order < /i > is lazy .
Arguments to functions are evaluated when they need to be evaluated .
As such , there are two flavours of Y as well .
The classic Y Combinator works when we 're using normal order of evaluation , but will hang when the evaluation is applicative order ( just like in JavaScript , which evaluates the arguments first before a function is called ) .
This normal Y Combinator is defined as such in lambda calculus : < b >Y</b> = λf · ( λx·f ( x x ) ) ( λx·f ( x x ) ) which is closer to this : function normal Y ( f ) { function recur( x ) { return f( x ( x ) ) ; } return recur( recur ) ; }
Which will hang , obviously , if you think in the applicative order way of thinking .
The Y we just derived earlier , on the other hand , is applicative order .
Note the difference in lambda calculus definition ( the difference is in bold italic ) :
Z = λf. ( λx. f ( λy. x x y ) ) ( λx. f ( λy. x x y ) )
and its corresponding JavaScript version :
function applicativeOrderY ( f ) { function recur( x ) { return function (y ) { return f( x ( x ) ) ( y ) ; } } ; return recur( recur ) ; }
Right .
Okay .
So What ’s In It For Me ?
Yeah .
That ’s it .
What ’s in it for me beyond the “ oh , neat ” factor ?
Er. Frankly , I ’m not sure .
In the real world , if I need to write a recursive function , I will just give it a bloody name .
Like alucard ( ) .
And doing Y combinator in your JavaScript codebase will probably piss off a web designer who has the misfortune of maintaining your code in the future .
I guess the main benefit of this whole exercise is that I feel good about understanding the Y combinator at last .
It wo n’t make me a better programmer , at least in the short run , but heck .
Having an iPod also does n’t make your life any better other than making you feel good .
So there .
UPDATE : I was surprised to see a big jump in my blog stat !
Turned out that Matt Jaynes submitted this article to Y Combinator Startup News , and then linuxer submitted it to programming subreddit !
Christophe Grand and others in reddit and news .
ycombinator pointed out that JavaScript has a built - in way of doing this using arguments .
callee ( see also Christophe ’s comment below for a short example of how this is done ) .
My intention was to derive the Y Combinator using a language with which a lot of people ( including myself ) are familiar ( that is , JavaScript ) , instead of answering the question “ how does one make an anonymous function call itself in JavaScript ? ” , but thanks anyway , guys !
Chris Rathman pointed out here that I ’m still using a named function for my definition of Y( ) .
Here ’s my definition of Y again :
function Y( f ) { function recur( r ) { return function ( n ) { return f( r ( r ) ) ( n ) ; } } ; return recur( recur ) ; }
This definition is probably easier to understand because it uses JavaScript constructs that are familiar to most people , but like Chris said , we can go for the fully anonymous variant .
Douglas Crockford also has a fully anonymous version in his The Little JavaScripter page , but let ’s see how we can get to there from the definition we ’ve seen in this article .
First of all , remember that in JavaScript , we can define and call a function at one go like this : js > var y = function ( x ) { return x * x ; }( 2 ) ;
js > y
4.0
So with that in mind , we can replace the last line “ return recur ( recur ) ; ” with an anonymous function that wraps around it like this :
var Y = function ( f ) { return function ( recur ) { return recur( recur ) ; }( /* we must pass something here */ ) ; } ;
And now what ’s left , is to call this anonymous function directly , passing the ( anonymized ) body of the recur function in my original definition of Y .
Like this :
var anonY = function ( f ) { return function ( recur ) { return recur( recur ) ; } ( function ( r ) { return function ( n ) { return f( r ( r ) ) ( n ) ; } } ) ; } ;
Which looks a little different from Douglas Crockford ’s version ( which is more similar to the one Chris posted in reddit ) , but they ’re really different ways of saying the same thing .
Man !
This whole thing surely has been real educational for me 🙂
( And I hope for you too ! )
Thanks very much , everyone !
There are lots of things you can criticize about Windows XP 's approach to software patches .
But when we asked around , the biggest complaint by far was how the OS 's Windows Update feature ( also known as Microsoft Update ) pops up a dialog box nagging you to reboot your PC ) and continues to do so every ten minutes until you obey .
( Ignore it , and the machine may reboot if you walk away for a moment , sometimes destroying unsaved data in the process . )
That dialog box is in desperate need of a button marked " I 'll Reboot When I'm Damn Well Ready . "
Windows Vista 's version does n't offer that , but it does allow you to wait up to four hours before being pestered again .
Research into the biology of fat is turning up some surprising new insights about how obesity kills .
The weight of the evidence :
It 's the toxic mischief of the flesh itself .
Experts have realized for decades that large people die young , and the explanation long seemed obvious .
Carrying around all those extra pounds must put a deadly strain on the heart and other organs .
Obvious but wrong , it turns out .
While the physical burden contributes to arthritis and sleep apnea , among other things , it is a minor hazard compared with the complex and insidious damage wrought by the oily , yellowish globs of fat that cover human bodies like never before .
A series of recent discoveries suggests that all fat - storage cells churn out a stew of hormones and other chemical messengers that fine - tune the body 's energy balance .
But when spewed in vast amounts by cells swollen to capacity with fat , they assault many organs in ways that are bad for health .
The exact details are still being worked out , but scientists say there is no doubt this flux of biological cross talk hastens death from heart disease , strokes , diabetes and cancer , diseases that are especially common among the obese .
" When we look at fat tissue now , we see it 's not just a passive depot of fat , " says Dr. Rudolph Leibel of Columbia University .
" It 's an active manufacturer of signals to other parts of the body . "
The first real inkling that fat is more than just inert blubber was the discovery 10 years ago of the substance leptin .
Scientists were amazed to find that this static - looking flesh helps maintain itself by producing a chemical that regulates appetite .
Roughly 25 different signaling compounds – with names like resistin and adiponectin – are now known to be made by fat cells , Leibel estimates , and many more undoubtedly will be found .
" There is an explosion of information about just what it is and what it does , " Dr. Allen Spiegel , director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , says of fat .
" It is a tremendously dynamic organ . "
Fat tissue is now recognized to be the body 's biggest endocrine organ , and its sheer volume is impressive even in normal - size people .
A trim woman is typically 30 percent fat , a man 15 percent .
That is enough fuel to keep someone alive without eating for three months .
The fat cell 's main job is to store our excess calories as fat .
When people grow obese , their fat cells swell with fat and can plump up to three times normal size .
As very overweight people get fatter still , they may also layer on many more fat cells .
The problem is the volume of chemicals these oversize cells churn out , says Dr. George Bray of Louisiana State University .
" The big cell secretes more of everything that it secreted when it was small .
When you get more of these things , they are not good for you . "
Many scientists are trying to learn exactly what these excess secretions do that is so harmful .
The answers will help explain – and perhaps offer solutions to – the real tragedy of the obesity epidemic , its disastrous effect on health .
Obesity is a huge and growing killer , in the United States just slightly behind smoking .
Moderately obese people live two to five years less than normal - size folks .
For the severely obese , the reduction in life span may be five to 10 years .
By far the biggest single threat of obesity is heart disease .
Someone with a body mass index over 30 has triple the usual risk .
Scientists can visualize many ways that fat cells ' chemical flood contributes to heart attacks , heart failure and cardiac arrest .
For instance , it has long been known that weight increases blood pressure .
Once doctors thought this was a matter of physics , the force needed to push blood through the many more yards of blood vessels that nourish the extra flesh .
But now it is clear that fat can trigger high blood pressure by making blood vessels narrow in several chemical ways .
For instance , it produces a substance called angiotensinogen that is a powerful constrictor .
At the same time , it stimulates the sympathetic nerves to squeeze the circulatory system .
And that may just be the beginning .
" It 's a very complicated system , and the more we learn about it , the more complicated it becomes , " says Dr. Xavier Pi-Sunyer , head of obesity research at St. Luke 's Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City .
One of the clearest hazards of overfilled fat cells is their influence on the body 's production and use of insulin , the hormone that instructs the muscle to burn energy and the fat cells to store it .
Oversize fat cells blunt the insulin message , in part by leaking fat into the bloodstream .
So the pancreas must compensate by making more insulin and other proteins .
Scientists now understand that increasing insulin levels – part of a condition called insulin resistance – are particularly harmful .
They can directly damage the walls of arteries and lead to clogging .
That leaking fat may also infiltrate the heart muscle , contributing to congestive heart failure .
Misplaced deposits of fat can also ruin the liver and have become the second - leading reason for liver transplants after hepatitis B .
Fat cells churn out a variety of proteins that cause inflammation , too .
These may be especially destructive to the gunky buildups in the arteries , causing them to burst and triggering heart attacks and strokes .
These inflammatory proteins and other fat - driven chemicals , such as growth hormones , may also contribute to one of the less - appreciated consequences of obesity – cancer .
" There is now conclusive evidence that obesity causes some cancers and strong evidence that it contributes to a wide variety of others , " says Dr. Michael Thun , epidemiology chief at the American Cancer Society .
The cancer society estimates that staying trim could eliminate 90,000 U.S. cancer deaths a year .
Among the varieties most clearly linked to weight are cancer of the breast , uterus , colon , kidney , esophagus , pancreas and gallbladder .
The best evidence of how obesity causes malignancy is in breast cancer in older women .
When the ovaries shut down after menopause , fat tissue becomes the primary producer of estrogen , which in turn can fuel the growth of breast tumors .
The heavier women are when diagnosed with breast cancer , the more likely they are to die from the disease , says Dr. Michelle Holmes of Boston 's Brigham and Women 's Hospital .
" Presumably it 's because their cancers are dependent on estrogen , and heavier women have more estrogen . "
Still , big - ticket killers like heart disease and cancer only start the long list of obesity 's health ills .
Among other things , obese people are more prone to depression , gallstones , even dying when in car accidents .
Says Dr. Michael Jensen of the Mayo Clinic , " There are so many ways that obesity can kill you . "

LONDON , England --
It 's a question that has baffled scientists , academics and pub bores through the ages :
What came first , the chicken or the egg ?
Now a team made up of a geneticist , philosopher and chicken farmer claim to have found an answer .
It was the egg .
Put simply , the reason is down to the fact that genetic material does not change during an animal 's life .
Therefore the first bird that evolved into what we would call a chicken , probably in prehistoric times , must have first existed as an embryo inside an egg .
Professor John Brookfield , a specialist in evolutionary genetics at the University of Nottingham , told the UK Press Association the pecking order was clear .
The living organism inside the eggshell would have had the same DNA as the chicken it would develop into , he said .
" Therefore , the first living thing which we could say unequivocally was a member of the species would be this first egg , " he added .
" So , I would conclude that the egg came first . "
The same conclusion was reached by his fellow " eggsperts " Professor David Papineau , of King 's College London , and poultry farmer Charles Bourns .
Mr Papineau , an expert in the philosophy of science , agreed that the first chicken came from an egg and that proves there were chicken eggs before chickens .
He told PA people were mistaken if they argued that the mutant egg belonged to the " non-chicken " bird parents .
" I would argue it is a chicken egg if it has a chicken in it , " he said .
" If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched , that would surely be an ostrich egg , not a kangaroo egg . "
Bourns , chairman of trade body Great British Chicken , said he was also firmly in the pro-egg camp .
He said : " Eggs were around long before the first chicken arrived .
Of course , they may not have been chicken eggs as we see them today , but they were eggs . "
The debate , which may come as a relief to those with argumentative relatives , was organized by Disney to promote the release of the film " Chicken Little " on DVD .

Jon Stewart put together a highlight reel from Gonzo 's testimony yesterday .
My how far his story has evolved since March 13th .

“ After weeks of mock testimony , there you have it .
Alberto Gonzales does n’t know what happened , but he assures you what he does n’t remember was handled properly . ”
San Francisco Chronicle :
When told by reporters that Gonzales had replied " I do n't recall " 55 times in his first round of questioning , ranking committee Republican Sen .
Arlen Specter quipped , " That 's an improvement , I 'd say . "
Yet Specter still does n't call for his resignation and Bush is " pleased . "
How far has the bar been lowered ?
Geez .
Gonzales is either lying or massively incompetent .
Either way he should n't be Attorney General .
Interesting , albeit tragic , story here ; an excerpt :
One hot , dusty day in June , Col .
Ted Westhusing was found dead in a trailer at a military base near the Baghdad airport , a single gunshot wound to the head .
The Army would conclude that he committed suicide with his service pistol .
At the time , he was the highest - ranking officer to die in Iraq ....
Col .
Westhusing was no ordinary officer .
He was one of the Army 's leading scholars of military ethics , a full professor at West Point who volunteered to serve in Iraq to be able to better teach his students .
He had a doctorate in philosophy ; his dissertation was an extended meditation on the meaning of honor .
So it was only natural that Westhusing acted when he learned of possible corruption by U.S. contractors in Iraq .
A few weeks before he died , Westhusing received an anonymous complaint that a private security company he oversaw had cheated the U.S. government and committed human rights violations .
Westhusing confronted the contractor and reported the concerns to superiors , who launched an investigation .
In e-mails to his family , Westhusing seemed especially upset by one conclusion he had reached : that traditional military values such as duty , honor and country had been replaced by profit motives in Iraq , where the U.S. had come to rely heavily on contractors for jobs once done by the military ....
In his 352 - page dissertation , Westhusing discussed the ethics of war , focusing on examples of military honor from Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee to the Israeli army .
It is a dense , searching and sometimes personal effort to define what , exactly , constitutes virtuous conduct in the context of the modern U.S. military .
" Born to be a warrior , I desire these answers not just for philosophical reasons , but for self - knowledge , " he wrote in the opening pages ....
In January , Westhusing began work on what the Pentagon considered the most important mission in Iraq : training Iraqi forces to take over security duties from U.S. troops .
Westhusing 's task was to oversee a private security company , Virginia - based USIS , which had contracts worth $ 79 million to train a corps of Iraqi police to conduct special operations .
In March , Gen. David Petraeus , commanding officer of the Iraqi training mission , praised Westhusing 's performance , saying he had exceeded " lofty expectations . "
" Thanks much , sir , but we can do much better and will , " Westhusing wrote back , according to a copy of the Army investigation of his death that was obtained by The Times .
In April , his mood seemed to have darkened .
He worried over delays in training one of the police battalions .
Then , in May , Westhusing received an anonymous four - page letter that contained detailed allegations of wrongdoing by USIS .
The writer accused USIS of deliberately shorting the government on the number of trainers to increase its profit margin .
More seriously , the writer detailed two incidents in which USIS contractors allegedly had witnessed or participated in the killing of Iraqis .
A USIS contractor accompanied Iraqi police trainees during the assault on Fallouja last November and later boasted about the number of insurgents he had killed , the letter says .
Private security contractors are not allowed to conduct offensive operations .
In a second incident , the letter says , a USIS employee saw Iraqi police trainees kill two innocent Iraqi civilians , then covered it up .
A USIS manager " did not want it reported because he thought it would put his contract at risk . "
Westhusing reported the allegations to his superiors but told one of them , Gen. Joseph Fil , that he believed USIS was complying with the terms of its contract .
U.S. officials investigated and found " no contractual violations , " an Army spokesman said .
Bill Winter , a USIS spokesman , said the investigation " found these allegations to be unfounded . "
However , several U.S. officials said inquiries on USIS were ongoing .
One U.S. military official , who , like others , requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case , said the inquiries had turned up problems , but nothing to support the more serious charges of human rights violations ....
The letter shook Westhusing , who felt personally implicated by accusations that he was too friendly with USIS management , according to an e-mail in the report ....
The colonel began to complain to colleagues about " his dislike of the contractors , " who , he said , " were paid too much money by the government , " according to one captain ....
Most of the [ suicide ] letter is a wrenching account of a struggle for honor in a strange land .
" I cannot support a msn [ mission ] that leads to corruption , human rights abuse and liars .
I am sullied , " it says .
" I came to serve honorably and feel dishonored .
" Death before being dishonored any more . "
A psychologist reviewed Westhusing 's e-mails and interviewed colleagues .
She concluded that the anonymous letter had been the " most difficult and probably most painful stressor . "
She said that Westhusing had placed too much pressure on himself to succeed and that he was unusually rigid in his thinking .
Westhusing struggled with the idea that monetary values could outweigh moral ones in war .
This , she said , was a flaw .
" Despite his intelligence , his ability to grasp the idea that profit is an important goal for people working in the private sector was surprisingly limited , " wrote Lt. Col. Lisa Breitenbach .
" He could not shift his mind - set from the military notion of completing a mission irrespective of cost , nor could he change his belief that doing the right thing because it was the right thing to do should be the sole motivator for businesses . "
Never Check Your Email First Or Last
I used to have this routine where I would check my email , go to bed , wake up , eat breakfast , and check my email again .
I used to believe that this was the way to do things ; by making sure I did n’t miss anything throughout the night .
I figured that if I wanted to be productive during the day , I ’d have to clear out the inbox first .
And if I did n’t clear out the inbox at night , I ’d be left with even more email to check in the morning .
What started out seemingly as a great plan to control my email and become more productive , quickly turned into making my life more cluttered , unscheduled and less productive .
The Nightly “ Mail ” Check
Checking my email at night before I went to bed soon started to affect other areas of my life .
The most obvious thing was that I was staying up much later than I planned .
Email is great at distracting you , mainly because you can open it up and anything can be waiting for you inside .
A work proposal , one of 10 uninteresting forwards from your grandma that day , a really weird Japanese game show video ; anything can be in there .
And because you ca n’t plan on what ’s in there , you have to check it all .
And it will distract you , mark my words .
You ’ll watch the movie , and then you ’ll want to watch more because it was sooo funny , and pretty soon you ’re no longer checking your email .
Before you know it , you ’ll have spent an hour “ checking your email ” , and you had n’t really gotten anything done .
I ’ve fallen down this road many a time , and before I knew it I was finding myself up 2 hours later than planned .
I was n’t giving myself enough time for a good night ’s sleep , and was n’t able to wake up when I wanted to the next day .
This is especially crucial because I ’ve found that I ’m most productive in the mornings .
By staying up hours later than planned , I ’d either be faced with waking up without adequate sleep or waking up later and missing those important productive hours .
The AM Bombardment
Now , if you ’re like me , you live and die by your email .
It is essential to my work life and personal life , and without it I curl up into a fetal position and start sucking my thumb .
Naturally , you can see why I felt it was important to check my email every morning .
So I ’d cater to my email addiction and hop on the computer as quickly as possible , only to find again that I was getting sidetracked like the night before while burning those precious productive hours .
This vicious cycle kept going until I started to do one thing ; waiting to check my email until I had gotten at least one task done .
I was inspired by a book I discovered on Amazon ( thanks Gina ) called “ Never Check Email In the Morning “ .
By not checking my email until I had gotten at least one task done , I was forcing myself to become less dependent on my AM email fix , and to start controlling my inbox instead of having it control me .
Merlin Mann at 43 Folders puts it best :
Waiting an hour or so to collect the overnight haul buys me time to wake up , get some work done , and generally orient myself .
By the the time I raise the electronic flood gate , I ’m already feeling on top of things and have no problem blowing through all my mail in a few short minutes .
Even the crazy ones
By not checking your email at night you ’ll find that you ’ll get more sleep , and you wo n’t really be missing anything too important anyway .
And by not checking your email first thing in the morning , you ’ll be more productive throughout the day .
By taking control of your email , you ’ll find how in the scope of things , you can easily check it less often and when you do you ’ll get through your inbox faster , with a more deliberate purpose .

As if cold sores were n’t bad enough , herpes simplex virus type 1 may now be linked to Alzheimer ’s disease .
The connection involves apolipoprotein E ( apoE ) , a protein that helps to transport cholesterol through the body .
There are several types of apoE genes ; one , APOE - e4 , is the leading risk factor for developing Alzheimer ’s .
In previous studies , researchers also found that people who have the APOE - e4 gene and have herpes simplex DNA in their brains are even more likely to be afflicted with Alzheimer’s .
To probe the link between gene and virus , neuroscientist HowardFederoff , of the University of Rochester School of Medicine , and his colleagues created mouse - cell cultures that expressed either theAPOE - e4 gene or another variant ( APOE - e2 or APOE - e3 ) , then infected the cells with herpes .
While all the cell types could be infected , the virus was much more likely to be active in the cells expressingAPOE - e4 .
“ There is something about APOE - e4 that may control the way the virus decides if it is going to be more or less active , ” Federoff says .
An active virus means cell injury or death ; a dormant virus poses no threat .
How that might eventually predispose a person to Alzheimer ’s is still unclear , but it may involve a receptor molecule for the herpes virus in the connections between nerve cells .
“ The failure of the electrical connections , which would cause cognitive impairment , might be linked in some way with the herpes simplex virus , ” Federoff says .
But he warns , “ The last thing I would want people to believe is that if they have the herpes virus or frequent cold sores , they are definitely going to get Alzheimer ’s .
The virus represents just one possible factor . ”
Medications are available that can prevent reactivation of the virus — and cold sores .
But if it ’s necessary to prevent herpes simplex infection in the first place to ward off Alzheimer ’s , “ it could spawn an effort to develop prophylactic vaccines , ” Federoff says .
At an event that linked the most sensitive domestic and foreign policy issues currently before the White House -- immigration and the war in Iraq -- President Bush on Monday attended a ceremony at which three wounded soldiers were given U.S. citizenship .
He also signed legislation blocking condominium associations from prohibiting residents from flying the U.S. flag .
“ If somebody is willing to risk their life for our country , they ought to be full participants in our country , ” Bush said in a ceremony at Walter Reed Army Medical Center before Emilio Gonzalez , the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services , administered the citizenship oath to the three men who suffered severe wounds in Iraq .
Under an executive order Bush signed in July 2002 , U.S. military personnel who are not citizens are eligible for immediate naturalization through active - duty service under certain conditions during periods of military hostilities .
According to the White House , more than 26,000 members of the military have been naturalized since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
“ As our nation debates the future of our immigration policies , we must remember the contribution of these good men , and all who dream of contributing to this country ’s future , ” Bush said .

The three soldiers are Pfc. Eduardo Leal - Cardenas , 21 , of Los Angeles , originally from Mexico ; Spec. Noe Santos - Dilone , 21 , of New York City , originally from the Dominican Republic ; and Spec. Sergio Lopez , 24 , of Bolingbrook , Ill. , originally from Mexico .
The flag legislation generated little attention and was approved on a voice vote in the Senate , its final hurdle , July 17 .
Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett ( R - Md. ) said he introduced it after a constituent reported that some condominium associations had policies preventing homeowners from displaying the flag .
The legislation was part of a package of measures making their way through Congress that Republicans hope will energize conservative voters with appeals to patriotism and conservative values .

In a written statement , Bush praised the legislation as “ an important measure to protect our citizens ’ right to express their patriotism here at home without burdensome restrictions . ”
Like many of his novels , Spanish author Javier Marías ’ new book , Thus Bad Begins , is n’t exactly a mystery , though it is mysterious .
Here , the 65 - year - old perennial Nobel favorite tells the story of Juan de Vere , a young man working for a film director , Eduardo Muriel .
The older man assigns his apprentice the task of finding out a secret about a longtime friend .
Meanwhile , de Vere is intrigued by the cold relationship between Muriel and his depressed wife Beatriz–at some point in their past , she did something unforgivable , also a secret , and de Vere wants to find out what .
Marías ( The Infatuations , A Heart So White ) makes hypnotic use of discursive prose , punctuating almost every action and piece of dialogue with a long , philosophical interrogation that somehow never detracts from the story ’s drama .
No story is new , de Vere says –the ways we wrong one another have all been seen before by “ the cold moon , which dozes and observes with just one eye open . ”
But that does n’t make tales of conflict and betrayal any less fascinating to those of us walking the earth .
As de Vere and Muriel try to get to the heart of matters , they discover secrets they wish they had n’t , events they wish only the “ sentinel moon ” had witnessed .
“ When you give up trying to know what you cannot know , ” says Muriel , “ perhaps , to paraphrase Shakespeare , perhaps that is when bad begins , but , on the other hand , worse remains behind . ”
The characters may wish they ’d closed their eyes and covered their ears , but the reader will devour every exquisitely wretched revelation .

From HaskellWiki
The GHC Users Guide has a Type Family section .
Indexed type families , or type families for short , are a Haskell extension supporting ad - hoc overloading of data types .
Type families are parametric types that can be assigned specialized representations based on the type parameters they are instantiated with .
They are the data type analogue of type classes : families are used to define overloaded data in the same way that classes are used to define overloaded functions .
Type families are useful for generic programming , for creating highly parameterised library interfaces , and for creating interfaces with enhanced static information , much like dependent types .
Type families come in two flavors : data families and type synonym families .
Data families are the indexed form of data and newtype definitions .
Type synonym families are the indexed form of type synonyms .
Each of these flavors can be defined in a standalone manner or associated with a type class .
Standalone definitions are more general , while associated types can more clearly express how a type is used and lead to better error messages .
NB : see also Simon 's blog entry on let generalisation for a significant change in the policy for let generalisation , driven by the type family extension .
In brief : a few programs will puzzlingly fail to compile with - XTypeFamilies even though the code is legal Haskell 98 .
What are type families ?
The concept of a type family comes from type theory .
An indexed type family in type theory is a partial function at the type level .
Applying the function to parameters ( called type indices ) yields a type .
Type families permit a program to compute what data constructors it will operate on , rather than having them fixed statically ( as with simple type systems ) or treated as opaque unknowns ( as with parametrically polymorphic types ) .
Type families are to vanilla data types what type class methods are to regular functions .
Vanilla polymorphic data types and functions have a single definition , which is used at all type instances .
Classes and type families , on the other hand , have an interface definition and any number of instance definitions .
A type family 's interface definition declares its kind and its arity , or the number of type indices it takes .
Instance definitions define the type family over some part of the domain .
As a simple example of how type families differ from ordinary parametric data types , consider a strict list type .
We can represent a list of Char in the usual way , with cons cells .
We can do the same thing to represent a list of ( ) , but since a strict ( ) value carries no useful information , it would be more efficient to just store the length of the list .
This can't be done with an ordinary parametric data type , because the data constructors used to represent the list would depend on the list 's type parameter : if it 's Char then the list consists of cons cells ; if it 's ( ) , then the list consists of a single integer .
We basically want to select between two different data types based on a type parameter .
Using type families , this list type could be declared as follows :
-- Declare a list - like data family data family XList a -- Declare a list - like instance for Char data instance XList Char = XCons !
Char !
( XList Char ) | XNil -- Declare a number - like instance for ( ) data instance XList ( ) = XListUnit !
Int
The right - hand sides of the two data instance declarations are exactly ordinary data definitions .
In fact , a data instance declaration is nothing more than a shorthand for a data declaration followed by a type instance ( see below ) declaration .
However , they define two instances of the same parametric data type , XList Char and XList ( ) , whereas ordinary data declarations define completely unrelated types .
A recent tutorial paper has more in - depth examples of programming with type families .
GADTs bear some similarity to type families , in the sense that they allow a parametric type 's constructors to depend on the type 's parameters .
However , all GADT constructors must be defined in one place , whereas type families can be extended .
Functional dependencies are similar to type families , and many type classes that use functional dependencies can be equivalently expressed with type families .
Type families provide a more functional style of type - level programming than the relational style of functional dependencies .
Requirements to use type families
Type families are a GHC extension enabled with the - XTypeFamilies flag or the {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-} option .
The first stable release of GHC that properly supports type families is 6.10.1 .
Release 6.8 includes an early partial deprecated implementation .
An associated data type example
As an example , consider Ralf Hinze 's generalised tries , a form of generic finite maps .
The class declaration
We define a type class whose instances are the types that we can use as keys in our generic maps :
class GMapKey k where data GMap k :: * -> * empty :: GMap k v lookup :: k -> GMap k v ->
Maybe v insert :: k -> v -> GMap k v ->
GMap k v
The interesting part is the associated data family declaration of the class .
It gives a kind signature ( here * -> * ) for the associated data type GMap k - analogous to how methods receive a type signature in a class declaration .
What it is important to notice is that the first parameter of the associated type GMap coincides with the class parameter of GMapKey .
This indicates that also in all instances of the class , the instances of the associated data type need to have their first argument match up with the instance type .
In general , the type arguments of an associated type can be a subset of the class parameters ( in a multi- parameter type class ) and they can appear in any order , possibly in an order other than in the class head .
The latter can be useful if the associated data type is partially applied in some contexts .
The second important point is that as GMap k has kind * -> * and k ( implicitly ) has kind * , the type constructor GMap ( without an argument ) has kind * -> * -> * .
Consequently , we see that GMap is applied to two arguments in the signatures of the methods empty , lookup , and insert .
An Int instance
To use Ints as keys into generic maps , we declare an instance that simply uses Data .
IntMap , thusly :
instance GMapKey
Int where data GMap Int v = GMapInt ( Data .
IntMap .
IntMap v ) empty = GMapInt Data .
IntMap .
empty lookup k ( GMapInt m ) = Data .
IntMap .
lookup k m insert k v ( GMapInt m ) = GMapInt ( Data .
IntMap . insert k v m )
The Int instance of the associated data type GMap needs to have both of its parameters , but as only the first one corresponds to a class parameter , the second needs to be a type variable ( here v ) .
As mentioned before , any associated type parameter that corresponds to a class parameter must be identical to the class parameter in each instance .
The right hand side of the associated data declaration is like that of any other data type .
NB : At the moment , GADT syntax is not allowed for associated data types ( or other indexed types ) .
This is not a fundamental limitation , but just a shortcoming of the current implementation , which we expect to lift in the future .
As an exercise , implement an instance for Char that maps back to the Int instance using the conversion functions Char.ord and Char.chr .
A unit instance
Generic definitions , apart from elementary types , typically cover units , products , and sums .
We start here with the unit instance for GMap :
instance GMapKey ( ) where data GMap ( ) v = GMapUnit ( Maybe v ) empty = GMapUnit Nothing lookup () ( GMapUnit v ) = v insert () v ( GMapUnit _ ) = GMapUnit $ Just v
For unit , the map is just a Maybe value .
Product and sum instances
Next , let us define the instances for pairs and sums ( i.e. , Either ) :
instance ( GMapKey a , GMapKey b ) =>
GMapKey ( a , b ) where data GMap ( a , b ) v = GMapPair ( GMap a ( GMap b v ) ) empty = GMapPair empty lookup ( a , b ) ( GMapPair gm ) = lookup a gm >>= lookup b insert ( a , b ) v ( GMapPair gm ) = GMapPair $ case lookup a gm of Nothing -> insert a ( insert b v empty ) gm Just gm2 -> insert a ( insert b v gm2 ) gm instance ( GMapKey a , GMapKey b ) =>
GMapKey ( Either a b ) where data GMap ( Either a b ) v = GMapEither ( GMap a v ) ( GMap b v ) empty = GMapEither empty empty lookup ( Left a ) ( GMapEither gm1 _gm2 ) = lookup a gm1 lookup ( Right b ) ( GMapEither _gm1 gm2 ) = lookup b gm2 insert ( Left a ) v ( GMapEither gm1 gm2 ) = GMapEither ( insert a v gm1 ) gm2 insert ( Right b ) v ( GMapEither gm1 gm2 ) = GMapEither gm1 ( insert b v gm2 )
If you find this code algorithmically surprising , I 'd suggest to have a look at Ralf Hinze 's paper .
The only novelty concerning associated types , in these two instances , is that the instances have a context ( GMapKey a , GMapKey b ) .
Consequently , the right hand sides of the associated type declarations can use GMap recursively at the key types a and b - not unlike the method definitions use the class methods recursively at the types for which the class is given in the instance context .
Using a generic map
Finally , some code building and querying a generic map :
myGMap :: GMap ( Int , Either Char ( ) )
String myGMap = insert ( 5 , Left ' c ' ) " ( 5 , Left ' c ' ) " $ insert ( 4 , Right ( ) ) " ( 4 , Right ( ) ) " $ insert ( 5 , Right ( ) )
" This is the one ! " $ insert ( 5 , Right ( ) )
" This is the two ! " $ insert ( 6 , Right ( ) ) " ( 6 , Right ( ) ) " $ insert ( 5 , Left ' a ' ) " ( 5 , Left ' a ' ) " $ empty main = putStrLn $ maybe " Could n't find key ! " id $ lookup ( 5 , Right ( ) ) myGMap
Download the code
If you want to play with this example without copying it off the wiki , just download the source code [ 1 ] for GMap from GHC 's test suite .
Detailed definition of data families
Data families appear in two flavours : ( 1 ) they can be defined on the toplevel or ( 2 ) they can appear inside type classes ( in which case they are known as associated types ) .
The former is the more general variant , as it lacks the requirement for the type - indices to coincide with the class parameters .
However , the latter can lead to more clearly structured code and compiler warnings if some type instances were - possibly accidentally - omitted .
In the following , we always discuss the general toplevel form first and then cover the additional constraints placed on associated types .
Family declarations
Indexed data families are introduced by a signature , such as
data family GMap k :: * -> *
The special family distinguishes family from standard data declarations .
The result kind annotation is optional and , as usual , defaults to * if omitted .
An example is
data family Array e
Named arguments can also be given explicit kind signatures if needed .
Just as with GADT declarations named arguments are entirely optional , so that we can declare Array alternatively with
data family Array :: * -> *
Associated family declarations
When a data family is declared as part of a type class , we drop the family keyword .
The GMap declaration takes the following form
class GMapKey k where data GMap k :: * -> * ...
In contrast to toplevel declarations , named arguments must be used for all type parameters that are to be used as type - indices .
Moreover , the argument names must be class parameters .
Each class parameter may only be used at most once per associated type , but some may be omitted and they may be in an order other than in the class head .
In other words : the named type parameters of the data declaration must be a permutation of a subset of the class variables .
Example is admissible :
class C a b c where { data T c a :: * } -- OK class C a b c where { data T a a :: * } -- Bad : repeated variable class D a where { data T a x :: * } -- Bad : x is not a class variable class D a where { data T a :: * -> * } -- OK
Instance declarations
Instance declarations of data and newtype families are very similar to standard data and newtype declarations .
The only two differences are that the keyword data or newtype is followed by instance and that some or all of the type arguments can be non-variable types , but may not contain forall types or type synonym families .
However , data families are generally allowed in type parameters , and type synonyms are allowed as long as they are fully applied and expand to a type that is itself admissible - exactly as this is required for occurrences of type synonyms in class instance parameters .
For example , the Either instance for GMap is
data instance GMap ( Either a b ) v = GMapEither ( GMap a v ) ( GMap b v )
In this example , the declaration has only one variant .
In general , it can be any number .
Data and newtype instance declarations are only legit when an appropriate family declaration is in scope - just like class instances require the class declaration to be visible .
Moreover , each instance declaration has to conform to the kind determined by its family declaration .
This implies that the number of parameters of an instance declaration matches the arity determined by the kind of the family .
Although all data families are declared with the data keyword , instances can be either data or newtype s , or a mix of both .
Even if type families are defined as toplevel declarations , functions that perform different computations for different family instances still need to be defined as methods of type classes .
In particular , the following is not possible :
data family T a data instance T Int =
A data instance T Char = B nonsense :: T a ->
Int nonsense A = 1 -- WRONG : These two equations together ... nonsense B = 2 -- ... will produce a type error .
Given the functionality provided by GADTs ( Generalised Algebraic Data Types ) , it might seem as if a definition , such as the above , should be feasible .
However , type families - in contrast to GADTs - are open ; i.e. , new instances can always be added , possibly in other modules .
Supporting pattern matching across different data instances would require a form of extensible case construct .
Associated type instances
When an associated family instance is declared within a type class instance , we drop the instance keyword in the family instance .
So , the Either instance for GMap becomes :
instance ( GMapKey a , GMapKey b ) =>
GMapKey ( Either a b ) where data GMap ( Either a b ) v = GMapEither ( GMap a v ) ( GMap b v ) ...
The most important point about associated family instances is that the type indices corresponding to class parameters must be identical to the type given in the instance head ; here this is the first argument of GMap , namely Either a b , which coincides with the only class parameter .
Any parameters to the family constructor that do not correspond to class parameters , need to be variables in every instance ; here this is the variable v .
Instances for an associated family can only appear as part of instance declarations of the class in which the family was declared - just as with the equations of the methods of a class .
Also in correspondence to how methods are handled , declarations of associated types can be omitted in class instances .
If an associated family instance is omitted , the corresponding instance type is not inhabited ; i.e. , only diverging expressions , such as undefined , can assume the type .
Scoping of class parameters
In the case of multi- parameter type classes , the visibility of class parameters in the right - hand side of associated family instances depends solely on the parameters of the data family .
As an example , consider the simple class declaration
class C a b where data T a
Only one of the two class parameters is a parameter to the data family .
Hence , the following instance declaration is invalid :
instance C [ c ] d where data T [ c ] = MkT ( c , d ) -- WRONG !! 'd ' is not in scope
Here , the right - hand side of the data instance mentions the type variable d that does not occur in its left - hand side .
We cannot admit such data instances as they would compromise type safety .
Type class instances of family instances
Type class instances of instances of data families can be defined as usual , and in particular data instance declarations can have deriving clauses .
For example , we can write
data GMap ( ) v = GMapUnit ( Maybe v ) deriving Show
which implicitly defines an instance of the form
instance Show v =>
Show ( GMap ( ) v ) where ...
Note that class instances are always for particular instances of a data family and never for an entire family as a whole .
This is for essentially the same reasons that we cannot define a toplevel function that performs pattern matching on the data constructors of different instances of a single type family .
It would require a form of extensible case construct .
Overlap
The instance declarations of a data family used in a single program may not overlap at all , independent of whether they are associated or not .
In contrast to type class instances , this is not only a matter of consistency , but one of type safety .
Import and export
The association of data constructors with type families is more dynamic than that is the case with standard data and newtype declarations .
In the standard case , the notation T ( .. ) in an import or export list denotes the type constructor and all the data constructors introduced in its declaration .
However , a family declaration never introduces any data constructors ; instead , data constructors are introduced by family instances .
As a result , which data constructors are associated with a type family depends on the currently visible instance declarations for that family .
Consequently , an import or export item of the form T (.. ) denotes the family constructor and all currently visible data constructors - in the case of an export item , these may be either imported or defined in the current module .
The treatment of import and export items that explicitly list data constructors , such as GMap ( GMapEither ) , is analogous .
Associated families
As expected , an import or export item of the form C ( .. ) denotes all of the class ' methods and associated types .
However , when associated types are explicitly listed as subitems of a class , we need some new syntax , as uppercase identifiers as subitems are usually data constructors , not type constructors .
To clarify that we denote types here , each associated type name needs to be prefixed by the keyword type .
So for example , when explicitly listing the components of the GMapKey class , we write GMapKey ( type GMap , empty , lookup , insert ) .
Examples
Assuming our running GMapKey class example , let us look at some export lists and their meaning :
module GMap ( GMapKey ) where ... : Exports just the class name .
: Exports just the class name .
module GMap ( GMapKey ( .. ) ) where ... :
Exports the class , the associated type GMap and the member functions empty , lookup , and insert .
None of the data constructors is exported .
: Exports the class , the associated type and the member functions , , and .
None of the data constructors is exported .
module GMap ( GMapKey ( .. ) , GMap ( .. ) ) where ... :
As before , but also exports all the data constructors GMapInt , GMapChar , GMapUnit , GMapPair , and GMapEither .
: As before , but also exports all the data constructors , , , , and .
module GMap ( GMapKey ( empty , lookup , insert ) , GMap ( .. ) ) where ... :
As before .
: As before .
module GMap ( GMapKey , empty , lookup , insert , GMap ( .. ) ) where ... :
As before .
Finally , you can write GMapKey ( type GMap ) to denote both the class GMapKey as well as its associated type GMap .
However , you cannot write GMapKey ( type GMap ( .. ) ) — i.e. , sub -component specifications cannot be nested .
To specify GMap 's data constructors , you have to list it separately .
Instances
Family instances are implicitly exported , just like class instances .
However , this applies only to the heads of instances , not to the data constructors an instance defines .
An associated type synonym example
Type synonym families are an alternative to functional dependencies , which makes functional dependency examples well suited to introduce type synonym families .
In fact , type families are a more functional way to express the same as functional dependencies ( despite the name ! ) , as they replace the relational notation of functional dependencies by an expression - oriented notation ; i.e. , functions on types are really represented by functions and not relations .
The class declaration
Here 's an example from Mark Jones ' seminal paper on functional dependencies :
class Collects e ce | ce -> e where empty :: ce insert :: e -> ce -> ce member :: e -> ce ->
Bool toList :: ce -> [ e ]
With associated type synonyms we can write this as
class Collects ce where type Elem ce empty :: ce insert :: Elem ce -> ce -> ce member :: Elem ce -> ce ->
Bool toList :: ce -> [ Elem ce ]
Instead of the multi- parameter type class , we use a single parameter class , and the parameter e turned into an associated type synonym
Elem ce .
An instance
Instances change correspondingly .
An instance of the two - parameter class
instance Eq e =>
Collects e [ e ] where empty = [ ] insert e l = ( e : l ) member e [ ] =
False member e ( x : xs ) | e == x =
True | otherwise = member e xs toList l = l
becomes an instance of a single - parameter class , where the dependent type parameter turns into an associated type instance declaration :
instance Eq e =>
Collects [ e ] where type Elem [ e ] = e empty = [ ] insert e l = ( e : l ) member e [ ] =
False member e ( x : xs ) | e == x =
True | otherwise = member e xs toList l = l
Using generic collections
With Functional Dependencies the code would be :
sumCollects :: ( Collects e c1 , Collects e c2 ) => c1 -> c2 -> c2 sumCollects c1 c2 = foldr insert c2 ( toList c 1 )
In contrast , with associated type synonyms , we get :
sumCollects :: ( Collects c1 , Collects c2 , Elem c1 ~ Elem c 2 ) => c1 -> c2 -> c2 sumCollects c1 c2 = foldr insert c2 ( toList c 1 )
Detailed definition of type synonym families
Type families appear in two flavours : ( 1 ) they can be defined on the toplevel or ( 2 ) they can appear inside type classes ( in which case they are known as associated type synonyms ) .
The former is the more general variant , as it lacks the requirement for the type - indices to coincide with the class parameters .
However , the latter can lead to more clearly structured code and compiler warnings if some type instances were - possibly accidentally - omitted .
In the following , we always discuss the general toplevel form first and then cover the additional constraints placed on associated types .
Family declarations
Indexed type families are introduced by a signature , such as
type family Elem c :: *
The special family distinguishes family from standard type declarations .
The result kind annotation is optional and , as usual , defaults to * if omitted .
An example is
type family Elem c
Parameters can also be given explicit kind signatures if needed .
We call the number of parameters in a type family declaration , the family 's arity , and all applications of a type family must be fully saturated w.r.t. to that arity .
This requirement is unlike ordinary type synonyms and it implies that the kind of a type family is not sufficient to determine a family 's arity , and hence in general , also insufficient to determine whether a type family application is well formed .
As an example , consider the following declaration :
type family F a b :: * -> * --
F's arity is 2 , -- although its overall kind is * -> * -> * -> *
Given this declaration the following are examples of well - formed and malformed types :
F Char [ Int ] -- OK !
Kind : * -> * F Char [ Int ]
Bool -- OK !
Kind : * F IO Bool -- WRONG : kind mismatch in the first argument F Bool -- WRONG : unsaturated application
A top - level type family can be declared as open or closed .
( Associated type families are always open . )
A closed type family has all of its equations defined in one place and cannot be extended , whereas an open family can have instances spread across modules .
The advantage of a closed family is that its equations are tried in order , similar to a term - level function definition :
type family G a where G Int = Bool G a = Char
With this definition , the type G Int becomes Bool and , say , G Double becomes Char .
See also here for more information about closed type families .
Associated family declarations
When a type family is declared as part of a type class , we drop the family special .
The Elem declaration takes the following form
class Collects ce where type Elem ce :: * ...
Exactly as in the case of an associated data declaration , the named type parameters must be a permutation of a subset of the class parameters .
Examples
class C a b c where { type T c a :: * } -- OK class D a where { type T a x :: * } --
No : x is not a class parameter class D a where { type T a :: * -> * } -- OK
Type instance declarations
Instance declarations of open type families are very similar to standard type synonym declarations .
The only two differences are that the keyword type is followed by instance and that some or all of the type arguments can be non-variable types , but may not contain forall types or type synonym families .
However , data families are generally allowed , and type synonyms are allowed as long as they are fully applied and expand to a type that is admissible - these are the exact same requirements as for data instances .
For example , the [ e ] instance for Elem is
type instance Elem [ e ] = e
A type family instance declaration must satisfy the following rules :
An appropriate family declaration is in scope - just like class instances require the class declaration to be visible .
The instance declaration conforms to the kind determined by its family declaration
The number of type parameters in an instance declaration matches the number of type parameters in the family declaration .
The right - hand side of a type instance must be a monotype ( i.e. , it may not include foralls ) and after the expansion of all saturated vanilla type synonyms , no synonyms , except family synonyms may remain .
Here are some examples of admissible and illegal type instances and closed families :
type family F a :: * type instance F [ Int ] = Int -- OK !
type instance F String = Char -- OK !
type instance F ( F a ) = a -- WRONG : type parameter mentions a type family type instance F ( forall a . ( a , b ) ) = b -- WRONG : a forall type appears in a type parameter type instance F Float = forall a .
a -- WRONG : right - hand side may not be a forall type type family F2 a where -- OK !
F2 ( Maybe Int ) = Int F2 ( Maybe Bool ) = Bool F2 ( Maybe a ) =
String type family G a b :: * -> * type instance G Int = ( , ) -- WRONG : must be two type parameters type instance G Int Char Float = Double -- WRONG : must be two type parameters
Closed family simplification
Included in ghc starting 7.8.1 .
When dealing with closed families , simplifying the type is harder than just finding a left - hand side that matches and replacing that with a right - hand side .
GHC will select an equation to use in a given type family application ( the " target " ) if and only if the following 2 conditions hold :
There is a substitution from the variables in the equation 's LHS that makes the left - hand side of the branch coincide with the target .
For each previous equation in the family : either the LHS of that equation is apart from the type family application , or the equation is compatible with the chosen equation .
Now , we define apart and compatible :
Two types are apart when one cannot simplify to the other , even after arbitrary type - family simplifications
Two equations are compatible if , either , their LHSs are apart or their LHSs unify and their RHSs are the same under the substitution induced by the unification .
Some examples are in order :
type family F a where F Int = Bool F Bool = Char F a =
Bool type family And ( a :: Bool ) ( b :: Bool ) :: Bool where And False c = False And True d = d And e False = False And f True = f
And g g = g
In F , all pairs of equations are compatible except the second and third .
The first two are compatible because their LHSs are apart .
The first and third are compatible because the unifying substitution leads the RHSs to be the same .
But , the second and third are not compatible because neither of these conditions holds .
As a result , GHC will not use the third equation to simplify a target unless that target is apart from Bool .
In And , every pair of equations is compatible , meaning GHC never has to make the extra apartness check during simplification .
Why do all of this ?
It 's a matter of type safety .
Consider this example :
type family J a b where J a a = Int J a b = Bool
Say GHC selected the second branch just because the first does n't apply at the moment , because two type variables are distinct .
The problem is that those variables might later be instantiated at the same value , and then the first branch would have applied .
You can convince this sort of inconsistency to produce unsafeCoerce .
It gets worse .
GHC has no internal notion of inequality , so it can't use previous , failed term - level GADT pattern matches to refine its type assumptions .
For example :
data G :: * -> * where GInt :: G Int GBool :: G
Bool type family Foo ( a :: * ) :: * where Foo Int = Char Foo a = Double bar :: G a ->
Foo a bar GInt = ' x ' bar _ = 3.14
The last line will fail to typecheck , because GHC does n't know that the type variable a can't be Int here , even though it 's obvious .
The only general way to fix this is to have inequality evidence introduced into GHC , and that 's a big deal and we do n't know if we have the motivation for such a change yet .
Associated type instances
When an associated family instance is declared within a type class instance , we drop the instance keyword in the family instance .
So , the [ e ] instance for Elem becomes :
instance ( Eq ( Elem [ e ] ) ) =>
Collects ( [ e ] ) where type Elem [ e ] = e ...
The most important point about associated family instances is that the type indexes corresponding to class parameters must be identical to the type given in the instance head ; here this is [ e ] , which coincides with the only class parameter .
Instances for an associated family can only appear as part of instance declarations of the class in which the family was declared - just as with the equations of the methods of a class .
Also in correspondence to how methods are handled , declarations of associated types can be omitted in class instances .
If an associated family instance is omitted , the corresponding instance type is not inhabited ; i.e. , only diverging expressions , such as undefined , can assume the type .
Overlap
The instance declarations of an open type family used in a single program must be compatible , in the form defined above .
This condition is independent of whether the type family is associated or not , and it is not only a matter of consistency , but one of type safety .
Here are two examples to illustrate the condition under which overlap is permitted .
type instance F ( a , Int ) = [ a ] type instance F ( Int , b ) = [ b ] -- overlap permitted type instance G ( a , Int ) = [ a ] type instance G ( Char , a ) = [ a ] -- ILLEGAL overlap , as [ Char ] /= [ Int ]
Decidability
In order to guarantee that type inference in the presence of type families is decidable , we need to place a number of additional restrictions on the formation of type instance declarations ( c.f. , Definition 5 ( Relaxed Conditions ) of Type Checking with Open Type Functions ) .
Instance declarations have the general form
type instance F t1 .. tn = t
where we require that for every type family application ( G s1 .. sm ) in t ,
s1 .. sm do not contain any type family constructors , the total number of symbols ( data type constructors and type variables ) in s1 .. sm is strictly smaller than in t1 .. tn , and for every type variable a , a occurs in s1 .. sm at most as often as in t1 .. tn .
These restrictions are easily verified and ensure termination of type inference .
However , they are not sufficient to guarantee completeness of type inference in the presence of , so called , loopy equalities , such as a ~ [ F a ] , where a recursive occurrence of a type variable is underneath a family application and data constructor application - see the above mentioned paper for details .
If the option - XUndecidableInstances is passed to the compiler , the above restrictions are not enforced and it is on the programmer to ensure termination of the normalisation of type families during type inference .
Equality constraints
Type context can include equality constraints of the form t1 ~ t2 , which denote that the types t1 and t2 need to be the same .
In the presence of type families , whether two types are equal cannot generally be decided locally .
Hence , the contexts of function signatures may include equality constraints , as in the following example :
sumCollects :: ( Collects c1 , Collects c2 , Elem c1 ~ Elem c 2 ) => c1 -> c2 -> c2
where we require that the element type of c1 and c2 are the same .
In general , the types t1 and t2 of an equality constraint may be arbitrary monotypes ; i.e. , they may not contain any quantifiers , independent of whether higher - rank types are otherwise enabled .
Equality constraints can also appear in class and instance contexts .
The former enable a simple translation of programs using functional dependencies into programs using family synonyms instead .
The general idea is to rewrite a class declaration of the form
class C a b | a -> b
to
class ( F a ~ b ) =>
C a b where type F a
That is , we represent every functional dependency ( FD ) a 1 .. an -> b by an FD type family F a1 .. an and a superclass context equality F a 1 .. an ~ b , essentially giving a name to the functional dependency .
In class instances , we define the type instances of FD families in accordance with the class head .
Method signatures are not affected by that process .
Frequently asked questions
Comparing type families and functional dependencies
Functional dependencies cover some of the same territory as type families .
How do the two compare ?
There are some articles about this question :
Experiences in converting functional dependencies to type families : " Functional dependencies vs. type families "
GHC trac on a comparison of functional dependencies and type families
Injectivity , type inference , and ambiguity
A common problem is if :
type family F a f :: F a ->
F a f = undefined g :: F Int -> F
Int g x = f x
Then compiler complains about the definition of g :
Could n't match expected type `F Int ' against inferred type ` F a 1 ' .
In type - checking g 's right hand side GHC discovers ( by instantiating f 's type with a fresh type variable ) that it has type F a 1 -> F a1 for some as - yet - unknown type a 1 .
Now it tries to make the inferred type match g 's type signature .
Well , you say , just make a1 equal to Int and you are done .
True , but what if there were these instances
type instance F Int =
Bool type instance F Char = Bool
Then making a1 equal to Char would also make the two types equal .
Because there is ( potentially ) more than one choice , the program is rejected .
However ( and confusingly ) if you omit the type signature on g altogether , thus
f :: F a ->
F a f = undefined g x = f x
GHC will happily infer the type g :: F a -> F a .
But you can't write that type signature or , indeed , the more specific one above .
( Arguably this behaviour , where GHC infers a type it can't check , is very confusing .
I suppose we could make GHC reject both programs , with and without type signatures . )
What is the problem ?
The nub of the issue is this : knowing that F t1 = F t2 does not imply that t1 = t2 .
The difficulty is that the type function F need not be injective ; it can map two distinct types to the same type .
For an injective type constructor like Maybe , if we know that Maybe t1 = Maybe t2 , then we know that t1 = t2 .
But not so for non-injective type functions .
The problem starts with f .
Its type is ambiguous ; even if I know the argument and result types for f , I can not use that to find the type at which a should be instantiated .
( So arguably , f should be rejected as having an ambiguous type , and probably will be in future . )
The situation is well known in type classes :
bad :: ( Read a , Show a ) =>
String ->
String bad x = show ( read x )
At a call of bad one cannot tell at what type a should be instantiated .
The only solution is to avoid ambiguous types .
In the type signature of a function ,
Ensure that every type variable occurs in the part after the " => "
" Ensure that every type variable appears at least once outside a type function call .
Alternatively , you can use data families , which create new types and are therefore injective .
The following code works :
data family F a f :: F a ->
F a f = undefined g :: F Int -> F
Int g x = f x

Armed robots – similar to the ones now on patrol in Iraq – are being marketed to domestic police forces , according to the machines ' manufacturer and law enforcement officers .
None of the gun-toting ' bots appear to have been deployed domestically , yet .
Both cops and company officials say it 's only a matter of time , however .
" Other than some R&D with the shotgun mount , we have n't used it operationally , " Massachusetts State Police Trooper Mike Rogowski tells DANGER ROOM .
" But they 're on the way .
They 're coming , "
Foster - Miller , maker of the armed SWORDS robot for military use , is also actively promoting a similar model to domestic , civilian police forces .
The Talon SWAT / MP is a " robot specifically equipped for scenarios
frequently encountered by police SWAT [ special weapon and tactics ] units and MPs [ military police ] , " a company fact sheet announces .
It " can be configured with the following equipment :
• Multi-shot TASER electronic control device with laser - dot aiming .
• Loudspeaker and audio receiver for negotiations .
• Night vision and thermal cameras .
• Choice of weapons for lethal or less - than - lethal responses
- 40 mm grenade launcher - 2 rounds
- 12 - gage shotgun - 5 rounds
- FN303 less - lethal launcher - 15 rounds . *
In addition to the Massachusetts State Police , SWAT teams in Houston , San Francisco , and Lubbock , TX all have the robots , according to Foster - Miller spokesperson Cynthia Black .
None of the team have armed the machines , so far .
But Trooper Rogowski , for one , is extremely interested – especially in equipping the robot with a less - lethal weapon , like a three - shot Taser stun gun .
" That would be phenomenal , " he says .
However , Trooper Rogowski adds , " Massachusetts is a pretty liberal state .
To get management to sign off on an armed weapons platform – that 'll be pretty interesting , to see how that goes . "
( Foster - Miller competitor iRobot recently teamed up with Taser International to build a stun gun-packing ' bot of their own . )
Like the SWORDS , the Talon SWAT / MP is based on Foster - Miller 's line of bomb - disposal robots which have seen years ' worth of action in Iraq .
Rogowski says handling ordnance is his robot's main mission , too .
But the machine has also been deployed in SWAT - type situations – even before it gets armed .
Last fall , Rogowski remembers , a person in the town of Wilbraham , Massachusetts had barricaded himself into his house .
But the overwhelming odor of propane fumes made police reluctant to send humans in .
The robot went instead – and discovered propane tanks , as well as the man .
" He had shot himself in the master bedroom , " Rogowski recalls .

A seismic survey peels away the sediments to reveal the structure
The 5.5 km - wide bowl is buried under shale sediments west of Stockton , in San Joaquin County , and is thought to be between 37 and 49 million years old .
Researchers are continuing to analyse cuttings from oil exploration wells drilled in the structure .
Details of the discovery were presented at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston .
Data from a 3D seismic survey of an ancient sea bed clearly shows a circular structure buried 1,490 - 1,600 m ( 4,890 - 5,250 ft ) below sea level .
The Victoria Island structure , as it has been named , has a concentric rim surrounding a " central uplift " - a peak at the centre - which are both characteristic of impact craters .
Co-investigator Professor Jared Morrow , from San Diego State University , said the context of the crater in relation to surrounding rock layers suggested it dated from the middle Eocene Epoch .
Crater pair
Preliminary estimates for the age of the crater suggest it is just too early for an episode of multiple impacts on Earth known as the late Eocene bombardment , which occurred about 35 million years ago .
One of the largest impact craters in the world - the 90 km - wide ( 56 miles ) Chesapeake Bay structure on the eastern shore of North America - is from this period .
The team plans to look for characteristic geological signatures of impact sites in cuttings drilled from wells in and around the structure .
These include a type of quartz deformed under intense pressure - known as shocked quartz - as well as glass and melt particles , and an enhancement of the element iridium .
Victoria Island is not the first crater proposed for the Central Valley .
A 1.3 km - wide ( 0.8 miles ) feature to the north known as the Cowell structure , dating to the Miocene ( 5 to 24 million years ago ) , has also been put forward as the location of a space impact .
Dr Morrow co-authored the work with Samuel Spevack from Grossmont Middle College High School , in California , and Bennett Spevack from ABA Energy .

Parallel programming has the reputation of being an exotic field , pursued by experts using extremely large and expensive machines .
Unfortunately , due in part to its history , parallel programming languages and tools still mostly focus on " big iron " and older languages such as C and Fortran .
Performance improvement via parallelism should be of interest to anyone whose codes run too slowly .
This requires a shift in focus .
Today , many new computers are multicore and most users have access to multiple computers .
Many developers work with newer dynamic languages like Python and R .
To meet the needs of these users , we 've developed a Python - based coordination system called " NetWorkSpaces " ( NWS ) that is easy to learn , accessible via almost all development environments ( including R , Java , octave , Python , Perl , and Ruby ) , and deployable on ad hoc collections of spare CPUs .
But while its simplicity makes it a good choice for pedagogical examples , it 's not a toy system .
We 've used NWS to run parallel programs on hundreds of processors , producing many CPU years of useful computation .
NetWorkSpaces
NetWorkSpaces ( www.lindaspaces.com/products/NWS_overview.html) was developed at Scientific Computing Associates and is available at SourceForge ( nws-py.sourceforge.net / ) .
You must install both the server ( on one machine ) and a client ( on all machines involved in the computation ) .
The server is implemented using Python and Twisted , which are required .
Even though NWS is implemented in Python , we have NetWorkSpace client APIs for a variety of languages .
While we describe the Python client here , the ideas transfer to other language clients .
NWS is based on the concept of a set of bindings , which in programming languages are sometimes known as " environments , " " namespaces , " " workspaces , " and the like .
Generally in programming languages , a binding maps a name to a value .
Because this is a concept familiar to programmers , it is a good foundation for building a coordination system .
A given language has rules about allowable names , allowable values for a given name , and the context in which the binding is valid ( the binding 's scope ) .
The language also provides operations for establishing a binding and for retrieving the value of a bound name .
Often these operations are implied by the lexical structure of code , as is the intended binding set .
So , for example , in x = y the y implies a look - up of the value bound to y , while the x is the target of the assignment .
Scoping rules determine which x and y are meant .
NWS provides a particular encapsulation of binding semantics .
Using this encapsulation , we explicitly specify the look - up ( fetch ) , the association of the name x with the retrieved value ( store ) , and the intended binding set ( indicated by the ws object ) .
Thus , a simple assignment looks like this in NWS :
ws.store ('x ' , ws. fetch ( 'y ' ) )
So far , we 've succeeded in making a fairly routine construct more verbose .
The key point is that the NWS encapsulation is amenable to a network - based implementation , which lets different processes exchange data and synchronize via NWS bindings .
In many languages , including Python , we could have used syntax similar to that of normal bindings :
ws.x = ws.y
However , the semantics of these NWS variables differ in important ways from that of normal variables .
In our opinion , it 's a mistake to create a false illusion of similarity when , in fact , there are important differences .
NWS is designed to be a coordination facility that is language neutral .
The advantages this neutrality offers include :
NWS coordination patterns and idioms can be recycled from one language environment to the next .
NWS can be used to coordinate heterogeneous ensembles of code written in different languages .
To facilitate interlanguage coordination , NWS variable names are ASCII strings and do n't need to conform to the variable naming rules of any given language .
The values can be any native type in the client language for which that language has a workable serialization .
Most values in most of the languages mentioned can be automatically serialized ( the serialization is done behind the scenes by NWS , and is not of direct concern to programmers ) .
For example , Python NWS can automatically handle composite data structures :
>>> from nws.client import NetWorkSpace >>> ws=NetWorkSpace('test ' ) >>> l= [ 'a ' , 'b ' , 'c ' ] >>> t=( 1,2,3 ) >>> d={' list ':l , ' tuple ' : t} >>> ws.store ( ' dict example ' , d ) >>> ws. fetch ( ' dict example ') {' list ' : [ 'a ' , 'b ' , 'c ' ] , ' tuple ' : ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) }
Finally , ASCII strings used as values are treated in a special way ( they are not subject to the client language serialization protocol ) that makes it possible for them to be exchanged across client languages .
In Example 1 , for instance , you can use NWS to move data from Python to R encoded as an ASCII string .
Illah Nourbakhsh is a professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , which has one of the world 's most prestigious robotics programs , and his research is funded by the likes of Google , Intel and Microsoft .
But in the end , he says , he does it for the kids .
" [ Robots ] are really interesting to a diverse group of people , " says Nourbakhsh , whose research has revealed that when kids are given programming tasks that involve robots , girls are no less interested than boys , and everyone is more likely to stick with the curriculum .
" If there 's a [ software ] bug , " he adds , " the robot may veer off the desk and then I 'll have to dive for it .
That inspires people more than a bug on a computer screen that causes a red line to be off by two pixels . "
In collaboration with Rich LeGrand , president of Austin - based robotics parts manufacturer Charmed Labs , Nourbakhsh wants to take DIY robotics to the next level , by offering the public an entire suite of tools to build their own droids from parts readily available at a hardware store — no soldering or programming required .
The heart of Nourbakhsh 's project , dubbed the Telepresence Robot Kit ( TeRK ) , is the Qwerk , a box just over five inches square and an inch thick .
Into this tiny , Linux - powered frame LeGrand and his team of engineers have packed a 200 megahertz ARM processor — the same chip that runs Nokia N - Series Smartphones and the Nintendo DS — 32 megabytes of SDRAM and 16 megabytes of flash memory .
It can connect to the outside world via WiFi , USB 2.0 , 16 servo controllers and a host of other inputs and outputs .
At $ 350 a pop , Qwerk ultimately costs far less than it could have , considering how much power it packs .
The reason , LeGrand says , is that he did n't have to shell out extra money for engineers , many of whom volunteered their time and worked at a discount because they believe in the project .
By putting Qwerk within reach of educators and hobbyists , the TeRK program aims to allow anyone to use it as a control center for just about any robot they can imagine .
Initially , though , Qwerk will be used for teaching and for projects that are " just for fun . "
Online , TeRK users can access complete parts lists for robot kits that range from easy ( think a three - wheeled spybot with a camera that can be controlled from any Web browser , and which can be built in a couple of hours ) to ambitious : LeGrand envisions an arm on a Qwerk - powered robot that would allow it to carry out such functions as pressing elevator buttons in order to navigate entire office buildings .
All of the software that runs Qwerk is open source , which makes TeRK incredibly flexible in the hands of the technically savvy .
" We 're hoping people notice that the sky 's the limit , " Nourbakhsh notes .
Qwerk even uses a field - programmable gate array ( FPGA ) to carry out control functions .
Unlike normal integrated circuits ( which are unalterably etched at the plant ) , FPGAs can be reconfigured by the user .
According to LeGrand , this kind of control is unprecedented .
" [ TeRK ] is not only open from a software perspective , but also from a hardware perspective , " LeGrand says .
" That 's something this industry has never seen . "
Nourbakhsh and his team have tried to make TeRK accessible to even the least programming - savvy students by creating software that allows students to program Qwerk simply by arranging on their computers colorful icons that represent various tasks .
Qwerk then performs the actions represented by those icons in the order specified by students .
But Nourbakhsh hopes to appeal to geeks as well as to novices .
" We also want to have people [ akin to mechanics who ] go under the hood of the car , '' he says .
" At all levels we reveal enough of the interior detail so that users can go in and program at the lowest level they want . "
The Qwerk uses Internet Communications Engine to allow a wide variety of programs on a PC or Mac to send commands or receive sensor data directly from the little blue box .
Nourbakhsh and his students are also working on an interface for Microsoft Robotics Studio .
Members of the larger TeRK community are beginning to build their own projects using the Qwerk , along with instructions and software available on the TeRK Web site , whereas members of Nourbakhsh 's lab have concentrated on using those tools to develop robots and curricula designed to retain the interest of groups that frequently drop out of traditional computer science courses .
" Retention has always been a problem in introductory computer science classes , " Nourbakhsh acknowledges .
Computer science is the only field of science and engineering that has not experienced an increase in the enrollment of women over the past two decades .
Quite the contrary : the percentage of women granted degrees in computer science has been declining since its peak in 1985 .
Many in the field view this trend as a crisis , and it is part of the reason that Google , Microsoft and Intel have agreed to support Nourbakhsh 's work .
All three companies are eager to build a diverse workforce in the coming decades .
" When you look at who enters these classes , it 's diverse , it includes women but they drop out early , " and you are left with a bunch of male " geeks , " Nourbakhsh says .
One of the curricula he developed to address this issue used robots in narrative play .
" We wanted to incorporate robots into things that are already meaningful .
It turns out that girls in middle school are blogging , keeping diaries , etcetera , so we had them create robots that act out how they feel .
It 's very different from a robot that moves earth or picks up ping - pong balls . "
As with other open - source projects that involve software built entirely by volunteers , such as Firefox and Linux , the success or failure of TeRK may ultimately hinge on attracting a pool of programmers and engineers willing to write new code for Qwerk and create new recipes for the hardware necessary to build robots .
" The hardware is important , but the community is the biggest part of this project , " LeGrand says .
So far , the community looks healthy : Nourbakhsh is about to post the first batch of projects submitted by Qwerk users .
It is a varied group , including an ottoman that moves about , a doll that sits on your desk and inflates and deflates depending on whether you have had enough exercise that day , and an ambitious marriage of Qwerk with the Create platform from iRobot , the folks who manufacture Roomba , the robotic vacuum cleaner .

R earden heard Bertram Scudder , outside the group , say to a girl who made some sound of indignation , " Do n't let him disturb you .
You know , money is the root of all evil – and he's the typical product of money . "
R earden did not think that Francisco could have heard it , but he saw Francisco turning to them with a gravely courteous smile .
" S o you think that money is the root of all evil ? " said Francisco d'Aconia .
" Have you ever asked what is the root of money ?
Money is a tool of exchange , which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them .
Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value .
Money is not the tool of the moochers , who claim your product by tears , or of the looters , who take it from you by force .
Money is made possible only by the men who produce .
Is this what you consider evil ?
" W hen you accept money in payment for your effort , you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others .
It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money .
Not an ocean of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow .
Those pieces of paper , which should have been gold , are a token of honor – your claim upon the energy of the men who produce .
Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money .
Is this what you consider evil ?
" H ave you ever looked for the root of production ?
Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes .
Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time .
Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motions – and you 'll learn that man 's mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth .
" B ut you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak ?
What strength do you mean ?
It is not the strength of guns or muscles .
Wealth is the product of man 's capacity to think .
Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it ?
Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools ?
By the able at the expense of the incompetent ?
By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy ?
Money is made – before it can be looted or mooched – made by the effort of every honest man , each to the extent of his ability .
An honest man is one who knows that he can't consume more than he has produced .
" T o trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will .
Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort .
Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except by the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return .
Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them , but no more .
Money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders .
Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit , not for their own injury , for their gain , not their loss – the recognition that they are not beasts of burden , born to carry the weight of your misery – that you must offer them values , not wounds – that the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering , but the exchange of goods .
Money demands that you sell , not your weakness to men's stupidity , but your talent to their reason ; it demands that you buy , not the shoddiest they offer , but the best your money can find .
And when men live by trade – with reason , not force , as their final arbiter – it is the best product that wins , the best performance , then man of best judgment and highest ability – and the degree of a man 's productiveness is the degree of his reward .
This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money .
Is this what you consider evil ?
" B ut money is only a tool .
It will take you wherever you wish , but it will not replace you as the driver .
It will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires , but it will not provide you with desires .
Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causality – the men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind .
" M oney will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants ; money will not give him a code of values , if he 's evaded the knowledge of what to value , and it will not provide him with a purpose , if he 's evaded the choice of what to seek .
Money will not buy intelligence for the fool , or admiration for the coward , or respect for the incompetent .
The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him , with his money replacing his judgment , ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors .
The men of intelligence desert him , but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him , drawn by a law which he has not discovered : that no man may be smaller than his money .
Is this the reason why you call it evil ?
" O nly the man who does not need it , is fit to inherit wealth – the man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started .
If an heir is equal to his money , it serves him ; if not , it destroys him .
But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him .
Did it ?
Or did he corrupt his money ?
Do not envy a worthless heir ; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it .
Do not think that it should have been distributed among you ; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune .
Money is a living power that dies without its root .
Money will not serve that mind that cannot match it .
Is this the reason why you call it evil ?
" M oney is your means of survival .
The verdict which you pronounce upon the source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life .
If the source is corrupt , you have damned your own existence .
Did you get your money by fraud ?
By pandering to men's vices or men's stupidity ?
By catering to fools , in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves ?
By lowering your standards ?
By doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn ?
If so , then your money will not give you a moment 's or a penny 's worth of joy .
Then all the things you buy will become , not a tribute to you , but a reproach ; not an achievement , but a reminder of shame .
Then you 'll scream that money is evil .
Evil , because it would not pinch - hit for your self - respect ?
Evil , because it would not let you enjoy your depravity ?
Is this the root of your hatred of money ?
" M oney will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause .
Money is the product of virtue , but it will not give you virtue and it will not redeem your vices .
Money will not give you the unearned , neither in matter nor in spirit .
Is this the root of your hatred of money ?
" O r did you say it 's the love of money that 's the root of all evil ?
To love a thing is to know and love its nature .
To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you , and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men .
It 's the person who would sell his soul for a nickel , who is the loudest in proclaiming his hatred of money – and he has good reason to hate it .
The lovers of money are willing to work for it .
They know they are able to deserve it .
" L et me give you a tip on a clue to men 's characters : the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably ; the man who respects it has earned it .
" R un for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil .
That sentence is the leper 's bell of an approaching looter .
So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one another – their only substitute , if they abandon money , is the muzzle of a gun .
" B ut money demands of you the highest virtues , if you wish to make it or to keep it .
Men who have no courage , pride , or self - esteem , men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life , men who apologize for being rich – will not remain rich for long .
They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries , but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth .
They will hasten to relieve him of the guilt – and of his life , as he deserves .
" T hen you will see the rise of the double standard – the men who live by force , yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted money – the men who are the hitchhikers of virtue .
In a moral society , these are the criminals , and the statutes are written to protect you against them .
But when a society establishes criminals - by - right and looters - by - law – men who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victims – then money becomes its creators ' avenger .
Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men , once they 've passed a law to disarm them .
But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters , who get it from them as they got it .
Then the race goes , not to the ablest at production , but to those most ruthless at brutality .
When force is the standard , the murderer wins over the pickpocket .
And then that society vanishes , in a spread of ruins and slaughter .
" D o you wish to know whether that day is coming ?
Watch money .
Money is the barometer of a society 's virtue .
When you see that trading is done , not by consent , but by compulsion – when you see that in order to produce , you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing – when you see that money is flowing to those who deal , not in goods , but in favors – when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work , and your laws do n't protect you against them , but protect them against you – when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self - sacrifice – you may know that your society is doomed .
Money is so noble a medium that it does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality .
It will not permit a country to survive as half - property , half - loot .
" W henever destroyers appear among men , they start by destroying money , for money is men's protection and the base of a moral existence .
Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper .
This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values .
Gold was an objective value , an equivalent of wealth produced .
Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist , backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it .
Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs : upon the virtue of the victims .
Watch for the day when it becomes , marked : ' Account overdrawn . '
" W hen you have made evil the means of survival , do not expect men to remain good .
Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral .
Do not expect them to produce , when production is punished and looting rewarded .
Do not ask , ' Who is destroying the world ? '
You are .
" Y ou stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why it 's crumbling around you , while you 're damning its life - blood – money .
You look upon money as the savages did before you , and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities .
Throughout men's history , money was always seized by looters of one brand or another , but whose method remained the same : to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound , demeaned , defamed , deprived of honor .
That phrase about the evil of money , which you mouth with such righteous recklessness , comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slaves – slaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebody 's mind and left unimproved for centuries .
So long as production was ruled by force , and wealth was obtained by conquest , there was little to conquer .
Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation , men exalted the looters , as aristocrats of the sword , as aristocrats of birth , as aristocrats of the bureau , and despised the producers , as slaves , as traders , as shopkeepers – as industrialists .
" T o the glory of mankind , there was , for the first and only time in history , a country of money – and I have no higher , more reverent tribute to pay to America , for this means : a country of reason , justice , freedom , production , achievement .
For the first time , man 's mind and money were set free , and there were no fortunes - by - conquest , but only fortunes - by - work , and instead of swordsmen and slaves , there appeared the real maker of wealth , the greatest worker , the highest type of human being – the self - made man – the American industrialist .
" I f you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans , I would choose – because it contains all the others – the fact that they were the people who created the phrase ' to make money ' .
No other language or nation had ever used these words before ; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantity – to be seized , begged , inherited , shared , looted , or obtained as a favor .
Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created .
The words ' to make money ' hold the essence of human morality .
" Y et these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters ' continents .
Now the looters ' credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame , your prosperity as guilt , your greatest men , the industrialists , as blackguards , and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor , the labor of whip - driven slaves , like the pyramids of Egypt .
The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the dollar and the power of the whip , ought to learn the difference on his own hide – as , I think , he will .

Make America Think Again ! - Share Pat's Columns ...
by Patrick J. Buchanan
Is the United States provoking war with Iran , to begin while the Congress is conveniently on its August recess ?
One recalls that it was in August 1964 , after the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater , that the Tonkin Gulf incident occurred .
Twice it was said , on Aug. 2 and Aug. 4 , North Vietnamese patrol boats had attacked the U.S. destroyers Maddox and Turner Joy in international waters .
The U.S. Senate responded by voting 88 to 2 to authorize President Johnson to assist any Southeast Asian nation whose government was threatened by communist aggression .
The bombing of the North began , followed by the arrival of U.S. Marines .
America ’s war was on .
As Congress prepares for its August recess , the probability of U.S. air strikes on Iran rises with each week .
A third carrier , the USS Enterprise , and its battle group is joining the Nimitz and Stennis in the largest concentration of U.S. naval power ever off the coast of Iran .
And Tonkin Gulf II may have already occurred .
In Baghdad , on July 1 , Gen. Kevin J. Bergner charged that Iranians planned the January raid in Karbala , using commandos in American - style uniforms , that resulted in the death of five U.S. soldiers .
As the New York Times reports , this “ marks the first time that the United States has charged that Iranian officials have helped plan operations against American troops in Iraq and have had advance knowledge of specific attacks that have led to the death of American soldiers . ”
The Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards is using Hezbollah to train Shiites to attack our soldiers and providing them with enhanced IEDs that have killed scores of U.S. troops , Bergner charged .
He says we have captured a veteran Hezbollah agent and documents pointing to direct Iranian complicity in the Karbala raid .
Iran has denounced the charge as “ ridiculous . ”
But the Senate has voted 97 - 0 to censure Iran for complicity in killing the Americans .
If what Bergner alleges is true , President Bush has not only the right but appears to have the blessing of Congress to attack Iran .
And he now has the naval and air forces at hand .
What is stopping him ?
For it is surely not Congress , which buried a resolution last spring declaring that Bush must come to Congress before taking us into a new war in the Middle East .
Congress appears to be signaling Bush : “ If you want to hit Iran , you have the green light .
No need to consult us . ”
Is this yet another abdication by Congress of its moral and constitutional duty to decide when and whether America goes to war ?
And something smells awfully fishy here .
Iran has no interest in a war with the United States , which it seems to be toying with .
Iran supports the pro-American Shia regime in Baghdad .
And the al - Qaida umbrella group in Iraq , which is our mortal enemy , has just warned Iran it faces terror attacks if it does not stop supporting Shiites in Iraq .
Abu Omar al - Baghdadi , who leads the al - Qaida group known as the Islamic State in Iraq , says his fighters have been preparing for four years for war on Iran :
“ We are giving the Persians , and especially the rulers of Iran , a two - month period to end all kinds of support for the Iraqi Shiite government and to stop direct and indirect intervention – otherwise a severe war is waiting for you , ” al - Baghdadi said in a 50 - minute videotape .
Al - Baghdadi also warned Arab Sunnis in the region who do business with Shiites in Iran that they were inviting assassination .
Query : If Iran ’s ally , the Maliki government , is our ally , and if Iran ’s enemy , al - Qaida in Iraq , is our enemy , why would Iran use the Quds Force to attack Americans and risk U.S. retaliation ?
Killing Americans in Iraq is not going to defeat the United States .
But it could trigger heavy U.S. retaliation , not only on the Quds Force , but on Iran ’s nuclear facilities – and a war with the United States .
Yet Iran ’s diplomatic behavior suggests it wishes to avoid such a war .
Another explanation comes to mind .
Iran is not initiating , but is responding to U.S. - inspired attacks inside Iran , in the Kurdish north , the Arab southwest and the Baluchi southeast of its country .
Was Karbala an attempted kidnapping to exchange U.S. soldiers for the five Iranian “ diplomats ” we are holding ?
Has Bush secretly authorized covert attacks inside Iran ?
Are U.S. and Israeli agents in Kurdistan behind the attacks across the border to provoke Iran ?
On July 11 , Iranian troops clashed with Kurd rebels inside Iran , and the Iranians fired artillery back into Iraq .
Why is Congress going on vacation ?
Why are a Democratic - controlled House and Senate not asking these questions in public hearings ?
Why is Congress letting Bush and Vice President Cheney decide whether we launch a third war in the Middle East ?
Or is Congress in on it ?
GREAT BARRINGTON , Massachusetts ( Reuters ) - A walk down Main Street in this New England town calls to mind the pictures of Norman Rockwell , who lived nearby and chronicled small - town American life in the mid-20th Century .

So it is fitting that the artist ’s face adorns the 50 BerkShares note , one of five denominations in a currency adopted by towns in western Massachusetts to support locally owned businesses over national chains .
“ I just love the feel of using a local currency , ” said Trice Atchison , 43 , a teacher who used BerkShares to buy a snack at a cafe in Great Barrington , a town of about 7,400 people .
“ It keeps the profit within the community . ”
There are about 844,000 BerkShares in circulation , worth $ 759,600 at the fixed exchange rate of 1 BerkShare to 90 U.S. cents , according to program organizers .
The paper scrip is available in denominations of one , five , 10 , 20 and 50 .
In their 10 months of circulation , they ’ve become a regular feature of the local economy .
Businesses that accept BerkShares treat them interchangeably with dollars : a $ 1 cup of coffee sells for 1 BerkShare , a 10 percent discount for people paying in BerkShares .
Named for the local Berkshire Hills , BerkShares are accepted in about 280 cafes , coffee shops , grocery stores and other businesses in Great Barrington and neighboring towns , including Stockbridge , the town where Rockwell lived for a quarter century .
“ BerkShares are cash , and so people have transferred their cash habits to BerkShares , ” said Susan Witt , executive director of the E.F.
Schumacher Society , a nonprofit group that set up the program .
“ They might have 50 in their pocket , but not 150 .
They ’re buying their lunch , their coffee , a small birthday present . ”
Great Barrington attracts weekend residents and tourists from the New York area who help to support its wealth of organic farms , yoga studios , cafes and businesses like Allow Yourself to Be , which offers services ranging from massage to “ chakra balancing ” and Infinite Quest , which sells “ past life regression therapy . ”
LOCAL PRIDE
The BerkShares program is one of about a dozen such efforts in the nation .
Local groups in California , Kansas , Michigan , New York , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Vermont and Wisconsin run similar ones .
One of the oldest is Ithaca Hours , which went into circulation in 1991 in Ithaca , New York .
About $ 120,000 of that currency circulates in the rural town .
Unlike BerkShares , Ithaca
Hours cannot officially be freely converted to dollars , though some businesses buy them .
Stephen Burkle , president of the Ithaca Hours program , said the notes are a badge of local pride .
“ At the beginning it was very hard to get small businesses to get on board with it , ” said Burkle , who also owns a music store in Ithaca .
“ When Ithaca Hours first started , there was n’t a Home Depot in town , there was n’t a Borders , there was n’t a Starbucks .
Now that there are , it ’s a mechanism for small businesses to compete with national chains . ”
U.S. law prevents states from issuing their own currency but allows private groups to print paper scrip , though not coins , said Lewis Solomon , a professor of law at George Washington University , who studies local currencies .
“ As long as you do n’t turn out quarters and you do n’t turn out something that looks like the U.S. dollar , it ’s legal , ” Solomon said .
FULL CIRCLE
The BerkShares experiment comes as the dollar is losing some of its status on international markets , with governments shifting some reserves into euros , the pound and other investments as the U.S. currency has slid in value .
But the dollar is still the currency that businesses in Great Barrington need to pay most of their bills .
“ The promise of this program is for it to be a completed circle , ” said Matt Rubiner , owner of Rubiner ’s cheese shop and Rubi ’s cafe .
Some local farmers who supply him accept BerkShares , but he pays most of his bills in dollars .
“ The circle is n’t quite completed yet in most cases , and someone has to take the hit , ” Rubiner said , referring to the 10 percent discount .
“ The person who takes the hit is the merchant , it ’s me . ”
Meanwhile , Berkshire Hills Bancorp Inc. , a western Massachusetts bank that exchanges BerkShares for dollars , is considering BerkShares - denominated checks and debit cards .
“ Businesses are n’t comfortable walking around with wads of BerkShares to pay for their supplies or their advertising , ” said Melissa Joyce , a branch officer with the bank , which has 25 branches , six of which exchange BerkShares .
“ I do hope that we ’re able to develop the checking account and debit card , because it will make it easier for everyone . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush on Monday spared I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby from prison , commuting the former White House aide 's 30 - month prison term .
A conviction remains on Scooter Libby 's record , and he must still pay a $ 250,000 fine .
The prison time was imposed after a federal court convicted Libby of perjury , obstruction of justice and lying to investigators in the probe of the leak of the name of a CIA operative .
A commutation is distinct from a pardon , which is a complete eradication of a conviction record and makes it the same as if the person has never been convicted .
Bush has only commuted Libby 's prison term , which means that the conviction remains on Libby 's record and he must still pay a $ 250,000 fine .
He will be on probation for two years .
Commutations are rarely granted , says CNN 's chief legal analyst , Jeffrey Toobin .
A commutation is a total right of the president and it cannot be challenged by any attorney or court , he said .
It 's the fourth time Bush has issued one .
Earlier Monday , a federal appeals court unanimously ruled that Libby could not delay serving his sentence , which would have put Libby just weeks away from surrendering to a prison .
In a written statement commuting the prison sentence , issued hours after Monday 's ruling , Bush called the sentence " excessive , " and suggested that Libby will pay a big enough price for his conviction .
Watch what signal critics say Bush 's decision sends »
" The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer , public servant , and private citizen will be long - lasting , " he said .
The president , who has been under great pressure to pardon Libby , said Libby was given " a harsh sentence based in part on allegations never presented to the jury . "
Libby can still appeal his conviction .
And if the appeal fails or is still in process at the end of Bush 's term , the president could grant Libby a full pardon .
Libby 's conviction is linked to the investigation into the 2003 leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame 's identity .
An outraged Joe Wilson , Plame 's husband , spoke to CNN shortly after the ruling .
Wilson had gone public with allegations that the Bush administration had " twisted " the evidence used to justify the invasion of Iraq , and prosecutors argued that Libby disclosed her employment as part of an effort to discredit him .
" I have nothing to say to Scooter Libby , " Wilson said .
" I do n't owe this administration .
They owe my wife and my family an apology for having betrayed her .
Scooter Libby is a traitor . "
Libby was not accused of disclosing Plame 's identity himself .
But at trial , special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald told the jury that Libby 's actions left " a cloud over the White House " by obstructing the leak probe .
In a statement issued Monday night , Fitzgerald took issue with Bush 's description of the sentence as " excessive , " saying it was " imposed pursuant to the laws governing sentencings which occur every day throughout this country . "
" It is fundamental to the rule of law that all citizens stand before the bar of justice as equals , " Fitzgerald said .
" That principle guided the judge during both the trial and the sentencing . "
Plame had worked in the CIA 's counter - proliferation division before the March 2003 invasion .
She told a congressional committee in March that her exposure effectively ended her career and endangered " entire networks " of agents overseas .
Her husband said Bush 's action today demonstrates that the White House is " corrupt from top to bottom . "
Clemency petitions are normally reviewed by the Justice Department , which investigates the case and seeks input from the federal prosecutor who brought the case before issuing a recommendation to the president .
A government official said that Bush did not consult with the Justice Department before rendering his decision .
Reaction on Capitol Hill was swift .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , said the president had " abandoned all sense of fairness when it comes to justice . "
" The president 's commutation of Scooter Libby 's prison sentence does not serve justice , condones criminal conduct , and is a betrayal of trust of the American people , " she said .
One of the few members of the GOP backing Bush , House Republican Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri , said the commutation was " the right thing to do . "
" The prison sentence was overly harsh , and the punishment did not fit the crime , " Blunt said .
Plame 's name became public when Robert Novak named her in his column on July 14 , 2003 .
Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage has admitted he disclosed the information to a reporter .
Novak pointed to another " senior administration official " -- Bush political adviser Karl Rove -- as the second source for his column .
No one has been charged with leaking classified information in the case , but a jury found Libby guilty of trying to deceive investigators and a grand jury during the investigation .
Bush was under great pressure to grant a pardon to Libby .
Libby , the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , is the highest - ranking White House official ordered to prison since the Iran - Contra affair .
Polls suggest the American public may not be happy with Libby 's commutation .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll taken in March asked if Bush should pardon Libby -- 69 percent said no , 18 percent said yes .
Ted Wells , an attorney for Libby , issued a statement late Monday saying that Libby and his family " wish to express their gratitude for the president 's decision . "
" We continue to believe in Mr. Libby 's innocence , " Wells said .
" Scooter and his family appreciate the many Americans who have supported them over the last two years . "

All About Lewis Libby
Signaling that alternative energy could one day provide massive amounts of the state ’s power , PG&E said Wednesday it signed a contract to buy electricity from what will be one of the world ’s largest solar plants .
The deal provides enough power to serve more than 400,000 homes and is big enough to help the company meet aggressive state rules that demand utilities provide 20 percent of their power from renewable energy sources by 2010 .
“ People who have sort of looked down at renewables because it ’s nice and cute but small - scale will now see that the 800 - pound gorilla in the room does not have to be a coal plant , ” said Dan Kammen , co-director of the Berkeley Institute of the Environment at the University of California - Berkeley .
But as the state ’s large publicly owned utilities strive to meet the state goals , they are also running into another formidable challenge : Expensive and sometimes unreliable energy options .
Experts say it is impossible to say how an increase in renewable energy use will affect customer bills because there are a number of factors that contribute to the price of power .
But it is clear that new environmentally friendly sources of energy cost more than traditional sources .
While natural gas and clean - coal technologies cost about 9 cents per kilowatt - hour , solar technologies can cost four times that .
Even more , renewable fuels provide intermittent power , working only when the wind blows or the sun shines .
“ Getting away from fossil fuels costs money if all you consider is the direct cost of power , ” said Severin Borenstein , director of the University of California Energy Institute .
“ If you consider the environmental consequences , I think it makes a lot of sense . ”
Still , the direct costs can be steep .
Solar photovoltaic , which usually uses panels on rooftops , costs about 39 cents a kilowatt - hour .
Solar thermal , the system to be used in the PG&E contract project , uses the sun ’s heat to create steam energy and costs about 22 cents a kilowatt - hour , according to 2007 data from the California Energy Commission .
The price includes the cost of constructing a new plant .
Wind power , another popular form of renewable energy , is cost - competitive at about 7 cents a kilowatt hour , according to the energy commission .
PG&E declines to talk about the cost of renewables and how much they may affect customer bills , citing competitive reasons .
However , the company confirms that renewables usually cost more than natural gas or coal .
The company would not disclose how much its deal with Solel Solar Systems of Israel to buy power from a 553 - megawatt plant in California ’s Mojave Desert .
Solel President and Chief Executive Avi Brenmiller said he believed the new plant would be “ cost competitive ” with natural gas .
Construction of the plant – the same size as natural gas plants – will begin in 2009 and finish by 2011 .
PG&E has signed a 25 - year contract for the energy .
Solar thermal ’s renaissance is in part because of rising natural gas prices and also because larger plants makes the technology more economical .
“ We think it ’s one of – if not the – most promising technology , ” said Keely Wachs , PG&E ’s environmental communications manager .
Thermal is so attractive , utilities said , because it provides energy when and where California needs it most : hot sunny days .
“ The U.S. is perfectly situated to be able to build large - scale solar thermal plants because we have an abundance of flat , arid land close to large populations , ” said Rhone Resch , president of the national Solar Energy Industries Association .
In California , PG&E said the Solel plant will help increase the company ’s renewable - energy portfolio of contracts by two percentage points to 18 percent – bringing it another step closer to reaching the state goals .
The utility expects to contract for more than 20 percent of its power from renewable sources by the end of this year .
But does the race to build renewable power mean California ’s utility customers will pay higher prices ?
Experts say that ’s hard to answer .
While renewables cost more , there are many factors that contribute to the price of power .
Michael Peevey , president of the California Public Utilities Commission , which regulates utilities and the rates customers pay , has said the factors that make California ’s prices higher include not using coal and relying on volatile natural gas prices .
Californians already pay some of the highest electricity prices in the nation – about 15 cents per kilowatt - hour in April compared with a U.S. average of about 11 cents per kilowatt - hour , according to the federal Energy Information Administration .
Advocates argue that prices will go down as more renewable power sources are built .
Database myths and legends ( Part 9 ) In this series we 're looking at the myths and legends of the database world - some are true , some false .
The myth under the spotlight today is : Bloor Research once produced a report that slammed SQL Server so much that Microsoft had it suppressed .
OK , let 's start at the top .
Bloor Research is a highly respectable analyst company .
Has it ever looked at scalability in database engines ?
A quick Google of the words " Bloor Scalability Database " produces over 40,000 hits and simply following a couple of links will convince you that , of course , the company has done so .
This kind of report is meat and drink to Bloor .
Now try and find a reference to the highly critical one .
I 'll give you two clues .
It did exist .
It was published in March 1997 .
It 's hard to find any references to it .
In fact , only by knowing , and searching for , the actual title of the report , The Realities of Scalability , was I able to turn up two references to it : here and here .
Both are contemporary news pieces , published shortly after it appeared .
It seems very likely that these originally appeared in print and have subsequently migrated to the web as archive material .
So the report clearly did exist , indeed rumour has it that certain copies are still extant ...
The ' supressed ' Bloor report
It is still , today , a very impressive body of work .
Over 130 detailed pages of complex tests that really put three database engines : DB2 on AIX , DB2 on WindowsNT , and Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 on WindowsNT , through the wringer .
Bloor tested the databases ' performance under read - only and update conditions , varied the number of users and the number of processors .
Finally , and unusually , Bloor actually performed statistical analysis on the results to verify whether the differences were significant .
It is also undeniable that the report is highly critical of SQL Server 6.5 .
The summary says , for example , of the user scalability : " Put simply , Microsoft SQL Server for Windows NT at high numbers of users performs dramatically worse than either of the other two databases . "
And of the stability , it says : " This database had a number of failure states that could repeatably be generated .
With large numbers of users , it was found that the database would grind to a halt . "
DB2 for NT generally acquitted itself well : " Despite the occasional unexplained server or database crash , it proved impossible to consistently generate a fatal error in DB2 for Windows NT .
It seemed to be capable of taking most things thrown at it . "
And DB2 for AIX was a positive paragon of virtue : " DB2 for AIX proved to be by far the most stable of the platforms tested .
No repeatable errors were found , and the system never fell over .
The performance never fell appreciably below that which was expected in any of our tests . "
RIAA Pre-Litigation Letters Sent to MIT
23 Students Accused of Copyright Violations
Twenty - three MIT students have been sent pre-litigation settlement letters after allegedly illegally downloading copyrighted audio recordings , according to a press release from the Recording Industry Association of America .
MIT received the pre-litigation letters last Wednesday , May 2 , said Daniel Jacobs , legal assistant in MIT 's Senior Counsel 's Office .
At that time , Jacobs said that the letters would have to be analyzed before MIT considered forwarding them to students .
These are the first RIAA pre-litigation letters received by MIT , according to Jacobs .
As of yesterday , MIT had forwarded the letters on to students , said Timothy J. McGovern , manager of IT Security Support for Information Services and Technology .
McGovern also said that MIT suggested students talk with advisers , family members , or attorneys in considering a response to a pre-litigation letter .
McGovern declined to discuss legal specifics regarding the cases , saying the letters were part of a student 's permanent record and thus legally protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act .
According to a spokeswoman from the RIAA , the letters are part of a new anti-piracy initiative announced in February that offers students a chance to avoid a lawsuit by settling outside of court .
The spokeswoman also said that the letters allow students to settle at a discounted rate compared to the damages sought in a civil suit .
The new initiative is a shift from the RIAA 's previous strategy of filing " John Doe " lawsuits and subpoenas that order MIT to divulge the name of a student .
Instead , the RIAA contacts schools directly with pre-litigation letters containing IP addresses — addresses used to uniquely define computers on the Internet — of allegedly infringing users and the dates of the offenses .
The RIAA then requests that schools forward the letters on to users , according to an RIAA press release .
The spokeswoman said that the majority of schools that received letters had forwarded them on to students .
According to a sample pre-litigation letter provided by the RIAA , the settlement process involves " lump sum " payment to record companies and deletion of all material infringing on copyright .
The agreement also states that the party accused of copyright infringement agrees to not infringe on " any other sound recording protected under federal or state law … whether now in existence or later created " or the agreement may become void .
A sample pre-litigation settlement agreement is available at http://www-tech.mit.edu/V127/N24/riaa/letter.pdf .
Jeffrey I. Schiller ' 79 , Network Manager for IS&T , said that the letters also act as a preserve order for MIT , requiring the Institute to save information about the user of a specific IP .
MIT maintains a database of IP addresses assigned to users and stores the information for 30 days , said Schiller .
" Suppose on day 29 we get one of the pre-litigation notices .
Once we get one of these , we basically … have to save the information forever . "
Increased enforcement
McGovern stated that " most " of the students who were sent pre-litigation letters had previously received Digital Millennium Copyright
Act takedown notices regarding the music in question .
Schiller said that MIT , acting as an Internet Service Provider , forwards DMCA notices to students accused of violating copyright law .
According to the IS&T
Web site , a student 's first case of alleged copyright infringement results in a warning , as long as the student responds that the copyrighted material was removed from their computer .
A second violation results in temporary suspension of network access and a meeting with IS&T representatives .
A third violation results in an indefinite suspension of network access and referral to the Committee on Discipline .
McGovern said he saw " an unusual increase in the total number of takedown notices " between the 2005 - 2006 and 2006 - 2007 academic years , estimating that infringement notices increased by " several hundred percent . "
McGovern did not have statistics immediately available , but attributed the spike to increased enforcement by television , movie , and software industries .
McGovern also said he hoped MIT students would not be the target of future lawsuits but said that there had been no talks about restricting access to peer - to - peer ( P2P ) services .
Other universities restrict bandwidth available to P2P applications in an effort to stem copyright infringement and some have begun to ban P2P applications altogether .
Last month , Ohio University banned all P2P applications , writing in a statement on their Web site that peer - to - peer traffic " consumes a disproportionate amount of resources , both in bandwidth and human technical support . "
A statement on MIT 's Office of Intellectual Property Counsel 's Web page says that MIT " is firmly against the unauthorized uploading or downloading and sharing of … copyrighted material " but also that " MIT recognizes the many legal benefits of P2P software . "
Schiller said that MIT has " no plans " to restrict P2P traffic or block P2P applications , and seemed confident that those policies were unlikely to change .
" We view ourselves as an ISP , " said Schiller , describing MIT 's hands - off network policy .
Schiller also said that P2P programs were becoming increasingly difficult to detect , as applications can conceal traffic in a variety of ways , including encrypting payload data .
Moreover , Schiller cautioned that not all students who receive DMCA notices necessarily violated copyright law .
Shiller said that it is becoming " quite difficult " to ensure IP addresses were actually used for infringement .
" I 've seen notices for random IP addresses that we would have never assigned , " said Schiller .
Furthermore , the complexity of some protocols such as BitTorrent has caused erroneous DMCA notices to be sent .
A discussion on the EDUCAUSE Security Discussion Group last month included concerns that HBO had sent a series of inaccurate DMCA notices with incorrect infringement times .
The discussion also suggested that HBO was relying on questionable and possibly forged data from BitTorrent " trackers " — directory servers that contain information about IPs downloading a file — that could be readily forged .
WASHINGTON , Mich. , June 8 —
The undoing of the immigration bill in the Senate this week had many players , but none more effective than angry voters like Monique Thibodeaux , who joined a nationwide campaign to derail it .
Mrs. Thibodeaux , an office manager at a towing company here in suburban Detroit , became politically active as she never had before .
Guided by conservative Internet organizations , she made calls and sent e-mail messages to senators across the country and pushed her friends to do the same .
“ These people came in the wrong way , so they do n’t belong here , period , ” Mrs. Thibodeaux , a Republican , said of some 12 million illegal immigrants who would have been granted a path to citizenship under the Senate bill .
“ In my heart I knew it was wrong for our country , ” she said of the measure .
Supporters of the legislation defended it as an imperfect but pragmatic solution to the difficult problem of illegal immigration .
Public opinion polls , including a New York Times / CBS News
Poll conducted last month , showed broad support among Americans for the bill ’s major provisions .

Posted on June 15 , 2007 , Ron Whitaker Gaming Today ’s Exclusive Interview with Author Orson Scott Card
It ’s no secret that I am a huge fan of Orson Scott Card .
The “ Ender ’s Saga ” series of novels is among my all - time favorites .
Needless to say , when I discovered that Mr. Card was willing to sit down with me to answer a few of my questions , I was elated .
My elation soon turned into anxiety .
How do I interview someone I hold in such high regard without sounding completely idiotic ?
My first instinct of screaming “ YOU ARE SO AWESOME ” would be the start , and end , of the interview .
Luckily , Mr. Card was kind enough to indulge my fan - boy rantings to answer a few of my questions .
In this interview , Orson Scott Card reveals a progress update for the upcoming “ Ender ’s Game ” film , brand - new information regarding plans for video games based on the beloved “ Ender ’s Saga ” series of novels , and his thoughts on the current gaming industry .
We want to extend our sincerest thanks to Mr. Card for taking the time out of his busy schedule to speak with us .
Gaming Today :
While our readers certainly know your work from the acclaimed Alvin Maker and Saga series of novels , what they might not realize is how often your works have shown up in the gaming world .
( Titles like Advent Rising , and smaller parts in The Secret of Monkey Island among others . )
How did you get involved in writing for video games ?
Orson Scott Card :
The writing I did for projects with LucasFilm Games ( as they were then called ) began when I was invited to visit “ the ranch ” ( back when they were still in the carriagehouse ) and look in on some of the games .
I loved what they were doing and learned a lot ; I ’m not sure of the value of my contributions , but I did come up with the insults for Monkey Island ( with the help of my kids , who drew on their grade - school experience to create the lame starting insults ) .
Later , I was hired to write dialogue for two games , one of them “ The Dig ” and the other a side - scrolling shooter that I ’m not sure was ever published , since it was coming out just when first - person shooters completely took over the genre .
However , for that game I came up with the slang that I later used in battle school in the Shadow books and in the movie scripts I ’ve written for Ender ’s Game .
Nothing gets wasted .
With Advent Rising , the creators of that game , then at GlyphX ( now at Chair Entertainment ) invited me to take part early on .
The collaboration did not work as we had hoped – I ended up coming in too late to be part of the story development – but I wrote much of the dialogue and established the character relationships .
It was a productive partnership , because I later wrote my novel Empire based on the situations created for their game of the same name ( not yet finished ) .
See the rest of this exclusive interview after the jump .
GT : I read an interview where you described your experiences of a “ gaming addiction with the PC game Civilization 2 .
( I can relate , as I am still having Civilization 4 withdrawal )
What do you think it takes to create a great video game , and are there any games you are addicted to currently ?
OSC : After I went cold turkey on Civ II , I have deliberately avoided ANY game of that type .
There are nuisance games that I ’m semi-addicted to .
( “ Nuisance games ” are the ones that sit on your PC and keep nagging you to play them , because after all they only take about three minutes .
The problem is you play them forty times . )
My list is : Spider Solitaire , Cruel , TaiPei , Tetris , Hearts , Jezzball , WordZap , and the Hoyle Backgammon game .
( Am I the only one who deeply resents MicroSoft removing the LAN option from Hearts and forcing you to an online situation ?
We used to play on the various computers in our house ; now we have to get online and play with idiots .
So instead I just play solo . )
The games that I was addicted to , in an opium - morphine - heroine kind of progression , were Romance of the Three Kingdoms , then one of the early Ultimas , followed by whatever Sid Meier was doing : Colonization , Civilization , Railroads .
I would devote days at a time to each game , and could only break one addiction by replacing it with the next .
The odd thing is that I never liked them as programmed .
I wanted to play a different game , and with Civ II players were allowed to access and revise the values tables .
Basically , I made it so combat was a trivial matter , and what was fun for me was creating the cities and eventually filling the whole world ( except for one rival city that knew to keep its head down ) with my marvelous , high - level cities .
The only thing that kept me from going broke because of never writing was that I reached a point where I would only play to 210 A.D. and then stop .
Sometimes I was even building a spaceship by then .
The weird thing was that even when I was n’t playing , I felt a tremendous anxiety .
I had responsibilities – there were cities waiting for me to tell them what to build !
Now , I ’m not insane .
My conscious mind knew that it was just a game , and when I was n’t running the program , nothing was happening at all .
But I invested so much tension in the playing of the game that it did n’t go away when I left the computer .
The call of duty was still there .
These games were so much a part of my life that I still feel a little stab of excitement when somebody mentions ( often in a book ) one of the towns that were British rail stations in Sid Meier ’s Railroad game .
And I still remember the names of my favorite Chinese generals from Romance of the Three Kingdoms : Sima Yi , Cao Pi , Zhang Wei .
I tried some of the other games that thought they were similar , but they were n’t .
Either they were too combat centered – it was all about staying alive by fighting all the time – or the city - building felt like meaningless task management instead of something creative .
I do n’t enjoy playing games that feel like just a job , with nothing to show for it .
In fact , in CivII I really missed one of the features of CivI :
The replay at the end of the game , where the whole history of the world was played out on a miniature map .
That was so great !
Yeah , I know , I sound like an ex-drinker talking about all the good times I used to have on my alcoholic binges …
My cold - turkey stop was because , and I ’m serious here , it was costing me a shocking amount of money and depriving me of a home life with my family .
Here I am , a self - employed writer , and I never had time for my family because I had this GAME that was waiting to seduce me whenever I pretended I was going to the office to work .
I estimate there are about twenty novels that were never written because of computer games .
Now , there are those who think that ’s a blessing to literature , but at the very least it was costing me money because I was n’t getting paid as often as when I actually complete the books that are under contract .
GT : Video games are notorious for having mediocre storylines , which I suppose can be blamed on the gamers themselves .
I certainly am guilty of frantically trying to skip monotonous video game dialog , hitting the start button until I can get back into the action .
As a writer , how do you go about facing the challenges inherent in writing for such a dynamic medium ?
OSC : Games CAN’T have the kind of storylines that movies and books have , or they would n’t be playable .
You are correct to skip the tedious , badly written “ scenes ” that are usually a pathetic job of trying to paste story on top of a game .
What makes a game work is the opposite of what makes a story work .
In a story , you are seeking to find out what really happened – why people do what they do , what the results of their choices are .
You identify with the character (s ) but you do not control them .
Instead , the author has the ultimate authority .
When a movie is made from a book and the script changes key events , the readers are usually furious .
Why ?
Since the original events were n’t real , why not change them ?
The answer is simple : Even in fiction , what the author put down on paper is “ the truth ” and anyone who fiddles with it is “ lying ” or “ wrecking it . ”
In a game , the opposite illusion must be created .
Even though most games absolutely force you to follow preset paths , the gamewrights try to give you the illusion that you are making free choices ( even though you are actually , in almost all games , still being channeled through certain puzzles with fixed solutions ) .
There is no question about character motivation .
The lead character is you , and your motivation is to beat the enemy and win .
It ’s like golf .
Sure , you could put on a World War II uniform and pretend that each ball was a bomb that needed to be dropped down into the underground bunker of some Nazi generals , and call it “ Golf : The Dirty Dozen , ” but the GAME is about you and your contest with the obstacles placed in your way by the course designer .
You can compare your score with other players , but the things they do are completely irrelevant to your game .
It ’s just you against the golf course designer ( and , of course , the groundskeepers ) .
In most videogames , you ’re still just playing golf .
The story exists only to justify cool new gameplay features .
Yes , we respond to greater and greater realism ; yes , there ’s an element of escapism and power fantasy and all that crap that we hear about from psychologists – but lousy games have those just as much as good ones .
What makes a difference is the degree of challenge and freshness in each new game .
Everything else is window dressing .
You ’ve got to have it , but nobody should ever get confused and think that the window dressing IS the game .
The “ story ” elements of game are the window dressing .
No wonder you skip them .
To the degree that the game is fixed – the outcome predetermined – the game is a story .
But to the degree that you SEE that the game is fixed , it becomes less fun to play !
You want to have the feeling that you can also explore the world a little , maybe find stuff that has nothing to do with gameplay .
Since when do you do that in a novel or movie ?
You can do that on a golf course , because the world is just a little bigger than the fairways and greens .
But when you ’re choosing weapons in a shooter , you ’re just telling the caddy to give you a nine - iron instead of a wood .
I wish sometimes that I were so rich I could just finance the development of the games I want to play .
The gamewrights would report only to me instead of pinheaded executives from the game publishing companies .
Once I was happy with a game , then we ’d release it to the public , and if nobody else likes it , screw ‘ em .
I ’m happy .
GT : I ’m sure you are asked this next question constantly , but our readers would kill me if I did not ask .
How is the development process for the Enders Game movie coming along ?
I would imagine that turning such a beloved story into a tangible script is a pretty daunting challenge .
OSC : Ender ’s Game is in turnaround right this minute , which means that the scripts that were written to the previous director ’s specs were unfilmable .
Nothing against the writers – they did what they were told .
But in no case was it remotely like Ender ’s Game .
The only scripts that came close to duplicating the effects of Ender ’s Game on the audience were mine , and even THOSE are n’t yet where they need to be .
It finally became clear to us all that what the Warner executives wanted was never going to be close enough to Ender ’s Game to satisfy what I would allow to be done to the story .
And yet … in the process , my own scripts have come closer and closer to being what we need .
I ’m about to start yet another revision that will , I think , take us over the top to a movie that works as a movie , but is also true to what is most important about the book .
Meanwhile , we ’re talking to other studios and other directors , and I ’m optimistic enough to say that I believe that the actor who will play Ender Wiggin has been born .
It ’s worth keeping in mind that if you just filmed the book , you would have a completely lousy movie .
The book takes place in Ender ’s head ; the movie ca n’t take you there .
Without Ender ’s thoughts , he just looks like a violent little kid .
So with the movie scripts , I ’ve been doing the things that are necessary to make it work as a movie .
That means eliminating things that do n’t play on the screen .
The whole Peter and Valentine subplot is gone , for the simple reason that all they do , on screen , is sit at computers and type .
you ca n’t SEE what they do .
Also , the action has to be compressed in time so that instead of taking seven years , as the book does , it all takes place in one year – so that all the kid parts can be played by one actor each !
No way can you expect an actor to fake aging from six to twelve .
And no way can you expect an audience to accept two or three changes of actor for the same part in the same movie !
And the movie has to take about two hours .
The book , filmed scene for scene , would take four times that or more .
It ’s not easy .
But I ’m optimistic .
We ’re getting there .
GT : Whenever I bring up “ Ender ’s Game ” to my friends , all we seem to talk about is how amazing the novel would translate into a gaming experience .
Are there any plans for Ender ’s Game to be developed as a video game ?
OSC : Part of the deal with Warner Brothers was for them to develop the many videogames that are possible from the book , without waiting for the movie .
They never fulfilled that – which was the only part of the deal with Warner Brothers that actually made me angry .
Movies are hard to make – but to make many good , profitable Ender ’s Game games is a no-brainer .
Do n’t look for one “ Ender ’s Game ” game .
Look , instead , for games bearing the Ender ’s Game brand .
Here are just a few :
The Battle Room .
I see several game modules here , using the same graphics base but with quite different game play .
There ’s the game where you ’re an individual soldier ; the game where you ’re a toon leader ; the game where you command .
Then there are three radically different space war games .
There is the game based on the first Formic War ( i.e. , Earth itself is attacked and must fight back with a jerry - rigged fleet made up of non-combat or non-space vehicles and weapons ) , the second Formic War ( where Earth ’s forces are grossly outgunned and outnumbered , but they must find ways – and not just Mazer ’s trick way – to win or at least stay alive with enough force to engage in the next round of combat ) , and finally the Third Formic War , which is the one where Ender and the kids on Eros command the fleet .
Within each of these are several modules , again depending on whether you ’re an individual pilot , a small - group leader , or a commander of a larger fleet .
Then there ’s the story - based game , in which there ’s a character named Ender and another named Bean – arguably , those are two separate games , if they ’re based on the books Ender ’s Game and Ender ’s Shadow !
These would be your standard movie - adaptation games , where you control the hero character and have to solve puzzles .
In the Bean game , there ’s a lot of gameplay in the air - conditioning system – I suspect it would actually be more fun than the Ender game .
Ender did n’t get much chance to goof around .
Then there ’s the multi-user online game called Battle School , where players are organized in armies and actually progress through the whole Battle School sequence , graduating by being assigned to tactical or pre-command or other assignments .
Then there ’s the “ mind game ” or Fantasy Game from the novel .
This would be the hardest to design , since there are so many areas where free - association would need to be rewarded .
But it would also be the most fun to explore !
Then there ’s the game “ Hive Queen , ” set in the days before the Hive Queens began to cooperate .
Instead they are rivals on the original home planet , struggling to compete with the other queens while building up techno advantages in their wars , while fending off the problems caused by the birth of new queens from time to time .
This one is implied by Ender ’s Game , but never explicitly enacted .
It ’s what SimAnt should have been , but was n’t – because you play the Hive Queen , not an expendable worker , it actually matters whether you live or die and you have time to accomplish something before you had the baton over to a successor queen who , having all your memories , is in many ways simply a continuation of yourself .
This game , like Civilization , could be a multi - thousand - year saga .
And then there ’s the post - war war :
The war among Earth nations struggling to get control of the IF after the formics are defeated .
This is like a huge game of Risk with only a few real - time days in which to carry out whatever you ’ve been able to conspire to set up .
You get the idea .
Probably the Battle Room game would be the most popular and yet the cheapest to develop each module for , so we ’ll certainly start there , though I think the First Formic War will also be a terrific and popular game .
We ’ll see what happens .
GT : The topic in the news seems to be the effect of violent video games on children .
This sort of nature vs. argument represents itself in some aspects of the Battle School in Ender ’s Game .
Does simulated violence alter an individual capacity for real violence ?
What is your take on this issue ?
OSC : There is rational evidence that exposure to or participation in simulated violence has a brief halo effect – that for a short time afterward , people tend to act out the attitudes of the game .
But this has not been shown to have a long - term causative effect :
That is , games do not take nonviolent people and turn them violent .
Rather it seems that exceptionally violent games attract people who are already heavily violence - prone , so that , as with pornography , they are a symptom and an exacerbator rather than a cause .
Also , players , like audiences , are able to distinguish very clearly between cartoon violence and real violence .
Grand Theft Auto provides real - world scripts ; Coyote - and - Road - Runner cartoons do not .
Playing Space Invaders may make me more likely to shoot rows of aliens attacking slowly from above , but it is not likely to cause me to drive more aggressively or beat people up .
To say “ video games cause violence ” is stupid in the extreme , like saying “ novel reading causes teenagers to have sex ” just because SOME young - adult novels are perhaps more sex- centered than is helpful .
The question is always :
Which videogame are you talking about ?
Here ’s the parental - control switch that is truly needed : Built - in clocks , which parents can set to say that at exactly one or two or three hours , the game shuts off ( saving your exact game state ) and cannot be restarted for at least twelve hours .
This would be called the “ get a life ” switch , and I certainly have needed to have such a switch under the control of my wife .
Games ARE addictive ; it is hard to stop playing without outside help .
GT : Finally , what other projects are you currently working on ?
OSC : I ’m starting up a new fantasy novel that I hope will be as compelling and successful a world and story as Ender ’s Game has been .
But then , I always hope that with all my projects …

VIDEO : Vice President Cheney bashes New York Times during campaign rally
David Edwards
Published : Friday July 21 , 2006
During a campaign speech on behalf of Gus Bilirakis in Florida 's 9th District , Vice President Dick Cheney took the opportunity to attack The New York Times .
Throughout his tenure as Vice President , Cheney has had a record of disdain for the paper , but his attacks have escalated since The Times revealed last fall that the NSA had been conducting secret surveillance on American citizens without properly informing Congress .
" Now these kinds of stories alert the terrorists to what we 're doing , and how we 're doing it , " said Cheney .
Speaking of The New York Times , Cheney said , " The fact is that it 's harder to defend the United States when news executives take it upon themselves to determine whether National Security secrets deserve protection and then routinely decide that they do not . "

According to the Tampa affiliate for ABC News , the " $ 500 - a- plate fundraiser " was held at the Wyndham Westshore resort .
" Vice President Cheney , following a loud round of applause , opened his remarks by saying , ' Thank you very much .
A warm welcome like that is almost enough to make me want to run again .
Almost almost ( laughter and applause ) , ' " the station 's Website reported .
Handsome men have the best sperm , a new study reveals .
The researchers showed that men with the healthiest , fastest sperm were rated as the most facially attractive by women .
The characteristics of a person ’s face have long been regarded as an indicator of health .
But this is the first direct evidence to suggest a man ’s reproductive quality correlates with his facial characteristics , say the authors .
Maria Sancho - Navarro , a team member at the University of Valencia , Spain , said that symmetrical faces were rated as more attractive by the women .
And other studies have shown that people with more symmetrical features are less likely to suffer ill health .
The researcher team examined 66 male students from Valencia .
They showed frontal and side photos of the men ’s faces to 66 women , who rated their attractiveness .
The men ’s semen quality was measured according to World Health Organization guidelines .

Motility and morphology
In the second part of the study , 12 men from the good , normal and bad semen groups were selected and their photos rated by two independent sets of women .
The women ’s perception of a man ’s good looks corresponded to better sperm motility and morphology in both groups .
However , there was no relationship between attractiveness and sperm concentration .
Although other factors like social and economic status influence women ’s final choice of a partner , say the researchers , they do seek attractive partners who are healthy and able to father children .
“ Our study has shown that women are able to recognise reproductively fit males on the basis of their facial appearance alone , ” they conclude .
A separate study by UK researchers has revealed that women with the most alluring voices have the most attractive faces .
Sarah Collins and Caroline Missing , at the University of Nottingham , played recordings of 30 young women to men who later saw their photos .
The men judged women with attractive voices as the best looking , reveals the study published in the latest Animal Behaviour .

Federal investigators have uncovered what they describe as a sweeping network of kickbacks , bribes and fraud involving at least eight employees and subcontractors of KBR , the former Halliburton subsidiary , in a scheme to inflate charges for flying freight into Iraq in support of the war , according to court papers unsealed yesterday .
The latest conviction in the cases related to the scheme came yesterday , when a former Houston - based executive for an air - freight carrier hired by KBR pleaded guilty in federal district court to dispensing bribes and then lying to federal investigators .
The executive , Kevin Andre Smoot , 43 , of The Woodlands , Tex. , served as a managing director for Eagle Global Logistics Incorporated , a carrier that received a subcontract from KBR to ship the freight .
The guilty plea by Mr. Smoot is the second by an Eagle executive in the case .
But the papers describing his plea indicate that investigators believe at least one more Eagle employee and five KBR employees , all so far unnamed , were also involved .
Mr. Smoot alone admitted to delivering bribes , called gratuities in the legalistic language of the court papers , to the employees of KBR on some 90 occasions between 2002 and 2005 .
At the core of the case is a contract that KBR , previously known as Kellogg , Brown & Root , won before the war to supply the American military with food , fuel , housing and other necessities .
The value of the contract soared with the Iraq invasion , and has so far paid KBR some $ 20 billion .

Her methods sound more domestic disaster than domestic goddess .
But Eliza Smith was , in fact , the Nigella Lawson of her day .
From sliced cow heels to a sauce of minced pig ears , she knew how to please an 18th century palate .
Even better , she had remedies for fevers , boils and baldness , and all the best tips for pickling and brewing .
So - like any celebrity chef worth their salt - she sold her secrets to the public .
Now a copy of her book The Compleat Housewife or Accomplish-d Gentlewoman 's Companion , published in 1736 , has surfaced at an auction house .
Scroll down for more
The 373 - page work , which is leather - bound , is expected to fetch £ 800 when it goes under the hammer in May .
It offers an intriguing picture of life before the Industrial Revolution , only 70 years after the Great Plague .
Very little is known about the author , who is believed to have been born in the late 17th century .
But she reveals in her preface that for over 30 years she had been employed ' in fashionable and noble Families ' .
Auctioneer Charles Hanson , a regular on the BBC's Bargain Hunt antiques show , said : " What is clear is that Mrs Smith was very much the domestic goddess of her day .
" We do know that she worked for a number of fashionable houses and noble families of the time .
" Though many of her ideas sound alarming to us , she was very much in the tradition of what were known as ' ladies of taste ' and highly respected . "
The book lists more than 600 recipes for cakes , pastry , confectionery , and meals such as the sliced cow 's feet and ' ragoo of pig's ear ' garnished with ' barberies ' , or barberries , a bitter fruit .
Originally published in 1727 shortly before Smith 's death it was revised 18 times over the following three decades .
This seventh edition , which cost the original buyer five shillings , promised ' very large additions ' including ' near fifty receipts being communicated just before the author 's death ' .
It also boasts ' above two - hundred family receipts of medicines ' - including a remedy for boils using a newly - laid egg mixed with honey and a cure for ' spotted fever ' with snake - weed , treacle and raspberry juice .
Mrs Smith also offers an unlikely - sounding remedy for baldness - involving ' two ounces of boar 's grease , one dram of the ashes of burnt bees and one dram of the ashes of Southernwood ' .
She says of her remedies : " They are all excellent in their kind and have cured when all other means have failed and are ready to serve the publick . "
The book , of which only around 150 copies are thought to have been produced , was found at a valuation day run by Mr Hanson in Kings Bromley , Staffordshire .
Its owner , who does not want to be identified , came forward after Mr Hanson , of Hanson 's Auctioneers , Lichfield , Staffordshire , sold a work by the man described as the Gordon Ramsay of his day .
The Accomplish'd Cook - the Art and Mastery of Cookery , penned by 17th century ' celebrity chef ' Robert May in 1678 , fetched £ 4,500 in January .

Welcome to the shortest Photoshop Phriday ever !
This week I tasked the Something Awful Forum Goons with making some humorous pinball machines .
It turns out everybody hates pinball , possibly justifiably so .
In spite of all this brevity we 're packing , the images are n't too shabby .
So enjoy !
It wo n't take you long to do so .

A day after the government confirmed its telephone deregulation plan over the objection of a Parliamentary committee and moved forward on plans to create a new , independent telecommunications consumer agency , it is worth pointing to a necessary complaint once that agency is operational ( and to the CRTC in the meantime ) .
For the past 18 months , it has been open secret that Rogers engages in packet shaping , conduct that limits the amount of available bandwidth for certain services such as peer - to - peer file sharing applications .
Rogers denied the practice at first , but effectively acknowledged it in late 2005 .
Net neutrality advocates regularly point to traffic shaping as a concern since they fear that Rogers could limit bandwidth to competing content or services .
In response to the packet shaping approach , many file sharing applications now employ encryption to make it difficult to detect the contents of data packets .
This has led to a technical " cat and mouse " game , with Rogers now one of the only ISPs in the world to simply degrade encrypted traffic .
This raises many issues but I would like to focus on just two in this posting .
First , not only is BitTorrent legal in Canada , but a growing percentage of the file swapping on BitTorrent clients is authorized .
This includes a substantial amount of open source software development , independent films , and other large files .
By reducing the bandwidth available for this application , Rogers is impairing the ability for Canadian artists to distribute their work and hampering the development of open source software in Canada .
Moreover , this could lead to a situation where Rogers ' own content is unfairly advantaged over competing content .
If that was not bad enough , there is now speculation at my own university that the packet shaping is making it very difficult for University of Ottawa users to use email applications from home .
The University of Ottawa uses a persistent SSL encryption technology for the thousands of professors and students who access their email from off - campus .
There is speculation that Rogers is mistakenly treating the email traffic as BitTorrent traffic , thereby creating noticeable slowdowns .
Indeed , I have been advised that the University computer help desk has received a steady stream of complaints from Rogers customers about off - campus email service .
If true , this form of network interference – implemented with virtually no transparency and now affecting basic Internet services such as email – demonstrates why a dedicated consumer complaints commission is a good start , but a place to complain is not enough .
The solution lies in creating mandatory net neutrality provisions to ensure that essential communications tools such as email are not surreptitiously degraded .
Nobody these days can live without China .
Many — perhaps too many , particularly in Congress — cannot live with it either .
Yesterday , National Public Radio reviewedA Year Without " Made in China " : One Family 's True Life Adventure in the Global Economy .
In it , journalist Sara Bongiorni chronicles how she and her family tried to live without buying anything shipped to the US from China .
You do not have to be Thomas Friedman to realize that these efforts quickly become futile showmanship .
They make the book an entertaining read , but they also made me ask a question not many in Congress are willing to pursue : why on earth would we want to spend a year , or even a day , without “ Made in China ” ?
Nobody ( these days ) can live without their barber .
Yet one rarely hears pulpit - pounding fulminations about the enormous bilateral trade deficit almost everyone in America

Bilateral trade deficits do not matter economically ; only overall trade deficits do ( and those only up to a point ) .
But politically , they seem to be all - important .
Perhaps Congress could spend more time boning up on the basic lessons of economics — and explaining them to their constituents — than looking for excuses to ratchet up protectionism .
The Afghan government is expressing concern over the growing number of women in Herat Province who have killed themselves through self - immolation .
Suraya Sobah Rang , Afghanistan 's deputy women 's affairs minister , says forced marriages and a continued lack of access to education is contributing to the growing despair among Herat 's women .
Prague , 1 March 2004 ( RFE / RL ) -- Gurcharan Virdee is no stranger to the hardships facing women around the world .
Virdee works with Medica Mondiale , a German - based international organization supporting women in war and crisis situations .
" Before she committed suicide , my sister always said she hoped she would never return to Afghanistan and experience the closed atmosphere of Herat .
"
The group is currently working on a program to provide shelter to women living in the western Afghan province of Herat -- an area where Taliban - era repressions are still very much in place .
There , Virdee met several women who had attempted to kill themselves through self - immolation .
The most tragic case , Virdee says , involved a young pregnant woman who survived despite suffering severe burns over 60 percent of her body .
However , the daily cited humanitarian aid workers who blamed the recently imposed restrictions on women by Heart 's governor Ismael Khan for self - burning .
" Harsh restrictions against women are the main cause behind women 's self - immolation , " Erada quoted Mrs. Gulcharan as saying .
No government official was available to comment on the issue .
" Despite government and humanitarian agencies ' efforts four more cases of self - immolation have been reported in Heart province , " Erada reported .
All the victims , the daily said , were young girls and the reason behind the motivation has yet to be known .
Four more ladies have immolated themselves in western Afghanistan over the last three days , a Kabul - based independent daily reported Sunday .
" Despite government and humanitarian agencies ' efforts four more cases of self - immolation have been reported in Heart province , " Erada reported .
All the victims , the daily said , were young girls and the reason behind the motivation has yet to be known .
However , the daily cited humanitarian aid workers who blamed the recently imposed restrictions on women by Heart 's governor Ismael Khan for self - burning .
" Harsh restrictions against women are the main cause behind women 's self - immolation , " Erada quoted Mrs. Gulcharan as saying .
No government official was available to comment on the issue .
Heart 's strongman Ismael Khan has banned lady singers on television , closed beauty parlor as well as women tailoring in hisown administered areas
A government delegation that traveled to Herat last week said at least 52 women in the province have killed themselves in recent months through self - immolation .
A Herat regional hospital last year recorded 160 cases of attempted suicide among girls and women between the ages of 12 and 50 .
But Virdee says the real number is probably much higher .
" The official statistics which the hospitals have are for the women who have actually come to the hospital , who can receive treatment .
There are many other cases of women burning themselves in the villages , in the city , in some of the provinces .
But these are women we can't give any estimates on , partly because they never reach the hospital or because they die in their villages or city .
These are the cases that never come to the attention of any public authorities , " Virdee said .
Afghan officials say poverty , forced marriages , and lack of access to education are the main reasons for suicide among women in Herat .
Domestic violence is also widespread .
" A lot of women are saying that their husbands do n't allow them to go and visit their families .
There are severe restrictions on their movement , and also there is violence towards them -- both physical and psychological -- and intimidation and isolation , " Virdee said .
During the five - year rule of the Taliban militia , women were not allowed to work or study .
They could not leave their homes without a male escort and were forced to wear the all - encompassing burqa .
Since the fall of the Taliban in late 2001 , women have once again been given the right to study and work .
But activists say women in many parts of Afghanistan -- including Herat , which is ruled with an iron fist by provincial governor and warlord Ismail Khan -- still face repression and harassment .
Virdee says the continued crackdown on women 's rights is contributing to the rise in self - immolation cases .
" The institutional repression of the women 's movement is also a big factor because women are not allowed to go on their own in taxi cars , they are sort of socially policed if they are talking to other men , they have to be in the burqa , they have restriction on freedom to work .
Just recently in Herat a women 's shop which was employing a lot of women was closed .
The driving school for women was also closed , " Virdee said .
Ahmad Bassir is a Herat - based correspondent for Radio Free Afghanistan .
He says women see no difference between their lives now and under the Taliban , and that desperation drives them to attempt suicide .
" They say we were hoping that after the fall of Taliban and after the transitional authority took power , the situation would improve for women , and there would be fewer restrictions .
But we see that there have been no changes , and women are using this very violent act [ of self - immolation ] to show their protest .
Most of these girls are literate , they are knowledgeable , and several of them are students , " Bassir said .
Bassir adds that the despair is especially strong among women who once lived as refugees in neighboring Iran , where women enjoy far greater rights .
Mina , a Herat resident , told Radio Free Afghanistan that her sister recently committed suicide after returning to Afghanistan from Iran .
" Before , we lived in Iran , and we were used to the life and environment there , which was very good .
But since we returned [ to Afghanistan ] , to Herat , there has been a lot of pressure on us .
Before she committed suicide , my sister always said she hoped she would never return to Afghanistan and experience the closed atmosphere of Herat .
She also had family problems .
She did n't like her fiance , but she was forced to get engaged to him , " Mina said .
The rise of self - immolation among women in Herat is causing concern among the authorities and citizens .
Herat Public
Television last year broadcast a program urging husbands to treat their wives with greater consideration .
Several NGOs are also trying to address the issue .
But Virdee says these are only small steps toward solving an endemic problem .
In many cases , she says , social restrictions continue to prevent women from seeking what little help is available .
" At the moment , although there are lots of different women 's NGOs and the department of women 's affairs all trying to raise some kind of public awareness about this issue , the problem is that women are so restricted that for them to even get out of the house , to be able to seek support is also sometimes very difficult , " Virdee said .
Nor is the problem restricted to Herat .
Female suicide through self - immolation is common in many parts of Afghanistan and throughout all of South Asia .
But statistics are incomplete and largely anecdotal .
There is a strong social stigma attached to suicide in Afghanistan , and many families are reluctant to seek help for victims of self - immolation or talk about the reasons behind the attempt .
Okay , the height of hypocrisy is anyone in the Bush administration challenging anything as “ highly misleading . ”
Liars do n’t have the standing to call anyone else a liar .
But , that does n’t prevent the Bush team from doing it anyway .
Because everyone in the Bush administration knows that the media will dutifully report their lies :
The White House issued a statement that criticized as “ highly misleading ” a front - page article in The New York Times on Monday that described the legislation as having “ broadly expanded the government ’s authority to eavesdrop on the international telephone calls and e-mail messages of American citizens without warrants . ”
The White House took issue not with the article ’s account of the new law ’s provisions , but instead with its characterization of the measure as having “ broadly ” strengthened the government ’s authority .
In a telephone briefing for reporters on Monday , officials said the administration had set out to resolve a “ narrow ” technical problem that had called into question whether intelligence officials needed to get a court warrant to intercept foreign - to - foreign communications that happened to pass through American telecommunication switches .
But in fact the legislation as enacted not only provides that no warrant is needed in such a situation but also goes further , in giving the administration discretion to eavesdrop on foreign communications that might involve Americans .
The officials who participated in the briefing spoke on condition of anonymity , saying only that doing so would allow them to talk more freely .
One more time we see just how boldly the Bush administration is willing to lie .
Some anonymous officials , probably including Stephen Hadley , had an a conference call to challenge the NY Times .
Eric Lichtblau , who wrote this article , basically discounts what the anonymous White House official said .
When he wrote “ But in fact …. ” , Lichtblau was intimating that what he heard was n’t based on facts .
In other words , the anonymous Bush sources lied and misled .
You wo n’t hear or read those actual words from any reporter — and the Bushies know that .
Instead , most of the White House press corps will dutifully report what they heard , even if they know it ’s a lie .
That ’s what these reporters always do .
Think Progress has the video of Glenn Greenwald discounting the Bush administration ’s position :
Today on C - SPAN ’s Washington Journal , former constitutional lawyer Glenn Greenwald , who blogs at Salon.com , debunked the White House ’s claim that the new FISA law requires “ court approval ” prior to spying on an “ individual located in the United States . ”
In fact , as Greenwald explained , the law now allows the government to “ listen to our conversations , read our e-mails , with no connection to terrorism , with no proof that anyone has ever done anything wrong ” — without judicial oversight .
I ’d trust Glenn Greenwald over any Bush administration official — anonymous or not — any day on any issue , but especially on this .
DIGG THIS
As everyone except for a dwindling band of Bush supporters now knows , the US is in a terrible situation in Iraq from which it cannot extract itself .
For Bush and Cheney , their own pride and delusion are more compelling than US casualties , the destruction of Iraq and its people , and the inflaming of sectarian strife and anti-American violence throughout the Middle East .
Congress is complicit in the great strategic blunder .
Republican flag - wavers led Americans like lemmings into the abyss .
The Democrats have already abandoned the electorate that gave them Control of Congress six months ago in the false hope that the Democrats would corral the White House Moron and lead America out of the abyss .
Like the Republicans , the Democrats serve the few special - interest groups that benefit , or believe that they benefit , from the war .
By now we all know who these groups are : the oil industry , the military - security complex , and the Israel Lobby , AIPAC .
This contrived war , based on lies and deception , serves no other interest .
There is no longer any question whatsoever , not a single sliver of doubt , that Americans were deceived into this disastrous war .
The President of the United States lied to the American people , as did the Vice President , the National Security Advisor , the Secretary of State , the Secretary of Defense , the Deputy Secretary of Defense , the Undersecretary of Defense , as did every neoconservative in the Bush administration , think tanks , and media .
The fact that the American people were lied to and deceived does not absolve them from blame .
The lie was transparent , the logic nonexistent , the true facts available and easy to discover .
America failed , because the American people failed .
The American people failed , because their self - righteousness and their hubris made them easy saps for deception .
Even now after five years of a disastrous policy , Republicans cannot accept the facts about the US invasion and failed occupation of Iraq .
At the recent " debate " between Republican presidential candidates in South Carolina , US Representative Ron Paul dared to tell the truth .
Rep .
Paul said that our difficulties in the Middle East are " blowback " from our government ’s determined attempts to exercise hegemony over the Middle East .
Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani , a person who sunk so low as to frame innocents while serving as US Attorney in order to boost his name recognition , played the self - righteous card to extreme .
How dare Ron Paul suggest that US policy toward Muslims has anything whatsoever to do with attacks on the US !
With all the outrage he could muster , Giuliani asked Rep.
Paul " to withdraw that comment and tell us that he did n’t really mean that . "
The thunderous applause from the Republican audience to Giuliani ’s put - down of the only honest person present underlines that the Republican Party is incapable of leadership to end a futile and lost war that under international standards is a war crime , an unprovoked naked aggression based entirely on lies , deception and a secret agenda .
At other times , the Republican audience applauded in support of torture and greeted John McCain ’s protest against the practice with cold silence .
In the opening years of the 21st century the Republicans have made it clear that they are willing to sacrifice the US Constitution and Bill of Rights in order to wage " war against terrorism . "
This willingness makes the Republican Party a more dangerous threat to Americans than Muslim terrorists .
Muslim terrorists cannot destroy our country ’s reputation , trash our civil liberties and wreck our system of accountable government , but the Republican Party has done a thorough job of it .
The Democratic Party is complicit in the Republican Party ’s crimes , but unlike the Republican electorate , the Democratic electorate does not support the occupation , the domestic police state measures , and the Bush administration ’s decision to send more combat troops to Iraq .
Although none of the current frontrunners for the Democratic presidential nomination are independent of the special interests that benefit from the war , it might still be possible for a Democrat to emerge who will represent the Democratic electorate instead of the special interests .
Republican support for Bush ’s contrived war against Iraq has diminished the Republican Party .
Intelligent and decent people have abandoned the party , which has morphed into a Brownshirt Party with which fewer people are willing to be associated .
The diminished Republican ranks will make it difficult for the party to steal any more elections .
If we are fortunate , Republicans will complete their self - destruction before they extinguish the Constitution and destroy America .

One find has been nicknamed " The Monster "
Enlarge Image
The 150 - million - year - old fossils were uncovered on the Arctic island chain of Svalbard - about halfway between the Norwegian mainland and the North Pole .
The finds belong to two groups of extinct marine reptiles - the plesiosaurs and the ichthyosaurs .
One skeleton has been nicknamed The Monster because of its enormous size .
These animals were the top predators living in what was then a relatively cool , deep sea .
These sites are very unusual .
To find that many individuals is a remarkable thing - that 's a bonanza
Dave Martill , University of Portsmouth
Palaeontologists from the University of Oslo's Natural History Museum discovered the fossils during fieldwork in a remote part of Spitsbergen , the largest island in the Svalbard archipelago .
Jorn Harald Hurum , co-director of the dig , said he was taken aback by the sheer density of fossil remains in one area .
" You can't walk for more than 100 m without finding a skeleton .
That 's amazing anywhere in the world , " he told BBC News .
Dr Dave Martill , a palaeontologist at the University of Portsmouth , UK , commented : " These sites are very unusual .
To find that many individuals is a remarkable thing - that 's a bonanza . "
The " Monster " may measure more than 8 m ( 26ft ) in length

Ichthyosaurs bore a passing resemblance to modern dolphins , but they used an upright tail fin to propel themselves through the water .
Plesiosaurs are said to fit descriptions of Scotland 's mythical Loch Ness monster .
They used two sets of powerful flippers for swimming and came in two varieties - one with a small head and very long neck , and another with a large head and short neck .
The short - necked varieties are known as pliosaurs .
The discovery of a gigantic pliosaur , nicknamed The Monster , was one of the most remarkable discoveries of the expedition .
Its skeleton has dinner - plate - sized neck vertebrae , and the lower jaw has teeth as big as bananas .
Tooth in the neck
The skeleton is not yet fully excavated , but its skull is about 3 m long , suggesting the body could be more than 8 m from the tip of its nose to its tail .
" What 's amazing here is that it looks like we have a complete skeleton .
No other complete pliosaur skeletons are known anywhere in the world , " said Dr Hurum .

In pictures
The fossil hoard comprises 21 long - necked plesiosaurs , six ichthyosaurs and one short - necked plesiosaur .
The bones were unearthed in fine - grained sedimentary rock called black shale .
" Everything we 're finding is articulated .
It 's not single bones here and there , and bits and pieces - these are complete skeletons , " said Dr Hurum .
After death , the carcasses came to rest in mud at the bottom of the deep ocean , where little or no oxygen was present .
Dr Hurum said an unusual chemistry of the mud could have been responsible for the remarkable preservation of the specimens : " Something happened with the chemistry that 's really good for bone preservation .
Some skeletons are pale white even though they 're in black shale - they look like ' roadkill ' . "
The marine reptiles found in the Norwegian archipelago are very similar to ones known from southern England .
Dr Hurum said the animals could have been living in the same ocean and he now plans to compare the Arctic finds with those from Britain .
The Svalbard excavation was led by Dr Hurum and Hans Arne Nakrem , also of Oslo 's Natural History Museum .
The museum plans to return to the field site in the summer of 2007 to resume excavations .

What is the difference between the bacteria around a deep - sea vent and those in the human body ?
Surprisingly little , according to a comparison of the genomes of bacteria from deep - sea vents with those of human and animal bacterial pathogens .
Their evolutionary relationship suggests that animal pathogens came from the deep .
Life on the ocean floor may have provided bacteria with the survival strategies to cope with life as pathogens , says Satoshi Nakagawa of the Japan Agency for Marine - Earth Science and Technology , Yokosuka , whose team carried out the analysis .
Deep - sea or hydrothermal vents spew superheated water , rich in chemicals , from volcanically active mid-ocean ridges .
Here , bacteria feeding on methane and sulphides support large communities of exotic animals .

The study found that vent bacteria frequently lose genes , develop new mutations , or acquire genes from evolutionarily distant sources .
That is an advantage when dealing with the steep chemical gradients and extreme temperature changes in these environments .
The ability to survive in an ever - changing environment is also useful for pathogens under attack from their host ’s immune system .
The team suggests that the bacteria initially lived with vent invertebrates before swapping that location for life as a pathogen .
Nakagawa says he does not know how the bacteria jumped from the deep sea to the human body “ The best answer might come from the fossil record , ” he says .

RALEIGH , N.C. , June 16 , 2007  -- Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong has been disbarred after being found guilty of a battery of ethics violations for his handling of the Duke Lacrosse investigation , a North Carolina Bar disciplinary committee announced Saturday evening .
" We are in unanimous agreement that there is no discipline short of disbarment that would be appropiate in this case , " said F. Lane Williamson , the committee 's chairman .
Before the panel announced its punishment , Nifong said he believed disbarment would be appropriate and that he planned to waive all rights to appeal the findings of the bar panel , his attorney David Freedman said in court Saturday afternoon .
" He hopes that in light of his accepting his punishment it will restore some of the confidence in the criminal justice system , " Freedman said .
" You have some semblance of relief when this is all over , regardless of the outcome . "
After announcing Nifong 's punishment , Williamson excoriated the disgraced prosecutor .
He said Nifong was driven to prosecute the Duke Lacrosse case out of " self - interest and self - deception . "
" Sometimes character is called upon ... and it is found wanting , " Williamson said .
" That is what happened to Mr. Nifong . "
The bar 's three - member disciplinary panel unanimously found Nifong guilty of fraud , dishonesty , deceit or misrepresentation ; of making false statements of material fact before a judge ; of making false statements of material fact before bar investigators , and of lying about withholding exculpatory DNA evidence , among other violations .
Nifong 's punishment could have ranged from a written reprimand to disbarment .
He already announced Friday his intention to resign as district attorney .
With the panel 's decision , the long saga of what was once known as the Duke Lacrosse rape scandal may be largely over , though a raft of civil lawsuits are expected .
Nifong 's conviction was widely anticipated as long - overdue justice for the three players who were indicted in spring 2006 on charges of rape , kidnapping , and sexual offense .
Last April , the three were cleared of all charges and declared innocent by the attorney general of North Carolina .
All three exonerated Duke Lacrosse players -- Reade Seligmann , David Evans and Collin Finnerty -- were in the courtroom Saturday with their families .
They listened intently as Nifong was found to have behaved unethically , but showed little emotion .
Later , as Nifong 's disbarment was announced , there was an air of relief and satisfaction among the lacrosse players and their families .
" They are relieved and thankful , " said Wade Smith , a veteran North Carolina attorney who represented the Finnertys .
" While it does n't take away the pain and it does n't change anything , it helps these three boys feel as though they can go on with their lives , " he said .
The three lacrosse players ' families are moving on .
David Evans found a new job in finance .
His first offer was revoked after his indictment .
Reade Seligmann will be attend Brown University this fall .
Collin Finnerty will make a decision shortly about where to start his junior year .
Moving on wo n't be as easy for Nifong .
Attorneys for the exonerated lacrosse players say they have more in store by way of legal action .
" I do n't think any of us are done with Mr. Nifong yet , " said Seligmann family lawyer Jim Cooney .
He announced plans to file a motion against Nifong in Durham County Superior Court within the week .
Brad Bannon , a lawyer for David Evans , said that motion would request that the court sanction Nifong with fines and contempt of court .
Nifong could also face civil lawsuits ; Bannon 's partner Joe Cheshire said on Friday that he expects " extensive civil action . "
Lawyers are also pushing for an independent federal investigation into Nifong 's conduct .
The mood at the trial Saturday was a remarkable reversal of the courtroom atmosphere in the early days of the case .
Then , the parents of the players sat wide - eyed and stone - faced , occasionally shedding a tear , while the now - disgraced prosecutor moved through the court room smiling and navigated the camera crews outside in the hallway with a grin on his face .
Saturday , Nifong and his wife wept during a recess and held each other , clearly shaken , while the players and their families smiled and chatted with easily with one another .
As the first witness to testify in the penalty phase , David Evans Sr. , whose son Dave was charged , described being " floored " when he heard Nifong tell the media that the players were not cooperating fully with the investigation .
He described how his family learned of his son's indictment on Dave 's graduation day , and testified that his son's job offer from the Wall Street firm J.P. Morgan was withdrawn after the charges were brought .
He said he recently " Googled " the phrases " Dave Evans " and " Duke Lacrosse , " and that the search turned up more than five million hits .
Evans said his son and the other players " stepped up to the plate ' ' and cooperated fully with investigators .
He said that Nifong has now acknowledged he " crossed the line ' ' of ethical conduct and " maligned an entire team -- 47 players , their parents , their grandparents . ''
David Evans Jr.'s grandfather on his mother 's side died of a heart attack last August before the charges were dropped , Evans Sr. said .
" It was very very hard on him , '' Evans Sr. testified .
" He took it very , very hard .
He could n't understand .
He was consumed with the case .
As it moved along he would call several times a day .
He 'd say , ' Why is this district attorney going forward ?
Look at all this information ?
The accuser is not credible .
Why is n't the system working ?'
" Our great regret is that [ the grandfather ] died before the system worked , " Evans Sr. said , " before he was found innocent . "
In a statement that seemed to both echo and mock Nifong 's tearful claim Friday that the case will be associated with him until he goes to his grave , David Evans Sr. told the court that his son , too , " believes that when he dies , people will say he was one of the three Duke lacrosse players who was accused of rape . "
Next up was Colin Finnerty 's mother Mary Ellen Finnerty , who said that after 26 years as a parent , learning her son was indicted for rape and kidnapping was " the hardest moment as a mother I have ever had . "
" We were in the fight of our lives , '' she said .
" We now had to fight to save our son 's life .
From that day on that was our job as parents .
How do you explain to a 10 - year - old that her brother has been indicted for rape ? '' she asked rhetorically .
When her son's name was finally cleared in the wake of an investigation by North Carolina State Attorney General Roy Cooper , " it was an answer to all our prayers , " she said .
" Nobody can give the families back the 14 months we 've gone through , '' she said , and began to cry .
" Laying in bed at night and saying that they could go to jail for 30 years for a crime they did n't do . "
During closing arguments Friday , attorney Doug Brocker of the North Carolina State Bar said Nifong engaged in a " systematic abuse of prosecutorial power and discretion in the Duke Lacrosse case . "
" Mr. Nifong did not act as a minister of justice , but as a minister of injustice , " Brocker added .
Brocker argued that the central motive for Nifong 's decision to prosecute the case was winning a tightly contested election for district attorney .
Just after the first indictments in the case , Nifong won a May 2 Democratic primary by a margin of 3 percent .
In his closing statements , Nifong 's attorney Dudley Witt admitted that Nifong committed " egregious mistakes " but said his " was not intentional conduct . "
Witt also denied Nifong 's use of the case to further any political agenda .
He specifically cited Nifong 's lack of experience in dealing with the media and argued that Nifong did n't realize until December 2006 that the withheld DNA was significant to the case .
Ann Fawcett , a friend of the Nifong family who attended the trial , called him " an honorable man of great integrity . "
Nifong 's nearly - 30 - year career as a prosecutor ended over the Duke Lacrosse case .
During his testimony Friday , Nifong tearfully announced that whatever the bar 's choice of punishment he intended to step down as Durham County district attorney .
" My presence as the district attorney in Durham is not furthering the cause of justice , " Nifong said .
" It is not fair for the people in my community to be represented by someone who is not held in high esteem by either the members of the community or members of the profession . "
Nifong also apologized to the three indicted lacrosse players and their families .
But defense attorney Cheshire dismissed Nifong 's contrition as contrived and insincere .
Nifong led the prosecution of three Duke Lacrosse players for rape and sexual assault .
The case began in March 2006 when woman hired to strip at a team party accused three players of attacking her in a bathroom .
In the months that followed , the case fell apart , riddled by a lack of evidence and an accuser who changed her story repeatedly .
From the early days of the case , Nifong was widely criticized for his handling of the matter .
On Friday , Nifong admitted to many mistakes .
" I think clearly some of the statements I made were improper , " Nifong said , admitting that his comments about the case violated the rules of professional conduct .
" I take responsibility for the things I have done in this case . "
Nifong also admitted that he should have given defense attorneys all available DNA evidence months earlier than he did .
He added that despite her changing story , Nifong never pushed the accuser to explain the inconsistencies in her version of events .
By getting disbarred , Nifong lost not just his law license , but his livelihood .
Unable to practice law , it 's unclear what kind of work , if any , Nifong will do next .
But wherever he goes , Nifong expects the words " Duke Lacrosse " will follow him .
" I will go to my grave being associated with this case , " said Nifong .
" That 's okay .
... I took the responsibility on myself . "
I ’ve always liked Python .
I started using it back in 2003 , and it ’s always been my first choice when writing stuff like sysadmin scripts , built tasks , RSS feed readers , that kind of thing .
However , my bread and butter is web development , and Python never had a compelling story for me in that field .
Zope / Plone is horrendously bloated and complex ( the infamous Z - shaped learning curve ) , Django is nice and well thought out , but I ’ve found it more for developing dynamic web sites ; it gets in the way too much for complex web apps .
Turbogears started out well , but seems broken and lacking in direction these days .
Then we have a number of smaller , or older , frameworks – web.py , Quixote , snakelets , WebWare … either too small a developer base , not actively developed , or just not what I ’m looking for .
So , for web development , I ’ve used J( 2 ) EE , PHP and more recently , Rails .
The latter has been the most fun , and Ruby is a nice language to work with .
However , despite the deluge of Ruby hype and praise ( much of it justified ) I still prefer Python .
Maybe it just fits my brain better , maybe it ’s the scope and size of the libraries .
I find Ruby harder to understand and debug , perhaps because of its Perlish syntax and metaprogramming tricks .
This is not meant as flamebait : I just find Python easier for getting things done .
I can think better in Python ; I find the process harder in Ruby , and often find there ’s always a “ better ” way of doing it .
As with Perl , I feel that while I may be a competent Ruby programmer , I ’ll never be a Ruby guru ( I think that may be the case of many Rails developers : they use Rails and its plugins without really needing to understand Ruby at any deeper level , thanks to Rails ’ DSLs ) .
However , the lack of a compelling framework , which would give me the same kind of productivity as Rails , has held me back from using Python for serious web projects .
Until I found Pylons .
Unlike Rails and Django , Pylons is not marketed in any way ; it is strictly minimalist , a “ hacker ’s framework ” .
This will not appeal to those who turn to Rails or Django for an out of the box solution with their decisions made for them ( and nothing wrong with that , if you just want to get your project out the door ) , but it appeals to someone who enjoys building something just the way they want it , and dislikes “ opinionated ” frameworks that like to think they always know better .
Superficially , Pylons resembles Rails : it follows the same MVC pattern , supports AJAX , and uses Routes and helpers .
That ’s where the similarity ends .
For starters , there ’s no ActiveRecord : you provide your own model ; most Pylons developers go with SQLAlchemy , possibly one of the finest ORMs in any language .
Further , rather than just ERB on the menu , you can choose your own template engine .
Myghty is the current default , but this is soon to be replaced with the awesome Mako , and you can use for example Genshi or Kid if you prefer something more XML - based , or Jinja if you like Django ’s minimalist templates .
The most interesting thing about Pylons however is that it runs on Paste and WSGI , the Python web server gateway standard .
You can run your Pylons apps on mod_python , FastCGI , SCGI , whatever you want , and build your own custom frameworks with Paste templates .
I ca n’t remember where I saw the quote , but David Heinemeier Hansson , the leading Rails developer , once compared Rails to a Ferrari .
Well , a Ferrari is nice ( and maybe not the best comparison , considering the performance of Ruby ) but Pylons + SQLAlchemy +
Mako is more like James Bond ’s Aston Martin , customized by Q .
It just looks like a normal car but comes with ejector seats , bulletproof glass and tons of gadgets .
I know which one I ’d like to drive .
Foreclosure activity rises dramatically / Bay Area defaults , auctions , repossessions nearly triple ; nationwide notices are up 87 %
Foreclosures continued to rise throughout the country , the state and the Bay Area in June , according to a report to be released today .
Nationally , 164,644 foreclosure notices were filed in June , up 87 percent from June of last year , said RealtyTrac.com , an online marketplace for foreclosure properties .
In the Bay Area , the number of foreclosure notices was 5,018 , almost triple the 1,780 in June 2006 .
" The big variable driving the numbers is the much higher - than - anticipated rate of default of subprime loans , " said Rick Sharga , vice president of RealtyTrac in Irvine .
Subprime loans , which grew in popularity in the past two years , are loans to people with tarnished credit , as well as loans for 100 percent financing .
" The excessive and lax lending practices of the past couple of years of the real estate boom are coming home to roost , " Sharga said .
Such notices encompass three stages of foreclosure : default notices , which occur after a homeowner has missed payments ; notices of trustee sales , which mean a foreclosure auction has been scheduled ; and bank repossession , which means the property has reverted to the lender .
Not all default notices result in foreclosures , but they are an early warning sign that homeowners are in trouble .
In the nine - county Bay Area , 3,383 households received default notices in June , more than double the 1,460 in June 2006 .
Alameda and Contra Costa had the highest number , with slightly more than 1,000 such notices each , followed by Solano with 557 default notices .
Notices of trustee sales in the nine counties hit 1,011 in June , more than triple the 281 filed the previous June .
Again , Alameda , Contra Costa and Solano counties had the most such notices .
There were 624 Bay Area bank repossessions in June , a dramatic increase from 39 the previous June .
Comparing the total of all three types of foreclosure notices with each county 's number of households showed that Solano had the most foreclosure activity relative to its size , with 1 foreclosure notice for every 149 households .
Contra Costa County had 1 foreclosure notice for every 198 households , while Alameda County had 1 notice for every 440 households .
At the other end of the spectrum , Marin County had 1 foreclosure notice for every 2,625 households , while San Francisco had 1 such notice for every 2,179 households .
Sharga said foreclosure activity this year has accelerated much faster than RealtyTrac anticipated .
While it originally forecast that the nation would see about 1.4 million to 1.5 million foreclosure notices in 2007 , " Right now , if we run at a flat rate , it will be 1.8 million filings and 2 million is n't out of the question , " he said .
California had the second - highest foreclosure rate in the country after Nevada , with 1 filing for every 315 households .
State residents received 27,483 default notices and 7,082 notices of trustee sales , and had 4,236 homes repossessed by banks .
California also had the dubious distinction of accounting for six of the nation 's top 10 metropolitan areas with the most foreclosure activity per number of households .
Stockton , Merced , Modesto and Riverside - San Bernardino were Nos. 1 through 4 on the list .
Vallejo - Fairfield was No. 7 and Sacramento was No. 8 . Las Vegas was No. 5 ; Greeley , Colo. , was No. 6 ; Detroit was No. 9 and Miami was No. 10 .
While not all notices of default result in a foreclosure , Sharga said their rapid rise can still have a material effect on the real estate market .
As the number of properties in such a situation increases , banks are more likely to allow the homes to be sold at a loss in a process called a short sale , or to be sold in a foreclosure auction , also at a lower value .
That in turn will depress values of nearby homes .
" That has an insidious effect across the state , " Sharga said .
If one thinks of default notices as the canary in the coal mine , " The canary has wheezed and gasped and is probably being carried out right now , " he said .
of the top 10 metro areas with the most foreclosure activity were in California .

624
Number of Bay Area bank repossessions June 2007 .

Number of California homes per foreclosure filing , second in the nation .
87 %
Increase in foreclosure filings nationally in the past year .
Foreclosure activity rises
The Bay Area saw a significant increase in foreclosure notices in June compared with June 2006 .
The types of activity tracked are notices of default , which indicate that a homeowner is behind on the mortgage ; notices of trustee sale , which indicate that a bank has scheduled a foreclosure auction ; and REOs , or real estate owned by banks , which indicate that a house has been repossessed by the lender .

The ‘ Monster Study ’ on Stuttering
The so - called ‘ Monster Study ’ on children ’s stuttering qualifies for this series on weird psychology on three grounds .
First it had extremely shaky ( practically non-existent ) ethical standards .
Second its results were never published for fear it would be likened to experiments carried out by the Nazis ( Rothwell , 2003 ) .
Finally , in historical context , its findings were dramatic .
Challenging theories of stuttering
Dr. Wendell Johnson , a speech pathologist , wanted to show that the prevailing theories about the causes of stuttering were wrong .
During the 1930s it was thought that stuttering had an organic or genetic cause .
This meant you were born a stutterer ( or not ) and little could be done .
Dr Johnson had different ideas .
Instead he thought the labelling of children as stutterers could actually make them worse , and in some cases cause ‘ normal ’ children to start stuttering .
To prove his point , he suggested an experiment which has since become known as the ‘ Monster Study ’ .
Power of labelling
Twenty - two young orphans were recruited to participate in the experiment .
They were then divided into two groups .
The first were labelled ‘ normal speakers ’ and the second ‘ stutterers ’ .
Crucially only half of the group labelled stutterers did actually show signs of stuttering .
During the course of the experiment , the normal speakers were given positive encouragement but it was the treatment of the other group that has made the experiment notorious .
The group labelled stutterers were made more self - conscious about stuttering .
They were lectured about stuttering and told to take extra care not to repeat words .
Other teachers and staff at the orphanage were even unknowingly recruited to reinforce the label as the researchers told them the whole group were stutterers .
Dramatic results
Of the six ‘ normal ’ children in the stuttering group , five began stuttering after the negative therapy .
Of the five children who had stuttered before their ‘ therapy ’ , three became worse .
In comparison , only one of the children in the group labelled ‘ normal ’ had greater speech problems after the study .
Realising the power of their experiment , the researchers tried to undo the damage they had done , but to no avail .
It seemed the effects of labelling the children stutterers was permanent .
This is something the orphans labelled stutterers have had to cope with for the rest of their lives .
Clearly this research raises a number of major ethical concerns .
Case for the defence
The researchers had the best of intentions – they were motivated to help stutterers of all ages .
Indeed Dr. Wendell Johnson was himself a severe stutterer .
The findings supported Dr Johnson ’s theory and contributed to new and successful ways of treating people with stutters .
Case for the prosecution
Despite the researcher ’s good intentions , the study fails on any number of ethical dimensions .
The children were never told they had been involved in a study , until it was revealed by a newspaper over 60 years later .
The teachers and administrators of the orphanage were also misled about the purpose of the study .
This deception was never explained to them .
The study was never published .
Because of this some argue the damage inflicted on the children was even more unethical .
All studies must balance the potential risks against the potential benefits .
Without publication and dissemination through the academic community , this study ’s benefits are reduced .
The final word
This is left to the University of Iowa , where Dr Johnson was working at the time of the experiment .
In 2001 , 36 years after his death , they issued a formal apology , calling the experiment both regrettable and indefensible ( Rothwell , 2003 ) .
This judgement is impossible to argue with .
UPDATE : Six participants in this study have just won a £ 500,000 settlement against the University of Iowa .

I encountered an interesting problem on reddit a few days ago which can be paraphrased as follows :
After reading the discussion about implementing a brute - force algorithm to solve the problem and spending a futile half - hour or so trying my hand at find a better way , someone noticed that the problem was an instance of Pell 's equation which is known to have an elegant and fast solution ; indeed , he posted a one - liner in Mathematica solving the given problem .
However , I wanted to try coding up the solution myself as the Mathematica solution , while succinct , is n't very enlightening since the heavy lifting is already done by a built - in function and an arbitrary constant was used for this particular instance of Pell 's equation .
Pell 's equation is simply the Diophantine equation \ ( x ^2 - dy ^2 = 1\ ) for a given \ ( d\ ) [ 1 ] ; being Diophantine means that all variables involved take on only integer values .
( In our original problem , \ ( d\ ) is 1597 and we are asked for \( y ^ 2 \ ) . )
The solution involves finding the continued fraction expansion of \( \sqrt{d}\ ) , finding the first convergent of the expansion that satisfies Pell 's equation , and then generating all other solutions from that fundamental solution .
We rule out the trivial solution \ ( x = 1\ ) , \(y = 0 \ ) which also implies that if \ ( d\ ) is a perfect square then there is no solution .
A continued fraction is an expression of the form : \[ x = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \ cfrac{1}{\ddots \, }}}} \ ] where all \ ( a_i\ ) are integers and all but the first one are positive .
The standard math notation for continued fractions is quite unwieldy so from now on we 'll use \( \left \langle a_0 ; a_1 , a_2 , \dotsc \right \rangle\ ) instead of the above .
The continued fraction expansion of a number is ( mostly ) unique .
The continued fraction expansion of a rational number is finite .
The continued fraction expansion of a irrational number is infinite .
A quadratic surd is a number of the form \( \frac{a + \ sqrt{b}}{c}\ ) where \ ( a\ ) , \ ( b\ ) , and \( c\ ) are integers .
Except maybe for the first term , the continued fraction expansion of a quadratic surd is periodic ; that is , it repeats forever after a certain number of terms .
This applies in particular to the square root of an integer .
Truncating an infinite continued fraction to get a finite continued fraction gives ( in some sense ) an optimal rational approximation to the irrational number represented by the infinite continued fraction .
The theory of continued fractions is a rich and beautiful one but for now we 'll just state a few facts :
sqrt_continued_fraction n = [ a_i | ( _ , _ , a_i ) <- mdas ] where mdas = iterate get_next_triplet ( m_0 , d_0 , a_0 ) m_0 = 0 d_0 = 1 a_0 = truncate $ sqrt $ fromIntegral n get_next_triplet ( m_i , d_i , a_i ) = ( m_j , d_j , a_j ) where m_j = d_i * a_i - m_i d_j = ( n - m_j * m_j ) `div` d_i a_j = ( a_0 + m_j ) `div` d_j and here are some examples : Prelude Main > take 20 $ sqrt_continued_fraction 2 [ 1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 ] Prelude Main > take 20 $ sqrt_continued_fraction 103 [ 10,6,1,2,1,1,9,1,1,2,1,6,20,6,1,2,1,1,9,1 ]
Prelude Main > take 20 $ sqrt_continued_fraction 36 [ 6,*** Exception : divide by zero Given a quadratic surd it is fairly easy to manipulate it into the form \( a + \ frac{1}{q}\ ) where \( q\ ) is another quadratic surd .
This fact can be used to come up with an algorithm to find the continued fraction expansion of a square root .
Wikipedia explains it pretty well so I wo n't go over it , but here is my Haskell implementation : and here are some examples :
( Note that we 're assuming that we wo n't be called with a perfect square .
Also , do you notice anything interesting about the periodic portion of the continued fractions , particularly of \( \sqrt{103} \ ) ? )
The first line takes a list of triplets and forms a list of all third elements , which is what we 're interested in .
( The other two elements of the triplet are auxiliary variables used by the algorithm . )
iterate is a function which takes in another function f , an initial variable x , and returns the infinite list [ x , f( x ) , f( f ( x ) ) , f( f( f( x ) ) ) , ... ] .
is a function which takes in another function , an initial variable , and returns the infinite list .
Note that Haskell uses lazy evaluation and so this function does not take an infinite amount of time to run ; all its elements are evaluated ( and memoized ) only when needed .
The rest of the function is a straightforward representation of the meat of the algorithm described in the above Wikipedia entry .
For those who are unfamiliar with Haskell , here 's a quick list of key facts :
It may not be clear what \( \sqrt{d}\ ) and its continued fraction expansion has to do with solving Pell 's equation .
However , notice that if \ ( x\ ) and \ ( y\ ) solve Pell 's equation then manipulating Pell 's equation to get \( \sqrt{d}\ ) on one side reveals that \( \frac{x}{y}\ ) is a good approximation of \( \sqrt{n}\ ) .
In fact , it is so good that you can prove that \( \frac{x}{y}\ ) must come from truncating the continued fraction expansion of \( \sqrt{d}\ ) .
This leads us to the following : if you have an infinite continued fraction \( \left \langle a_0 ; a_1 , a_2 , \ dotsc \right \rangle\ ) you can truncate it into a finite continued fraction \( \left \langle a_0 ; a_1 , a_2 , \dotsc , a_i \right \rangle\ ) and simplify it into the rational number \( \frac{p_i}{q_i}\ ) .
The sequence \( \frac{p_0}{q_0} , \ frac{p_1}{q_1} , \ frac{p_2}{q_2} , \dotsc\ ) forms the convergents of \( \left \langle a_0 ; a_1 , a_2 , \ dotsc \right \rangle\ ) and converges to its represented irrational number .
get_convergents ( a_0 : a_1 : as ) = pqs where pqs = ( p_0 , q_0 ) : ( p_1 , q_1 ) : zipWith3 get_next_convergent pqs ( tail pqs ) as p_0 = a_0 q_0 = 1 p_1 = a_1 * a_0 + 1 q_1 = a_1 get_next_convergent ( p_i , q_i ) ( p_j , q_j ) a_k = ( p_k , q_k ) where p_k = a_k * p_j + p_i q_k = a_k * q_j + q_i and some more examples : Prelude Main > take 8 $ get_convergents $ sqrt_continued_fraction 2 [ ( 1,1 ) , ( 3,2 ) , ( 7,5 ) , ( 17,12 ) , ( 41,29 ) , ( 99,70 ) , ( 239,169 ) , ( 577,408 ) ]

It turns out you can calculate \ ( p_{i+1}\ ) and \ ( q_{i+1}\ ) efficiently from \ ( p_i\ ) , \( q_i\ ) , \ ( p_{i - 1}\ ) , \( q_{i - 1}\ ) , and \ ( a_{i+1} \ ) using the fundamental recurrence formulas ( which can be proved by induction ) .
Here is my Haskell implementation : and some more examples :
The expression a : as forms a new list from the element a and the existing list as ( equivalent to cons in Lisp ) .
forms a new list from the element and the existing list ( equivalent to in Lisp ) .
zipWith3 is a function that takes in a function f , three lists a , b , and c of the same ( possibly infinite ) length n , and forms the new list [ f ( a [ 0 ] , b[0 ] , c [ 0 ] ) , f ( a [ 1 ] , b[ 1 ] , c [ 1 ] ) , ... , f ( a [ n ] , b[n ] , c[n ] ) ] .
is a function that takes in a function , three lists , , and of the same ( possibly infinite ) length , and forms the new list .
Note that the result of zipWith3 is part of the variable pqs which itself appears ( twice ! ) in the arguments to zipWith3 .
This is a Haskell idiom and reflects the fact that the recurrence formulas define a convergent in terms of its two previous convergents .
A simpler example ( using the Fibonacci sequence ) can be found in the Wikipedia entry for lazy evaluation .

Haskell has built - in data types for integers of arbitrary size which is necessary as the numerators and denominators of the convergents get large quickly .
In fact , Haskell has built - in data types for rational numbers ( represented as fractions ) but it does n't help us much here .
Here are a few more quick facts to help those unfamiliar with Haskell :
get_pell_fundamental_solution n = head $ solutions where solutions = [ ( p , q ) | ( p , q ) <- convergents , p * p - n * q * q == 1 ] convergents = get_convergents $ sqrt_continued_fraction n
Note the use of the Haskell 's Since we are guaranteed that some convergent eventually satisfies Pell 's equation , we can write a simple function to generate all convergents , test each one to see if it satisfies Pell 's equation , and return the first one we see .
Here is the Haskell implementation : Note the use of the Haskell 's list comprehension syntax , similar to Python , which expresses what I just described in a matter reminiscent of set notation .
module Main where import System ( getArgs ) sqrt_continued_fraction :: ( Integral a ) => a -> [ a ] {- ... the sqrt_continued_fraction function explained above ... -} get_convergents :: ( Integral a ) = > [ a ] -> [ ( a , a ) ] {- ... the get_convergents function explained above ... -} get_pell_fundamental_solution :: ( Integral a ) => a -> ( a , a ) {- ... the get_pell_fundamental_solution function explained above ... -} main :: IO ( ) main = do args <- System.getArgs let d = ( read $ head $ args :: Integer ) ( p , q ) = get_pell_fundamental_solution d in putStr $ " d = " ++ ( show d ) ++ "
" ++ " p = " ++ ( show p ) ++ "
" ++ " q = " ++ ( show q ) ++ "
" ++ " p^2 - d * q^2 == 1
" and here is it in action : $ ./solve_pell 1597 d = 1597 p = 519711527755463096224266385375638449943026746249 q = 13004986088790772250309504643908671520836229100 p^2 - d * q^2 == 1
Here is the full Haskell program designed so its output may be conveniently piped to bc for verification : and here is it in action :
The solution to the original problem is therefore :
5054112910466227478111803017176109047976100000000 .
Now that we 've found a method to get a solution , the question remains as to whether it 's the only one .
In fact it is not , but it is the minimal one , and all other solutions ( of which there are an infinite number ) can be generated from this fundamental one with a simple recurrence relation as described on the Wikipedia article .
My program above can be easily extended to generate all solutions instead of just the fundamental one ( I 'll leave it to the reader as an exercise ) .
One remaining question is the efficiency of this algorithm .
For simplicity , let 's neglect the cost of the arbitrary - precision arithmetic involved and assume that the incremental cost of generating each term of the continued fraction expansion and the convergents is constant .
Then the main cost is just how many convergents we have to generate before we find one that satisfies Pell 's equation .
In fact , it turns out that this depends on the length of the period of the continued fraction expansion of \( \sqrt{d}\ ) , which has a rough upper bound of \ ( O ( \ln ( d \ sqrt{d} ) ) \ ) .
Therefore , the cost of solving Pell 's equation ( in terms of how many convergents to generate ) for a given \ ( n\ ) - digit number is \ ( O( n 2^ { n / 2} ) \ ) .
This is pretty expensive already , although it 's still much better than brute - force search ( which is on the order of exponentiating the above expression ) .
Can we do better ?
Well , sort of ; it turns out the length of the answer is of the same order as the expression above , so any algorithm that explicitly outputs a solution necessarily takes that long .
However , if you can somehow factor \ ( d\ ) into \(s d'\ ) , where \( s\ ) is a perfect square and \ ( d'\ ) is squarefree ( i.e. , not divisible by any perfect square ) , then you can solve Pell 's equation for the smaller number \ ( d'\ ) and output the solution for \ ( d'\ ) as the smaller fundamental solution and an expression raised to a certain power involving it .
Note that in general this involves factoring \ ( d\ ) , another hard problem , but for which there exists tons of prior work .
An interested reader can peruse the papers by Lenstra and Vardi for more details .
As a final note , one of the things I really like about number theory is that investigating such a simple program can lead you down surprising avenues of mathematics and computational theory .
In fact , I 've had to omit a lot of things I had planned to say to avoid growing this entry to be longer than it already is .
Hopefully , this entry helps someone else learn more about this interesting corner of number theory .

On barren desert in Saudi Arabia , British engineers and scientists are to build a stately pleasure dome five times bigger than Cornwall 's Eden Project .
The vast , covered ' garden of ages ' will re-create the 400 - million - year - old history of our planet 's plants , trees and flowers .
The dome - near Riyadh , the capital - will cover more than 24 acres and become the world 's largest indoor garden .
Plants from key botanical epochs will be grown and displayed in seven sections inside two interlocking , crescent - shaped enclosures .
The project - run on renewable energy and using a minimum of water - is intended to revitalise tourism .
' Visitors will journey through time , from the Devonian period 410 million years ago , through eras like the Carboniferous to the Pliocene and the present day , ' said the dome 's designer , Nick Sweet of the UK architects Barton Willmore .
' There will even be a Jurassic Park , but without dinosaurs . '
' Essentially , we are going to take a single piece of land and show how it has been transformed as plants have evolved and diversified throughout Earth 's history .
And some of those changes have been dramatic .
This part of Saudi Arabia may be parched and burning hot today - the temperature was 54C last week - but there were times when rivers flowed and cool forests flourished here .
Visitors will be able to experience all of that .'
A key aim of the King Abdullah International Gardens is to give Riyadh a sense of cultural gravitas , its backers claim .
Although one of the world 's principal cities , Riyadh lacks museums and other centres .
It is well supplied with shops for the lavishly rich and little else .
Designing such an ambitiious venture has not been easy , however .
Keeping the gardens ' various eco-systems cool in the blistering Saudi summer heat has been a major headache .
' We can not just stick in a huge air conditioner to pump in vast amounts of cold air , ' Sweet said .
' The running costs would be huge and it would send out the wrong ecological message .
Instead we have built especially high domes .
At some points , they will reach more than 120 ft .
Hot air will rise to the top and trap cool air at the bottom .
We will then need relatively modest amounts of air - conditioning to cool the gardens at ground level . '
Each of the seven environments inside the £ 100 m building , which will become the world 's largest Teflon construction , will be powered by renewable sources , mainly solar and wind , while water will be stored in underground reservoirs beneath the domes .
' Visitors will start their floral time walk at the Devonian period 410 million years ago , ' said Dr Paul Kenrick , a paleobotanist at the Natural History Museum , London , and the project 's scientific adviser .
' In those days , no plants grew above knee height .
So we will use mosses and lichens and grow them on rocks round huge artificial geysers ..'
After that , said Kenrick , visitors will experience the Carboniferous period , the Jurassic Park consisting of light woods of coniferous trees ; the Cretaceous era , when the first flowers flourished ; the Zenozoic age when the first grasses appeared ; and finally the Pliocene epoch , with riverbeds and light woodland .
' The last section is simple , ' he said .
' That will be called the garden of choices .
Visitors will see how our planet might end up , burnt and scorched or cool and moist , depending on the way we respond to the challenge of climate change . '

One Russian blogger have met Gregory Perelman , Russian mathematician who refused to get $ 1,000,000 Field ’s prize some months ago .
He did n’t give any interviews and refused to meet anybody .
And here he is , in St. Petersburg subway ( his native city ) .
According to the comment by the guy who made photos : “ He looks like totally homeless trash , he had a very big nail on one of his fingers and was constantly touching with it his mouth .
I was amazed why nobody recognized him , I was making a photos with my camphone trying not to attract his attention .
Later , when I told my friends that I met Perelman in the subway many just asked “ Who is he ? ” so I understood why nobody recognized him . ”

Kevin Ham built a $ 300 million web company in Vancouver you ’ve probably never heard of .
You are likely familiar with his work as you drop vowels from the domain names of your favorite web startups such as Flickr or Tumblr , or try selecting a name for your new company or product .
Kevin
Ham built a domain name empire named Agoga , cutting exclusive deals with local registrars and national governments , attracting over 30 million unique visitors a month according to an article by Paul Sloan in the June issue Business 2.0 magazine .
Think of a name , any name , and it ’s probably already registered as a .com domain .
Most sites blocking your path to a memorable and descriptive names are owned by domain squatters , businesses buying domain names in bulk and running targeted advertisements from Google and Yahoo !.
Domain names are not only memorable , they influence a site ’s ranking in search engines , since a site URL containing the phrase “ kittens ” has a higher possible correlation to kitten content than a URL without the keyword match .
Kevin Ham owns over 300,000 domains , virtual real estate in our online lives .
He assembled the portfolio over many years of work , taking advantage of changing technologies , business environments , and legal terms .
He is just one example in a global domain industry collecting millions of dollars a year prospecting new names .
Paying off registrars
Each top - level domain on the Internet owns one or more root nodes defining the availability and location of sites such as MySpace or eBay .
Ham wrote automated programs in the late 1990s that could download a listing of all registered domain names , a root zone file , on a daily basis , comparing multiple versions to identify expiring domains of value .
In the beginning Ham ran the programs on a few desktop machines in his office , but he quickly stepped up his operations to stay ahead of competitors .
Ham worked out exclusive deals with domain registrars , snapping up expiring domain names on a direct connection from the registrar ’s computers into the VeriSign root nodes at the heart of the U.S. Internet .
He paid 10 - times the typical domain registration fee in exchange for such privileged access to the domain name ecosystem .
Ham was able to snap up over 10,000 domains in late 2000 , just months after imploding Internet brands vacated their offices and their web brands .
Today registrars directly engage in the game of expiring domains , letting customers set triggers and alerts for a premium price or directing them to a domain resale marketplace .
The Money
WeddingShoes.com is one of Han ’s many sites setup to serve visitors relevant ads from Yahoo .
The site offers related keywords , often at higher CPC payouts , for site visitors who would like more advertisements .
A simple site targeting wedding shoes earns Han ’s business about $ 9,100 a year .
Not bad for a $ 8 domain purchase and what he reports and about $ 7 in maintenance costs per year .
Free trial periods
Each top - level domain sets its own terms and conditions for ownership , sometimes requiring a company to operate within the borders of the assigned country , or settling conflict resolution terms .
Each top - level domain often has a money back guarantee on purchased domain names varying from 5 to 30 days .
Domain name prospectors purchase thousands of domains at a time , run advertisements on each site , and get their money back on the worst performers when their trial period has ended .
Buy out an entire country
I often joke about the top - level domains assigned to small islands in the South Pacific which exist for a few hours each day at low tide .
The 12,000 inhabitants of Tuvalu , a member of the British Commonwealth , earn $ 4.2 million every year by leasing the .tv top - level domain .
That ’s $ 348 a year per resident in exchange for helping videobloggers find a more desirable web address .
Ham took things one step further , negotiating with the country of Cameroon for rights to the .cm top - level domain .
A special deal with the Cameroon government gives gives Agoga control of any wildcard domains , domains requested by a web browser but not yet registered .
It ’s a gold mine attracting 8 million unique visitors per month to pages full of ads served by Yahoo .
Cameroon currently has about 167,000 online users spread across 39 ISPs according to the CIA World Fact Book .
Leasing the unused space for .com typos makes good business sense for the local government .
Domain acquisition companies are already pursuing similar deals in Colombia and Oman , .co and .om respectively , hoping to capture a few more commercial typos without directly targeting the trademarked names and their legal troubles .
Summary
The Business 2.0 article is full of great stats and stories from the underworld of the domain trade .
If someone was buying up property in the physical world and putting up hundreds of thousands of billboards at a time , I ’m sure the governments and advertising industry would be forced to respond to the crowded skyline full of more advertisements than buildings .
In the virtual world domain names are as plentiful as the numbers and characters that string them together , and on - demand advertising from large companies like Yahoo and Google help line the pockets of these prospectors every month .
The domain portfolios of these domain companies are now big enough they have begun to correlate users across multiple sites , targeting the best possible advertisements based on past visits to any member of its portfolio .
The article mentions Ham now plans to build more features into his site , perhaps selling a turnkey wedding shoe selling site along with his domain .
Crazy stuff , but at least I ’ll know where to direct my anger the next time every good domain for my next idea is squatted .
SAN JOSE / Judge orders discharge of an anti-war Marine
A federal judge has ordered the Marines to discharge a San Jose lance corporal as a " conscientious objector " who had an aversion to killing and participating in war .
Robert Zabala , 23 , must be released from the Marines Corps Reserves by mid-April , U.S. District Judge James Ware said in a 21 - page ruling Thursday .
" We 're very pleased with it , " Zabala 's attorney , Stephen Collier , said Monday .
" I think it 's a good decision and that it makes clear to the armed services that they can't deny conscientious - objector discharges from the military . "
Zabala , a UC Santa Cruz student , began boot camp in June 2003 .
During a three - month period that summer , one of Zabala 's superiors repeatedly gave speeches about " blowing s -- up " or " kicking some f- a- , " which caused him to wonder " how someone could be so motivated to kill , " he wrote in his court petition in April 2006 .
In August 2003 , a fellow recruit committed suicide on the shooting range , and the same superior used profanities to belittle him , Zabala wrote , saying he was " abhorred by the blood lust ( the superior ) seemed to possess . "
An instructor showed recruits a " motivational clip " showing Iraqi corpses , explosions , gunfights and rockets set to the song " Bodies , " by the heavy - metal band Drowning Pool .
The lyrics included " Let the bodies hit the floor , " and Zabala said he cried -- his only time while in boot camp -- while other recruits nodded their heads in time with the beat and smiled .
" The sanctity of life that formed the moral center of petitioner 's life was being challenged , " Collier wrote in a court filing .
After Zabala returned to UC Santa Cruz , he had a conversation with a fellow Marine in May 2004 .
" I began to think about the thousands of people who died in the past year in war , who did n't die due to just one soldier or suicide bomber , but largely by an organization , " Zabala recounted .
" This organization trains to kill human life . "
Zabala , who followed some Buddhist - related traditions but was not a practicing Buddhist , applied in June 2004 for a discharge on the basis of conscientious - objector status , but was denied one , court records show .
Zabala 's grandfather served in Vietnam , his parents and uncles were in the Navy , one cousin is in the Air Force and another cousin is the Marines , according to Collier .
CTA president Ron Huberman has been saying that unless state funding comes through to help the transit agency plug a $ 110 million budget deficit , fares may have to rise to $ 3.25 during peak periods .
I 'd like nothing better .
Nothing as in free -- no charge to ride the buses and trains .
Throw the fareboxes , turnstiles and card - machines into the landfill .
Make every day New Year 's Eve ( when rides are free ) .
A radical idea ?
You bet .
CTA spokeswoman Noelle Gaffney said that about half of the CTA 's roughly billion dollar annual budget comes from fares , so lawmakers would have to raise taxes and fees significantly to cover the shortfall .
A new idea ?
No .
According to our news archives , in the fall of 1991 , Ald. Bernard Stone ( 50th ) proposed just such a plan to be financed by a " a small , insignificant income tax . "
" If public transportation is available to all the residents of the metropolitan Chicagoland area , then why should not the cost of such a system come from income earned in the metropolitan area and all fares be free ? "
Stone asked .
No one ever really answered Stone 's question , though Gaffney says someone or other raises the idea at nearly every CTA public meeting .
In March , the San Francisco Chronicle reported :
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said today that he has asked the Municipal Transportation Agency to look into the possibility of providing fare - free public transit in the city .
He told The Chronicle that when all the costs associated with collecting the fares are factored in , the idea of letting people board for free may not be a big financial stretch .
( Update -- San Francisco MTA spokeswoman Maggie Lynch told me Friday afternoon that her agency 's investigation into the idea is being done by the finance department and there is not yet even an interim report to cite )
Today , the New York Daily News columnist Michael Daly reported that , in an interview on transit issues this week , Mayor Michael Bloomberg --
allowed himself to imagine an ideal that is not likely ever to come to pass : " I would have mass transit be given away for nothing and charge an awful lot for bringing an automobile into the city , " he said .
An impossible idea ?
Again , no .
Free Public Transit , an organization devoted to , well , you know , lists seven success stories , though all in far smaller markets than ours .
People who really know the transit business would have to crunch the numbers and do the analysis , but on the back of my envelope it says :
Advantages of free public transportation :
It would make Chicago a more attractive city to visit and to operate a business .
Because of vastly increased ridership , there would be more buses and more trains running more often and along more routes , making the CTA a more efficient and attractive transportation option .
It would reduce traffic congestion and pollution
It would reduce our consumption of fossil fuels .
It would allow the CTA to divert resources now spent on enforcing , collecting and accounting for fares into such areas as enforcing platform , bus and train safety .
It would be of the greatest advantage to those who are currently disadvantaged -- low - income workers who now pay fares and have lengthy commutes on public transportation .
Like education , police and fire protection , and access to roads , transportation is a basic essential of life that government should provide .
Disadvantages of free public transportation :
It would cause economic harm to taxi drivers , parking lot owners and the automotive and petroleum industries .
Half a billion dollars ( probably more given the transition costs and the increased equipment and maintenance costs ) ain't chump change .
Without increased security and some sorts of restrictions , it might turn the CTA into more of a mobile homeless shelter than it is now .
It is n't the way we 've always done it !

As a child my family spent every summer in a Chevy Greenbrier Van traveling to every National Park and any other tourist traps you can imagine .
I remember going on Route 66 when it was the only way to get from the mid west to Southern Calif in 1963 .
The interstate freeway system had not been completed yet .
I loved the national parks and the forests , camping was cheap , fun and we could stay one day or 2 weeks .
My dad was retired and disabled so we had the " Eagle Pass " is what they called it back then , I think it was twenty dollars for the entire year and you could use and campground in the park system .
They are protected for us so we can enjoy nature , the Bush Administration of course thinks mining companies and oil companies are more entitled to search and drill these same parks , so they ignored EPA rules , Endangered Species Acts etc , to open the land up .
This article from the Seattle Times explains the ruling and the order to suspend permits under the " new rules "
The battle between environmental groups and the administration over the forest rules centers on changes to environmental protections that had been in place since the Reagan administration .
Under the old policy , the government had to maintain viable populations of native wildlife in forests and monitor some populations regularly , while limiting logging and drilling for oil and gas .
The new rule — which gave economic activities as high a priority as maintaining the forest 's ecological health — made it easier to conduct drilling and logging in national forests while weakening protections for native fish and wildlife .
It also accelerated the process for approving forest - management plans , which can drag on for as long as seven years .
Environmental groups hailed the decision Friday as a major victory .
They said it will force the Bush administration to rethink the way it oversees forests and grasslands , which make up 8 percent of the country 's land .
" The national forest - planning rules are like the Constitution for our national forests , and the Bush administration tried to throw out the Bill of Rights , " said Earthjustice lawyer Trent Orr , who argued the case before the court on behalf of Defenders of Wildlife , the Wilderness Society , the Sierra Club and the Vermont Natural Resources Council .
I am glad the judge ruled for the forests , and against the administration , because it would take centuries to undue the damage some of the mining companies and oil companies could do to the lands that we as a nation own .
I am glad to see that there are still some people willing to stand up and tell King George NO you can't do it your way just because you want to , we have laws , and even you and your friends have to obey them .

In one of our Lifehacks columns for Make magazine , Merlin forced me to admit that , to fight my tendency to zone out while surfing , I had constructed a haranguing browser , which after five minutes of aimless wandering online would refuse to let me continue without giving some justification for my behaviour .
It is shamefully true .
The original hack was a witch 's brew of PHP and a Perl http proxy .
I 've hacked the basic idea into a script for plugin - de - jour GreaseMonkey .
Your last unconfined act of browsing , then is to the user script page , where you should be able to install it using Tools - > Install User Script .
( This is all Firefox - only , natch ) .
Once installed , you will be pestered every 5 minutes to make a case for your further web browsing .
If your work is done , just cancel the dialog box and quit the app ; if you ’re not finished ( and you really need to keep zipping around the Interweb a bit longer ) , insert a virtual nickel by typing a summary of what you ’re working on .
This buys you another five minutes .
And so on .
The script resets the timer after three minutes , so if you spend more than that staring at one page , you 'll have beaten the system .
I did n't tell you that .
Note that the script can be tweaked with a text editor — change the “ 5 ” on line 16 to however many minutes you want to surf unmolested — and , of course , you can just turn off the damned thing if it becomes a nuisance to real work .
The idea , of course , is not to make you insane and interrupt your real work , but to ensure that you ’re always aware of the task that brought you where you are — that you not allow a legitimate work search to turn into a 4 - hour wikipedia party .
Enjoy it - it 's very bare - bones , so let me know if you make any cool elaborations on the idea .

Bush told Iraq war has helped al - Qa’eda
By Tim Shipman in Washington
President George W Bush was facing increasingly blunt criticism of his Iraq policy last night as a US intelligence report suggested that the war has made al - Qa’eda attacks on American soil more likely .
President Bush is losing support from Republicans in Congress
Senator George Voinovich , a close ally of Mr Bush , delivered a withering assessment of the situation in Iraq , declaring that the Bush administration had “ f****d up the war ” .
The Ohio senator revealed that he warned Karl Rove – the President ’s chief political adviser – last week that Mr Bush must devise a new plan for Iraq or he would vote with Democrats on Capitol Hill to withdraw troops from Iraq .
He spoke out as a declassified National Intelligence Estimate of the terrorist threat to the US indicated that the Iraq war has helped al - Qa’eda “ raise resources and to recruit and indoctrinate operatives , including for homeland attacks ” .

Bird botherers down at RSPB forums are in a flap over the avian conservation charity 's censoring of the word " cock " .
Furious cock commenter JohnD , of Holmfirth , challenged moderators : " When is it not in order to refer to a male bird as a **** and a femail [ sic ] as a hen ?
It 's censorship that is just silly , " the Evening Standard reports .
Other hide inhabitants ponder the issue here .
The site 's administrators pleaded that their white label forum software was to blame for the puritanical ban .
One RSPB cock apologist replied to JohnD : " It is far from an ideal situation , but it is better to be safe than sorry . "
Happily , the forum takes a more liberal stance on tits - blue , great , or otherwise . ®

Over the weekend I had a second hard drive installed in My Computer .
I am a heavy Microsoft Word 2003 user and I create lots of Word documents for my business .
The documents size can vary and I want to change the default location for saving to a folder on the new hard drive .
How can I permanently change the location in Word ?
By default Microsoft Office versions for Word saves documents to your My Documents folder ( C: \Documents and Settings\username \ My Documents ) on Windows XP and to the Documents folder on Windows Vista ( C: \User \Owner|Documents ) .
To change the default location for saving documents in Office version XP ( 2002 ) and 2003 , open Word and click on Tools \ Options …
While one would think changing the setting would be found in the Save tab , it is actually found in the File Locations tab ( circled ) .
After clicking on the File Locations tab , highlight Documents under File types : ( arrow in screen shot above ) then click the modify button .
In the Modify Location window , navigate to a folder or new hard drive location where you want Word to save all documents to , and click OK ,
Click OK again to close the Options window .
If you set up Microsoft Word to create automatic backup document copies , Word will also create the backup copies to the new location .
Dear Lopy :
I recently purchased a few movies from one of those “ legal ” video download services that you guys are always talking about .
For some reason they wo n’t play on my video iPod and I can’t burn them onto DVDs .
Hell , I ca n’t even watch these movies on my laptop if I ’m not connected to The Internets .
A friend suggested that it might have something to do with DRM , whatever that is .
So , how do I remove DRM from my WMV files ?
Signed ,
Stuck With DRM ( whatever that is )
Dear Stuck :
[ ad#AdSense1 ]
The limitations you ’ve run into are typical of the current generation of downloadable video services .
For what it ’s worth , you ’d have the same problem if you downloaded a movie from iTunes and wanted to burn a DVD or play it on a non-Apple portable .
While DRM is inconvenient , it ’s been put in place for a reason — to control consumer access to digital content .
In the pre-digital world consumers enjoyed a wide variety of rights that were generally considered to be “ fair use ” .
For example , consumers could easily make copies of analog media for personal use , or to transfer media from one format to another format .
Media companies , in their infinite wisdom , have determined that it ’s much to dangerous to grant consumers those same rights with digital media .
As a result , most digital media products are now protected with DRM .
Consumers like yourself are just now coming to terms with these new limitations .
It ’s understandable that you would want to remove DRM from your WMV files ( or iTunes video files , or any other DRM protected media file ) .
Unfortunately , the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) makes it a crime to circumvent DRM technology .
In fact , the DMCA is so strict that it ’s a crime to even think about circumventing DRM technology .
That does n’t mean you ’re entirely out of luck .
I ’ll make an effort to answer your question without breaking any federal laws .
On the off chance that I go too far there are other Lopers who will take my place should I get shipped off to Gitmo .
There are two basic approaches you might take in any hypothetical attempt to remove DRM from your WMV files :
Approach No. 1 : The super risky and extremely illegal approach for removing DRM .
Recently we ’ve seen the appearance of several programs that remove the DRM from encoded media files .
These programs literally de-DRM your media files and produce un -encoded files with no restrictions .
FairUse4WM cleans - up PlaysForSure encoded media files , but only audio , not video – so technically this would n’t solve your problem .
iTunes customers can use QTFairUse to remove DRM from iTunes music files , but not iTunes videos .
The advantage of this approach is that the quality of the original recording is not compromised .
The disadvantage , in your case , is that this approach currently does n’t remove DRM from encoded video files .
Oh , and did I mention it ’s also against federal law ?
If you ’re interested in violating the DMCA ( or perhaps you live outside of the United States ) you ’ll have to use The Google to find these programs .
It ’s actually against the law to even link to these programs .
Approach No. 2 : The slightly less risky and possibly even legal approach to remove DRM .
This method is sort of a throwback to the good old days when kids used to tape songs off of the radio ( probably before you were born ) .
As luck would have it , the DMCA makes exceptions for copies made from analog outputs .
As a result , you can take advantage of this so - called analog hole to record the playback of your DRM protected media files .
It ’s sort of like holding a microphone up to your speakers , except there are programs that actually do the recording inside of your computer ( eliminating all sorts of possible disasters involving cats , speakers , and microphones ) .
As you might guess , media companies are lobbying to have the analogue hole closed .
In the meantime , there are a couple programs you might want to investigate to help deal with your DRM problems .
Tunebite is somewhat of Swiss army knife for converting digital media files .
The program will convert audio and video files from any number of formats including WMA , M4A , M4P , AA , M4B , WMV and M4V .
Tunebites works by intercepting the output from your Windows Media or iTunes player .
Since the output has been decrypted by a supported media player , Tunebites is n’t technically removing DRM .
If you have doubts about Tunbebit ’s legality , check out the company ’s legal disclaimer .
While Tunebite may have found a way to sidestep DMCA restrictions , consumers are still obligated to limit their copying for personal use only .
AnalogWhole is another option for freeing your DRM ’d music files .
Like Tunebite , AnalogWhole intercepts audio after it ’s already been decrypted by a media player .
Unlike Tunebite , AnalogWhole can’t convert video files .
While Tunebite is a commercial program , AnalogWhole is open source and available at no cost .
If you ’re primarily interested in freeing your extensive iTunes collection AnalogWhole might be your best option .
Tunebites and AnalogWhole are both available for the Windows platform only .
Mac users will either need to find a friend with Windows or refrain from buying DRM ’d media in the first plays .
Also , it ’s worth noting that that this approach to capturing audio and video content can result in a substantial loss of quality .
After you ’ve freed your media files for convenience sake , you ’ll still want to maintain a backup of the originals .
And finally , Medialoper does not endorse or encourage the use of either of these programs .
Kirk Biglione is a DRM expert and new media consultant .
He has written extensively about digital content and the consumer experience , and how DRM shapes the marketplace for digital content .
Speaking to the Herald yesterday , Mr Bertellotti's lucid memories of the final minutes of the flight may cast a clearer picture on the causes of the crash .
A veteran air traveller who takes more than 100 flights a year , Mr Bertellotti was four seats back from the wing .
He said he was startled that the Boeing 737-400 was coming into Yogyakarta too fast .
When he checked the wing , he could clearly see the air brakes above the wing raised , but it appeared the main flaps below were not extended .
Normal procedures had not been followed .
The announcement to prepare for landing was issued about 10 seconds before the aircraft hit the tarmac , and some of the crew were not in their seats .
Mr Bertellotti felt the aircraft dip suddenly before landing , but he believes the speed of the approach made a crash inevitable .
The Herald revealed on Friday that the Garuda pilot had said a down draught slammed the aircraft into the runway and that the wing flaps were malfunctioning .
" We were travelling at an incredible speed , " Mr Bertellotti said .
" Everyone was screaming before the landing because we knew it was too fast .
" I look outside , the air brakes were up , but I saw the airport building passing by in a flash .
My impression was the flaps were n't down … " There was no wind at all before the crash .
I did feel it dip for just a moment .
We were about 50 metres above the ground .
There was this fast movement , but already we were approaching too fast .
We were already screaming .
" I do n't understand why they did n't touch and go [ take off and try to land again ] .
There was a huge bang and that was it . "
Two stewards were still running towards their seats .
The impact threw them into the air .
" I am very lucky .
I am still alive .
I was in seat 21C on the right side and the fire started on the left side four seats in front …
" Everything was incredibly dark , but we saw the light from the rear door and in eight steps I was out .
There were six or seven people in front of me .
" The hostess was just standing there , showing us the door with her hand and kept silent ; it was very strange .
Outside there was an incredible silence .
No one was speaking .
It 's incredible the plane did n't catch fire when we crashed - [ the fire ] only got big after two minutes .
In those two minutes most people got out .
" There were a few ambulances but I said I did n't need them because nothing was broken and to use them for the people who were hurt . "
Mr Bertellotti , a journalist with Italian TV who covers the region from Melbourne , then went into Yogyakarta to meet a cultural official at a conference he was meant to report on .
The official helped him buy clothes and glasses .
Mr Bertellotti said he then reported back to the airport , but the message appears not to have reached Australian officials .
Mr Bertellotti holds dual Australian and Italian citizenship , which may have added to confusion over his whereabouts .
He was listed as an Italian survivor when Australian officials were trying to find the 10th Australian they knew was on the flight .
" I went back to the airport later to tell them I was fine .
I got a call from Canberra that afternoon .
I told them I was fine and not to worry about me but look after the others who were hurt . "
He decided to leave immediately , stopping in Jakarta before catching the first flight he could to Melbourne .
" I wanted to leave this day behind , and the way was to go back with the ticket I had with Garuda .
I think if I do n't I wo n't fly any more . "
Boarding the flight he was " fighting the shadow of the memory " .
" I 'd like to leave this experience behind .
This will live with me forever , but life goes on . "
The fossils from France are 160 million years old
In pictures
The eight - legged marine animals , which are known as pycnogonids , are only distantly related to land spiders .
The stunning specimens were discovered in 160 million - year - old fossil beds at La Voulte - sur - Rhone , near Lyon in south - eastern France .
Details of the finds are published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
Sea spiders are still with us today ; scientists have described about 1,300 species of pycnogonid .
They are characterised by eight extremely long legs and a prominent mouthpart .
While they may resemble land spiders , the pycnogonids form a distinct biological group .
Writing in Proceedings B , Sylvain Charbonnier from the University of Lyon , France , and colleagues say the new fossils fill a 400 million - year gap in our knowledge of these enigmatic creatures .
The team identified 70 sea spiders from three distinct species in rock slabs from the Jurassic La Voulte Lagerstatte .
A Lagerstatte is a sedimentary rock bed rich in fossils or containing well - preserved specimens .
" This Lagerstatte is very important because during Jurassic times the water here was about 200 m deep , " Mr Charbonnier told the BBC News website .
Many other Lagerstatten from the Mesozoic - the era of the geological time when the dinosaurs walked the Earth - were formed from lagoons or relatively shallow bodies of water .
This means that La Voulte Lagerstatte preserved many fossil creatures not found elsewhere .

This is the dramatic moment when German police rammed a dinghy carrying demonstrators at the summit .
Police motor launches clashed with two Greenpeace inflatables following a high - speed chase across the Baltic Sea .
Meanwhile , on land , thousands of demonstrators continued to try to disrupt the day 's meetings by blocking roads , despite bursts of water cannon and tear gas and numerous arrests .
The ten -minute pursuit on the high seas was beamed by satellite TV around the globe .
Scroll down for more ...
Greenpeace protesters were aiming to score a publicity coup by breaching the massive security and reaching the luxury summit hotel in the resort of Heiligendamm - and they nearly succeeded .
The powerful inflatables were well within the five - mile aquatic no - go zone before a red alert went out to the armada of police and naval boats patrolling offshore to stop them .
A police motor launch rammed the inflatables , pitching the crew of one into the sea .
Three people were injured and taken to hospital after being picked up by the officers who sank them .
The sophistication of the planning and coordination that has gone into the demonstrations shows the determination to overcome the incredible security measures now needed to guard the world leaders .

By the end of this summit later today , the cost of keeping George Bush , Tony Blair and other G8 representatives safe will have reached more than £ 120 million .
It is this extreme contradiction of costs versus achievements which is one of the complaints of the disparate army of protesters who come together at every G8 summit to try to disrupt it or simply to fight with the authorities .
The thousands who have descended on Germany this week are from groups as diverse as Greenpeace and La Lotta Continua ( The Struggle Continues ) from Italy , who want to smash the state and set up " people 's collectives " .
Many Britons are among the estimated 30 protest groups .
" A new world order can only be created through violent struggle , " said Julia , from Nottingham .

She is part of G8 Feminist Action and has no qualms over the violence used by protesters .
" We have seen how ineffective peaceful mass protests have been , " she said .
" Millions took to the streets to try to stop the invasion of Iraq and yet the corrupt world powers still wage their war . "
Also there are members of the Rebel Clown Army , born out of Germany 's anti-nuclear movement .
Their members dress as circus clowns and claim to bring peaceful humour to the protests - although police say they include militants who threw acid into the faces of officers during riots at Rostock earlier this week .
The so - called " Black Bloc " are also out in force .
They are made up of black - clad , hooded , sunglasses - wearing street anarchists whose members dug up paving stones to hurl at police lines last Saturday and who were caught with petrol bombs on Wednesday .
Critics of G8 argue that if the summits were instead reduced to video - conferencing among the members taking part the protesters would be neutered overnight .

I Just Cancelled My " Free " Entertainment Weekly Subscription
Posted by Christine Hurt
Be patient -- this is a long story because I have to make myself look reasonable , even though I got suckered :
Last May , I bought my husband an mp3 player for his birthday .
I was at the Best Buy with my son , who was 2 1/ 2 then .
As I was trying to pay for the player , the clerk kept trying to sell me the $ 14.95 warranty .
I told her " no " many times .
Finally , I asked , " Can I not buy the player without the warranty ?
Just tell me so I can go somewhere else . "
She of course said that I could buy the player without the warranty .
She then asked , " Would you like 6 issues of Entertainment Weekly or Sports Illustrated ?
They 're free . "
The sarcasm in her voice was fairly obvious .
I told her that I would take 6 issues of Entertainment Weekly .
She told me to sign on the computer screen , which I did .
The only information on the computer screen was the amount I owed for the player .
She then handed me the receipt , and then the player .
I went home , wrapped the player , and put the receipt in my jewelry box .
Sure enough , we started getting Entertainment Weekly .
We enjoyed our issues .
Although my husband wo n't admit it , he read it more than I did .
After the 7th or 8th issue came , I realized that I had received more than my 6 issues .
Hmmmm .
Then , the mp3 player broke .
( If you ask me why I did n't get the warranty , I 'll kill you . )
So , Paul wanted the receipt so he could call Rio and yell at them .
I go to get the receipt and notice that on the receipt is a notice that by signing the receipt , I was agreeing to EW automatically renewing my subscription for six months at $ 29.99 .
Aargh .
OK , whatever .
Rio gave us another mp3 player ( which is broken again , but that 's another story ) , and we resigned ourselves to six months of trashy industry news ( and a really good column by Stephen King ) .
Then , before I realized it , my debit card was charged for ANOTHER six months at $ 29.99 when the first six months was over .
So , today I finally took the time to cancel the subscription before the next six months runs out .
My contracts question is this :
Did I legally bind myself to the first $ 29.99 renewal subscription by signing a computer screen with no information about that obligation ?
Does signing a computer screen for one obligation ( deduction from my bank account for amount of Rio player ) bind me to a secondary obligation that was only explained to me after signing on a tape receipt that was handed to me without any explanation ?
I understand that I could have been more diligent , but this strikes me as a practice designed to deceive .
In addition , the subscription rate for new subscribers is $ 19.99 / six months , according to the website .

Whew !
What a crazy ride the last 2 weeks have been : I was Joel'd , Bray'd , Slashdotted , featured in Agile Mafia Monthly , and completely buried in an avalanche of email from Alert Readers .
The highlight of it all was probably the invitation I received to speak at an Agile conference in Vancouver , B.C.
They told me , and this is a direct quote , " we promise not to cut your balls . "
They then went on to reassure me that just to be sure , they 'd get me a security guard .
Yikes !
No doubt the Agilawyers have been scrutinizing my Tyler Durden clause , seeing if they can find a loophole and take me up on it early .
Ha !
I wo n't be taken so easily .
" A fool and his balls are soon parted , " as the old saying goes .
More or less .
So I declined politely , filed for a legal name change , got on the list for facial reconstructive surgery , and moved to Oklahoma .
Ca n't be too careful when your you - know - whats are at stake .
The second runner - up was definitely this email , which I 've reproduced in full :
Hee hee .
Looks like someone did n't get the memo .
Anyway , because my last blog entry was soooo read and skimmed and linked and contested and grokked and misunderstood and praised and denounced and everything , I figured I 'd break tradition , buckle down , and actually write a follow - up .
Incidentally , I can't even begin to tell you how happy it makes me to break all the stupid - ass grammatical rules my Agile Grammar Teachers forced on me in grade school .
They represent a brittle , method{olog}ical personality type that 's still alive and thriving today , busy certifying scrum masters around the world , painting their cats , all that good stuff .
[ We 'll get to the cats in a little while , in case you were wondering . ]
OK , enough preambling already .
On to the main show !
I promise you many mean jokes in tonight 's entertainment , an insight or two , and if you 're a good audience , I 've got a bona - fide magic trick for you at the end .
Hang in there !
Before we get into the interesting stuff , I thought I 'd clear up one major misconception that kept coming up .
Some people apparently thought that by using Google 's development practices as a counterexample , I was implying that Google 's approach is the only alternative to ( a ) Agile , ( b ) Waterfall , or ( c ) Nyarlathotep .
Not true !
I was merely using Google 's process to illustrate that alternatives do exist and they do work .
I offered this evidence largely to combat the Agile claim — and I 'm paraphrasing loosely here — that " if you do n't forward this Agile Manifesto to 5 friends within 47 seconds , you will die instantly and then be thrown off a high building into a pile of manure .
" Seriously , though : you do n't need to look at Google to discuss life beyond Agile .
If you just look around , you 'll find plenty of " success stories " from non-Agile teams .
Looking for " success stories " is , of course , stupid ; it 's exactly the kind of selective reinforcement that can lead to ( e.g. ) chronic gambling disease .
If you want real supporting evidence , you should construct the scientific kind , using experiments .
Yes , I 'm afraid that means looking at the failures too .
Ouch !
So bad for marketing .
Whenever you hear Agile people asking around for " success stories " , remind them politely that only looking at the positives is pseudoscience .
If you walk around and do a survey for yourself , you 'll find two dimensions producing four categories : Agile vs. non-Agile , failure vs. success .
You 'll be able to find projects that fit into each category .
Do n't focus on the " success stories " — look at the whole picture , and correlate your findings with those of friends from other companies .
Most of you will find that if you did an honest assessment , Agile 's not very widespread , and it's not as success - prone as they 'd have you believe .
Not by a long shot .
As one concrete example , one commenter observed that Blizzard does n't ship on a schedule ; they ship " when the app is done " .
Well , raise your hand if you have n't heard of World of Warcraft .
Hands ?
Anyone ?
Did n't think so .
WoW broke into the crowded and locked - in gaming space ( people like to stay on their current MMORPG ) , and stomped the living crap out of huge competitors like Sony and Microsoft .
Overnight .
Boom .
And Blizzard is in a business that 's as about different from Google 's as you can get — especially their shrink - wrap games , which have also historically been groundbreaking , award - winning , runaway bestsellers .
But rather than enumerating all the non-Agile teams and companies as special cases , let 's get straight to the rule :
Most great software developers around the world do n't use Agile .
They just work hard , they stay lightweight , and they ship great stuff .
Most developers still have no idea what Agile even is .
Think of that !
Agile is a niche , a market minority , almost an aberration , really .
It just happens to have a lot of marketing , because it opened up a hitherto entirely untapped new market for snake oil in the tech sector .
Consultants are making money hand over fist by extending their contracts with credulous clients who are told they do n't have the process " quite right " yet , but they 're almost there !
Agile would n't be a big deal , except the Agile camp is really loud .
Annoyingly so .
Loud enough to start interfering with regular developers ' work .
Which is why I had to speak up .
Agile was the Mystery Topic that gave me Blogger 's Block for nearly 2 months .
At some point , though , I just could n't take it anymore .
There were critics here and there , sure , but none of them were as loud as the Agile folks .
So I yelled as loud as I could : loud enough to make it onto Slashdot , even !
Which is exactly what I wanted .
I only had one high - level takeaway , one marketing message I wanted to get out to developers everywhere :
It 's OK to say No to Agile .
That 's it .
Nothing more complicated than that .
But the Church of Agile was getting so powerful that it was becoming increasingly acceptable to criticize people in the workplace for not being Agile .
More on that in a bit .
As it happens , getting my broadcast message out was n't too difficult , on the whole , because snake oil 's kinda funny .
It 's an easy humor target .
You 've probably noticed by now that the Agile folks are utterly lacking in humor .
After my last blog , the whole Agile community started maneuvering and positioning and strategizing — and I 'm talking about the smarter ones .
The others just screamed " I lost thirty - five pounds on that diet ! " , demonstrating that they might possibly have missed my point about experiments vs. statistically meaningless anecdotes .
Ca n't blame 'em ; it was a lot of information to process : a whole book squeezed into a chapter - sized blog .
But across the board , there has n't been a whole lot of self - deprecating humor on the Agile side .
Well , any time you find a community whose overall Humor Level is rated at " Homeland Security " , it 's a pretty good indicator that you do n't ever want to have to deal with them .
Ever .
In any case , the whole discussion about whether Google 's approach is viable for tech companies in other domains is a red herring .
Most companies do n't use Agile Methodologies , or if they do , it 's only a handful of teams , maybe 10 % or fewer , I 'd guess .
At least it 's true at the companies I know lots of people from - Sun , Microsoft , Yahoo , Amazon , Google , Blizzard , and other places like them : industry leaders who write kick - ass software .
They do it almost entirely without Agile .
It 's not just Google .
It 's everyone .
Agile folks are so damn loud , I mean I swear they ought to get some sort of disturbing - the - peace ticket , that they'd have you believe that even if they 're not a majority , they 're some sort of moral majority .
I think you know better by now .
A few people caught a rather subtle point about static typing I made towards the end of my good / bad agile rant .
I did n't dwell on it , but all the follow - up cries of " well what should we use , then ? " have got me wondering whether it 's actually more central than I suspected at the time .
I 'm going to share some apparently unrelated short anecdotes .
They mesh , though .
Bear with me .
I had a high school English teacher who , on the last day of the semester , much to everyone 's surprise , claimed she should tell just by looking at each of us whether we 're a slob or a neat - freak .
She also claimed ( and I think I agree with this ) that the dividing line between slob and neat - freak , the sure - fire indicator , is whether you make your bed each morning .
Then she pointed at each each of us in turn and announced " slob " or " neat - freak " .
Everyone agreed she had us pegged .
( And most of us were slobs .
Making beds is for chumps . )
As I 've done for a great many other programming languages , I 've bashed on Perl 's technical weaknesses at length in the past .
To my continued amazement , the Perl folks are the only ones who never get upset .
They just say " Haha , yeah , boy , you 're right , it sure is ugly .
Heh .
Yeah , so , um , anyway , I 'm going to get back to work now ... "
It 's awesome .
I 've gained so much respect for them .
It 's almost enough to make me go back to programming in Perl .
Well , almost .
The Perl folks have this Perl Haiku competition each year .
It 's a nifty idea , and it 's pretty amazing that you can write useful seventeen - syllable programs .
I tried it with Java once , and produced a valid Java haiku : which , spoken aloud , reads : Maybe it 's just me , but I find it pretty farging depressing that a simple declaration like that can be haiku - sized in Java .
The noted Far Side cartoonist and computer scientist Dr. Gary Larson published the definitive paper on Java - style static type systems in October 1987 .
I 've taken the questionable liberty of reproducing his paper here , in full , sans permission , in the hope that it 'll fall under " fair use " if enough of you buy a Far Side book .
If you do n't , well , just remember what happened to Miranda Pinsley !
Here 's Dr. Larson 's renowned treatise on non-inferring static type systems :
It 's truly one of the most insightful Computer Science papers ever published .
Yet what Dr. Larson may not have realized at the time was that he was also predicting Agile Methodologies !
If there 's one thing I 've learned over the years about type systems , it 's that you have your slob type systems and your neat - freak type systems , and it comes down to personal preference .
The neat freaks ( Java , C# , C++ , Pascal ) know damn well that the slobs ( Perl , Python , Ruby , JavaScript ) are just as productive .
Maybe even more so .
Nobody really knows for sure .
One thing is clear , though : everyone 's getting stuff done , regardless of their language choice .
The whole debate is n't actually about productivity at all , even though most people still think it is .
It 's about whether you can stand to live in a house where the bed is n't made .
Did I mention making beds is for chumps ?
Well , that 's just my take on it .
My wife makes our bed almost every morning .
I find it annoying and useless , especially since we have to tear the thing apart again every night .
But she has to have the place spotless or she gets really uncomfortable .
So , you know , I have to pick up my socks and all that stuff .
There will always be slobs , and there will always be neat freaks .
There will always be programmers who have to paint " THE CAT " on their cat and " THE DOG " on their dog , metaphorically speaking , or they 'll be as stressed and uncomfortable as my wife is when I 've left a bunch of dishes in the sink and clothes on the floor .
And there will always be programmers who need a methodology : even if you can convince them that their current one is n't helping , they can't just drop it .
They need to switch to something else .
And that 's perfectly OK with me , as long as they understand that it 's not some proven silver bullet — it 's just a style thing .
Unfortunately , Agile has been propagating like a virus via a slightly buggy survival mechanism built into all our brains , every single one of us .
You have to take desperate measures to combat a viral epidemic , so I 'm going to pull out the really big guns , and tell you about my dad 's chili .
Many die - hard Agilytes have angrily retorted that Agile has been working for them for years , that they 've been successful with it , and so on .
They seem to think I 'm claiming that Agile " does n't work " .
A few even thought I was claiming that Agile projects are unsuccessful 90 % of the time !
Well , make no mistake : Agile works ( or at least it can work ) just fine .
The problem is much more subtle than that ; most of you appear to have understood it no problem , but many Agile folks missed it entirely .
So allow me to try being un-subtle , and see if that gets the point across to them any better .
When I was a teenager , my dad and my brother Mike decided to make homemade chili .
I 'd never seen it made before , and I watched with keen interest as they added beef , beans , some veggies and spices , and other ingredients .
Dad would taste it , add some more ingredients , wait a bit , taste it again .
My dad has some pretty good recipes .
So you can imagine my puzzlement when he opened the cupboard , pulled out 2 cans of Hormel chili , opened them and dumped them in .
I waited a respectful moment or two before asking him why he was adding canned chili to his chili .
They both said it tasted terrible , but , as my dad now - famously observed : " You can start with dog shit , and if you add enough chili , you get chili .
" Similarly , if you start with an Agile Methodology , and you add enough hard work , you get a bunch of work done .
Go figure .
But that 's a tautology ; you can substitute anything you like for " Agile Methodology " and it 's still true .
It 's probably not difficult to find people who believe that Feng Shui has brought them success in their projects for years .
Or throwing pennies in fountains .
Heck , there are probably some people who practice witchcraft to help their projects out , and a great many of those projects — probably the majority — wind up being successful .
If you do a rain dance for enough days in a row , it will eventually work .
Guaranteed .
So I 'm not saying Agile does n't work .
It does work !
But it 's plain , unadulterated superstition .
And that , dear audience members , brings us to our last big topic today .
Let 's start prepping for that magic trick !
Oh yeah .
First I have to tell you about the chicken .
We 've done the cats , we 've done the chili , we 're on to the chicken .
Almost ready for the final act , which is really gonna piss a lot of people off , I can tell you that right now .
In 1986 , my college Psychology 101 professor told us a little story about her Abnormal Psych class from the previous year .
The students each got a lab rat , and they had to train their rats to run through mazes by rewarding the rats for exhibiting properly ratty maze behavior .
But there was one girl who was terrified of rats , so they gave her a chicken , and she trained it to play the piano by pecking notes with its beak .
Each time the chicken played the right notes , she 'd give it a pellet ( or whatever the hell chickens eat ) .
Wrong notes , no pellet .
She 'd teach it one new note at a time , and eventually it would know the whole song .
At one point , after she 'd coaxed the chicken to learn maybe half its song , the chicken made a violent side - to - side motion just before playing exactly the right sequence of notes , including the new note she was trying to teach it .
It had played the right notes , so she had to give it a pellet .
The chicken had definitely figured out that doing what she wanted would get it yummy pellets .
After that last pellet , it decided that it had been rewarded for both the note and the motion , and from then on , it made crazy twisting motions continuously as it played .
She had to keep rewarding it when it played the right notes , and she had no good way of informing it that the twisting was unnecessary ( not without starting over , and there was n't time ) .
So the chicken went on happily believing that thrashing violently was helping its project succeed .
They eventually went on tour to the local colleges with it , billing it as " The Break - Dancing , Piano - Playing Chicken " .
Our prof told us wide - eyed freshmen that this phenomenon is called superstition , and it refers to the exact same kind of superstition you think of when someone mentions black cats , walking under ladders , breaking mirrors , opening umbrellas indoors , and so on .
' Superstition ' is any belief not based on scientific experiment or pure deductive reasoning .
( More or less . )
Well , geez , that seems pretty broad .
We do n't bother to go verify most of the stuff we know ( or think we know ) — does that mean we 're all really superstitious ?
It turns out we are .
See , our brains are powerful pattern - matching machines , and in order to survive and to learn about the world we have to be able to build up millions of inferences about our experiences , and then match against that " pattern database " in real time .
In order to process all that information fast enough , our minds have a tendency to assume that if two events are coincidental , they 're also correlated .
That last sentence was probably the most important in this whole rant , so I 'll restate it , in case you were dozing off at my boring lecture .
Do n't do it !
We have a magic trick coming soon .
You wo n't want to miss it !
Restated : when you see two events happening that appear to have a cause - and - effect relationship , then your brain naturally and automatically looks for reinforcement .
Also known as " success stories " .
The chicken , completely by accident , got the right notes at roughly the same time it twisted .
Then it received a pellet , and from then on it believed increasingly that the twisting was one of the things that " caused " pellets to appear .
The belief was only reinforced from then on .
That 's it .
That 's how superstition happens .
And would n't you know it , most of the time it 's right .
That 's why it works so well as a pattern - formation strategy .
You touch the stove , you burn your finger .
Do it again , sure enough , you burn it again .
Cause and effect .
But just because you 've drawn the correct inference does n't mean it 's not superstition !
You never really know if it's a " fact " until science has promoted it .
Getting things promoted from superstition to accepted fact is the fundamental endeavor of all science .
Ironically , the chicken story is an Urban Legend .
I have no idea whether my prof was telling the truth when she said it was " her " Abnormal Psych student who trained the chicken .
Maybe she said it was another prof , and I just remembered it as being her class .
I suppose I could go dig up the details ( with a LOT of effort ; this was 20 years ago ) and possibly find out whether it 's true or not .
Until then , it 's an Urban Legend .
That does n't actually mean it 's not true .
" Urban Legend " does n't refer to the message content ; it refers to the transmission protocol .
As it happens , many urban legends are true , if you believe Snopes.com at any rate .
What makes them urban legends is that they 're passed from person to person without keeping any of the original details correct about who , where , when .
So even if they 're true , the way you heard about them makes them superstition .
Until they 've been verified ( if necessary , by repeatable experiment ) , that 's all they are .
So superstition is n't necessarily a bad thing !
We could n't possibly go and verify every single fact we 've heard that we think is probably true .
We 'd never make any progress ( as individuals or as a civilization ) .
We have to take most things we know for granted .
Most of what we know at any given time is superstition .
It 's normal .
And of course many of our superstitions are transmitted to us from other people , through virus - like propagation .
One propagation type is the urban legend .
Another one , sadly , is marketing .
One way or another , ideas make their way to us , and our tendency is to believe anything that seems plausible .
As I was thinking last week about what I 'd write about in this essay , I Googled for " technological superstition " and came across this lovely little ACM article by Jef Raskin from 2003 .
In it , he talks a little about the psychological foundations of superstition , and goes on to poke fun at a popular and widespread superstition , namely that expensive audio cables sound better than cheap ones .
It 's definitely worth a read , and it has a little jewel at the end that I 'm sure will make you gasp with appreciation for the author 's Nostradamus - like predictive powers .
Superstition is harmless , right ?
Well , sort of .
Mostly .
Usually .
In fact , the point of the previous section was the superstition is not only inevitable ( for all of us ) , it 's actually a critical brain function .
Most of what we believe is superstitious , and if we really want to , we can go track down any particular belief and do some reference - checking on the sources ( e.g. is the source Wikipedia or the National Enquirer ?
Both are sometimes right and sometimes wrong , but the confidence levels differ dramatically ) or even repeat the experiments ourselves .
Superstition is strongest when people desperately want to influence or control events around them , but it 's too hard for them , so they turn to the magic of wishful thinking : Feng Shui , pennies in fountains , shooting stars , Agile Methodologies .
Nothing wrong with that .
The fundamental cultural problem with superstition arises when people do n't know how to differentiate between reliable and unreliable data - verification sources , so they treat non-science as science .
If they do n't recognize or admit that they 're being superstitious , then they 'll feel no qualms at all about trying to propagate their beliefs to YOU .
In fact , if they can do it successfully , if everyone believes something , then it 's no longer superstition .
( This is why philosophers wonder whether even scientifically accepted facts are still just superstition .
Quantum mechanics has revived that line of inquiry in the last century . )
That 's why they want you to believe what they believe : it reduces the nagging doubt that they might be wrong .
It 's why superstitious communities spring up and clump together and get all insular — they self - reinforce within the group .
This , folks , is what 's been gradually going wrong with Agile over the past decade .
It 's a complicated problem .
And it has NOTHING TO DO with whether it " works " for you or not .
The problem is that if it kept spreading , it was eventually going to be a majority opinion , at which point the non-believers would start losing their jobs because they were n't playing along with the Establishment .
Cowboys , indeed .
Now you know why Agile folks call them Cowboys .
They want to brand us all as rogues , as non -team - players .
Scary , eh ? I do n't want to have to wear an armband just because I do n't share their techno - religious beliefs .
I 'm already wearing enough of them as it is .
The Church of C++ , for instance , is a physical and moral majority , and you 're a lesser programmer if you do n't use it .
Get used to it .
You live in an unenlightened age .
As far as I 'm concerned , Agile Methodologies are fine for you to use , but if you try to push them on a coworker , it should be treated as an HR violation , just as if you were discriminating against them because they do n't believe in Feng Shui .
If it 's a manager pushing Agile on a subordinate , it should be treated with extra severity .
Reprimand , goes on the employee record , mandatory training , and 3 strikes you 're out .
You have to fight fire with fire .
I want it to be their career problem before it becomes your career problem .
I joke about it a lot , and I 'll continue to do so , but this is actually pretty serious stuff .
But let 's go ahead and close out on a lighter note .
I promised you a pony , right ?
No , wait , it was a magic trick .
That 's right .
Sigh .
All right , then .
You asked for it , you 'll get it !
Here 's one laaaaaaaaast superstition for you : anagrams !
Ooooh , they 're one of the most popular of all .
You rearrange the letters of a word or phrase to see if you can find hidden meanings .
That 's all there is to it !
Unless you 're truly superstitious — and I mean the Old World kind , where you still believe in crazy stuff like leprechauns and numerology and a steroid - free Olympics — then you know that anagrams do n't really have hidden meanings in them ; it 's just random coincidence .
I mean , let 's face it : if you look hard enough , you can always find some phrase describing your intended target that also has a really unfortunate anagram .
It 's just blind ( usually bad ) luck .
I think Spiro Agnew knows this better than anyone in history .
And yet ... sometimes it 's soooo hard to believe it 's really random .
When I was in my mid-twenties , I ran my full legal name ( Stephen Francis Yegge ) through an anagram solver to see what came up .
Ouch !
I mean , here I was , struggling with my weight , and all the meaningful anagrams of my name seemed to be about being fat .
The worst one was " piggery , hence fatness " .
Gosh .
Was I cursed ?
It sure seemed that way .
Meanwhile , my little brother Dave was all pissed off .
" Why are all mine about being sick ?
This is lame ! "
I remember it like it was yesterday .
" David Francis Yegge " ( my parents were so creative ) came back with anagrams like " gas acid fever dying " and " dying grief cave sad " , and Dave was NOT happy about it .
Hidden meanings my ass , he announced , and he stopped playing with the program .
I do n't think he ever used one again for the rest of his life .
Are " hidden messages " like these a coincidence ?
Yeah .
Yes .
They are .
From any rational , sane perspective , they 're just sheer bad luck .
Problem is , our brains sometimes just do n't want to be rational .
I 'll close with one last example , and it's a dirty trick — one that would be utterly beneath a more principled blogger than myself .
Because after all my ranting about superstition , I 'm about to use superstition for my own nefarious purposes .
Let 's say , hypothetically speaking of course , you were to rearrange the letters of — oh , how about , just for pure curiosity 's sake .
An innocent exercise , nothing more .
( " Hey , it ca n't hurt !
It works for me !
I 've been rearranging letters since 1990 ! " Dorks . )
Well , chances are pretty good that you 'll find lots of meaningless and ho - hum anagrams , and possibly one or two moderately interesting ones .
But if you 're hoping for a really clear message , especially with bigger words in it — you know , something that would be unmistakable as a hidden message — you know you 're likely to be disappointed .
So let 's try it .
Ca n't hurt .
How many 2 - word anagrams of " Agile Manifesto " do you think there are ?
Guess what ?
There 's exactly one : Yup .
I thought the exact same thing you just did .
:-)
Sure , you can argue about probability and statistics and the fundamental nature of randomness , and you can cry foul play !
no fair !
poor sportsmanship !
low blow !
until you 're blue in the face , and you 'd probably be right .
But in the end , I mean , come on , you have to admit , it 's a pretty spooky coincidence ...( cue haunted mansion bat music ) ... or IS it ? ( cue happy end - of - show music ) Tune in next time !
I think I 've pretty much finished up with Agile for now ; I 've stuffed garlic in its mouth and pounded a wooden stake through its heart and it's making melodramatic retreating gestures , shaking its fist at me and promising revenge in the inevitable sequel .
So now I can go back to writing about boring stuff that wo n't make me infamous .
Like , you know , Google .
Hope you enjoyed the show !

RECENTLY IN England , four Muslim - staffed committees appointed to advise Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Cabinet on issues related to Islam have come up with a recommendation :
Get rid of an official event viewed as offensive to Muslims .
What event would that be ?
A celebration of the Crusades , perhaps ?
No , Holocaust Memorial Day .
In the words of one committee member , '' The very name Holocaust Memorial Day sounds too exclusive to many young Muslims .
It sends out the wrong signals : that the lives of one people are to be remembered more than others . "
That '' one people , " of course , are the Jews .
The committees are n't exactly proposing that the Holocaust commemoration be scrapped outright .
They want it to be folded into a ' ' Genocide Memorial Day " that will also include such crimes as the slaughter of the Tutsis in Rwanda and the massacres of Bosnian Muslims by the Milosevic regime .
Unfortunately , even against the bloody backdrop of the 20th century , there are strong reasons to regard the Nazi extermination of the Jews as a unique atrocity .
It was the first , and so far the only time that , as Cornell University historian Stephen Katz put it in his 1994 book '' The Holocaust in Historical Context , " that ''a state set out , as a matter of intentional principle and actualized policy , to annihilate physically every man , woman , and child belonging to a specific people . "
But the problem with the proposal goes far deeper .
The other '' genocides " for which they want recognition include the Israeli killings of Palestinians .
Clearly , Palestinians have suffered under the occupation .
Over 4,000 have been killed since the renewal of violence five years ago .
Some of these dead were completely innocent victims ; others were fighters , violent protesters , or suicide bombers .
( Nearly 1,000 Israelis have died as well . )
This death toll is tragic ; but to call it '' genocide " is to cheapen the word .
Any equation between the Holocaust and Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians is absurd .
The effect of such a parallel is not to promote '' inclusiveness " -- it is to erase and minimize the tragedy of the Jews as past victims of genocide by slanderously assigning them an equal role as its present - day perpetrators .
The committees are formally presenting their proposal ( backed by the head of the Muslim Council of Britain ) to the government later this week ; the Home Office has already reportedly indicated that it does not plan to act on the recommendation .
What 's frightening , however , is that such a proposal could come from a group of people charged with the task of helping the government combat extremism .
Alas , this is not a unique case .
The same issue of the London Daily Telegraph that reported the attack on Holocaust Day carried another remarkable story .
Ahmad Thomson , deputy chairman of Britain 's Association of Muslim Lawyers and occasional adviser to the prime minister , recently claimed that Blair had been pressured into entering the Iraq war by a sinister conspiracy of Jews and Freemasons .
In his 1994 book , '' The Next World Order , " Thomson ( a convert to Islam ) claimed that the Holocaust is a ' ' big lie " and that the presence of US soldiers in Saudi Arabia is especially outrageous because many of them are Jewish .
These two stories illustrate an uncomfortable truth :
The infection of anti-Jewish bigotry is alarmingly widespread in the Muslim community today , not only in predominantly Muslim and Arab countries -- where the media routinely circulate anti-Semitic libels and conspiracy theories while preachers and editorialists compare Jews to pigs and monkeys -- but in Western democracies as well .
Some apologists on the left blame this virulent hatred on the Israeli occupation of the territories .
But is it plausible to believe that a state of Israel within its 1948 borders would be less hated by those who believe all of its land rightfully belongs to Muslims ?
This is not to tar all or most Muslims with the same brush , or to deny that anti-Muslim bias and paranoia exists , too .
( In the United States , some right - wing bloggers have been shrieking that the proposed memorial to the victims of 9/11's Flight 93 is shaped like -- horrors ! -- a crescent . )
Nor is it to say that Islam is inherently intolerant :
All religions and ethnic groups have their bigots and haters .
For a variety of reasons , the bigotry and hate in Islam are perilously close to the mainstream .

For better or worse , SOA ( service - oriented architecture ) continues to be the current industry fad .
As SOA continues along the “ hype curve ” ( a term I ’m borrowing from Gartner ) , more and more people are starting to realize that SOA is n’t a silver bullet , and that it does n’t actually replace n- tier client / server or object - orientation .
What will most likely happen over the next couple years , is that SOA will fall into the “ pit of disillusionment ” ( part of the hype curve , that I think of as the “ pit of despair ” ) , and many people will decide , as a result , that it is totally useless .
This will happen , not in small part , because some organizations are investing way too much money into SOA now , when it is overly hyped – and they ’ll feel betrayed when “ reality ” sets in .
After a period of disrepute , SOA may then rise to a “ plateau of productivity ” , where it will finally be used to solve the problems it is actually good at solving .
Some technologies do n’t live through the “ despair ” part of the process .
Sometimes the harsh light of reality is too bright , and the technology can’t hold up .
Other times , a competing technology or concept hits the top of its hype curve , derailing a previous technology .
Over the next very few years , we ’ll see if SOA holds up to the despair or not .
This is a pattern Gartner has observed for virtually all technologies over many , many years .
If you think about any technology introduced over the past 20 years or more , almost all of them have following this pattern : over - hyping , over - reacting - to - reality and finally used - as - a - real - solution .
My colleague and mentor , David Chappell , recently blogged about some of the realities people are discovering as they actually move beyond the hype and try to apply SOA .
It turns out , not surprisingly , that achieving real benefits in terms of reuse is much harder than the SOA evangelists would have anyone believe .
I think this is because SOA focuses on only one part of the problem : syntactic coupling .
SOA , or at least service - oriented design and programming , is very much centered around rules for addressing and binding to services , and around clear definition of syntactic contracts for the API and message data sent to and from services .
And that ’s all good !
Minimizing coupling at the syntactic level is absolutely critical , and SOA has moved us forward in this space , picking up where EAI ( enterprise application integration ) left off in the 90’s .
Unfortunately , syntactic coupling is the easy part .
Semantic coupling is the harder part of the problem , and SOA does little or nothing to address this challenging issue .
Semantic coupling refers to the behavioral dependencies between components or services .
There ’s actual meaning to the interaction between a consumer and a service .
Every service implements some tangible behavior .
A consumer calls the service , thus becoming coupled to that service , at both a syntactic and semantic level .
At the syntactic level , the consumer must use the address , binding and contract defined by the service – all of which are forms of coupling .
But the consumer also expects some specific behavior from the service – which is a form of semantic coupling .
And this is where things get very complex .
The broader the expected behavior , the tighter the coupling .
As an example , a service that does something trivial , like adding two numbers , is relatively easy to replace with an equivalent .
Such a service can even be enhanced to support other numeric data types with virtually no chance of breaking existing consumers .
So the semantic coupling between a consumer and such a service is relatively light .
Another example is credit card verification .
Obviously the internal implementation of this behavior is much more complex , but the external expectations of behavior remain very limited .
Like adding two numbers , verifying a credit card is a behavior that accepts very little data , and returns a very simple result ( yes / no ) .
Contrast this with many other possible business services , such as shipping an order , or generating manufacturing documentation .
In these ( quite common ) scenarios , the service performs , or is expected to perform , a relatively broad set of behaviors .
The result is a whole group of effects and side - effects – all of which should be considered as black - box effects by any caller .
But the more a service does , the less “ black - box ” it can be to its callers , and the tighter the coupling .
And this leaves us in a serious quandary .
There ’s a high cost to calling a service .
There ’s a lot of overhead to creating a message , serializing it into text ( XML ) , routing it through some communications stack onto the wire , getting the electrons across the wire through some protocol ( probably TCP ) and all the attendant hardware involved , picking it up off the wire on the server , routing it through another communications stack , deserializing the text ( XML ) back into a meaningful message and finally interpreting the message .
Only then can the service actually act on the message to do real work .
Worse , that ’s only half the story , because most people are creating synchronous request / response services , and so that whole overhead cost must be paid again to get the result back to the caller !
Before going further , let me expand on this “ overhead cost ” concept to be more precise .
I worked for many years in manufacturing .
In that industry there ’s the concept of cost accounting – people make their living at tracking costs .
They divide costs into overhead , setup and run ( there are other models , but this one ’s pretty standard ) .
To make this somewhat more clear , I ’ll use the metaphor of baking cookies .
Overhead cost are all the salaried people , the buildings , equipment and so forth .
Costs that are paid whether widgets are manufactured or not .
When baking cookies , this is the cost of having a kitchen , a stove , electricity , natural gas , and of course the person doing the baking .
In most homes these costs exist regardless of whether cookies are baked or not .
Setup costs are applied overhead .
They are costs that are required to build a set of widgets , but they are only incurred when widgets are being manufactured .
These costs include setting up machines , programming devices , getting organized , printing documents , etc .
When baking cookies , this is the cost ( in terms of time ) of getting out the various ingredients , bowls , spoons and other implements .
It is also the cost of cleaning up after the baking is done – all the washing , drying and putting - away - of - implements that follows .
These costs are directly applied to the process , but are pretty much the same whether you bake one dozen or ten dozen cookies .
Run costs are those costs that are incurred on a per-widget basis to make a widget .
This includes the hourly rate of the workers manning the assembly line , the materials that go into the widget and so forth .
When baking cookies , this is the time spent by the baker , the cost of the flour , eggs and other ingredients consumed in the process .
Ideally it would include the amount of electricity or natural gas used to run the stove as well .
Obviously detailed run costs can be hard to determine in some cases !
When calculating the cost of your cookies , each of these three costs is added together .
The run rate is easy , as it is per-cookie by definition .
The setup rate is variable – the more cookies you make in a batch the lower the relative setup cost , and the fewer cookies the higher the relative setup cost .
Overhead is typically aggregated – the annual overhead cost is known , and is divided by the number of cookies ( and other things ) made over a year ’s time .
Obviously there ’s lots of wiggle room in this last number .
For my purposes , in discussing services , the overhead rate is n’t all that meaningful .
In our industry this is the cost of the IT staff , the servers , the server room , electricity and cooling and so forth .
But the setup rate and run rate become very meaningful when talking about services .
Calling a service , as I noted earlier , incurs a lot of overhead .
This overhead is relatively constant : you pay about the same whether you send 1 byte or 1024 bytes to or from the service .
The run rate is the actual work done by the service .
Once the message is parsed and available to the service , then the service does real , valuable work .
This is the run rate for the service .
In manufacturing it is always important to manage the overhead and setup costs – they are a “ pure cost ” .
The run rate cost must also be managed , but it is directly applicable to a product , and so that cost can be factored into the price you charge .
Perhaps more importantly , your competitors typically have a comparable run rate ( materials and labor cost about the same ) , but the overhead can vary radically .
To switch industries just a bit , this is why Walmart does so well ( and is so feared ) .
They have managed their overhead and setup costs to such a degree that they actually do focus on reducing their run rate ( in their case , the per-unit acquisition cost of items ) .
Coming back to services , we face the same issue .
Typically we deal with this using intuition rather than thinking it through , but the core problem is very tangible .
Would you call a service to add two numbers ?
Of course not !
The setup / overhead cost would outweigh the run cost to such a degree that this makes no sense at all .
Would you call a service to ship an order , with all the surrounding activities that implies ?
This makes much more sense .
The setup / overhead cost becomes trivial when compared to the run cost for such a service .
And yet coupling has the opposite effect .
Which of those services can be more loosely coupled ?
The addition service of course , because it performs a very narrow , discrete , composable behavior .
Do you even know what the ship - an - order service might do ?
Of course not , it is too big and vague .
Will it trigger invoicing ?
Will it contact the customer ?
Will it print pick lists for inventory ?
Will it update the customer ’s sales history ?
I would hope it does all these things , but very few of us would be willing to blindly assume it does them .
And so we are forced to treat ship - an - order as something other than a black box .
At best it is gray , but probably downright clear .
We ’ll require that the service ’s actual behaviors be documented .
And then we ’ll fill in the gaps for what it does not provide , or does n’t provide in a way we like .
( Or , failing to get adequate documentation , we ’ll experiment with the service , probing to find its effects and side - effects and limitations .
And then we ’ll fill in the gaps for the bits we do n’t like .
Sadly , this is the more common scenario… )
At this point we ( the caller of the service ) have become so coupled to the service , that any change to the service will almost certainly require a change to our code .
And at this point we ’ve lost the primary goal / benefit of SOA .
Why ?
How can this be , when we ’re using all the blessed standards for SOA communication ?
Maybe we ’re even using an Enterprise Service Bus , or Biztalk Server or whatever the latest cool technology might be .
And yet this coupling occurs !
This is because I am describing semantic coupling .
Yes , all the cool , whiz - bang SOA technologies help solve the syntactic coupling issues .
But without a solution to the semantic , or behavioral , coupling it really does n’t get us very far …
What ’s even scarier , is that the vision of the future portrayed by the SOA evangelists is one where we build services ( systems ) that aggregate other services together to provide higher - level functionality .
Like assembling simple blocks into more complex creations , that in turn can be assembled into more complex creations or used as -is .
Except that each level of aggregation creates a service that provides broader behaviors – and by extension tighter coupling to any callers ( though the setup vs run costs become more and more favorable at the top level ) .
To bring this ( rather long ) post to a close , I want to return to the beginning .
SOA is heading down the steep slope into the pit of disillusionment .
You can head this off for yourself and your organization by realizing ahead of time , right now , that SOA only addresses syntactic issues .
You must address the much harder semantic issues yourself .
And the tools exist .
They have for a long time .
Good procedural design , use of flow charts , data flow diagrams , control diagrams , state diagrams : these are all very valid tools that can help you manage the semantic coupling .
Unfortunately the majority of people with expertise in these tools are nearing retirement ( or have retired ) – but the tools and techniques are there if you can find some old , dusty books on procedural design .
Just remember to include the setup / overhead cost vs run cost in your decisions on whether to make each procedure into a " service " .
Government attempts to persuade thousands of young people to stay away from drugs have failed and done nothing to curb the soaring popularity of illegal substances , a devastating report will warn this week .
The number of young people using cocaine and cannabis has increased rapidly over the past 20 years despite high - profile campaigns , such as the £ 9 m ' Frank ' initiative aimed at 11 to 15 - year - olds , according to an in - depth examination of official efforts to tackle Britain 's chronic drug problem .
It is also expected to claim that Britain 's ' unusually severe drug problem compared with that of our European neighbours ' is linked to social and economic deprivation , that punitive laws have had little effect and that police efforts to disrupt the drugs trade have also failed .
The report will be launched on Wednesday by the new UK Drugs Policy Commission , whose members include distinguished figures from the worlds of health , policing , drugs research and academia .
They include David Blakey , a former president of the Association of Chief Police Officers , Annette Dale - Perera of the NHS - funded National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse and Professor Colin Blakemore , who leads the Medical Research Council .
The study , ' An Analysis of UK Drugs Policy ' , has been written by two internationally respected experts , Professor Peter Reuter of Maryland University in the US and Alex Stevens , senior researcher at the European Institute of Social Services at Kent University .
Their findings are a scathing indictment of decades of education , prevention and awareness - raising campaigns intended to warn youngsters about the perils of narcotics .
The three main strategies into which successive governments have ploughed tens of millions of pounds - mass media campaigns such as ' heroin screws you up ' in the 1980s , initiatives in schools aimed at pupils as young as seven and targeting of vulnerable groups - have made little or no difference , it says .
' Prevention is cited as the main policy area aiming to reduce drug initiation and continued use .
The policy is predicated on the assumption that prevention efforts reduce drug use , but there is as yet no clear evidence showing that prevention has had this effect in the UK , ' the authors conclude .
The National Institute of Clinical Excellence recently drew similar conclusions about the usefulness of drugs prevention campaigns .
' It now seems that what might be termed " recreational " drug use has become firmly established as an experience that many young people will go through ' because consumption of illicit substances is now so common in their age group , the document says .
The failure to deter growing levels of drug use has contributed to Britain developing the most chronic drug problem in Western Europe , according to the report .
The report cites an array of official statistics charting the steady growth in Britain 's drugs culture .
For example , according to the 2005 British Crime Survey , 40.4 per cent of 16 to 19 - year - olds have used drugs at some point in their lifetime , as have 49 per cent of 20 to 24 - year - olds , 51.6 per cent of 25 to 29 - year - olds and 45.8 per cent of 30 to 34 - year - olds .
While cannabis use by young people has fallen recently , it remains around 50 per cent and consumption of cocaine has increased .
The Home Office last night rejected the new body 's findings .
A spokesman said research showed that giving young people information about drugs , rather than adopting a ' just say no ' approach , was a more effective way of warning them about the dangers .
' The British Crime Survey shows that drug use has fallen by 16 per cent since 1998 and drug use among adults has fallen by 21 per cent .
We are determined to build on this progress by continuing to take more drugs off our streets , put more dealers behind bars and make sure young people are informed about the harms drugs cause ' , he said .
But Peter Walker , a former secondary school head teacher who pioneered random drug testing at his school and is now a Whitehall adviser on drugs , last night agreed that government policy on drugs had not had enough of an impact .
' What has been done has not been as effective as the public or the government would like it to be , ' he said .
But while he accepted that ' methods of prevention are not good enough , ' he dismissed the notion that prevention could not work .
Danny Kushlick , director of the pro-legalisation Transform Drugs Policy Foundation , said the new study backed his view that attempts to discourage drug use were pointless .
' We know from evidence that misuse of drugs is related significantly to social ill - being and social deprivation .
You cannot deal with that stuff with education and prevention or through teaching younger and younger children .
You deal with it by redistributing wealth and improving wellbeing .'

Mobile Phone As Home Computer
A mobile phone has substantially all of the computing capabilities desired by a large fraction of the public .
Why then would someone want to go to the trouble of installing and maintaining a personal computer ( PC ) ?
The PC has a larger keyboard and screen , a larger storage capacity , can play more sophisticated games , and has a faster communications capability .
This is a plan for building an appliance into which a mobile phone plugs and that extends the phone 's capabilities without requiring the consumer to become a system administrator or be aware that he or she owns more than a phone .
In the rest of this document we will call the new device " The Appliance " .
Dethroning the Mighty PC
If you are an architect and want to run a computer - aided design program , the PC is great .
If you are an electrical engineer and want to design circuits , a PC is great .
If you are a filmmaker and want to edit video , a PC is great .
For all of these customers it would be difficult indeed to supplant the PC .
For a large segment of the market , however , the PC represents confusion , misery , and wasted hours .
The PC is a scaled - down circa 1965 mainframe .
The hardware engineers have done a brilliant job in changing the way that the circuits are constructed .
The software engineers , unfortunately , have presented today 's consumer with much of the same complexity that professional programmers faced in 1965 .
Consider as an example the mainframe file system .
The mainframe had a hierarchical file system in which files were divided up into folders .
This made it faster to find a particular file by name .
The mainframe also had some fast memory , what we call " RAM " today , and some slow memory , which was and is called " disk " .
Programmers knew that they could work on data in RAM but that changes would be erased when the program ended or the computer restarted so they saved those changes permanently to files on disk .
What does a personal computer designed for a 65 - year - old grandmother with no technical training demand her to know ?
All the same stuff !
Grandma has to pick one and only one folder in which each file will reside .
Grandma works on a document for awhile and , satisfied with her changes , quits the word processor .
She is asked " Do you want to save these changes ? "
" Save them where ? " she might wonder .
And why were n't they already saved somewhere ?
The result of exposing this much complexity to grandma is that all of her files will be on her desktop and she still wo n't be able to find important documents without resorting to search .
Alan Cooper argued in his 1995 book About Face that the file system should be used by the operating system but hidden from the user .
There should not be a " file " menu on the typical application .
Joe User works on a document and closes the application when he is done .
If he later wants to go back to an earlier version he asks " let me see what this document looked like a week ago " or " let me see what this document looked like when I said ' call this Final Draft ' " .
The file system is still there , of course , but the interface is divorced from the implementation .
The PC industry , however , is seemingly unable to change .
Nothing has been done to address the havoc wreaked on users except to build better desktop search tools for finding those lost files more quickly .
You would think that the success of programs such as iTunes , MusicMatch , and Windows Media Player , which present a multi- categorized view of files in the underlying hierarchical file system , would inspire the authors of other PC programs but this seems not to have been the case .
The Central Principle
( As far as the engineers building The Appliance are concerned , the phone is the key that identifies the user and the phone is a USB flash drive for storing a working subset of documents and information .
The Appliance itself is mostly a standard PC running a standard operating system plus a thin layer of custom software . )
Evidence that it can work
Fundamental ways in which the phone / appliance is more powerful
What must it do ?
Web browsing , which includes email access via Hotmail and Gmail , and which includes on - demand streams of audio and video
the ability to transfer recent and / or selected email messages to the phone itself
continuation of the instant message sessions that are very likely already active on the phone alone
shopping without constantly retyping address and payment information
calendar and contacts ( basically just using the big keyboard and screen to enter data more easily into the phone ; the Appliance backs up these data but the phone has a complete set )
word processing , spreadsheet
digital photo organization , editing , printing , uploading to printing services , and publishing to the Web
music collection storage , access to subscription music services such as Rhapsody and Yahoo Music , organizing the subset of music that will be available on the phone ( podcast spoken - word streams can be considered " music " )
play a DVD movie on the big screen ; would be ideal if portions of the movie could be transferred to the phone for later viewing
burn an audio or MP3 CD with music
play a video game sold on DVD and designed for a Windows machine (** this requirement could be relaxed on the assumption that a game - lover will own a separate Xbox or PlayStation **)
The Hardware
stuff you might find in a standard PC DVI output for LCD monitor
USB ports for connecting the phone itself , a keyboard , a mouse , a printer , and other devices
a DVD drive / burner for putting in games or movies to play , making backups to take off - site , and making music CDs
a fast CPU
two big hard drives , mirrored ( RAID 1 ) , and connected as easily - swapped cartridges
sockets for digital camera memory cards , e.g. , CF stuff you might not find in a standard PC
a 4 - port Ethernet switch
an 802.11 base station
a DSL modem
a cable modem
The Software
As with any standard mobile phone , all software is provided free by the carrier and kept up to date by the carrier in a way that is transparent to the customer .
The customer pays a monthly bill for service .
All software is modified so that the File menu is removed and the customer is presented with the versioned multi-categorized view of documents envisioned by Alan Cooper .
The need to incorporate a consistent document browser and email / messaging interface into every program implies a requirement that all software incorporated into the Appliance be open source .
For user interface consistency with the phone , the applications on the Appliance take their user interface conventions from the phone operating system .
As of late 2005 , the majority of smart phones run one of three operating systems : Palm , Symbian , and Windows Mobile .
If a customer owns a Nokia Symbian phone , for example , the applications on the Appliance that he or she purchases should have an immediate familiarity with consistent color schemes and design .
The Internet Connection
Note that the kind of easy addition of DSL makes a lot of sense for carriers such as Verizon that own both mobile phone companies and offer high - speed home Internet connections .
Services
Casual Encounters
What if you 're away from home and your houseguest Jenny wants to use " the machine " ?
She does n't have your phone to plug into the Appliance and certainly does not have your PIN number .
If you 've set up the Appliance to " allow guests to surf the Web " she can sit down at the keyboard and monitor and enjoy Internet access but not access to your personal files or information .
Connection Sharing
If someone shows up in the household with a laptop computer running a conventional operating system and wishes to use the Internet connection this can be authorized by the phone / Appliance owner .
It is an open question as to the best way to do this .
It might work if a dialog box could come up on the Appliance or phone with the MAC address of the laptop and asking for confirmation that it is okay to let this person have access .
Backups
Off - site backup can be accomplished in three ways .
If it is connected via a high - speed Internet connection , The Appliance will offer the customer the option of a network backup service .
For people with large photo and music collections we can sell a matched " offsite backup store " .
This is just a standard USB external hard drive pre-formatted and including a key that only a particular customer 's Appliance will recognize .
When the Appliance sees this matched offsite backup store it copies the contents of its internal hard drive onto the USB drive .
( The key is necessary so that an evildoer can't simply walk into your house , plug in a hard drive , and get all of your private info .
For additional protection the backup operation could be limited to times at which the phone is connected to The Appliance and a PIN number is entered . )
The third option for backup , and one that works with large photo and music collections , is to break the mirror and pull one of the disk cartridges out for storage in a remote location .
A replacement disk cartridge is installed and the mirror reestablished .
Service
Hardware failures will be dealt with by the consumer who either brings the Appliance into a shop or who gets a replacement Appliance via overnight delivery .
Failures are divided into " both disks " ( very unlikely ) versus " not both disks " .
If it is both disks that have failed the consumer will have to restore a fresh new Appliance from a USB backup drive .
In the usual case , however , the consumer will pull the disk cartridges from the old Appliance and plug them into the new one , plug the phone in , and go back to whatever he or she was doing .
Making Money
Because nearly every Appliance will generate a $ 200 - 600 per year DSL or cable modem revenue stream for the carrier , the carriers could afford to subsidize the purchase of Appliances much as they currently subsidize the purchase of mobile phones .
The company that produces the hardware spec and the software for the Appliance should be able to make money from carriers when consumers initially purchase the Appliance and from selling services such as Internet backup to Appliance owners .
As an acquisition the company behind the Appliance should be interesting to any firm unhappy about the fact that personal computing is frozen in the 1980s from a user interface point of view and that most of the profits go to one company ( Microsoft ) .
A handset maker would be a logical acquirer as would any company with a sophisticated engineering capability that has been reduced to making commodity PCs to run Windows ( e.g. , HP ) .
An online services company such as Yahoo or Google might acquire the Appliance 's creator in order to get a deeper foothold in subscription - based services .
Finally , Microsoft itself might buy the company , if only to kill it with neglect , as they did with WebTV .
A mobile phone carrier would not be a logical acquirer because it would be too difficult for them to sell to other carriers and because continuing to improve the software and hardware would be beyond their corporate capabilities .
Objection :
Why not just plug the phone into a PC ?
From an engineer 's point of view , the Appliance is just a PC with built - in cable and DSL modems and a cartridge system for connecting disk drives .
From a consumer 's point of view , however , running software on top of an existing PC does not get them out of sysadmin and upgrade hell .
The existing PC might not have mirrored disk drives .
The existing PC might be infected with a virus .
The existing PC might be running an older version of XP .
The deeper problems with using an existing or standard PC include the following :
A standard PC offers multiple ways to do any given task , thus creating confusion ( e.g. , email can be sent from Outlook Express , Outlook , clicking right on a document , using a Web - based mail system such as Gmail or Hotmail )
A standard PC needs to be told who are the users and what are their privileges .
A standard PC needs to be told how to get to an Internet connection and it needs to be plugged into the Internet connection properly .
A standard PC always has the potential for someone to come along and install performance - hogging software or otherwise compromise the system with configuration changes .
A standardly configured home PC running standard programs cannot have all of its software updated remotely and without the owner 's intervention .
Objection : Early adopters wo n't like it ; late adopters wo n't trust it
Why might the Appliance succeed where the network computer failed ?
A mobile phone in 2005 is a vastly more powerful device than a mobile phone in the 1990s .
Web - based services are much more useful and pervasive than they were in the 1990s .
Network computers were sold by new and unfamiliar companies .
The Appliance will be sold by the consumer 's existing mobile telephony provider , a company with whom he or she already has a relationship and from whom he or she already buys a new $ 200 - 400 device every two years ( though much of this cost is hidden via the carrier 's subsidy ) .
The Appliance might also be subsidized by the carrier .
Most importantly , the Appliance does not try to push everything back out onto the network .
The Appliance stores a consumer 's music library on a local hard disk , for example .
A deeper problem that is hinted at by the failure of the network computer is that the Appliance is a new technology and therefore must by definition be sold to early adopters .
Early adopters are technophiles with the most tolerance for complexity and the most demand for function .
An early adopter , for example , might object to the Appliance because it does n't have a state - of - the - art video card .
A typical consumer might not even know that a computer device has a video card or that there are differences among cards .
However , the typical consumer , a " late adopter " , might be wary of being the first among his acquaintances to buy a new type of device .
The late adopters have been exposed to PCs for 30 years and think of PCs as a safe purchase even if they do n't actually know how to use them .
Probably the best way to push through this problem is to make the Appliances free or very low cost with a service agreement , the same way that carriers have managed to sell hundreds of thousands of expensive smart phones .

Reader 's Comments
It 's about to arrive ( 7 years after the article ) : " Ubuntu for Android : Penguins peck at Nokia 's core problem ... Your smartphone runs Android when it ’s a phone but when you plug into a monitor or dock , Ubuntu kicks in .
Plug in a keyboard and you ’ve got Ubuntu – with the phone serving as your desktop computer . "
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/21/ubuntu_for_android/
You could say this article was very successful in predicting the features of the 2007 iPhone ( and later Android phones ) , which does things like ' play a DVD movie on the big screen ' , stream music and the like .

someone at Microsoft must have read this article ; now in 2015 they want to sell windows phone devices that can double as a desktop ; http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/29/microsoft-announces-continuum-turning-windows-10-phones-into-desktops/ is this done with the focus on corporations / enterprise markets ?
i guess that this will not make more sales for Microsoft , as most corporations are already using windows for the desktop .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military said on Saturday it had charged two U.S. Army soldiers with the “ premeditated murder ” of three Iraqis .
The alleged killings took place in separate incidents in the religiously mixed town of Iskandariya , south of Baghdad , between April and June 2007 , the U.S. military said in a statement .
Staff Sergeant Michael Hensley was charged with three counts of premeditated murder , obstruction of justice and of wrongfully placing weapons beside the dead bodies in an apparent attempt to cover up the crimes .
Specialist Jorge Sandoval was charged with one count of premeditated murder and with putting a weapon by the body .
Both soldiers are from the 1st Battalion , 501 Infantry Regiment based at Fort Richardson in Alaska .
They are being held in Kuwait pending trial , the military said .
Microsoft on Tuesday launches a fierce attack on Google over its “ cavalier ” approach to copyright , accusing the internet company of exploiting books , music , films and television programmes without permission .
Tom Rubin , associate general counsel for Microsoft , will say in a speech in New York that while authors and publishers find it hard to cover costs , “ companies that create no content of their own , and make money solely on the back of other people ’s content , are raking in billions through advertising and initial public offerings ” .
Mr Rubin ’s remarks , presaged in an article in Tuesday ’s Financial Times , come as Google faces criticism and legal pressure from media companies over services allowing users to search online for books , films , television programmes and news .
Viacom , the US media group , instructed YouTube , which Google owns , to remove 100,000 clips of copyright material .
The Authors Guild and a group of publishers backed by the Association of American Publishers have separately sued Google for making digital copies of copyrighted books from libraries without permission .
Mr Rubin will tell the AAP ’s annual meeting that Google ’s decision to take digital copies of all books in various library collections , unless publishers tell it not to , “ systematically violates copyright , deprives authors and publishers of an important avenue for monetising their works and , in doing so , undermines incentives to create ” .
He will say Google is breaching copyright law because it has “ bestowed upon itself the unilateral right to make entire copies of copyrighted books ” .
Google thinks it is acting legally because it publishes only “ snippets ” of copyrighted works unless it has the publisher ’s permission .
But Mr Rubin will say in Tuesday ’s speech : “ Google is saying to you and other copyright owners : ‘ Trust us , you ’re protected .
We ’ll keep the digital copies secure .
We ’ll only show snippets .
We wo n’t harm you , we ’ll promote you ’ .
“ But … anyone who visits YouTube … will immediately recognise that it follows a similar cavalier approach to copyright . ”
Microsoft is trying to differentiate itself from Google by portraying itself as more sympathetic to copyright holders than Google , and has sent a letter to executives of big media conglomerates , offering to work with them to eliminate piracy from Soapbox , a new video service on MSN .
Patricia Schroeder , AAP president , said it had agreed to work with Microsoft and others to develop principles on responsible book search .
Google said it believed it was acting legally and ethically in providing snippets of in - copyright books and added that it removed books promptly when contacted by publishers .
It said it generated more than $ 3bn of advertising revenues for other internet sites last year , which showed that it did not simply exploit the content of others .
He 's finished his third novel , is adding Mandarin to his language library and is keen on particle physics .
But what does Michael Dowling , 11 , make of chips , sweets and his peers ?
Zoe Williams finds out
Michael Dowling is 11 years old and has an IQ of 170 .
This puts him in the top 0.2 % of the country .
I would have trouble putting an age on him , down the phone , not because of the preternatural intelligence , but because he has a very easy conversational manner .
I know for a fact that one normally does n't become comfortable talking to strangers over the phone until the age of 27 .
Michael is one of the high - achieving children in a new Channel 4 series which documents the lives of 10 gifted children growing up in the UK and regularly updates us on their progress , Seven - Up style .
He has just delivered his third fantasy novel to the publishers , which he wrote with his mother , Diana , an Oxford don .
" I think that any child can write a book , " he says , and it is strange to hear him describe himself , even obliquely , as a child , when he sounds so unlike one .
I do n't think he really thinks of himself as one , either .
I think he is just being polite .
" It 's just difficult physically to write it , because your ideas are always sprinting ahead .
I think I can see myself having ideas to write for the rest of my life .
The only problem is , will I learn to write fast enough to keep up with my ideas ?
You can hear 40 words per second , you can think 120 words a second .
Writing is probably about two per second . "
I want to be the first person to introduce him to the concept of sitting about , staring at a wall , but it does n't come out right .
I am fascinated when great gifts reveal themselves in children ( I think Tiger Woods finishing a golf course at 18 months might be one of my favourite stories ) , so , after we have cleared the hurdle of whether or not he would call himself gifted - " I dislike the term gifted .
It 's sort of a label .
It 's put on people just because they 're more intelligent than other people , in one area or several " - I ask when his parents first thought he might be , you know , differently abled .
" It was really when I learnt to read , when I was about four .
I was reading books at five which several 12 - year - olds would probably enjoy . "
His first memory is " falling down the stairs outside my house .
Rather strangely , I remember it in the third person , which is impossible . "
His parents sent him to the Dragon , a prep school in Oxford ; I do n't think it 's actually in the phone book as School for Geniuses , but you would feel a lot more like a fish out of water there not knowing Latin than you would , say , knowing it .
Nevertheless , it had its disadvantages : " I was spending about 14 hours a week in the car ; it was far too long , it was absorbing all of my life .
And various aspects of the school were not quite up to scratch . "
Now he is home - schooled , with fencing on the side and exercise periods : " I usually go for a run to the loch and back , and then run over on various pieces of exercise machinery we have at home , then I do sit-ups , then I do sprints because I 'm trying to raise my VO2 max , which is the maximum consumption of oxygen per kilogram of muscle . "
You can imagine , when people meet him for the first time , their nodding sagely at him and then having to look up half the things he 's said when they get home .
That 's what I had to do , anyway .
At the moment I guess Michael 's proficiency as polymath is the most distinctive thing about him .
He had a grounding in Greek , Latin and Anglo - Saxon ( " which is great fun " ) ; he remembers later that he studied Hebrew for two years , between five and seven , and he is currently learning Mandarin " but I can't speak it , because it 's mainly a written language .
But I know some Chinese .
I can say ' four slices of bread ' . "
He then says " four slices of bread " , or at least , I assume he does .
" The only problem is , " he continues , " will I learn to say , ' Please may I have ? ' "
I could honestly listen to him all day . . . he talks with such precision and care , and he approaches everything with such idiosyncratic seriousness .
Like chips , for instance .
He 's a very keen cook of medieval feasts , but I want to know whether or not he likes chips .
" I despise McDonald 's because it is a global corporation and it's speeding up global warming by cutting down the Amazonian rainforests .
And chips , chips would be OK if they were home - made and nice , but most are n't , and the ones that are home - made usually come from a nearby shop .
They 're too sweet or soggy . "
And sweets ?
" Sweets contain far too much sugar , which makes your blood sugar rise and fall .
You 're not even a person , it turns you into a bouncy , hyperactive bunny and then in no time into a gloomy , hungry person . "
The obvious question , here , is how he gets on with his peers ; he dispatches this rather elegantly .
" Not meaning to be impertinent , do you like every adult that you meet ? "
" No , not at all , " I say .

Alan Watts discusses viewing work as a dance , and how life is spontaneous , instead of driven by external forces .
SPRINGFIELD — A $ 38,000 clock .
Four - hundred - dollar doorknobs .
Redecorated bathrooms for state legislators and staff — more than $ 444,000 .
Those are among the hidden costs of a multimillion - dollar makeover of the Illinois House and Senate with opulent showpieces re-creating the look of the chambers in the late 1800s .
With work finished , a Chicago Sun-Times review of construction documents unearthed expenditures one GOP lawmaker said would “ appall ” her constituents .
“ Certainly , the chamber has to be nice and to befit a state of our stature .
It ’s not like we ’re Mississippi .
We ’re a rich state , ” said Rep. Jack Franks ( D - Woodstock ) .
“ But it does n’t mean we should waste taxpayers ’ money .
You see these types of expenditures , and you have to question whether we could have gotten the same effect for a lot less . ”
Work began in 2001
Aides to House Speaker Michael Madigan ( D - Chicago ) and Senate President Emil Jones ( D - Chicago ) called the shots on the work , which started in 2001 .
Gov. Blagojevich ’s administration managed construction .
A Madigan aide said planners set out in painstaking detail to re-create the original look of the chambers .
Historic renovation is inherently expensive , the aide said , and this work should last decades .
“ We ’re looking at the restoration of a landmark space that serves as sort of the office for 200 or 300 people on a daily basis when the Legislature is in session and a visitors ’ destination for tens of thousands , ” Madigan spokesman Steve Brown said .
“ I ’m not sure when you talk about renovating a 130 - year - old structure , how you can compare costs , ” Brown said .
In the washrooms , used during the five months lawmakers are in Springfield , records show urinals were upgraded to top - of - the - line , “ touchless ” models that cost $ 950 each .
Other urinals from the same manufacturer sell for as little as $ 178 .
On this project , the state intended to install models that cost between $ 500 and $ 600 , but opted for the costliest version because of enhanced durability .
“ With the $ 500 or $ 600 urinal , we ’d have gotten 10 to 20 years use out of it .
The upgrade provides 30 to 40 years of longevity , ” Jones spokeswoman Cindy Davidsmeyer said .
Since the renovation , House members have dried their hands on high - quality paper towels embossed with the state seal and the word “ House ” rather than paper towels found in the Capitol ’s public restrooms .
The House towels are produced “ in - house ” at no cost , Brown said .
‘ Worst possible time ’
A government watchdog does n’t fault the state for wanting the House and Senate to appear true to their historical origins but believes some niceties go too far — particularly during a time of potential tax increases , legislative pay raises and no relief for consumers facing soaring electricity and property tax bills .
“ I ca n’t think of a worst possible , frickin’ time for them to be doing this , ” said Jay Stewart , the Better Government Association ’s executive director .
“ Pay raises for us , gridlock for everyone else .
And , by the way , we ’ll have really nice bathrooms . ”
Other expenses include automated window shades in the House that cost $ 15,128 , a custom - made brass clock in the Senate that cost $ 38,582 and 27 custom - made doorknobs bearing the state seal that cost $ 405 each .
In the House , four crystal chandeliers were rebuilt and attached to a new motorized hoisting system for $ 497,795 .
A new , backlit , stain - glass laylight cost $ 456,201 .
Custom - built desks used by the 177 lawmakers are made of solid mahogany , one of the most expensive hardwoods available but the type used originally at the Statehouse .
Blagojevich ’s administration said it could not provide a per-unit price , but records show four models of the desks cost $ 40,000 to build .
“ We ’re very proud of the beautiful renovation and the work that went into restoring the Senate chamber .
We feel the work that was done was an investment in our Capitol , which is the people ’s building , ” Davidsmeyer said .
Rank - and - file lawmakers approved $ 28 million for the renovation .
So far , $ 20.2 million has been spent .
“ My constituents are going to be appalled when they read those numbers , ” said Sen. Christine Radogno ( R - Lemont ) when told about the doorknobs and clock .
“ This is a prime example of why the public just does n’t want a tax increase .
They do n’t believe their money is being spent wisely .
It ’s tough to disagree . ”
The premise of the “ Verified by VISA ” program seems fine : request a password to allow the use of a credit card online , to lower credit card fraud ( besides the problem of having to manage yet another password ) .
However , there were several problems with how I was introduced to the program :
I was unexpectedly requested to register my card after doing some shopping online on a site that allowed customer comments , and had forced me to turn on JavaScript .
I knew nothing about this program , and the request was presented in an authoritative manner , implying that I * had * to register or else my purchase would be denied .
( Bull !
Even though I closed my browser without completing the registration , my purchase went through )
I was asked for the last 4 digits of my SSN as proof of identity (! ) , along with information I had just provided to the online merchant ( CC number , phone number , etc … )
There was no explanation or link to an explanation of what was going on , why VISA would want me to register my card and what was this program .
That appeared to me more like a phishing attempt , exploiting a XSS vulnerability , than anything else .
After contacting my bank , I was assured that the program was legitimate .
Visa actually has a web site where you can register your card for the program :
https://usa.visa.com/personal/security/vbv/index.html
On that site , you will find that most links to explanations are broken .
I get a “ Sorry !
The page you ’ve requested cannot be found . ” when clicking almost all of them ( I found out later that it works if you activate JavaScript ) .
Another issue is that you need to activate JavaScript in order to provide that sensitive information , therefore exposing your browser to exploits against the browser and to any XSS exploits ( I ’m not worried as much about the VISA site , which does n’t have user - submitted content , as much as the shopping sites ) .
If you are not using NoScript or forget to disable JavaScript afterwards , then you expose yourself to exploits from all the future sites you will visit .
It ’s irresponsible and unnecessary : there was nothing in the JavaScript - activated forms ( or in the explanations ) that could n’t have been done with regular HTML .
It ’s all in the name of security …
A fundamental issue I have with this process is that commands ( the registration ) to reach a higher level of security are issued in - band , using the very medium and means ( browser ) that are semi-trusted and part of the problem we ’re trying to solve ( I realize that this program addresses other threats , such as the vulnerability of CC numbers stored by merchants ) .
Moreover , doing this exposes more sensitive credentials .
It is almost like hiring a thief as a courier for the new keys to the building , while giving him as well the key to the safe where all the keys are stored .
The Visa program also enables a new kind of attack against credit cards .
If criminals get their hands on your last 4 SSN digits ( or if they guess it , it ’s only 9999 brute force attempts ) and your credit card number , they could register it themselves , denying you its use !
The motivation for this attack would n’t necessarily be financial gain , but causing you grief .
I also bet that you will have a harder time proving that fraud occurred , and may get stuck with any charges made by the criminals .
The correct way of registering for this program would be by using a trusted channel , such as showing up at your bank in person to choose a password for your credit card , or through registered mail with signatures .
However , these are not available options for me ( I wonder if some banks offer this service , and if so , whether they are not simply using the above web site ) .
There should also be a way to decline participation in the program , and block the future registration of the card .
In conclusion , this poorly executed program had a reverse effect on me : I now distrust my Visa card , and Visa itself , a little bit more .
Update :
There does n’t seem to be a limit on the number of times you can try to register a card , enabling the brute force finding of someone ’s last 4 SSN digits ( I tried 20 times .
At the end I entered the correct number and it worked , proving that it still accepted attempts after 20 times ) .
An attacker can then use the last 4 digits of your SSN elsewhere !
Let ’s say , your retirement accounts with Fidelity and others that accept SSNs as user IDs .
For more fun , I attempted to register my credit card again .
I received a message stating that the card was already registered , but I was offered the chance to re-register it anyway and erase my previously entered password simply by entering my name , the complete SSN and phone number .
Is n’t that great , now attackers could validate my entire SSN !
It gets worse .
I entered an incorrect SSN , and the system accepted it .
I was then prompted to enter new passwords .
The system accepted the new passwords without blinking …
Not only is the design flawed , but the implementation fails to properly perform the checks !
Last Day of Summer Camp
Ten calls are coming through on my cell phone at once .
I try to answer them in order .
Finally I get to my mom .
“ Just wanted to see how you are , ” she says .
“ Oh , by the way , Alexis called the cops . ”
I try to treat this as nonchalantly as she is , but mean while I ’m running to find my pants .
I don my gray hoodie , grab my keys , lock the door behind me , and run out into the street , finally saying goodbye .
I just make it —
I see the cops coming in front of my door as I make it to the next block .
I know exactly what to do in these kinds of situations ; I ’ve seen it in all the movies .
Turn off the wireless on the cell phone , pay for everything in cash , do n’t use RFID cards , stick to sidestreets .
I stick to sidestreets , but I still hear the cop sirens buzzing down all the major roads .
There are major roads on every side of me .
The lady across the aisle from me on the plane is pleading with the flight attendant .
She holds her small dog between her legs ( “ oh , do n’t worry , ” she had explained , “ he ’ll stop barking once we take off ” ) , covered in only a blanket .
The attendant is down on his knees , trying to understand what she wants .
He disappears and later I see the woman pouring a small bottle of alcohol into her drink .
Apparently this was a mistake .
The woman starts screaming profanity , locking herself in the bathroom , running up and down the aisles .
Finally , she ’s forcibly restrained .
The pilot comes on loud over the intercom , thanks us for our patience , explains that you ’re not supposed to mix alcohol with certain psychoactive medications , tells us law enforcement will be meeting us at the gate .
Law enforcement meets us at the gate .
“ Please remain in your seats , ” comes the pilot ’s voice .
“ Law enforcement has taken control of the air craft .
No one is permitted to move until law enforcement releases its control of the air craft . ”
Law enforcement relinquishes the air craft and as I exit I see the woman , with a couple policeman in front of her , asking her if she can see the fingers they ’re holding up .
“ God , ” I think .
“ Did n’t I just go through this yesterday ? ”
I forgot how much I hate San Francisco .
The bus takes an hour to arrive , while I have to stand in the human filth of the city .
For some reason they put the major bus transfer point at the same place drug dealers congregate .
It ’s not a very fun place to wait .
I finally get home and tumble into the mat that makes up my bed .
Next thing I remember I ’m in the Moscone Center .
MacWorld is over , but a few signs and people are still around .
I look out a window for a bit and a guy taps me on the shoulder .
“ I think they ’re trying to punk Paul Graham in that room , ” he says , pointing .
I go and see .
Paul Graham is indeed in that room , as is his girlfriend and my co-founders and the other Y Combinators I know and a bunch of people I do n’t recognize ( probably this year ’s batch of Y Combinators ) .
They start surrounding me .
I begin to suspect a trap .
“ What ’s going on here ? ” I ask Steve .
“ Wait a second , you brought me here , did n’t you ? ”
“ What are you talking about ? ” Steve replies .
“ I mean , I remember going to sleep , I remember kind of wanting to wake up , but then all of the sudden I ’m in the Moscone Center ?
How did I get here ?
You must have brought me here , did n’t you ? ”
Steve denies all knowledge , but there ’s a gleam in his eye .
The people surrounding me take a step closer .
“ Alright , ” I say .
“ I ’ll make a deal .
If I can tickle every last one of you , I go free .
Otherwise , you win . ”
They seem to accept the deal .
I begin tickling .
People begin running , dodging , flying around the room .
But I ’m like a heat - seeking missile .
I track down every one of them , extend my hands out , go straight for their armpits .
I win .
I wake up on my mat .
The sun is shining brightly .
It ’s a beautiful day .
I whistle a happy tune .
I go to wait for the bus .
One bus goes by , it ’s too full to stop .
Another comes by after what seems like an eternity .
It ’s almost as full , but I ’m not going to wait for yet another .
I hang from the bar overhead , just barely fitting inside .
There ’s no room for my feet .
The bus gets off a couple blocks from my office .
To get there , I have to walk past the Moscone Center .
That ’s when it comes back to me .
I look hard at the Moscone Center .
“ Oh , ” I say .
“ It must have been a dream . ”
“ Goooood Monday morning , ” I say , entering my office .
That ’s kind of my little thing , my little ritual .
“ Goooood XXX morning , ” I say in a happy voice , replacing the XXX with the name of the day I ’m saying it on .
I only say it once each day .
My co-worker is ignoring me .
I am presented with a letter accepting my resignation .
I am told to collect my “ personal effects ” .
A woman from HR politely escorts me from the premises .
She never says that she is escorting me , but she does stand behind me wherever I go .
I think I am supposed to leave .
I leave .
The sun is shining brightly .
It ’s a beautiful day .
You should follow me on twitter here .

Pushers and Spammers Should Pay
The amount of spam and flooding blogs and mailboxes is getting worse and worse and worse .
This is Akismet ’s graph of ham and spam since they have started .
“ Ham ” is what they call a non -spam message :
The business terms push and pull originated in the marketing and advertising world , but are also applicable in the world of electronic content and supply chain management .
The push / pull relationship is that between a product or piece of information and the one who is moving it .
A customer “ pulls ” things towards themselves , while a producer “ pushes ” things toward customers .
— Push - Pull strategy , Wikipedia
The daily increasing anger against spammers led to the following random thought :
Push content should reward their readers , and with that reward we should be allowed to buy pull content .
Two birds with one stone .
1. Money Online
Two Main Problems
The obvious problem with paid contents is that online payment is a complicated and sometimes insecure process .
Most of my attempts to buy something online were abandoned in the sign up process .
The less obvious problem is that information in our times of ubiquitous free data , spam and democratic publishing has become such a hard sell that one expects a new business model coming up .
A business model that actually pays the consumer for consuming information ( instead of charging him ) .
In the information age attention is the most precious trading good .
Pay your readers
Sounds insane , but if you look at the corporate value of mySpace , youTube , Digg , you realize that it ’s not the information on these sites that makes them so valuable , it ’s the traffic .
The more traffic you get , the higher the value .
The model is not new .
Advertisement works exactly like that .
And it works well .
The visitor ’s attention is the true value you are aiming at .
If users pay attention to you , you pay them back — with quality content or access to quality content .
Okay , but who pays me ?
No doubt : Producing quality information takes a lot of time and skill and should be rewarded accordingly .
Right now the only valuable business model for bloggers , newspapers , the music industry is advertisement or affiliate programs like Amazon .
Having to additionally pay for people to consume your information seems ridiculous — as long as you have high quality information in mind .
What about advertisement or spam ?
What if you get 1 iDollar for each spam mail that you get in your inbox ?
What if you get a share for each banner you click ?
Spam is a popular Monty Python sketch , first broadcast in 1970 .
In the sketch , two customers are trying to order a breakfast from a menu that includes the processed meat product in almost every dish .
The term spam ( in electronic communication , and as of 2006 , general slang ) is derived from this sketch .
— Spam ( Monty Python ) , Wikipedia
2. The Value of Attention
Quality information +1 Dollar , ads and spam - 1 Dollar
Obviously you cannot pay out real money right away .
It would be too easy a business for those annoying click farm owners .
Information will be tagged with a price , a negative price for corporate promotion , spam and advertisement , positive price for high end information like newspapers , music , special reports , movies .
Since we ’re flooded with crap , information that is worth our attention has become rare and thus very precious .
Virtual money
You need virtual money for that purpose to not freak people out .
With virtual money you avoid reactions like these : “ What , that article just cost me 50 Cents .
Oh no — I could have bought … chewing gum for that money … ”
Basically you have an account that fills with virtual money that you can trade in for quality information .
As for the value of that information , you can let the market regulate itself .
Users should be able to donate iDollars and thus reward undercharged information .
Companies should be able to buy iDollars in exchange for real money at the central Internet Bank .
Corporations that accumulate a lot of iDollars can sell them back to the bank .
3 . Where to Start
The iDollar Idea : Start with eMail
The introduction of the Penny Black stamp played an important role in the reform of the British Postal System during the 1830’s .
Before this time , postage fees were based on weight and on distance involved .
Postage had to be calculated for each letter , and was typically paid by the addressee .
The introduction of the Penny Black shifted the cost of postage to the sender and eliminated the complexity of postage computation by requiring a uniform , low rate . —
Since when do we pay for sending paper mail ?
So imagine each mail you read from an unknown person will cost them 1 Dollar .
The spamming will end instantly , as flooding people with millions of crap mails in return for a couple of idiots that actually follow the spammer ’s instructions will not pay off anymore .
All you need is an email client with a virtual money system .
Connect Mac Mail with iTunes .
At this point companies could use that service to promote their stuff .
I would n’t mind looking at some glossy
Nike mails from time to time , if they pay me for it — and if I can buy a record on the iTunes store with that money .
The next step : Create ads with payback
Now imagine that each banner you click on will pay a share into your Internet bank account , meaning that with this share you will be allowed to download music , movies , read quality articles .
Obviously banners on high end info sites will reward you better if you click them .
You would n’t mind banner advertisement anymore , would you ?
Internet advertisement would instantly become a huge business ( it already is — for Google ) .
The music industry will smile again , and last but not least , people would write their emails more carefully .

I GREW up watching my father stand on his head every morning .
He was doing sirsasana , a yoga pose that accounts for his youthful looks well into his 60s .
Now he might have to pay a royalty to an American patent holder if he teaches the secrets of his good health to others .
The United States government has issued 150 yoga - related copyrights , 134 patents on yoga accessories and 2,315 yoga trademarks .
There ’s big money in those pretzel twists and contortions — $ 3 billion a year in America alone .
It ’s a mystery to most Indians that anybody can make that much money from the teaching of a knowledge that is not supposed to be bought or sold like sausages .
Should an Indian , in retaliation , patent the Heimlich maneuver , so that he can collect every time a waiter saves a customer from choking on a fishbone ?
The Indian government is not laughing .
It has set up a task force that is cataloging traditional knowledge , including ayurvedic remedies and hundreds of yoga poses , to protect them from being pirated and copyrighted by foreign hucksters .
The data will be translated from ancient Sanskrit and Tamil texts , stored digitally and available in five international languages , so that patent offices in other countries can see that yoga did n’t originate in a San Francisco commune .
It is worth noting that the people in the forefront of the patenting of traditional Indian wisdom are Indians , mostly overseas .
We know a business opportunity when we see one and have exported generations of gurus skilled in peddling enlightenment for a buck .
The two scientists in Mississippi who patented the medicinal use of turmeric , a traditional Indian spice , are Indians .
So is the strapping Bikram Choudhury , founder of Bikram Yoga , who has copyrighted his method of teaching yoga — a sequence of 26 poses in an overheated room — and whose lawyers sent out threatening notices to small yoga studios that he claimed violated his copyright .

Ever wondered how some people can “ put themselves into another person ’s shoes ” and some people cannot ?
Our ability to empathise with others seems to depend on the action of “ mirror neurons ” in the brain , according to a new study .
Mirror neurons , known to exist in humans and in macaque monkeys , activate when an action is observed , and also when it is performed .
Now new research reveals that there are mirror neurons in humans that fire when sounds are heard .
In other words , if you hear the noise of someone eating an apple , some of the same neurons fire as when you eat the apple yourself .
So - called auditory mirror neurons were known only in macaques .
To determine if they exist in humans Valeria Gazzola , at the school of behavioural and cognitive neurosciences neuroimaging centre at the University of Groningen , the Netherlands , and colleagues , put 16 volunteers into functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scanners and observed their brains as they were played different noises .
The volunteers heard noises such as a sheet of paper being torn , or of someone crunching potato chips .
Then the same subjects were scanned again , this time whilst tearing a piece of paper , or eating potato chips .

Vicarious crunching
“ We combined the data from listening and execution and looked to see if the activity in the brain overlaps , ” says Gazzola ’s colleague Christian Keysers , also at the University of Groningen .
Sure enough , it did overlap .
Motor neurons associated with mouth actions ( crunching ) and hand actions ( ripping ) were activated in both cases .
The overlap occurred in areas of the brain such as the bilateral temporal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus .
“ The mirror system is a particular form of Pavlovian association , ” says Keysers , referring to the classic behavioural experiments where dogs were trained to associate food with the noise of a bell .
“ Each time you crunch a potato chip you hear yourself crunching the chip , and now when you hear someone else crunching it activates your own action neurons . ”
Spectrum of difference
The phenomenon has been exploited by advertisers for years – think of the Coca - cola commercials comprising of just the noise of a bottle of Coke being opened , the fizz of the drink and the sound of the drinking .
And intriguingly , subjects in the study who scored higher in empathy tests also showed higher levels of mirror neuron activation .
Differences in empathy scores and mirror neuron activity have been observed between autistic and non-autistic people , says Keysers , but this is the first time a spectrum of difference has been found in non-autistic people .
“ How empathetic we are seems to be related to how strongly our mirror neuron system is activated , ” he says .
“ It ’s exciting because we can start to look at the diversity of experiences of other people .
Some people see others through themselves , and some are more objective about it . ”
Journal reference : Current Biology ( vol 16 , p 1824 )
Of the 53,500 UK troops deployed to the Gulf war in 1990 - 91 , there are now close to 7,000 who have received a payment or are in receipt of an ongoing war pension for illness or injury relating either to their preparation to deploy or active service .
The Gulf war has been labelled the most toxic war in history .
Troops were subjected to a multiple immunisation programme of up to 14 vaccinations prior to deployment , followed by exposures to organophosphates ( and other pesticides ) , nerve agents to counteract the effects of chemical warfare , depleted uranium , environmental hazards , chemical weapons such as sarin and cyclosarin , and smoke from burning oil wells .
Completed research in the UK has now discounted most of these as the single cause of Gulf war illnesses .
However , work is currently under way in the US and elsewhere investigating the possible " cocktail effect " of these multiple exposures .
Research has confirmed , however , that Gulf war veterans are more than twice as likely to report symptoms of ill health , and to be suffering more severely from them , than their military contemporaries of equivalent age , gender , rank and branch of service .
Symptoms largely fall into four categories : musculoskeletal , neurological , respiratory and psychological .
Sadly , even though 16 years have passed , the veterans and the scientific community are still no clearer on the causes of their illnesses , some of which have proved terminal .
Epidemiological studies used to investigate causal links with illness have been hampered by the lack of accurate data , including service records and medical and / or vaccination records .
Health surveillance was not carried out during deployment , or immediately post deployment .
Additionally , this lack of clarity on exposures has resulted in lengthy delays for veterans seeking pensions and compensation for their conditions .
Still more controversy surrounds administrative problems with the programme of medical countermeasures in the lead - up to and during deployment of British troops to Kuwait and Iraq .
In 2003 , the government spokesperson for defence admitted in the House of Lords that these included breaches of the policy of voluntary informed consent on immunisations , the use of unlicensed and unproven vaccinations , and ignoring medical advice from the Department of Health on the potential adverse reactions of administering the vaccine cocktail .
Tomorrow , the Royal British Legion will host a conference in Birmingham for veterans of the Gulf war .
The conference will aim to update veterans - many of whom are in broken health - on the progress that has been made since the release of the findings of an independent public inquiry into Gulf war illnesses in 2004 , and offer input on future policy initiatives , including demands for a one - off payment of £ 10,000 to those affected .
The day 's programme will include a speech from the minister for veterans , Derek Twigg - the first time in 10 years that a veterans minister has spoken to Gulf veterans about their illnesses - as well as a presentation from Dr Harcourt Concannon on how the military 's pensions appeal tribunal has effectively forced the Ministry of Defence to accept the umbrella term " Gulf war syndrome " on selected hard - fought cases .
The government has continually stated that the time is not right for a public inquiry into the causes of Gulf war illnesses and the handling of the surrounding issues ; a policy which has bred a feeling of rejection among veterans .
The reasons given for this have been that scientific and medical investigations are ongoing .
However , many scientific and medical experts have now concluded that further clinical or causal investigations will probably not produce any further useful outcomes .
The legion has renewed its call on the government to make a definitive statement regarding a public inquiry at tomorrow 's conference .
The government has recognised the call from Gulf veterans for further research into rehabilitation and health and social care models that can improve the quality of life and general health of veterans and their families .
Identifying useful models needs to become a greater priority .
In 2004 , the Rt Hon Lord Lloyd of Berwick made a recommendation for an ex gratia payment for Gulf war veterans as part of the findings of his independent public inquiry into Gulf war illnesses .
Wednesday 's conference will seek support for the immediate offer of the ex gratia payment - based on the government 's failure to protect veterans , the treatment they have received and the resulting anxiety .
The £ 10,000 payment is in line with other UK ex gratia payment schemes .
It should be awarded to all Gulf war veterans who have received a gratuity or war disablement pension , Gulf war widow ( er ) s in receipt of a widow 's pension , and children of Gulf war veterans who are in receipt of a war orphan 's pension .

In the early 1990s , a Russian drilling rig encountered something peculiar two miles beneath the coldest and most desolate place on Earth .
For decades , the workers at Vostok Research Station in Antarctica had been extracting core samples from deep scientific boreholes , and analyzing the lasagna - like layers of ice to study Earth ’s bygone climate .
But after tunneling through 414,000 layers or so⁠— about two miles into the icecap⁠ — the layers abruptly ended .
The ice below that depth was relatively clear and featureless , a deviation the scientists were at a loss to explain .
In search of answers , the men drilled on .
Unbeknownst to the Russians , their drill had mingled with the uppermost reaches of one of the largest freshwater lakes in the world ; a pristine pocket of liquid whose ecosystem was separated from the rest of the Earth millions of years ago .
As for what sort of organisms might lurk in that exotic environment today , no one can really be certain .
In prehistoric times the Antarctic continent was much more temperate , with lush tropical foliage and thriving wildlife .
But millions of years ago the Earth ’s extra -flaky crust caused the landmasses of Australia and South America to gradually peel away from Antarctica , creating a ring of open sea around the southernmost continent .
This allowed a massive oceanic current to begin encircling the pole , deflecting warmer northerly currents away from Antarctica ’s shores .
Without warm water to moderate the temperature , a scab of polar ice developed over the formerly forested lands .
Roughly forty million years later , in 1996 , the men and women of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research ( SCAR ) urged their Russian colleagues to halt their indiscriminate drilling .
From Columbia University
Airborne radar and satellite altimetry had finally managed to penetrate the thick mound of ice over the south pole , and after electromagnetically groping every rock and crevice in Antarctica , a flat region 155 miles long and 31 miles wide was detected below Vostok Station .
As improbable as it seemed , SCAR researchers surmised that a liquid lake must lie just below the Russians ’ steadily advancing bore shaft .
In order to avoid contaminating the huge lake with surface bacteria and drilling chemicals , the tunneling had to be stopped .
Lake Vostok was found to have approximately the same surface area as the great Lake Ontario in North America , with more than thrice the depth .
Separated from sunlight by two miles of solid ice , the subglacial lake is a place of profound darkness and bitter cold .
The water temperature is estimated at 3 degrees below zero Celsius , but it maintains a liquid state due to the crushing weight of the polar ice slab ; the temperature at which water freezes is significantly lower under such phenomenal pressure .
It is also suspected that geothermal heat from the ground below adds some ambient warmth .
According to the ice cores extracted by the Vostok Base scientists , the lonely lake has been sealed beneath the ice for at least 500,000 years , but possibly as much as 25 million .
As requested , the Russians temporarily suspended their drilling efforts pending further study .
Their borehole⁠ — which was filled with sixty tons of kerosene and freon to prevent re-freezing ⁠ — stopped within a mere 300 feet of the lake surface .
The anomalous ice they had encountered turned out to be lake water which had long ago frozen to the bottom of the slowly migrating glacier .
These ice samples provided a few insights into the lake ’s anatomy , such as its lack of salt , and its absurd overabundance of oxygen ; under extreme pressures oxygen will more readily dissolve in water .
If the drilling over Vostok had continued uninterrupted , thereby encroaching upon the liquid portion of the lake , the hapless Russians might have been assaulted by a towering geyser of ancient water and liberated oxygen due to the astonishing pressure of the hidden body of water .
Unusual microbes found in the ice above Lake Vostok
In the wake of the lake ’s discovery , there arose considerable debate regarding the likelihood of finding life there .
The environment is remarkably similar to the dark and cold ocean below the surface of Jupiter ’s ice moon Europa , so the discovery of life in Vostok could have interesting extraterrestrial implications .
Due to the cold , the complete absence of sunlight , and the toxic levels of oxygen , many scientists are certain that Lake Vostok is sterile .
That , however , would be a scientific first , since never before has a completely lifeless body of water been found on Earth .
Extremophile organisms have turned up in the unlikeliest of places , including within volcanic vents on the ocean floor , in the rocks deep in the Earth ’s crust , and in frozen arctic soil .
It is not unreasonable to suggest that cold - tolerant creatures could thrive in the waters of Lake Vostok , overcoming the oxygen saturation with extraordinary natural antioxidants .
But millions of years of evolutionary isolation in an extreme environment may have created some truly bizarre organisms .
This notion is supported by the ice samples drawn from the ice just above Lake Vostok , where some unusual and unidentifiable microbial fossils have been found .
But the possibility that they are merely contaminates has not yet been completely ruled out .
At present , a number of researchers are mulling over methods to investigate the lake ’s unique ecosystem without defiling its pristine nature .
The introduction of any organisms or chemicals from the surface could irreversibly pollute its waters , and there is a small but real possibility that the lake ’s alien organisms could be dangerous to humans .
To date , the best candidate seems to be the cryobot , a fittingly phallic penetrating probe designed to gingerly work its way into the virgin lake .
Its heated tip would melt a channel straight into the ice as it unspools a power and communications line behind it .
The melted water would quickly re-freeze behind the cryobot in temperatures which linger around minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit , and once it finally reached the water it would eject a small submersible hydrobot to capture images and take measurements .
The Cryobot is happy to see you
Though most scientists are proceeding with considerable caution , and some advocate avoiding the lake altogether , there are reports that the Russian researchers intend to restart drilling in order to reach the lake before their rivals .
The Antarctic Treaty of 1961 guarantees all nations the right to conduct non-military scientific study on the continent , therefore little can be done to intervene if the men at Vostok station insist upon proceeding .
Several smaller lakes have since been identified beneath the Antarctic icecap , but geologists speculate many of these are linked by a network of under-ice rivers , so contaminating just one lake might taint them all beyond repair .
If science seizes the opportunity to properly explore this perplexing pocket of liquid , it would be equally enlightening whether there is a plethora of life or a complete absence thereof .
If the lake is found to be sterile , its desolate waters will provide some measure of insight into life ’s practical limitations .
But if living things do indeed lurk beneath the thick Antarctic icecap⁠ — even if only in microbial form⁠ — their presence will demonstrate that life is made up of truly resilient stuff , with scientific implications well beyond the scope of our planet .
Update 06 February 2012 : The Russians seem to have penetrated the ice and reached the upper reaches of the subglacial lake .
Further penetration is on hold due to international outcry for more precautions .
07 March 2013 : “ Russian scientists believe they have found a wholly new type of bacteria in the mysterious subglacial Lake Vostok in Antarctica , the RIA Novosti news agency reported on Thursday .
The samples obtained from the underground lake in May 2012 contained a bacteria which bore no resemblance to existing types , said Sergei Bulat of the genetics laboratory at the Saint Petersburg Institute of Nuclear Physics . ”
07 July 2013 : “ Analysis of ice cores obtained from the basin of Lake Vostok , the subglacial lake that Russian scientists drilled down to in 2012 , have revealed DNA from an estimated 3,507 organisms .
More info . “
15 January 2019 : Researchers have found life in other Antarctic subglacial lakes — though these are not as far beneath the ice as Lake Vostok .

Description and Rationale
jfli did not see wide porting , due to its use of LispWorks ' sophisticated FLI to access JNI , and the lack of corresponding facilities in some other Lisps
I found that I needed to access already - running instances of the JVM , for instance servlet containers , as done in Lisplets , and felt I could accomplish similar things with less effort with Foil + marshallers
I wanted to access the CLR / CLI in a similar fashion to Java
It allows for more flexibility in dealing with threading issues
Foil provides all the facilities of jfli and more -
Features of jfli that are retained / enhanced :
Automatic function generation for constructors , fields , methods , and properties either by named class , or entire package ( sub ) trees given a jar file or assembly name .
Java / CLI ->
Lisp package and name mapping with an eye towards lack of surprise , lack of conflict , and useful editor completion .
setf - able setter generation for fields and properties
Java / CLI vector creation and aref - like access to Java / CLI vectors .
Constructors that allow for keyword - style property initialization .
Typed references to Java / CLI objects with an inheritance hierarchy on the Lisp side mirroring that on the Java / CLI side - allowing for Lisp methods specialized on Java / CLI class and interface types .
Implementation of arbitrary Java / CLI interfaces in Lisp , and callbacks from Java / CLI to Lisp via those interfaces .
Automatic lifetime maintenance of Lisp - referenced Java / CLI objects , boxing / unboxing of primitive args / returns , string conversions , Java / CLI exception handling , overload resolution etc .
Some of the additions are :
( Hopefully ) Much improved portability ( n.b. it has not been ported , but is mostly standard CL )
Access to the CLR with the same API
Support for CLR and JavaBean properties
Simultaneous access to multiple runtimes
Simultaneous access to the CLR and Java
A marshalling system which can , in a single call , pull across the types , hashcodes , and / or values of reference objects to an arbitrary depth , with user customizable value marshallers .
All references to the same remote object are eq on the Lisp side
on the Lisp side ensure - typed - ref , which makes a remote reference its most fully derived type in Lisp , works in place , using change - class
, which makes a remote reference its most fully derived type in Lisp , works in place , using vector argument boxing , so lightweight vectors - as - arguments can be created in - place without the overhead of multiple calls to create and initialize the vector
keyword - style init of properties in constructor calls is supported by the ctor functions , and can be leveraged in apply and mapping scenarios ( this feature was limited in jfli to the new macro )
Download and Communication
Foil is hosted on SourceForge
We are going to try using SourceForge facilities for all communication regarding Foil , so please use the project tracker and forums there .
Quick Start
( compile - file " /dev/foil/foil.lisp " ) ( load " / dev/foil / foil " ) ( use - package : foil ) ; this is specific to LispWorks ' sockets support ( require " comm " ) ; create a foreign VM ( setf * fvm * ( make - instance ' foreign-vm : stream ( comm : open - tcp - stream " localhost " 13579 ) ) ) ;; ; ; ; ; ; ;; if Java ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;;; ; create a wrapper for dialog class ( def- foil - class " javax.swing.JOptionPane " ) ;use the wrapper ( use - package " javax.swing " ) ; show it ( joptionpane.showmessagedialog nil " Hello World from Lisp " ) ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;; if CLI ;; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;;;; ; create a wrapper for dialog class ( def- foil - class " System. Windows.Forms.MessageBox " ) ;use the wrapper ( use - package " System. Windows .
Forms " ) ; show it ( messagebox . show " Hello World from Lisp " )
Typically you would n't define single class wrappers by hand , but would instead pre-generate wrappers for entire packages using get - library - classnames and dump - wrapper - defs - to - file .
See foil - java.lisp and foil - cli.lisp for examples .
Lisp API Reference
foil.lisp
Foreign VMs
Foil is built upon the notion of interactions with one or more foreign VMs , instances of the JVM or CLR , running the Foil libraries , in another process on the same or another machine .
The connection to a specific VM is via one or more bidirectional streams .
Note that the instantiation of the foreign VM and the establishment of the streams is outside the scope of this Lisp API .
It is presumed you might utilize one of the supplied runtime servers , creating stream connections via sockets or pipes with the API provided by your Lisp implementation .
Many scenarios are possible , including embedding the Foil support libraries into your existing Java or C# application , multiple streams to different threads in the same VM , etc .
A foreign VM is represented by an instance of the foreign - vm class .
Each instance has a primary default stream over which communication will occur .
The special variable * fvm * represents the default VM to which any unqualified Foil calls will be directed , and can be bound in a specific context , thus allowing for multiple VMs .
Note - instance property / method calls will always be routed to the VM hosting that instance .
Foreign VMs maintain their own foreign reference pools , type caches etc , and objects from one VM cannot be passed to another , even if they are both Java or CLI .
However , in multi - thread , multi-stream scenarios , references are valid across threads in the same VM , and the runtime server implementations are thread safe .
A simple startup scenario would look like this :
- First , outside of Lisp , start the Java or CLI Foil runtime server supplied with Foil , running on port 13579 , then :
( load " / dev/foil / foil " ) ( use - package : foil ) ( require " comm " ) ; LispWorks - specific socket library ( setf * fvm * ( make - instance ' foreign-vm : stream ( comm : open - tcp - stream " localhost " 13579 ) ) ) ;use Foil
Special Variable * fvm *
This must be bound to an instance of foreign - vm .
Default : nil
Direct use of this other than during initial setup is not recommended , use instead with - vm or with - vm - of
Special Variable * thread - fvm *
If set , this thread is waiting on a callback from this VM .
Default : nil
This is only used for advanced multi- thread scenarios
Special Variable * thread - fvm- stream *
If this thread is waiting on a callback ( i.e. * thread - fvm * is bound ) , and ( eql * fvm * * thread - fvm * ) , use this stream instead of the primary default stream for the VM .
Default : nil
This is only used for advanced multi- thread scenarios
Class foreign - vm Manages a foreign VM .
Requires the initarg : stream be set to a bidirectional stream with an instance of the Foil runtime services on the other end .
Macro ( with - vm vm &body body )
Causes the body to be evaluated in a context where * fvm * is bound to vm
Macro ( with - vm - of this &body body )

Foreign References
fref
frefs
frefs
fref
frefs
eq
Class fref Reference to a foreign object .
fref is the superclass of all of the Foil classes generated to mirror the foreign hierarchy .
Method ( fref - vm fref ) ->
The foreign - vm from which this reference originated
-> The foreign - vm from which this reference originated Method ( fref - id fref ) ->
An integer ID , unique within a VM
-> An integer ID , unique within a VM Method ( fref - type fref ) -> A Class or Type fref
This will only be set if the type has been marshalled or get - type has been called on this fref .
-> A Class or Type fref Method ( fref - hash fref ) -> int
This will only be set if the hash code has been marshalled or hash has been called on this fref .
-> int Method ( fref - val fref ) ->
A Lisp object representing the value of the object
This will only be set if the value has been marshalled .
-> A Lisp object representing the value of the object Function ( ensure - typed - reference fref ) -> fref , whose class may have been changed Given a generic Foil fref , determines the full type of the object and uses change - class to convert the fref to that type .
Since we do n't want to always incur the cost of type determination , the wrapper - generated API functions return generic references .
Use this function to convert to a typed reference corresponding to the full actual type of the object when desired : CL - USER 42 > ( setf string - class ( get- type- for - name " java.lang . String " ) ) #}1 CL - USER 43 > ( type - of string - class ) FREF CL - USER 44 > ( ensure - typed - ref string - class ) #}1 CL - USER 45 > ( type - of string - class ) CLASS .
Wrapper Generation
Macro ( def- foil - class full - class-name ) -> unspecified
Given the package - qualified , case - correct name of a Java / CLI class as a string , will generate wrapper functions for its public constructors , fields , properties and methods .
The core API for generating interfaces to Java / CLI is the def - foil - class macro .
This macro will , at expansion time , use Java / CLI reflection to find all of the public constructors , fields , properties and methods of the given class and generate functions to access them .
The Generated API When you e.g. ( def-foil - class " java.lang. ClassName " ) you get several symbols / functions : A package named | java.lang| ( note case )
from which the following are exported : A class - symbol : classname .
( note the dot is part of the name )
which can usually be used where a typename is required .
It also serves as the name of the Lisp typed reference class .
Every non-interface class with a public constructor will get ; A constructor , ( classname.new &rest args ) -> fref , which returns a foreign - reference ( fref ) to the newly created object .
Note that the constructor function , and therefore everything built upon it , can take the actual arguments to the Java / CLI ctor , followed by zero or more property initializers , which take the form :
: keywordized - propertyname value
e.g. ( window.new parent : width 200 : height 200 )
thus supporting the creation and some setup of a new object in a single call A method defined on make - new , ultimately calling classname.new , specialized on ( the value of ) the class - symbol Note that if the constructor is overloaded , there is just one function generated , which handles overload resolution .
The function documentation string describes the constructor signature (s ) from the Java / CLI perspective .
The same argument conversions are performed as are for fields ( see below ) .
All public fields will get a getter function :
( classname.fieldname [ instance ] ) -> field value
and a setter :
( setf classname. fieldname [ instance ] )
Instance field wrappers take a first arg which is the instance .
Static fields get a symbol - macro * classname.fieldname *
If the type of the field is primitive , the field value will be converted to a native Lisp value .
If it is a Java / CLI String , it will be converted to a Lisp string .
Otherwise , a foreign reference to the Java / CLI object is returned .
Similarly , when setting , Lisp values will be accepted for primitives , Lisp strings for Strings , or foreign references for reference types .
All public properties ( explicit properties in the case of the CLI , implied properties in the case of Java as specified by the JavaBeans protocol ) will get a getter function if the property supports get :
( classname.propertyname [ instance ] [ args ] ) -> property value
and a setter if the property supports set :
( setf classname.propertyname [ instance ] [ args ] )
Instance property wrappers take a first arg which is the instance .
Static properties get a symbol - macro * classname.propertyname *
Every public method will get a wrapper function :
( classname.methodname &rest args ) -> return - value
As with constructors , if a method is overloaded a single wrapper is created that handles overload resolution .
The same argument and return value conversions are performed as are for fields .
The function documentation string describes the method signature (s ) from the Java / CLI perspective .
A Lisp class with the class - symbol as its name .
It will have as its superclasses other Lisp classes corresponding to the Java / CLI superclass / superinterfaces , some of which may be forward - referenced - classes , and will be ultimately derived from fref .
An instance of this class will be returned by ensure - typed - ref , at which point the entire hierarchy will consist of finalized standard - classes .
Note that , due to the need to reference other Java / CLI types during the definition of a class wrapper , symbols , classes , and packages relating to those other types may also be created .
In all cases they will be created with names and packages as described above .
When you e.g. you get several symbols / functions : Function ( get- library - classnames jar - or - assembly - filename &rest packages ) -> list - of - strings Returns a list of class name strings .
Packages should be strings of the form " java / lang " or " System / IO " for recursive lookup and " java / util / " or " System / IO / " ( note trailing slash ) for non-recursive .
Function ( dump - wrapper - defs - to - file filename classnames ) -> filename Given a list of classnames ( say from get - library - classnames ) , writes the consolidated expansions of calls to def- foil - class to a file : ( dump-wrapper-defs-to- file " /lisp/java-lang.lisp " ( get-library - classnames " / j2sdk1.4.2_01/jre/lib/rt.jar " " java/lang / " ) ) ( compile - file " / lisp/ java - lang " ) ( load " / lisp/ java - lang " ) ( use - package " java.lang " )
; Wrappers for all of java.lang are now available
This is the recommended way to access entire library packages .
In particular , it has the advantage that the dumped code does not require a foreign runtime to either compile or load .
Object Creation
classname.new
Generic Function ( make - new classname . &rest args ) -> fref Allows for definition of before / after methods on constructors .
Calls classname.new ctor .
The new macro expands into a call to this .
Macro ( new class - spec args & body body ) -> fref class - spec -> class - sym | ( class - sym this - name )
class - sym -> classname .
args -> as per ctors and make - new Creates a new instance of class , using the make - new generic function , then runs the body replacing all top - level calls of the form ( . anything whatever ) with ( classname .
anything new - object whatever )
If this - name is supplied it will be bound to the newly - allocated object and available to the body ( note - but not to the args ! )
Example : ( new shell .
( * display * : text " SWT Apropos " : layout ( gridlayout.new 1 t ) ) ( . setsize 800 600 ) ( .setlocation 100 100 ) ) Expands into : ( LET ((#: G2249 ( MAKE - NEW SHELL .
* DISPLAY * :TEXT " SWT Apropos " : LAYOUT ( GRIDLAYOUT.NEW 1 T ) ) ) ) ( PROGN ( SHELL .
SETSIZE #:G2249 800 600 ) ( SHELL .
SETLOCATION #:G2249 100 100 ) ) #: G2249 )
Object Services
Function ( equals fref1 fref2 ) -> boolean Portable Object.equals / Equals
Function ( instance - of fref type ) -> boolean Portable instanceof / is
Function ( to - string fref ) -> string Portable Object.toString /ToString
Function ( hash fref &key rehash ) -> int Portable Object.hasCode/GetHashCode .
Note : will cache the value on the fref .
If already cached , will return that , unless : rehash is t .
Function ( get - type fref ) -> Class or Type fref Portable Object.getClass/GetType.
Note : will cache the value on the fref .
Note also that obtaining the exact type of the object is completely independent of the coercion of the fref to its corresponding Lisp type ( see ensure - typed - ref )
Function ( iref indexable - obj &rest indexes ) -> a value Calls the default indexer for the object .
CLI only .
Settable .
Vectors
Function ( make - new - vector type length &rest inits ) -> array fref Creates a foreign vector of specified type and length .
There can be fewer inits than the length , in which case the remaining values take the default .
Function ( vref vector index ) -> value Returns the value at the index .
Settable .
Function ( vlength vector index ) -> int Returns the length of the vector .
Miscellaneous
Arguments and Boxing
In most cases argument matching and conversion should be transparent .
Lisp strings can be passed where Strings are required , Lisp numbers where int float etc are required .
t and nil can be passed where booleans are required etc. nil can be passed for null .
Some Foil APIs ( e.g. make - new - vector ) require type arguments , and unless specified otherwise , any of the following are acceptable :
( the value of ) A class - symbol - classname .
A primitive designator keyword - : boolean| : byte|:char|:double|:float|:int|:long|:short
A fref referring to an actual Class / Type instance
A " package.qualified .ClassName " string , case - sensitive .
This is least efficient and should only be used in dynamic scenarios .
Occasionally it may be necessary to provide a hint as to the intended type of a numeric argument in order to force resolution to a particular overload .
Function ( box type val )
Type must be a primitive designator keyword - : boolean| : byte| :char|:double|:float|: int|:long| : short
Produces an object that when passed to a Foil - generated function will be interpreted by the runtime as that type .
Note that silent truncation may occur .
It is also possible to create vectors in - line as arguments , which will avoid multiple round - trips vs. calling make - new - vector in place .
Note this is only good for ephemeral vectors , as there is no way to retain a reference to the newly - created vector .
Function ( box - vector type &rest vals )
Produces an object that when passed to a Foil - generated function will be an array of type with the supplied values .
CL - USER 102 > ( vref ( box - vector string . " a " " b " " c " " d " )
2 ) ; only one round - trip " c "
Class / Type Helpers
Function ( get - type - for - name full - class - name ) Returns a Class / Type instance corresponding to name .
Portable Class.forName/Type.GetType .
Function ( full - class - name class - symbol )
Returns the package qualified name string corresponding to the class symbol : CL - USER 104 > ( full - class - name string . ) " java.lang .
String "
Proxies and Callbacks
Generic Function ( handle - proxy - call method - symbol proxy &rest args ) )
The proxy infrastructure routes all callbacks to this generic function .
If a proxy p implements an interface i , and the foreign VM ends up invoking i.foo on p , it will map to a call to handle - proxy - call with the first 2 arguments of ' i.foo and p , followed by the actual arguments to the invocation .
So , callback handlers can be defined by specializing methods on the method - symbol , the proxy object , or both .
The unspecialized method spews out " unhandled proxy call " to standard output and returns nil to the foreign VM .
Any unhandled errors that occur on the Lisp side during a callback turn into exceptions on the runtime server .
Function ( make - new - proxy arg - marshall - flags arg - marshall - depth &rest interface - types ) -> proxy fref Creates and returns a proxy object that implements the given interface types or delegate type .
arg - marshall - flags and arg - marshall - depth will be used to marshall the arguments to the callback .
No handlers are defined by this function .
Macro ( new - proxy proxy arg - marshall - flags arg - marshall - depth &rest interface - defs ) -> proxy fref Creates and returns a proxy object that implements the given interface types or delegate .
proxy -> a symbol
interface - def -> ( interface - name method - defs + )
interface - name -> classname .
( must name an interface or delegate type )
method - def -> ( method - name ( args * ) body )
method - name -> symbol ( without classname )
The symbol proxy will be bound to the proxy instance in the body of the method implementations .
Example : ( new - proxy p +MARSHALL -ID+ 0 ( keylistener .
( keyreleased ( event ) ( when ( eql * SWT.CR * ( keyevent.character event ) ) ( gob ) ) ) ) )
Marshalling
Foil supports an extensible marshalling system which allows the values of reference / composite types to be returned in addition to , or even instead of , the references themselves .
Used appropriately , this can substantially reduce the number of round trips between processes and avoid significant ' chatter ' overhead .
Marshalling comes into play whenever a reference type is returned from a Foil function .
With certain settings , it is possible to return any or all of a reference , its hash code , its type , and its value ( and the same for any of its value 's reference members ) , to a specific depth .
The nature and depth of the marshalling is governed by two special variables on the Lisp side - * marshalling - flags * and * marshalling - depth * .
The format of marshalled values is determined by the runtime servers , and both the Java and CLI servers provided with Foil have facilities for adding new marshallers for specific types .
The way an object 's value is marshalled is a function of its type .
Class or Types will always marshall the string representing the packageQualifiedTypeName , ignoring * marshalling - depth *
By default , the following marshalling will be performed when requested , i.e. * marshalling - depth * > 0
Arrays marshall as simple Lisp vectors
Collections and other enumerable entities marshall as simple Lisp lists
Default , if no other marshaller applies - a Lisp assoc - list of keywordized - property - name / value pairs for any public properties of the object
Special Variable * marshalling - depth * Default : 0
A depth of 0 means no values are marshalled , a setting of 1 means that values will be marshalled for the returned object ( if it is a reference ) , but not any nested references .
When > 1 nested reference types will marshall , to that depth of nesting .
Special Variable * marshalling - flags * Either +MARSHALL-NO -IDS + , or the logical or-ing of +MARSHALL -ID + and zero or more of : +MARSHALL -HASH + and +MARSHALL -TYPE +
Default : +MARSHALL-ID +
A setting of +MARSHALL -NO -IDS + means that no frefs will be returned , and thus no references will be held on the VM side .
If * marshalling - depth * is 0 then nil will be returned .
If * marshalling - depth * > 0 then the value will be returned instead of the fref .
Otherwise , +MARSHALL -ID + must be set , and frefs will be returned for reference types .
If * marshalling - depth * > 0 , then the marshalled values will be in the fref -val slot .
If +MARSHALL - HASH + is set then the object 's hash code will be calculated and stored in the fref - hash slot .
Similarly , if +MARSHALL -TYPE + is set then the object 's class / type will be determined and stored in the fref - type slot .
Macro ( with - marshalling ( depth &rest flags ) & body body )
Evaluates the body in a context in which the * marshalling - depth * is set to depth and * marshalling - flags * to the logior of flags .
Function ( marshall fref )
Explicitly marshalls the object with the current * marshalling - flags * and * marshalling - depth * settings , and returns the marshalled object ( which may be the same fref , but with additional data in its type / hash / val slots )

Runtime Servers
Foil includes 2 complete implementations of the runtime server portion of the protocol , one for Java / JVM , the other for C# / CLI .
The implementations are 100 % Java / Managed , and use only standard libraries .
Both will run the protocol over one or more TCP sockets specified on the command line , or , if none specified , via standard IO .
Project files are included for Eclipse and Visual Studio .
All of the Java code is in com/ richhickey / foil and the stand - alone server is in RuntimeServer .
Main .
The CLI implementation is in 2 projects , one for the Foil library itself - FoilCLI , and the other for the stand - alone server - FoilCLISvr .
After building , you can invoke the Java server as follows :
java - cp .
com.richhickey.foil.RuntimeServer 13579
Make sure the classpath includes the libraries and . jars you will want to use via Foil .
After building , you can invoke the CLI server as follows :
foilclisvr 13479

Where typename is one of : byte :int : long : short : float : double
N.B. silent truncation may occur
Return values should never be boxed
vector literals
#{:vector " packageQualifiedTypeName " |tref| : int ( etc ) value ...}
References
#{:ref id rev : type a - ref : hash an - int :val marshalled - value}
: ref , id , and rev must be supplied , all others are optional
id - A unique integer reference that identifies the object .
The object will be kept alive on the hosting side until it is freed .
Multiple references to the same object will always have the same id .
: type -
A reference to the Type ( CLI ) or Class ( Java ) object that is the type of the object .
Note that this may be the first time this reference is seen ( and thus it must be registered for lifetime maintenance )
This will only be available if the marshall - type flag is set .
: hash -
An integer representing the hash value of the object .
This will only be available if the marshall - hash flag is set .
:val - A Lisp - readable representation of the value of the object .
This will be obtained by using the marshaller registered for the type of the object .
This will only be available when marshall - value - depth - limit is >
0 . Note #{ and #} user - space read macros are used by the implementation of foil .
A reference ( obtained previously ) is passed back to its host like this :
#}123
The host will look up the object with that id and pass it along to the call .
Exception Reporting
( :err " error description " " stack trace " )
if an exception occurred while processing the request .
Unless the exception originated in the reflection API , it is preferred that the stack trace be of the inner ( reflection - invoked ) call .
Object support services
Object references
Object lifetime management
( : free refid refrev ... )
a list of id / rev pairs is passed .
Allows one or more refs to be GC -ed on the hosting side .
It is an error to refer to these refids again .
Object marshalling
It is anticipated that runtime servers will provide for user - installable marshallers , associated with types , that will render the value of an object of that type on a stream in a form readable by Lisp .
By default at least the following marshallers should be provided :
Type|Class - must always marshall the string representing the packageQualifiedTypeName , ignoring marshalling - depth
arrays - should marshall as simple vector literals : #(...)
collections and other enumerable entities - should marshall as simple lists (...)
default , if no other marshaller applies - should yield an assoc - list of keywordized - property - name / value pairs
In addition to marshalling returns during calls , the value of an object reference can be explicitly marshalled :
( : marshall ref marshall - flags marshall - value - depth - limit ) ->
Lisp - readable - value
Hash values
( : hash ref ) -> int
Object equality
( :equals ref ref ) -> t|nil , per Object .
Equals
ToString
( : str ref ) -> " string value "
Reflection Services
Obtaining a reference to a Type / Class object
( : tref " packageQualifiedTypeName " )
Object type
( : type - of ref )
( : is - a ref tref ) -> t|nil
( : bases tref| " packageQualifiedTypeName " )
-> ( :ret ( " packageQualifiedTypeName " ... ) ) ; most - derived to least - derived
( : members tref| " packageQualifiedTypeName " )
-> ( : ret ( ( : ctors doc-string ... ) ( : methods ( ( : name string ) ( : static bool ) ( : doc doc- string ) ) ... ) ( : fields ( ( : name string ) ( : static bool ) ( : doc doc- string ) ) ... ) ( : properties ( ( : name string ) ( : static bool ) ( : get - doc doc- string ) ( : set - doc doc- string ) ) ... ) ) )
Proxies
( : proxy marshall - flags marshall - value - depth - limit interface - trefs ...)
-> ( : ret proxy - ref )
Creates a proxy object that implements the given interface (s ) .
When any of the object 's methods are called , sends a : proxy - call message of the form :
( : proxy - call method - symbol proxy - ref args ... )
where the proxy - ref is the same one originally returned from the : proxy message , and the args are marshalled with the flags and depth requested in the : proxy message .
method - symbol has the form
|package.name|::classname.methodname
note this means that the Lisp names are not independent , hmmm ...
Vectors
( : vector tref| " packageQualifiedTypeName " length value ...)
Creates an vector of the specified type with the specified length Initial values are optional and may be fewer than the length .
-> aref
( : vget aref marshall - flags marshall - value - depth - limit index ) -> value
( : vset aref index value ) -> nil
( : vlen aref ) -> int
Summary
I 'd like to thank my good friend Eric Thorsen for his hard work on the CLI / C# port .
I hope you find Foil useful .
It is my sincere intent that it enhance the utility and interoperability of Common Lisp .
I welcome comments and code contributions .

Introduction
Computer performance have increased at an amazing rate in recent years , and unfortunately so does power consumption .
An ultimate gaming system equipped with a quad - core processor , two NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra , 4 sticks of DDR2 memory and a few hard drives can easily consume 200W without doing anything !
To reduce power wastage , a few industry standards have been developed to make our computers work more efficiently .
In January 1992 , Intel and Microsoft developed APM ( Advanced Power Management ) to manage power when a computer system is idling .
Later in December 1996 , the successor of APM – the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ( ACPI ) specification was developed by Compaq , Microsoft , Intel , Phoenix and Toshiba as the industry open - standard power management interface .
What 's the difference ?
Let 's take a look :
Advanced Power Management ( APM ) Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ( ACPI ) • Cheap implementation , but not effective .
• Application and driver send control to APM driver directly .
• Device power is managed by its own driver .
• Other hardware like CPU is managed by APM BIOS .
• Power management state machine is done by APM BIOS since it is simple .
•
Implementation is more costly , but effective .
• Application does n't need to manage power .
• Device driver uses ACPI to interface with hardware power management .
• ACPI is abstract , thus OS and hardware can evolve separately .
• Power management state machine is complex , hence handle by the operating system .
In this article , I will not go into APM as most PC use ACPI these days .
The Regressive Imagery Dictionary
The Regressive Imagery Dictionary ( RID ) is a coding scheme for text analysis that is designed to measure “ primordial ” and conceptual content .
Primordial thought is the kind of free - form , associative thinking involved in fantasy and dreams .
Like Freud 's id , I guess .
Conceptual ( or secondary ) thought is logical , reality - based and focused on problem solving .
RID contains about 3,000 words grouped into categories that are themselves classified as primary , secondary , and emotional .
A piece of text is classified by what percentage of its words fall into each category .
I 'm skeptical , but it seemed like it might be fun .
And some people do think it 's accurate and useful :
Detailed evidence concerning the reliability and validity of the Regressive Imagery Dictionary is reported elsewhere ( Martindale , 1975 , 1990 ) .
Evidence for the construct validity of primordial vs. conceptual content comes from studies where the measure has behaved as theoretically predicted : Significantly more primordial content has been found in the poetry of poets who exhibit signs of psychopathology than in that of poets who exhibit no such signs ( Martindale , 1975 ) .
There is also more primordial content in the fantasy stories of creative as opposed to uncreative subjects ( Martindale & Dailey , 1996 ) , in psychoanalytic sessions marked by therapeutic " work " as opposed to those marked by resistance and defensiveness ( Reynes , Martindale & Dahl , 1984 ) , and in sentences containing verbal tics as opposed to asymptomatic sentences ( Martindale , 1977 ) .
A cross-cultural study of folktales from forty - five preliterate societies revealed , as predicted from the " primitive mentality " hypothesis of Lévy - Bruhl ( 1910 ) and Werner ( 1948 ) , that amount of primary process content in folktales is negatively related to the degree of sociocultural complexity of the societies that produced them ( Martindale , 1976 ) .
Martindale and Fischer ( 1977 ) found that psilocybin ( a drug that has about the same effect as LSD ) increases the amount of primordial content in written stories .
Marijuana has a similar effect ( West et al. , 1983 ) .
Research has also revealed more primordial content in verbal productions of younger children as compared with older children ( West , Martindale , & Sutton - Smith , 1985 ) and of schizophrenic subjects as compared with control subjects ( West & Martindale , 1988 ) .
It shows the pattern expected for historical trends in primordial content in Martindale 's ( 1990 ) theory of literarary evolution .
Thus , the Regressive Imagery Dictionary does seem to yield a valid index of primordial or dedifferentiated thought in a variety of contexts in which the measure varies as is theoretically expected .
Erik Frey has code for analyzing LiveJournal posts with RID .
It even compares your scores to the averages of everyone who uses his code .
But it was n't in a form that was easy for me to apply to arbitrary text , so I wrote my own RID code .
rid.py is my Python implementation .
It reads text from stdin and prints its analysis to stdout .
It uses the English dictionary from Kovach Computing Services .
If you want to download or create a dictionary for other languages , it 's pretty easy to modify the code to use any dictionary you choose ( that 's in the proper format ) .
About the only interesting thing in the code is that it uses a discrimination tree to look up word categories .
This was 100x faster than doing linear search with regular expressions .
And now for some armchair psychoanalysis .

Conclusion : Ruby usenetters are operating on a significantly more primordial level than the Lispers , giving less attention to problem solving !
And damn , the Lispers need sex badly — more than 4x as much as Ruby fans !
The possibilities for RID are endless .

Go nuts , people .
Update : Added a license ( MIT ) to the code .
Fixed another misspelling in the dictionary itself .
Update : Neil Kandalgaonkar has a visualization tool based on RID .

" Can someone who uses chopsticks please help me understand this ? "
Assuming that 's a mildly serious request , I 'll throw in another $ 0.02 ...
" Why , why why do people insist on using chopsticks ?
Is it more efficient ?
No .
Is it easier ?
No . "
As I said , * I* personally DO find many asian dishes easier to eat ( not to mention cook ) with chopsticks ( which is not to say I refuse to eat them with a fork if that 's all that 's on hand ) .
But I myself am half chinese , and grew up using chopsticks at home almost as much as I used a fork .
Had I used a fork exclusively in my formative years I might agree that a fork is easier to use across the board .
As it is , both are so normal to me that I 'm occasionally not entirely aware of which I 'm using .
I remember once I was eating a salad and my mother asked why I was eating it with chopsticks , I was rather surprised to look down and see that I in fact WAS using chopsticks ( but a green salad is yet another pre-sliced dish that lends itself to the sticks ) , something I had n't specifically planned to do .
" Is a a way for useless people to feel pretentious and skilled ?
Probably .
" Hey look at me !
I can use two sticks to pick things up !
Weeee ! " "
When I lived in Japan I did actually take my own chopsticks with me a lot of the time , but that 's mainly because I felt bad endlessly wasting the disposable ones .
Also , I do n't particularly like the Japanese style chopsticks which taper to an almost sharp point .
Chinese style sticks are usually much more blunt .
That 's what I grew up with , so that 's what I like .
As for why people do so in the US or other traditionally fork using places ... sure , I 'll bet some people do it for pretentious reasons .
But hey , maybe some people simply ENJOY using chopsticks , and do n't give a hoot who sees or does n't see them doing it .
I do n't see why people should feel bound to a tradition ( like using a fork ) just because they were born to it .
Especially if they find something they like better .
Do you tsk-tsk at Asians in the US when you see THEM use FORKS ?
Because I can assure you , in the 3 asian countries I 've been to ( Japan , Korea , Taiwan ) the indigs had no compunctions about using forks if they were eating western style food .
Heck , I saw them eat local cuisine with forks on occasion ...
Just some things to consider ... :)

People and vehicles pass debris left by protesters during election protests on the outskirts of Kano , Nigeria April 23 , 2007 .
The price of machetes has halved in parts of Nigeria since the end of general elections in April because demand from thugs sponsored by politicians has subsided , the state - owned News Agency of Nigeria reported .
REUTERS / Radu Sigheti
ABUJA ( Reuters ) -
The price of machetes has halved in parts of Nigeria since the end of general elections in April because demand from thugs sponsored by politicians has subsided , the state - owned News Agency of Nigeria reported .
NAN surveyed prices in the northeastern state of Gombe and found that a good quality machete was now selling for 400 naira ( $ 3 ) compared with 800 naira before the elections , which were marred by politically motivated violence in many states .
“ A price survey on machetes , which served as a popular weapon among political thugs in the state , indicated ... a drop in the price of the implement , ” NAN reported over the weekend .
Machetes are primarily used as a tool for farming in Nigeria but they are also popular among political gangsters .
“ Before the conduct of the general elections , I was selling a minimum of seven machetes daily but can hardly sell one a day now , ” said Usman Masi , a trader quoted by NAN .
Africa ’s most populous country returned to civilian rule in 1999 after three decades of almost continuous army rule but violence remains a feature of politics , especially during the build - up to elections .
European election monitors estimated that at least 200 people were killed in politically motivated violence during months of campaigning ahead of the April polls .
Question
When my boyfriend has any problem and I am not able to support him , then he also does n't talk to me properly and tries to make me feel bad .
When I help him , he behaves well .
What can I do ?
Tom De Backer Top Answerer
He may not realize it , but he 's actually manipulating you .
And being rather childish .
When adults have problems , we find ways to solve them ourselves .
Asking for help is one such a way , but he has to take the lead in solving his own problems .
Sure , he should be able to count on you , but he can't make you feel bad .
In fact , he should apologize and make it up to you .
Life is to be enjoyed , and though we all have problems , we all want to enjoy life , and while he 's asking your help in solving his problems , he 's taking away your time to enjoy life .
You should still help him , but he should help you enjoy life in return .
Set strong boundaries , and do n't tolerate his bad behavior .

This is how Trent Reznor is letting the world — or some fanatical portion thereof — know about “ Year Zero ” ( Nothing Records / Interscope ) , the new Nine Inch Nails album , which arrives in shops today .
Open the packaging and you ’ll find another secret message : the disc itself changes color with heat , turning white to display the copyright information and a long string of ones and zeroes .
In this paranoid world , everything worth knowing is a secret .
Mr. Reznor has been making aggressive computer music under the name Nine Inch Nails for about two decades , but it was “ The Downward Spiral , ” his bilious but elegant 1994 blockbuster , that confirmed his position as a true rock star in an era largely devoid of them .
He released a colder - blooded double album , “ The Fragile , ” in 1999 , then laid low for half a decade .
His seething 2005 CD , “ With Teeth , ” felt like a comeback , a reminder to his fans — and maybe to himself — that he had n’t retired after all .
Apparently the follow - up came quickly : Mr. Reznor has said the new album “ began as an experiment with noise on a laptop in a bus on tour somewhere . ”
( A sticker on the cover bears a promise , or a warning : “ 16 noisy new songs . ” )
But “ Year Zero ” is much more seductive than “ With Teeth , ” partly because of all the so - called noise .
Hard beats are softened with distortion , static cushions the tantrums , sneaky bass lines float beneath the surface .
And as usual the music is packed with details : “ Meet Your Master ” goes through at least three cycles of decay and rebirth ; part of the fun of “ The Warning ” is tracking the ever - mutating timbres .

If all these sounds often distract listeners from Mr. Reznor ’s lyrics , well , so much the better .
In the year 2022 , apparently , clumsy sloganeering is all the rage .
The album ’s first single , “ Survivalism , ” includes the phrase “ Mother Nature is a whore , ” a sarcastic expression of anti-environmentalism .
And “ Capital G , ” which sounds a lot like an anti-Bush diatribe , has another deluded narrator we ’re supposed to hate : “ I pushed a button and elected him to office and a / He pushed a button and it dropped a bomb . ”
But the mysterious discovery of an alien in his attic has spooked the 54 - year - old screenwriter and bewildered extraterrestrial experts , who yesterday suggested the US military could be involved .
The delicate 30 cm ( 12 inch ) figure of a baby alien is stored in a pungent liquid and has a US serial number painted on its four - toed foot .
Possibly sculpted from a clay - like substance and painted grey , the model closely resembles the aliens depicted in a hoax film of an autopsy of the infamous " Roswell incident " .
Curiously , the alien was discovered stored in an old toffee jar wrapped in a copy of the Daily Mirror dating from October 1947 .
In July of that year , officials at the American air base of Roswell reported and then denied finding the remains of a flying saucer .
The Roswell incident sparked a popular fascination with UFOs and led the US air force to collect data on sightings .
One theory is that the alien was left in the loft by a US serviceman working at a nearby US air base .
Mr Broom 's two - bedroom cottage at Gunthorpe , north Norfolk , which he bought eight months ago , is 45 miles from two large US air bases at RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall .
Many US servicemen and women live and work in the region .
Mr Broom told the Guardian he was " a bit spooked " by the discovery but said he was not yet living in fear of being beamed up by aliens .
" It was stuffed in the corner of the loft with other old newspapers .
Before me , an old spinster lived in the house .
I do n't think anybody had been up there for years .
I have n't got three heads and I 'm not the sort of eccentric lunatic to think it 's an alien but it's a funny thing to find in your loft . "
Mr Broom reported his finding to the Sci Fi Channel , who called in Professor Adam Roberts , an expert in science fiction literature , to examine the creature .
" The easy thing to do is dismiss it all and say it 's a hoax .
It may be or may not be , " said Prof Roberts .
" The fact that it was found near a US air base suggests there may be a military component to it . "
A spokeswoman for the US air force said it had never made such models of an alien , the figure was not government property and the serial number could mean it had been catalogued by a museum .
" It 's a hoax , " the spokeswoman said .
Prof Roberts admitted it could be a film prop dating from the 1960s , but said he was not surprised at US denials : " That is the US air force line .
They deny these alien encounters .
It is quite possible they concoct stories to cover up for more nefarious activities . "
The Sci Fi Channel will this week broadcast live footage of the alien on its website .
After further tests , Mr Broom will put it on his mantelpiece .
