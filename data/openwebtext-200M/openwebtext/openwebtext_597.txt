The Obama campaign has now clearly taken the leap into openly attacking John McCain for the series of lies and fraudulent statements he and his campaign have now told over the previous two weeks .
The evidence is beyond question and even mainstream news organizations which place balance over accuracy in reportage have confirmed his deceptions .
Presumably they will soon move to the obvious and more consequential corollary .
If voters ca n’t trust John McCain to tell the truth about even the most basic facts of the campaign , how can they trust him when he says he ’s going to bring change ?
I am a big supporter of buying used cars instead of new cars .
Buying a used car will save you money not just on the price , but can also help in finding affordable car insurance options because used cars are typically less expensive to insure .
Unfortunately , used cars do n’t always come with the same guarantees that come with new cars .
Here are a few tips to help you find a quality used car :
Check the Vehicle ’s History
An important part of a used car purchase is to obtain the car ’s history , making sure title is clear and there were no serious accidents that have n’t been disclosed by the owner .
You should primarily be concerned with issues regarding the vehicle ’s title , accident history , and ownership history .
Vehicle title history .
Before purchasing a used vehicle you want to ensure there is a clear title , and that the vehicle has not been totaled due to a severe accident or flooding .
You also want to verify the odometer readings on the title if applicable .
Accident and service history .
Has the car been well taken care of and are there service records that show routine maintenance ?
Has the vehicle been written off as a total loss , have the airbags been deployed , is there frame damage , etc .
Ownership history .
It ’s also a good idea to know the ownership history of the vehicle you are considering buying .
Key information to look for includes the number of previous owners , and the type of owner ( rental company , fleet vehicle , etc. ) .
Many vehicles used as fleet vehicles or that are rented out are not taken care of as well as a vehicle owned by an individual .
CarFax is the industry leader for this type of “ vehicle background check , ” but even CarFax reports are n’t always 100 % accurate .
For one thing they only cover reported information , and as of two years ago , they still did n’t include information from insurance companies – so there are some other things you should do before you seal the deal , especially if the seller is an individual and not a dealership or used car lot .
Also keep in mind that it may take some time before information is made available to CarFax , allowing dishonest people to sell a lemon before it can be reported .
Check for Telltale Signs of Damage or Repair
CarMax recently released a report about how to spot hidden vehicle damage .
As part of the associated survey , most people responded that they though a fresh paint job was the best indicator that a car has undergone major repairs .
But according to CarMax professionals , clamp marks on a vehicle ’s frame are the biggest sign that the car may have been involved in a serious collision .
In addition to looking for clamp marks , you want to pay attention to the feel and sound of the engine while taking a test drive , ensure doors and windows close properly , and observe the functionality of all the electronics and the odometer .
Check out this video produced by CarMax for more tips :
Check the Odometer
This is especially important on an older car , and can be an important gauge of how much wear and tear is really on the vehicle .
A general rule is that there should be an average of 10 – 20,000 miles per year .
If you have a car with a low number of miles that seems to be in poor condition , or if the odometer reading seems overly low when compared to the age of the car , these are red flags , and you may want to reconsider your purchase .
Check the VIN
The Vehicle Identification Number for any car should be located on a plate under the dash , on the doorpost , or on the firewall of the engine , and is often in all three locations .
Check all of them , and make sure the number is the same in all three , as well as checking , not only with CarFax but with the local crime database as well ( in some places you can do this ) to be certain title is clear .
Mismatched numbers ?
You may not want to take on that risk .
You can also perform a free VIN check with the National Insurance Crime Bureau .
NICB ’s VINCheckSM is a service provided to the public to assist in determining if a vehicle has been reported as stolen , but not recovered , or has been reported as a previously declared total loss vehicle by cooperating NICB members .
All you need to perform the search is the VIN .
Keep in mind that a maximum of 5 VINCheck searches can be conducted within a 24 hour period .
Inspect the Car in the Daytime
If you do it after dark you wo n’t really be able to assess the condition of the vehicle .
Bring a mechanic or knowledgeable person along , if possible , and be sure to look at the following :
Upholstery : Check for excessive wear and tear on the seats , but also examine the accelerator and brake pedals – if the latter are either over - worn , or obviously new there could be a problem with the braking system .
Tires :
Make sure they ’re all in decent condition , and confirm that the spare is in the trunk , along with a jack , if one came with the car .
Shock absorbers : Lean on each corner of the car , and then release it , and watch to make sure it returns to position quickly , and without excessive bouncing .
Body :
Do a visual inspection of the entire body of the vehicle , looking for dents , rust , patched pain , or ripples in the metal , all of which may point to undisclosed body work having been done .
Take it on a Test Drive :
You ’ll want to be certain that the car starts immediately , idles smoothly , and changes gears well .
Steering and braking should be smooth and responsive , with no squeaking or squealing .
If all this seems like a lot to do for a used car , remember that car accident statistics show that poor maintenance is one of the four major causes of car accidents , leading to five percent of all accidents reported .
Knowing the history and condition of a used car before you buy it can go a long way toward helping you choose a vehicle that has been well - maintained , and is therefore safer to drive .
Good luck finding your next used car !

The guy in Wisconsin really resonated with a lot of us when he said " I 'm angry " ; we all are .
Hopefully it will never come to a fight , but what that guy was angry about will stimilute it ... socialism .
That 's worth fighting against , at least for me .
Much is being said about the liberals getting ready to seize this moment ( the financial panic ) and ram their socialism through .
I 'm not willing to sit by and just watch .

Ca n’t riot in the suburbs , our neighbors have guns to protect their “ owned property ” , if we riot it has to be on a weekend when most people are off .
Not enough public transportation to take all of us to the nearest city and too many of us have consciouses that prevent us from looting .
It would be a dull riot .

So maybe we should “ do an ‘ Odinga ’ ” if McCain loses ?
To : RC2
Well , basically “ we ” do n’t think this way ... it ’s contrary to our self - sufficient and non-victim mentality .
But there ’s a point where you have to stand up and say “ Enough ! ” and maybe Carville ’s insinuations are at that point .
But it ’s probably up to the media ( i.e. Rush , Hannity , O’Reilly , et al ) to say it , rather than the candidates .
We really do n’t want them coming across like the perpetually offended PC types on the other side .
I love Sarah Palin ’s response about “ the hits I ’ve taken are nothing compared with what our troops are doing ” .
She rises far above ...

I believe there is a good chance of civil unrest no matter who wins , especially if it ’s a close election .
It may be kept to a minimum if McCain wins in a landslide .

Imagine that someone makes a platforming game in the style of the classic Super Mario Brothers .
Only , they replace the jump button with something crazy .
Like mouse gestures .
No , I do n’t mean like Super Mario Galaxy where you just wave the Wiimote around to do that spin move , I mean full - on mouse gestures where you click and doodle you get your avatar to leap and jump .
It would obviously be a lot harder , assuming it was possible at all .
You ca n’t “ flutter ” a gesture the way you can flutter a button .
It takes longer to do a gesture than tap a button .
The game would be less fluid and responsive , and the pace would have to be slower , more deliberate .
The designer could compensate by making the game more forgiving and by slowing things down .
The game could be made to work in the sense that it would be playable , but mouse - gesture platforming still would n’t be the same gameplay .
There is a certain cathartic pleasure to playing these sorts of games .
Aside from the scenery , the threadbare story , or whatever bells and whistles have been grafted onto the given title to distinguish it from the rest , the simple act of moving and jumping can be entertainment in itself .
The seamless translation of player thoughts and intentions to on - screen activity – the player ’s will instantly projected into an animated world – is what really defines the experience .
The rest is mostly makeup .
If the designer replaced buttons with mouse gestures , the game would lose more than the ease and pacing .
It would lose a lot of the fun , and no degree of practice on the part of the player would make it possible to play this new game the way they played Super Mario Brothers , because there would be latency between the player ’s thoughts and the gameworld .
I know this , even though I ’m absolute rubbish at platforming games .
( Which is why I depend [ed ] on the Prince of Persia franchise to provide for my platforming needs . )
Once in a while I ’ll have a good run and I ’ll feel that rush of satisfaction that more competent players no doubt feel all the time .
But without the platforming Mulligans provided by the time - controlling Prince of Persia , my inept pawing at the dual - shock controller would never guide him to victory .
First - person shooters have a similar appeal .
The core gameplay of running , strafing , and shooting is deeply rewarding when delivered properly .
It ca n’t carry a game alone any more than running and jumping can , but it ’s at the heart of just about everything you do in a shooter .
Playing an FPS with thumbsticks is n’t just more awkward , it takes away the tactile appeal .
Like platforming with mouse gestures , it ’s serviceable ( with the help of auto - aim and smoothing ) but it ca n’t deliver the same rewarding experience .
I spent several hours this weekend with an FPS game on the PS3 , and while there was nothing whatsoever wrong the game itself , I kept feeling like I was missing something .
I was moving from room to room , knocking down bad guys in disgustingly detailed environments , but there was now a delay between what I wanted and what my guy was doing .
It was n’t that it was harder , ( although it was ) it was that there was now friction between my tactical decisions and my in - game actions .
Practice could cut it down a bit , but there ’s no getting rid of it .
It seems mouse - based gaming has been “ right around the corner ” on consoles for a couple of years now .
I see you can buy PS3 mice and I hear about people going that route from time to time .
Some games – like Unreal Tournament 3 – ostensibly offer some sort of mouse support .
But I do n’t think it ’s the right solution to the problem .
I do n’t think anyone is imagining a setup where you hold the mouse in one hand and half of the controller in the other .
That setup would fall somewhere between ungainly and stupid .
But if your hand is holding a mouse , then the four right - hand buttons ( Triangle , Square , Circle , X , or their other - console counterparts ) need to be handled by the left hand .
How do you accomplish this ?
The thinking seems to be to add a keyboard to the mix , but I do n’t think that just just replicating the PC setup is the right way to go .
Keyboards are for typing , and have been conscripted for gaming , but they have their drawbacks as an input device .
If you replace a Dual Shock with a mouse and keyboard , you ’re giving up both thumbsticks – effectively trading two analog inputs for one .
You trade a small number of easily - accessible low - profile , pressure sensitive buttons for 104 big clicky keys .
Not all games need pressure - sensitive buttons , and not all games need 104 keys , but it seems like we should weigh the tradeoffs before we plug our PC peripherals into the console and dive in .
The last thing we want is for console games to take on all the hassle and baggage of PC titles , where you have to re-bind all the keyboard keys because the game designer was an obvious lunatic .
Controls become less intuitive and symbolic as you move to the anything - goes world of keyboard interfaces .
Maybe it ’s just me , but I think that “ Press X to kick Hitler in the balls “ , is intuitive , while , “ Press Right Ctrl to kick Hitler in the balls “ , is n’t .
The four buttons have established behavior and logic to them .
The economy of limited inputs has forced designers to develop a certain language through these four buttons , and that would be shattered by giving them 104 generic mappable keys to deal with .
Most normal console gamers ( that is , not me ) play from the couch , and any setup that does n’t work from there is a non-starter .
You can sit on a nice comfy couch in your living room and pass the controller around , but if the controller is a mouse and a full - sized keyboard , then you ’re going to want some sort of surface to hold it .
Maybe something like a desk .
With a keyboard drawer .
And a mouse pad .
And now put the TV on the desk .
And move all that crap out of the living room because you do n’t need to sit in the family space with your back to the room .
Now you ’re all alone , because no ( sane ) system is going to support multiple keyboards and multiple mice on the same machine so everyone can play split screen .
Your friends are in the living room playing Super Smash Brothers on the couch , and they ’ve forgotten all about you .
Congratulations , you ’re a PC Gamer again .
No , if this is FPS - on - a - console thing going to work we need something you can hold in your hands .
I ’ve mentioned before that I think replacing the right analog stick with a trackball is the easiest and most elegant solution .
That stick is already used for camera movement , so it ’s a very slight change for both the user and developer .
Games could easily be set to work with both .
Our engineer worked all night for ten whole minutes to construct this prototype poorly photoshopped concept .
A trackball is n’t as ideal as a mouse – or else laptop users would n’t bother lugging mice with them wherever they go – but I think it ’s close enough to deliver the rewarding experience the user is looking for .
You ’d get rid of the jerky “ nudging ” effect that makes combat feel stiff on consoles .
There would be a learning curve , but I think the end result would be a controller that could offer a solid FPS experience without sacrificing any of the advantages of consoles .
There are still some minor hurdles :
For the PS3 , you would probably need to relocate the R3 button .
( Activated on traditional controllers by pressing down on the thumbstick . )
I ’m not sure if there are similar problems for the XBox 360 – I do n’t own one yet .
It would n’t be backwards compatible , which means you ’d need to keep the original controller around to play old games .
Great .
Another thing cluttering up the area around the TV .
As if it was n’t a tumbling heap of blinking , battery - powered confusion already .
Still , it ’s better than adding a mouse and a keyboard .
The last issue : Nobody seems to be considering this .
I do n’t know what kind of tectonic forces would be required to get someone like Sony or Microsoft to embrace something like this , but it ’s more force than migrating PC Gamers can muster .
In fact , even if you did get the idea in front of them , they ’d probably reject it just because they did n’t think of it themselves .
Still , it ’s a natural and sensible solution .
Since developers seem so intent on jamming the square peg of FPS games into the round hole of the console , it ’s nice to imagine that someday we might have a controller to make it work .
Bataan Death March Tickertape By Jim Willie CB
Oct 9 2008 2:13 PM www.GoldenJackass.com
Use the above link to subscribe to the paid research reports , which include coverage of several smallcap companies positioned to rise during the ongoing panicky attempt to sustain an unsustainable system burdened by numerous imbalances aggravated by global village forces .
An historically unprecedented mess has been created by compromised central bankers and inept economic advisors , whose interference has irreversibly altered and damaged the world financial system , urgently pushed after the removed anchor of money to gold .
Analysis features Gold , Crude Oil , USDollar , Treasury bonds , and inter-market dynamics with the US Economy and US Federal Reserve monetary policy .
Pardon the jumpy style , not burdened by depth , preferring breadth instead .
The events of the last few days continue to be remarkable , alarming , chaotic , surreal , and desperate .
The globe is slowly realizing that the United States is careening toward a probable financial death experience .
Nothing has worked to date , and nothing will work in the present , not bailouts , not liquidations , not nationalizations , not papered over fraud , and surely rate cuts .
The stark reality contains a blur of a massive locomotive derailed , having run over the mountain ledge , heading downward in a freefall , subjected to the force of gravity , and ripping through a gigantic erected paper net designed to halt its crash .
CLOWNS IN CHARGE DO NOT REALIZE THE SYSTEM IS FLAWED AND BROKEN , AS EFFORTS TO REDOUBLE THE DEVICES ARE ALL DRAWN FROM THE SAME DEFECTIVE TOOLBAG .
MAJOR BANK FAILURES , BANKRUPTCIES OF MAJOR FINANCIAL FIRMS ( LIKE INSURANCE ) , AND INDIVIDUAL MARKET DEFAULTS COME VERY SOON .
Incredible events are occurring behind the scenes , the details of which would shock most people , even those who deal with the underworld .
Recall Wall Street propaganda this summer ?
That the US will be first to emerge from the carnage ?
Such lunatic promotional nonsense should be recalled when it becomes clear that the Untied States cannot emerge from its broken condition .
The game is over , and only the enlightened realize it !
What lies ahead is the tragedy of distintegration !!!
That includes the nation and its very governmental structure .
GLOBAL RATE CUT : The USFed turned down a chance to cut a couple weeks ago , thinking it would look weak .
Now they look desperate .
Surely , to defend the USDollar , they wanted coordinated rate cuts , but gold will respond the most .
The Dow futures were down 280 points before the coordinated interest rate cut was announced on Wednesday .
The USFed , Bank of Canada , Bank of England , Euro Central Bank , Swiss National Bank , and Sveriges Riksbank ( Sweden ) all announced an official interest rate cut .
Yesterday , the Reserve Bank of Australia cut by a full 100 basis points .
Hong Kong is considering its own cut also .
When the New York City fraudulent rigged bazaar known as the stock market opened , the Dow was suddenly down 220 points , then rallied to plus 180 points , and seemed like it could not do anything but head down , closing down 189 points .
What a loud repudiation of a fleeting solution !
The rate cut might have some impact on mortgage loans , almost nothing more .
The S&P500 index lies below its 200 - week moving average , the ultra - longterm series , which was penetrated on the downside last June , the first time in 26 years .
Talk about a bear signal !!!
On any day in the past twenty years , a 50 basis point rate cut would enable a complete turnaround in the stock market for months on end .
What a shock .
Banks are insolvent , distrust each other , as the economies are sliding into a quagmire !
A great quote came from sage Rick Santelli from CNBC , who said “ The Fed rate cut is like shooting arrows at an enemy that is 20 miles away . ”
He can speak freely only half the time .
GOLD DEFAULT DEAD AHEAD : The COMEX and London Metal Exchange are living on borrowed time in their corrupt gold game .
They sell paper gold , and precious little actual gold metal .
See a refreshing straightforward interview aired on CNBC of all places .
It is by Jurg Kiener , CEO of Swiss Asia Capital .
He points out the dual market for gold , one paper and one metal .
He expects soon the US ‘ gambling price ’ gold market in COMEX and LME to default .
By that he means a return suddenly to physical price determination .
He is quoted to say THE GOLD PRICE WOULD DOUBLE VERY QUICKLY , LIKE IN DAYS AFTER THE EXPECTED METAL DEFAULT .
One should expect the interview to be lifted and removed from their website within days , after they realize the explosive nature of his words .
THE FAVORABLE DISCONNECT : In August , my analysis pointed out that a disconnect was necessary for the gold price to rise independently of the USDollar .
Gold is no longer just an anti-US $ trade , but rather a trade on global monetary inflation .
With today ’s virtual global rate cut , one can herald the transition as complete .
Notice how since mid-September , the gold price has risen with the USDollar DX index , shown in the big green ellipse .
Liquidations and monetizations will go hand in hand , once properly understood .
Gold has begun to respond to anticipated extreme new US $ money supply growth and supply needs .
USDOLLAR RALLY AS SIGNAL OF DEATH : Few seem to comprehend that the USDollar is rallying recently as a result of the imminent death of itself and the USTreasury Bond .
A vast liquidation is underway of speculative trades , and of US bank assets .
For years many analysts properly understood that the USEconomy is debt dependent .
Now credit is drying up , and being denied even to good credit risk customers .
The USEconomy is falling off the cliff , and evidence mounts .
See car sales in September , down almost 30 % by Toyota , down 34 % by Ford .
Layoffs by the tens of thousands are next , right down the vertically integrated car industry layers .
As the USEconomy and US bank system continues in death spiral , the USDollar rallies , during unspeakable ruin to US fundamentals .
Recall that the tide went out along the shores in Indonesia and Thailand right before the great tsunami hit almost three years ago .
Ditto here !
The banking crisis and extreme distress that remains stubbornly unfixable in the Untied States urgently motivates foreigners to quickly assemble , implement , and announce a replacement world currency basket .
Watch for a euro currency split soon , where Nordic version will compete viciously against the dead USDollar .
HUGE RISK OF LOSING WORLD RESERVE CURRENCY :
As preface , the world banking structure rests atop a world currency foundation denominated in USDollars , with USTreasury Bonds and USAgency Mortgage Bonds serving the primary role as financial instruments .
These toxic building blocks are all really bad lego blocks .
Foreigners must respond very soon , to replace the US $ as global reserve currency , or else risk a similar implosion to their banking systems .
Many USAgency
Bonds have been replaced by USTBonds , not much of an upgrade .
If the USTreasurys soon suffer in the heart attack seizures underway , foreign economies will be at risk of serious deterioration .
So foreigners are working toward a solution .
One might be announced soon , with a new world reserve basket announced , based upon the Euro , Russian ruble , Japanese yen , and newly crowned Gulf dinar .
The common theme is these are all currencies from nations boasting export surplus .
They are taking action , but behind the scenes , like in Berlin .
The consequence to the USEconomy is dire .
The beleaguered nation would be forced to attract foreign capital , and bid up foreign currencies in order to purchase crude oil .
The word inflation would soon be replaced in the press networks with the word “ hyper- inflation ” as the Untied States enters the Third World overnight .
It seems that the vast majority will be caught blindsided .
Not the Hat Trick Letter !
THREATENED FRANCHISE OF CENTRAL BANKS :
The other big powerful underlying failure in progress is of the central bank concept , and its many franchises .
They essentially install central planning , Soviet Politburo style , complete with failure .
The central bankers around the globe must be panicking over their common failure .
They have one thing in common , overarching above trade surpluses or deficits .
That common trait is they all manage debt from a fiat currency , and extend credit to inflate .
They acted in coordinated style today for the first time in their history .
Call it a panic !
Central bankers are all scared witless .
THE BIG LIE ON THE WALL STREET BAILOUT :
The historic $ 700 billion Congressional bailout bill had some key added provisions over the failed House bill .
The new funds can buy back bonds owned by foreign investors , like those defrauded in Europe and Asia .
The American public was told that the US banking system would have blockage unclogged .
BS !
It was a congame again , after foreign investors demanded restitution immediately , or else !
The US banks will remain clogged .
When almost nothing is fixed concerning US internal bank distrust due to toxin floating around , people will eventually realize the US public just paid for Wall Street fraud of foreign financial firms .
It might be even worse .
Foreign firms can possibly package any kind of rubbish , toxin , or acid into a bond for US swap .
No end to the fraud .
Oh , lest one forget , the $ 700 billion is only 15 % to 20 % of what might ultimately be needed .
The overall tally will be much larger , for total bailouts , nationalizations , FDIC refills , tax stimulus , and ongoing programs to rework mortgages .
The people have been ignored so far .
EFFECT OF ABSENT SHORT - TERM CREDIT :
Few seem yet to comprehend the depth of the risk to the USEconomy if short - term credit continues its vanishing act .
Most realize when the US banks are insolvent and lend less , the USEconomy is assured a recession .
They do not comprehend that when short - term credit is denied , the USEconomy disintegrates .
Imagine a man whose bones are turned into mush , trying to walk .
That is the economy with insolvent banks .
The man becomes a body without a heart and blood circulation when short - term credit is absent .
The commercial side requires it for supply of food , gasoline , housewares , hardware , building materials , and more .
Imagine riots for toilet paper , let alone gasoline and food !
The financial side requires it for supply of ATM cash , credit card usage , and even payroll income .
A heart attack is not a proper analogy .
More like a science fiction movie where the victim is vaporized , or is burned suddenly into a heap of plasma .
FUTILITY OF SOLUTIONS : Few pundits , analysts , Wall Street observers , and banking officials seem to comprehend that solutions are almost all flawed .
Where is the motive to generate jobs for legitimate income , like infrastructure development or reversal of Asian job exodus ???
Where is the connection between Asian investment since 2001 , job creation there , and a delayed reaction of the complete destruction of US banks and more ?
Are they all stupid ?
Maybe not , but surely compromised , indoctrinated , and committed to a system whose foundation is built on shifting sands .
Call it a corporate executive sellout of America .
The solutions fail because they are all debt based , like with new USTreasury Bonds to finance bailouts , like with USTBonds in swaps to banks for cratered mortgage bonds , like with USTBonds to finance household stimulus packages , and with monetization to print money to finance whatever the idiots leave on the table on USTBond sales .
The problems from debt collapse due to debt - related ills inside banks cannot be solved by more debt instruments , plain and simple .
The solutions must , if they are legitimate , involve new income sources , like manufacturing returned to the US soil , like a national grand initiative for infrastructure betterment , like better agriculture management of ethanol solutions , like broader export successfully landing abroad from US firms .
The dumbstruck fools running US bank policy are forced to resort to their own failed toolbag .
How effective will lower interest rate be , if only another attraction to a debt device ?
Not much !
And the failure to revive and resuscitate will shock the system very soon .
HEART ATTACK SYMPTOMS & CAUSES :
To be sure , the LIBOR rates are not responding to supposed solutions , the TED ( Treasury EuroDollar ) spread remains wide , and the short - term USTreasury Bill yield hovers near zero .
These are the symptoms of heart attack .
Behind the bank lending constrictions , clogs , and refusals is lost faith , lost trust in borrowers , lost credible value in borrower collateral .
The day will come soon when banks will be paid a yield to hold money outside the system , as in financial firms and corporate entities will actually pay the biggest banks and the USFed itself to hold money .
See negative yield , which occurred for a brief spell in Japan a few years ago .
The ultimate cause of the heart attack symptoms is the split in usury cost , never discussed .
The root cause is that JPMorgan continues to push the cost of money down , using its strongarm futures contract devices , complete with more than a small amount of counterfeit additives bought in dark basement chambers .
Such a low rate results in revolt among bankers , who refuse to lend at such an absurd rate in today ’s risky environment .
So the LIBOR spread widens , even the overnight rate .
See the TED Spread here .
Look like a heart attack on an EKG chart ?
Yep !
ACCELERATION OF EVENTS : Each week contains its disaster .
Each week has included its own deadline timetable to reach agreement on resolution of this or that .
Each week is replete with new signals of contagion or breakdown .
Recall USFed Chairman Bernanke , the smartest idiot on the planet , who claimed a year ago that no contagion would result from the spark of the subprime mortgage lit fuse .
Expect such braindead calls from a university professor , burdened by the limitations of his credentials .
Absolute contagion occurred instead , in total defiance to his orthodox heresy .
Yesterday the big news saw the United Kingdom nationalize almost their entire banking system with $ 50 billion , including the venerable Lloyds TSB .
Regard these moves as firm evidence of the death of the AngloSphere .
Today ’s big news is that Iceland collapsed , rescued in part so far by $ 4.5 billion from Russia , not Europe .
As time passes , the financial structures weaken further , certain to break in central connective tissue , as well as in extended sections .
My analogy of the giant locomotive train hurtling down over the mountainside ledge fits here .
Apply gravity as the acceleration force , and inertia to administer pain .
A bright friend , not the least bit in the dark on current events , claimed that stupid American officials believe the runaway locomotive can actually fly .
ENTIRE US BANK SYSTEM JUST FAILED :
It is almost totally now nationalized after failure , seemingly without recognition .
If the USFed has swapped a mountain of impaired asset backed bonds from crippled US banks , and has taken over AIG obligations , while the Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac acidic office park has been placed under the USGovt aegis , and while the USGovt has bailed out the Wall Street gigantic stream of fraudulent bond sales , then the great majority of the US financial system has been nationalized after failure .
This week , after acquiescing to acceptance of various types of bank assets including preferred stock , the USFed announced that it will accept all asset backed commercial paper ( ABCP ) in swaps .
What remains untouched of the US financial system ?
Credit unions and corporate subsidiaries ?
A good slice of corporate finance arms can be managed with the ABCP inclusion .
Not much remains .
Oh , by the way , the AIG risk assumption will turn into a Giant Black Hole .
They borrowed $ 85 billion three weeks ago .
Now they have won approval by the clueless US Congress for $ 38 billion more .
My forecast is for AIG to ultimately cost $ 1 trillion in loans and other bailout largesse , as credit default swaps will hit like a mushroom cloud .
Much criticism has come already for this elite club of vipers , as the company spent $ 440 k on a California conference at a beachside resort less than a week after it was rescued .
Also , the Fannie & Freddie credit derivatives might easily cost close to another $ 1 trillion , including mortgage portfolio losses upcoming .
To say the USGovt has made a bad investment with the US financial system is the under - statement of the millennium .
To say it will turn a profit on anything it touches is cause for a deep belly laugh and thigh slap .
Just a sales pitch by conmen !
FLIMSY VIEWPOINTS ON SITUATION :
At the Toronto Gold Show , a few conversations involved me with smart people who seemed to have a shallow comprehension of the current situation .
One from a well connected organization told me that the entire US bank system will be taken over , with all underwater firms simply given a blank check to render them solvent , in a simple but costly procedure .
My eyes blinked , my head twisted , my brain squirmed .
The concepts not fully factored in are that the failing machinery is often hidden from view , the assets going rapidly negative in value are not easily measured , the system contains so many functions that are far beyond control and monitor , so many unregulated and syndicate operations are intentionally kept from public view , that the system is guaranteed to crash without any conceivable opportunity to react to its many failing components in any responsible timely manner .
When my questions were directed to credit derivatives , he just shrugged his shoulders , and repeated his shallow argument on solution .
If an informed fellow from a fine organization cannot grasp the complex nature of any solution , then rest assured that it would go far beyond out of control .
Not only are the size and scope misjudged , but so are the hidden depth and exotic complexity by architects often on cocaine in Wall Street houses .
Their leverage devices make an industrial chemical plant look simple .
THIRD WORLD , DEAD AHEAD : Few in the Untied States seem to realize that what is happening is the magnificent unstoppable event whereby an inevitable shift of tectonic financial plates is underway .
The result will be the Untied States entire system , financial and commercial , will suddenly find itself tragically lodged in the Third World .
The chief traits will be major shortages , high prices , absent capital for credit , diverted supply of commodities , poor investment opportunities , massive flight of capital , corrupt law enforcement , widespread violence , despair among the public , horrific loss of wealth , and a severe brain drain as intellectual talent abandons the nation .
Oh yes , carpet baggers will arrive soon , and perhaps even an historically unprecedented wave of colonists from Asia , Russia , and Arab nations .
Those who own the failed credit during default make ALL THE RULES .
LOST INTEGRITY OF US FINANCIAL MARKETS :
The revived short rule restriction has contributed to yet another severe black eye to the reputation of the Untied States .
Its financial markets are already considered the playground for Wall Street syndicates , with criminal behavior protected by the system .
Foreigners mock our markets for their grotesque unfairness .
Insider trading , 3 pm rescues , program trading , naked shorts , controlled news sources , conflicts of interest between news networks and advertisers , justification of fraudulent accounting under pretense of national security , these all contribute to the cesspool image .
The list of financial firms protected by short rule restrictions included far too many stocks .
What really really angered me , as in really really angered me , was the exemption given to Goldman Suchs .
They are permitted to short financial firm stocks .
At least the short rule restriction ends on Wednesday tonight .
When one examines the Mussolini Fascist Business Model , be sure to include the criminal aspect of rules changes to the corrupt model that assures destruction of the system .
Now these corrupt clowns want to eliminate ‘ Mark To Market ’ accounting for bank assets .
Calling them worth original parity value will not improve anything for the lending risk , and surely will not lift the systemic faith .
The Japanese could pull off the ‘ Vampire Banks ’ trick where they walked around insolvent , since their financial system , if not culture , contained ten times as much integrity per capita versus the US .
The Untied States relies heavily upon faith for the system .
Faith is almost all gone !
FLIGHT TO QUALITY RUSE : JPMorgan is the primary usher orchestrator to the phony movement , called a ‘ Flight to Safety ’ or a ‘ Flight to Quality ’ as seen with the movement to USTreasury Bond .
Absolutely nothing denotes quality of the USTBond complex .
The description of safety seems to ignore , deny , and defy the rapid deterioration of all US financial fundamentals .
They seem as safe as a spiked chamber slowly closing in the “ Lara Croft : Tomb Raider ” movie .
The image of out of the frying pan and into the fire seems to fit .
A USTreasury Bond default appears a total lock guarantee in the near future .
A blight on the US financials grows worse with each passing month , as the total cost for bailouts , nationalizations , stimulus packages , and federal deficits mounts .
Foreigners own 52 % of all USTBond debt .
They will eventually say NO MORE !
A powerful vortex is building , with ultra-strong low pressure zones colliding with ultra-strong high pressure zones to create a hurricane .
It is bigger and more powerful than anything ever having formed on planet earth .
The flight to quality or to safety is pointed directly into a black hole .
Look for staggering events to come with USTBonds on the supply side , which cannot support the upcoming funding needs .
THE LEHMAN FAILURE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CON JOB :
It was planned , calculated , designed , and executed like a criminal act .
The Wall Street criminals needed to test the system on credit default swap risk , needed a sink hole from which to hand $ 138 billion to JPMorgan on a reloaded .
It was carried out pre-dawn on a weekend before a hapless bankruptcy judge who found no objection .
He probably did not look hard , maybe even bribed .
The criminals were able to observe the consequences from senior bond holders who were illegally denied due process in the bankruptcy procedure .
The event was a failure called a merger , complete with a huge handout given to JPMorgan so it can continue its illegal enterprise .
The real big deception is that JPMorgan was probably within a hair from its own bankruptcy , and therefore required a sacrificial lamb to feed from elaborate entrails .
The sad fact is that the Wall Street consolidators need another Lehman - type event soon , since more reloads will be required .
The French finance minister publicly decried the Lehman bankruptcy , saying letting it go was a major error .
He might not be aware of the Wall Street crime syndicate need to cover up evidence , or the need to create a sink hole for a concealed JPMorgan reload , or the need to illicitly pack printed money into the massive credit default swap crater .
Recall that numerous boxes of documents were hurriedly removed from Lehman offices that crucial fateful weekend .
No watchful eye by police , no cordon yellow tape to protect a crime scene , nothing .
Another Fascist Business Model privilege that does not make America strong .
CITIGROUP ACTUALLY FILED A LAWSUIT TO ACQUIRE WACHOVIA : Sorry , but Wells Fargo is in line to win this ugly pig prize .
Citigroup must have lusted deeply for the opportunity to pull off the same trick that Bank of America did , to seize the Merrill Lynch deposits and toss the impaired bond assets into the JPMorgan ‘ Garbage Can ’ powderkeg .
JPMorgan had the great advantage to seize the Washington Mutual deposits and toss the impaired bond assets into their own ‘ Garbage Can ’ powderkeg .
What a sight to behold !
The American financial system manages garbage that it keeps in secret mountains of some of the most disgusting ruinous rotting sewage ever known to mankind .
The gall of Citigroup to even attempt a bold coup when it is bankrupt , insolvent , and running on the vile fumes of phony accounting .
They acquired a bank with HQ in San Salvador ( branches in Panama ) in recent months that really angered me , since opening an account there was on my list .
My guess is that Citigroup has assimilated deposits from Banco Cuzcatlan , much like the Borg of Star Trek fame .
REALITY CHECK ON THE DESTRUCTION IN PROGRESS :
The Dow Jones Industrial index should get hit time after time after time until some good economic or banking news emerges .
The stupidity evident out there is to expect the Dow stock index to lead on asserting stability , when it must come from housing prices and the solvent condition of leading banks .
The ultimate key to the US bank destruction has been a powerful decline in housing prices , not the Dow .
It will follow news of things being ultimately repaired .
The US banks are destroyed , and that should kill the entire USEconomy in the foreseeable future .
Few seem willing to accept this stark ugly fact .
Housing prices continue down , and that assures continued lethal pressure on bank assets .
That keeps the destructive process relentless and very powerful , like deep knife cuts to a patient lying on a hospital gurney , while being shuttled from room to room for futile treatment .
Much more destruction lies ahead , like with at least two more Wall Street firms , many regional banks , and a few insurance companies .
Few seem willing to accept this stark ugly fact .
Instead they look like idiotic children gazing upon the wrong traffic lights , as truck after truck runs them over in the middle of the road .
Little do they realize , PEOPLE ARE ROADKILL .
REALITY CHECK , INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVE :
If you had purchased $ 1000 of Delta Airlines stock one year ago , you would have $ 49 today .
If you had purchased $ 1000 of AIG stock one year ago , you would have $ 33 today .
If you had purchased $ 1000 of Lehman Brothers stock one year ago , you will have $ 0 today .
However , if you had purchased $ 1000 worth of beer one year ago , drank all the beer , then turned in the aluminum cans for recycling , you would have received $ 214 today at redemptions .
Based on the above , the best current investment plan is to drink heavily & recycle .
It is called the 401 - KEG Plan .
US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION :
We as Americans must vote for the next chief engineer for the locomotive that is running 100 miles per hour ( =160 km / hour ) into the bottomless chasm , in a vertical descent , without any semblance of controls .
Every train needs an engineer , complete with hat , striped shirt , and a whistle at the ready !
Be sure that almost no agenda will be the privilege of any new president , that is if the corrupt powers permit the election without disturbance , delay , or deletion .
This president has done such a bangup job that he might deserve to be emperor .

GOP insiders predicting Obama victory Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Friday October 10 , 2008
Print This Email This With less than a month until Election Day , even Republicans are beginning to predict Barack Obama will become the 44th president .
Eight in 10 Republican insiders polled by National Journal said there is a " high " chance of an Obama victory .
None said there is a " low " chance the Democratic candidate will win .
" I love my crazy uncle .
I do n't like anybody else 's , " one anonymous insider quipped to the magazine .
Other Republicans cited McCain 's inability to connect with voters who are deeply worried about the tanking economy .
Rather than engage in a straightforward debate contrasting his economic proposals with Obama's , McCain has decided to run a scorched earth campaign aimed solely at convincing voters that Obama is unacceptable because he previously crossed paths with '60s anti-war radical Bill Ayers .
There 's little indication the strategy is working , despite the fiercely rabid crowds that are greeting McCain and Sarah Palin on the campaign trail .
Republican consultant Michelle Laxalt was particularly critical of McCain 's decision to employ Palin as an attack dog .
" They have send this young , naive -- very confident , perhaps in Alaska -- young woman out with the most incendiary talking points , the most dangerous racist talking points and I think they should be ashamed of themselves , " Laxalt told CNN 's Larry King Thursday night .
While Palin's accusation that Obama is " palling around with terrorists " may cause much frothing among the party 's base , it has n't stopped a slide in support that now has Obama up 11 points in the latest Gallup tracking poll .
The town hall debate earlier this week that was supposed to mark McCain 's chances to turn things around has done anything but .
Two - thirds of the 75 GOP insiders National Journal polled said Obama helped himself more following Tuesday 's show down .
" Every time Obama is on the same stage with McCain he looks a little more presidential , a little more prepared for the job , " one Republican said .
" McCain 's attack strategy made him look so small at a time when the issues are so big . "

New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is demanding information about executive compensation and bonuses at nine banks that have received federal funds under TARP , the U.S. Treasury 's Troubled Asset Relief Program .
In a letter to each institution 's Board of Directors , Cuomo warns the bonuses could violate New York 's state fraudulent conveyance law .
" Obviously , " he writes , " we will have grave concerns if your expected bonus pool has increased in any way as a result of your receipt or expected receipt of taxpayer funds from TARP . "
In the letter , Cuomo demands information on how this year 's bonus pools were calculated , as well as details on each bank 's 2006 and 2007 bonus payments .
Cuomo recently won concessions from AIG — also the recipient of a federal bailout — after details of lavish payments and corporate junkets came to light .
The firms receiving today 's letter are : Bank of America , Bank of New York Mellon , Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , J.P. Morgan Chase , Merrill Lynch , Morgan Stanley , State Street and Wells Fargo .
In a statement , Citigroup said it would cooperate with federal and state inquiries about its wages and benefits , which the firm says " reflect compensation best practices . "
The company also noted that the federal bailout already includes restrictions on executive pay .
A spokeswoman for State Street said the bank is " carefully evaluating the request , " and a Goldman Sachs spokesman said the firm had not yet seen the letter .
Spokespeople for Bank of America , Bank of New York Mellon , J.P. Morgan Chase , Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo all declined to comment .
Morgan Stanley could not be immediately reached for comment .
Yesterday , California Congressman Henry Waxman , who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , sent similar letters to the same nine banks .
Among my somewhat over - the - hill crowd 
I ’m 64  there ’s one thing friends have said to me repeatedly since the stock market started to tumble , the global economic system began to melt down , and Iceland went from bank haven to bankrupt .
They say , “ I ’m just not looking .
I do n’t want to know . ”
And they ’re not referring to the world situation , they ’re talking about their pension plans , or 401 ( k ) s , or IRAs , or whatever they put their money into , so much of which is melting away in plain sight even as Iceland freezes up .
I ’ve said it myself .
Think of it as a pragmatic acknowledgment of reality at an extreme moment , but also as a statement of denial and despair .
The point is :
Why look ?
The news is going to be worse than you think , and it ’s way too late anyway .
This is what crosses your mind when the ground under you starts to crumble .
Do n’t look , not yet , not when the life you know , the one you took for granted , is vanishing , and there is n’t a damn thing you can do about it .
Today , in my world at least , this is the most commonplace of comments .
It ’s just not a line I ’ve seen much when the press and TV bring on the parade of financial experts  most of whom are there largely because they did n’t have the faintest idea that anything like this might happen .
Whether they ’re reporting on , or opining about , the latest market nosedives , panic selling , chaotic bailouts , arcane derivatives , A.I.G. facials , or bank and stock - exchange closures , it still always sounds like someone else ’s story .
I guess that ’s the nature of the media .
It ’s professional for reporters and pundits to write or talk about the pain of others , not their own .
Normally , you just assume that ’s the case .
So , for instance , when Frank Bruni , in a front - page New York Times piece on the second presidential debate , writes , “ Now the situation looks gloomier still , with markets in other continents tumbling  with a world of hurt at hand , ” it really does n’t cross your mind that he might be including Frank Bruni in that description .
Here ’s a rock - you - to - your - socks fact I happened to read in a news report the afternoon of the day that Barack Obama and John McCain had their town hall meeting with 80 uncommitted voters and moderator Tom Brokaw .
In the last 15 months , according to the Associated Press , Americans lost $ 2 trillion from their retirement plans .
Now , that ’s a world of hurt and you could feel it the moment Brokaw first called on an audience member .
Allen Shaffer rose and asked : “ With the economy on the downturn and retired and older citizens and workers losing their incomes , what ’s the fastest , most positive solution to bail these people out of the economic ruin ? ”
I have no idea what Shaffer ’s situation is , but I ’ll tell you this , his did n’t sound like a reporter ’s question .
It sounded close to the bone .
It sounded like a world of hurt .
Not surprisingly , neither presidential candidate actually responded , in part , undoubtedly , because to be close to the truth either would have had to say something like :
Hey , how the hell do I know ?
At this point , despite the onslaught of news about how bad things are , dotted with portrayals of Americans in trouble , I suspect there ’s quite a gap between the world as reported and the world as felt by most Americans .
Let me give you a simple example .
In the news these days , it ’s common to hear that we are at the edge of a real recession or , as International Monetary Fund managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn put it , “ the cusp of a global recession , ” or even the verge of a “ deep recession . ”
Recently , the word “ depression ” has finally made it onto the scene .
Little wonder , as ever more financial institutions totter , while , for the first time in memory , the initials GM and the word “ bankruptcy ” repeatedly end up in the same headlines .
“ Depression ” arrived on the media scene , however , in a formulaic way and usually quite carefully hemmed in as part of a comparison :
If X does or does n’t happen , this will be “ the worst crisis since the Great Depression , ” or simply that it is “ the worst [ you fill this in ] since the Great Depression . ”
And yet a recent CNN poll indicates that nearly 60 percent of Americans think an actual depression , even a great depression  not a situation bad enough to compare to one  is “ likely . ”
To many of us , it ’s already starting to feel that way and that ’s no small thing .
When you see a Wall Street Journal headline like last Friday ’s  “ Market ’s 7 - Day Rout Leaves U.S. Reeling ”  do n’t you feel like you ’re in a different world , however the experts care to define it ?
The edge of panic in the voice of a friend telling me about the 401 ( k ) she ’s not looking at catches the story for me .
It ’s visceral and scary and , let ’s face it , whether this is the half - forgotten past coming back to bite us or the future kneecapping us , it ’s depressing as hell .
Being Depressed
And speaking of depressions no one is much talking about , let me just say what a journalist can’t : I ’m depressed .
It crept up on me , but I can date the feeling to the first week of October , because a friend e-mailed me on Sept. 29 this way : “ I ’m given to gloomy thoughts
You really get the sense that things are on the verge of spinning out of control . ”
I remember the e-mail I wrote back with a certain embarrassment .
I was neither gloomy nor down , I responded .
My reigning feeling was one of “ awe ”  that you could live your whole life and never experience a moment like this one .
At about the same time , I told another friend that I found it staggering to turn a corner , bump into History , and discover that he ’s unbelievably gargantuan .
Even as I sent that e-mail off , it felt kind of callous to me , but it was what I thought I felt .
The media claims to know  and report on  “ our pain , ” just as the presidential candidates claim to feel it .
How could they ?
I did n’t even know my own .
It took a remarkably long time to notice that weird feeling  as if another body were sagging inside mine 
I identify with depression , and so finally say to myself :
Okay , maybe you were awed , maybe you still are , but you also feel gloomy as hell .
Here ’s the strange thing : I ’ve been running TomDispatch.com these last nearly six years .
I ’ve written ( or posted ) with regularity on how the Bush administration , with its blind , fundamentalist faith in military power , had pushed an imperial America into a precipitous decline .
In July 2006 , I typically ended one dispatch on the subject , “ The Force Is Not With Them , ” this way :
“ Oh , and there ’s one fundamentalist character I ’ve left out of the mix , someone who definitely bows down to force .
Call everything that ’s happened these last few years Osama ’s dream .
It ’s hard not to think of William Butler Yeats ’ poem , ‘ The Second Coming , ’ and then wonder : ‘ And what rough beast , its hour come round at last , slouches towards Bethlehem to be born ? ' ”
I posted a piece at TomDispatch in April of this year in which , to some criticism , Wall Street expert Steve Fraser specifically brought up the “ D ” word in this passage :
“ Nonetheless , the current breakdown of the financial system is portentous .
It threatens a general economic implosion more serious than anyone has witnessed for many decades .
Depression , if that is what it turns out to be , together with the agonies of a misbegotten and lost war no one believes in any longer , could undermine whatever is left of the threadbare credibility of our Gilded Age elite . ”
Last January , I even posted an essay by Chalmers Johnson , bluntly entitled “ Going Bankrupt , ” suggesting that we were fast heading the way of Argentina 2001 .
I ’ve certainly long been convinced that we were spinning out of control , that this was madness , and that we were , in some fashion , heading down .
But a near global financial collapse and crash in a matter of weeks ?
I ca n’t claim that such a possibility even crossed my mind .
And anyway , who can ever claim that learned and lived history bear much relation to each other any more than do the experiences of reporting and being reported upon ?
That was a thought , a construct .
This is my life .
That was so much writing on the page .
This is the world I ’m sending my children into ( which depresses me more than anything ) .
I find I have no particular faith that , in the worst of times , the best of things will happen .
Now , at least , the media is talking about the Great Depression and , of course , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , fireside chats , and the like .
Even Barack Obama did so the other day in an interview with ABC ’s Charlie Gibson .
But , of course , the Great Depression brought Hitler as well as Roosevelt to power .
And if people are disturbed by the anger , the threats , the rage exhibited recently at McCain / Palin rallies , then hold your hats as things turn truly grim .
So I sit here and worry .
And I know I ’m not alone .
In these last days , I ’ve thought some about my parents , about their whole generation which lived through the Great Depression , those fathers and mothers who had a “ depression mentality ” for which we , the young growing up in the 1950s and 1960s , had no patience , and about which we had next to no curiosity whatsoever .
I sure did n’t , anyway .
That was so past .
Despite the good times , they feared otherwise .
It ’s unnerving when history becomes yours , when no one can tell you where the bottom is , or what life will be like after that bottom is reached .
It ’s one of those moments when you discover why overused phrases 
I think here , for instance , of “ through a glass darkly ”  were overused in the first place .
What a grim Alice - in - Wonderland feeling this turns out to be  in which the world simultaneously seems to shrink to you and expand to take in everything .
Maybe this was what it felt like in parts of Asia as the great meltdown of 1997 began , or in Argentina as national bankruptcy hit in 2001 .
I would n’t know .
Those were distant tsunamis to which we were immune .
It was Washington then that dispatched the International Monetary Fund to other countries in such crises to “ impose discipline . ”
Now , ominously , the IMF ( and the World Bank ) are imposingly back in Washington  and not for a night on the town either .
The Invisible Ruins
I ‘m a New Yorker , and soon after Sept. 11 , 2001 , my daughter and I took the subway downtown to see the damage for ourselves .
The jets had been screaming overhead the preceding days , and that acrid smell from the collapse of the towers had drifted up the island .
But walking in that area , which was n’t yet known as Ground Zero , glimpsing down blocked - off side streets those humongous shards of the World Trade Center , that was staggering .
The indescribable scale of destruction was something the small screen simply could n’t transmit .
Within a few minutes , still blocks away , our throats were already raw and we were hacking and coughing .
As for so many people then , life brought films to my mind .
In my case , those giant shards conjured up , as I ’ve written elsewhere , the final scene of the original Planet of the Apes  that unforgettable shot of the Statue of Liberty atilt and half - buried in the sands of time as the two humans escape down the beach on horseback .
And yet in September 2001 , the real damage was largely confined to a number of square blocks of downtown Manhattan , including the shut - down Stock Exchange on Wall Street , as well as part of a single building in Washington , D.C. , and a field in Pennsylvania .
This , we were told , was “ the Pearl Harbor of the 21st century . ”
And soon enough , with a helping hand from the Bush administration , Americans from Akron to El Paso were officially  and mistakenly  terrified for their lives and for their country .
In the next seven years , the Bush administration managed to turn that misplaced fear into something like prophecy and bring down the house .
Today , on a visit to lower Manhattan , there would be no smoldering fires , no smoke , no raw throats , no gaping holes , no smashed buildings , no ruins , and yet , as you walked those streets , you would almost certainly be strolling among the ruins , amid the shards of American financial , political , and even military superpowerdom .
Think of it as Bush ’s hubris and bin Laden ’s revenge .
You would be facing the results , however unseen , of the real 9/11 , which is still taking place in relative slow motion seven years later .
It should scare us all .
Hey , I ’m depressed , are n’t you ?

The word technology has a very complex meaning , but it has a very simple definition .
It 's the sum total of all mechanical , electrical , and information systems that are used in the creation of products or services , including scientific research .
technology applied to various forms of art .
It 's amazing , however , that some people still think that technology is simply the result of human nature and is nothing more than a product of mankind 's endless quest to improve itself .

His life , unassuming , working beneath a tree , is the story of hundreds of thousands of Egyptians , those who went abroad to make a living , watched their children grow from a distance and returned to a nation that , in many ways , had slipped backward in their absence .
It is a story of good luck turning bad , of experience hardening into wisdom .

He was born in the port of Alexandria , the son of a railroad conductor .
He worked as a textile mechanic but in the 1970s he traveled to Saudi Arabia to work as a chauffeur .
It was a boom time of oil money and opportunity when Egyptian men with shiny passports and cheap suitcases headed toward Mecca and beyond to cities in eastern deserts .
It lasted awhile but then , he said , “ the Saudi king got rid of Egyptians for cheaper Asians .
. . .
“ So I went to work in Iraq , ” he smiles , rolling his eyes .
“ It was 1980 and when I got there the war between Iraq and Iran had broken out and I had to come home .
I was there four months , painting walls and laying tile .
It seemed like 14 years .
My toughest days were in Iraq , but my happiest were in Saudi Arabia .
I had a stable job .
I was dealing with foreigners and worked for a good company .
They gave us an annual vacation with a plane ticket . ”
All those years abroad had furnished his house in Egypt and helped support a wife and five children .
He returned from Iraq with little savings .
The reign of President Hosni Mubarak was beginning , and year by year , the simple business of living grew more expensive .
Fishermen from along the Nile and farmers from its delta streamed into Cairo hoping for fortune .
Few found it .
Tenements went up at the same pace costs were rising ; inflation ballooned to today ’s rate of nearly 24 % , the highest in more than 15 years .
Halawany ’s brother , a marble cutter , handed him a hammer and a chisel , taught him to carve squiggles and lines in rock and stone .
Sometimes he ’d make a sign for a mosque , but mostly he copied into marble Koranic verses and names of the dead handed to him on slips of paper .
He ’s done better than many , earning about $ 110 a month , including the pension for his old textile mechanic ’s job .
But it goes ; the money goes so quickly .

“ You do n’t ask a marble writer what ’s wrong with the country , ” he said .
“ You ask the president and the prime minister :
Why do we have this high inflation ?
Tell the president to go to the poor neighborhoods so he can see how people are living , instead of him asking his secretary what ’s going on out there .
Then he ’ll know .
These are bad times .
I get paid OK .
People are always dying so it ’s a good business , but this inflation sucks away any profit .
“ Many people ca n’t make it .
This is the worst time in Egypt I ’ve seen . ”
A man in the grave marker trade reaches conclusions about death and commerce : “ No more people are dying now than before , but there ’s more deaths among men than women .
Men are exposed to stress , I guess .
I have stress , ” he said .
“ I support a wife , a divorced daughter and a grandson .
My hope is to have enough money to go to the grave and to support my family until I get there . ”
He hammers , he works .
But there are names , no matter how skilled the craftsman , that can not be written .
They are the ones dropped on you unexpectedly , like his daughter who went into the hospital for sinus surgery and died on the operating table .
Complications .
Anesthesia .
A blur of words .
It was 1994 .
Halawany remembers getting the news , remembers how his chisel would n’t move , how the slate stayed blank .
Advertisement
“ I ca n’t write in marble for people I know , ” he said .
“ It ’s too emotional .
Once , I was asked to write for the husband of my cousin .
We were close and when I got the chisel to his name I burst into tears .
In the end , I ’m a human , not a machine .
I ’m always aware of death .
When I write the Koran sayings , I contemplate it . ”
The shade on Halawany ’s street widens ; the stonecutters break for tea and prayers .
Sadaq M. El - Sayed ’s name waits unfinished in marble .
Halawany will get to it .
But it is a time to linger , to speak of those days in Saudi Arabia , an adventure born of necessity , but still an adventure .
A man can leave part of himself somewhere , that younger , brash spirit that age , imperceptibly , chisels away .
“ I ’ll write my own gravestone , and on it will be this verse : ‘ But ah !
Thou soul at peace !
Return to thy Lord , content in His good pleasure !
Enter thou among
My bondmen !
Enter thou My garden ! ’ ”

Party Affiliation of the Now - Deceased Bruce Ivins , as Confirmed by His Local County Board of Elections , Adds Yet Another Curious Question to the Increasingly Troubling Investigation into the Post - 9/11 Terrorist Attacks on American Soil ...
Brad Friedman Byon 8/4/2008 , 6:13 pm PT
-- Brad Friedman
Bruce E. Ivins , reportedly on the verge of being indicted for capital murder in the anthrax killings , was a registered Democrat , according to the Fredrick County , MD , Board of Elections .
He had been registered there since 1982 and records indicate that he voted in " every election since 1996 , " including Democratic primaries , according to the official who responded to a request from West Virginia - based radio host Bob Kincaid .
The party affiliation of the bio-terror researcher who worked at U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease ( USAMRIID ) adds a notable twist to the ever increasing questions surrounding the bizarre case following Ivins ' reported suicide last week .
He was , according to media reports , soon to be indicted for charges related to the post - 9/11 terror attacks that rocked the nation and , as Salon 's Glen Greenwald has very effectively argued , served as a crucial influence in marching the country towards war with Iraq .
Last week , as the story of Ivins ' reported suicide was breaking , The BRAD BLOG excoriated the corporate mainstream media for failing to note that the targets of the multiple post - 9/11 terror attacks on American soil were primarily powerful men , perceived as " liberals " by the Republican right wing .
Nonetheless , despite two senior Democratic U.S. senators , Tom Daschle of SD and Patrick Leahy of VT , having been the only known governmental targets in the deadly letter campaign which also included perceived " liberal " media figurehead Tom Brokaw , the MSM coverage --- almost uniformly --- failed to note the obvious correlations in the attacks .
Most even failed to even mention the names of those who were directly targeted in what was clearly meant to appear as a follow - up attack from Muslim extremists .
Furthermore , as we also noted on Friday , despite a parade of reporters who had contacted Ivins ' oldest brother Thomas that day for comment , not one of them --- until us --- bothered even to inquire about Bruce 's political leanings or affiliations .
That it now turns out Ivins was a registered Democrat adds yet another curious twist to a story which is already revealing bizarre and potentially exculpatory evidence and other cracks in the government 's reported ( though , as yet , not publicly disclosed ) case against him .
Today , the New York Times noted , as we similarly did yesterday , that the FBI 's case against Ivins appears to be almost entirely circumstantial , at least based on the information so far available ...
As the Times , The BRAD BLOG , and many others have now noted , the case appears to hinge largely on the testimony of a social worker , Jean C. Duley , who had treated Ivins for a number of months in group therapy .
As it turns out , however , Duley herself has a criminal history ( as detailed by both Larisa Alexandrovna and Greenwald ) and is no longer working at the Fredrick , MD , facility where Ivins was being treated , according to Bloomberg News .
A physician , bio - terror specialist , and former colleague of Ivins , Meryl Nass raised significant questions about the veracity of Duley 's testimony against Ivins on her blog devoted to the topic .
Further , the Washington Post noted on Friday ( before they scrubbed the story from their website , but then re-asserted the charges on Sunday ) that colleagues of Ivins and other experts felt Ivins could n't have carried out the attacks , as " he had no access to dry , powdered anthrax " of the type used in the attacks at the Army lab in MD where he worked .
While it was too late to reach anyone for confirmation at the Frederick County , MD , Board of Elections , our source for this report , Bob Kincaid , creator and host of the progressive Head - On Radio Network , has been a long - time trusted friend of The BRAD BLOG .
He detailed the information he gathered and how he gathered it .
[ ED NOTE 5/8/08 1:45 pm PT :
We have since confirmed the information ourselves with the Frederick County Board of Elections .
See the update at the end of this article for details . ]
After he informed us of his findings late this afternoon , we asked if he had documents from the BoE to support the claim that Ivins was a Democrat .
He replied , via email , that he had no physical documentation , at this time , since " The nature of Maryland law was such that I had to provide them with a written request for info , signed by yrs trly . "
He " complied by e-mailing a scan of a signed request letter " and was told that he could either wait for the information in response to his request to be sent via the U.S. mail or he could be notified by phone .
" They ... informed me that the Board is n't allowed to e-mail such info in response " to such requests , Kincaid wrote and later confirmed when we chatted about the matter later on the phone , and on his radio program late this afternoon .
( The MP3 of that interview is now posted as an update at the bottom of this article . )
" I did n't want to wait for the snail mail , so I requested they let me know by phone , " Kincaid told us during the follow - up call .
" I asked for Bruce Ivins , " he explained while detailing his call to the BoE .
" I spelled the name , and they were well familiar with who I was talking about .
I can't imagine that there could be many other Bruce Ivins in Frederick , Maryland . "
The BRAD BLOG has reviewed the signed request that Kincaid says he sent to Stuart Harvey , Supervisor of the BoE , in which Kincaid noted that " Any response [ to the request ] may be made telephonically to the number above or to [ his email address ] .
Inasmuch as this is information for a story on deadline , there is no need to mail the response . "
" The purpose of this correspondence is to provide you with a written request , " Kincaid wrote to Harvey , " pursuant to Maryland law as you expressed it to me , for all public voter registration information for an individual by the name of Bruce Ivins , included , but not limited to name , address of registration , party affiliation and elections / primaries in which the registrant has voted . "
Kincaid was later called back by a deputy to the Supervisor of the Fredrick County BoE and informed that Ivins had been a registered Democrat and had voted in every election since 1996 .
The pertinent part of the initial email from Kincaid follows :
The nature of Maryland law was such that I had to provide them with a written request for info , signed by yrs trly .
I complied by e-mailing a scan of a signed request letter .
They then informed me that the Board is n't allowed to e-mail such info in response .
She instead conveyed the information by phone , said info being received by my lovely wife , Agnes .
That information via Noreen , the deputy to Stuart Harvey , Supervisor of the Frederick County , Maryland Board of Elections , is as follows : Bruce Ivins , Date of Registration 24 November 1982 .
Party of Registration : Democrat .
Records indicate he voted in every election since 1996 .
Kincaid confirmed again , on the air today , that his understanding was that Ivins had voted in every Democratic Primary election in Frederick County since ' 96 , since Maryland has a " closed " primary system , allowing only members of each political party to vote in their own primaries .
" So it was n't an Operation Chaos type of thing , " Kincaid explained on the air , referring to rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh 's campaign to encourage Republicans to vote for Hillary Clinton in this year 's Democratic Primary contests .
Little otherwise seems to be known so far about Ivins ' political affiliation and little has been reported on what would seem to be a crucial element in the case .
The toxic letters sent to the Democratic senators were written so as to have appeared to be from a Muslim extremist , and were used to further the Administration 's early allegations that the 9/11 attacks were from similar entities .
Ivins was known to have been a practicing Roman Catholic and a regular attendee of his local parish , according to a number of media accounts .
He had sent Letters to the Editor of his local paper , the Frederick News - Post , over the years .
The paper printed several of them .
Greenwald reported on the cryptic clues , perhaps revealed by those letters , regarding Ivins ' ideology .
The letters , which seem to indicate , contrary to his party registration , that he leaned politically rightward , were excerpted by Greenwald on Friday as follows :
Today we frequently admonish people who oppose abortion , euthanasia , assisted suicide or capital punishment to keep their religious , moral , and philosophical beliefs to themselves .
Before dispensing such admonishments in the future , perhaps we should gratefully consider some of our country 's most courageous , historical figures who refused to do so .
Though the underlying ideology is a bit difficult to discern , he seems clearly driven by a belief in the need for Christian doctrine to govern our laws and political institutions , with a particular interest in Catholic dogma .
He wrote things like this :
And then there 's this rather cryptic message , published in 2006 : Rabbi Morris Kosman is entirely correct in summarily rejecting the demands of the Frederick Imam for a " dialogue . "
By blood and faith , Jews are God 's chosen , and have no need for " dialogue " with any gentile .
End of " dialogue . "
A full reading of the first letter excerpted above by Greenwald , however , reveals that Ivins was speaking up for early religious leaders , such as Quakers , who believed " slavery was a sin " .
He goes on , in the same letter then , to laud American " ministers , rabbis and priests whose beliefs brought them to the forefront in the battle against forced , racial segregation in America . "
Other letters from Ivins to the News - Post exhibited still more signs of Progressivism , as late as this 2004 letter to the paper :
Readers of The Frederick News - Post were recently informed via letter to the editor ( " Gay marriage not supportable , " Dec. 26 ) , that " the newest studies indicate that you are not born gay . "
I 'm a scientist , as well as a married heterosexual , and I 'd be very interested in learning what those " newest studies " are .
Hopefully they are based upon scientific study , rather than political , social , cultural or religious ideology .
Going on to recommend a specific scientific study [ PDF ] on the matter , he notes :
The author , Amar Klar , ( a geneticist who works in Frederick ) states in the final sentence of the study summary , " These results suggest that sexual preference may be influenced in a significant proportion of homosexual men by a biological / genetic factor that also controls direction of hair - whorl rotation . "
It 's a very interesting paper , regardless what side you take on the debate of how individuals gain their sexual preference .
In 2002 Ivins wrote :
The Roman Catholic Church should learn from other equally worthy Christian denominations and eagerly welcome female clergy as well as married clergy .
And in 1999 he excoriated the " racial insensitivity , profanity and abuse " on rightwing talk radio shows that had recently been added to one of his local stations :
I tuned into WFMD 's " John and Ken " program a few weeks ago .
One of the hosts unashamedly used " G -- d --- " on the air , then a few moments later told a caller , " You talk like a black person ! " .
Click ..
A few days later I tried WFMD's " Mike Gallagher " program .
He referred to some of his listeners as " pinheads . "
Click .
Again ..
Capstar owes a special apology to African - American residents of the area , and local businesses should seriously rethink their commitment to sponsoring racial insensitivity , profanity and abuse on WFMD .
As well , it 's been reported that Ivins volunteered with the Red Cross and encouraged neighbors recycle their grass cuttings .
Given the similarities in the perceived political ideology among the targeted victims of the anthrax letters , the political affiliation or leanings of whoever was responsible for the attacks would seem key to the government 's still - undisclosed case .
Yet that aspect continues to be largely overlooked in the media coverage since Ivins ' death .
Greenwald noted this interesting exchange from a Vermont Daily Briefing interview with Leahy late last year , which highlights the political undertones in the case [ emphasis Greenwald's ] :
Leahy :
What I want to know --- I have a theory .
But what I want to know is why me , why Tom Daschle , why Tom Brokaw ?
What I want to know --- I have a theory .
But what I want to know is why me , why Tom Daschle , why Tom Brokaw ?
VDB : Right .
That all fits into the profile of a kind of hard - core and obviously insane ideologue on the far Right , somebody who would fixate on especially Tom Daschle , who at that point was the target of daily , vitriolic attacks on Right - wing talk radio .
Leahy : [ Slowly , with a little shake of the head ]
I do n't think it ’s somebody insane .
I 'd accept everything else you said .
But I do n’t think it 's somebody insane .
And I think there are people within our government --- certainly from the source of it --- who know where it came from .
[ Taps the table to let that settle in ]
And these people may not have had anything to do with it , but they certainly know where it came from .
While Ivins ' registration as a Democrat , originally filed as far back as 1982 , does n't necessarily mean he continued to hold the same political leanings today --- many voters who are registered , but who have n't moved , simply do not bother to change their party affiliation , even as their political beliefs morph over the years --- it 's certainly another point of interest in an increasingly troubling case .
Kincaid , who conceded during our interview that the revelation of Ivins ' party registration , in and of itself , was not necessarily " probative , " still found it difficult to believe that someone as virulently rightwing as the author of the anthrax letters was believed to have been , would continue year in and year out to vote in Democratic primary elections .
Why it has taken the mainstream corporate media this long to ask and investigate similar questions about the political affiliation of Ivins , or even probe their many unnamed " government official " sources who have been feeding them reports , is just one more troubling mystery in the ever - growing mountain of troubling aspects in this story .
UPDATE : As promised , here is our hour - long interview today with Bob Kincaid , from his Head - On program , concerning the latest developments , issues and concerns in the anthrax case .
Details concerning his findings on Bruce Ivins ' Democratic Party registration in Maryland are discussed in the final 15 minutes or so of the hour .

UPDATE 8/5/08 12:30 pm PT : A quick update .
Reader RS notes that both of the targets of the anthrax letters in the Senate , Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy , in addition to being Democrats like Ivins , are also both Roman Catholics , according to their Wikipedia pages .
As Ivins was , by all accounts , a practicing Roman Catholic who volunteered for his local parish , ( and as we 've been informed by Catholic readers that suicide is a grave sin , punishable by eternal damnation , in the faith , and as Ivins , the meticulous scientist and prolific writer reportedly left no suicide note ) the story just continues to grow curiouser and curiouser with each passing hour ...
UPDATE 8/5/08 1:40 pm PT : Just to close this loop .
We called the Frederick County Board of Elections today , now that they are open for business again , and the Deputy Election Director Noreen Schultz , the same person who called Kincaid back yesterday , confirmed to us that in fact Ivins was a registered Democrat since 1982 .
She said they only have voting records going back to 1996 in their database , but that , yes , Ivins " was a very regular voter " who had voted in every election , including Democratic Primaries , since that date .

Nowadays , even Google is questioning Google 's rose - colored portrait of its ever - expanding search advertising monopoly .
The way senior vp Jonathan Rosenberg tells it , Google will gradually tweak its AdWords ad platform until it displays almost no ads .
Ad " coverage " on the world 's largest search engine has certainly shrunk over the past several months , and when the subject was mooted during July 's quarterly earnings call , Rosenberg attributed this steady shrinkage to Google 's " continued focus on quality " advertising .
" [ Google co-founder ] Larry [ Page ] says we'd be better off showing just one ad [ per page ] - the perfect ad , " Rosenberg cooed , indicating that coverage would shrink even further .
But then , in a rare moment of Google candor , the other co-founder told listening reporters and financial analysts that Rosenberg 's " perfect ad " nonsense was indeed nonsense .
" There is some evidence that we 've been a little bit more aggressive in decreasing coverage than we ought to have been , " was the word from Sergey Brin .
" We 've been reexamining some of that . "
His candor was fleeting .
But with the company 's second quarter profits dipping below Wall Street expectations , it looked an awful lot like Brin and company were on the verge of cranking the dial on their AdWords money machine and cooking up added profits for quarters three and four - and beyond .
Remember : More coverage means more clicks , and more clicks means more money .
Well , little more than a month later , Google has announced significant changes to its ad platform .
Most notably , the company is killing AdWords ' much - discussed " minimum bid , " a means of discouraging what Google considers " low quality " ads .
The changes have yet to reach the web at large .
Google is testing the waters with " a very small segment of advertisers . "
But search engine marketers - and Wall Street analysts - can't help but wonder if this is Google 's play for more coverage .
And more revenue .
" No more minimum bids ? " says Adam Audette , founder of AudetteMedia , a boutique search marketing shop out of Bend , Oregon .
" It certainly looks like they 'll have more leeway to make more money . "
Meanwhile , as Jonathan " Perfect Ad " Rosenberg himself let slip during that shockingly - newsworthy earnings call , Google continues to expand a coverage - happy AdWords beta known as " Automatic Matching . "
Believe it or not , Auto Match spends your excess ad budget on keyword searches you are n't actually bidding on , and judging from initial tests , it empties your wallet just as pointlessly as expected .
Sergey Brin
Testing Auto Match with a seasoned Google advertiser , the Dallas , Texas - based search marketing outfit KeyRelevance saw spending increase 600 per cent on a single ad campaign , and most of that extra dough was spent on keyword searches that had little or nothing to do with the advertiser 's products .
" Auto Match decided the account needed help spending money , " says Jim Gilbert , the KeyRelevance ad guru who ran the tests .
" So it started spending money . "
Google insists it 's only interested in serving up relevant ads , satisfying both advertisers and web surfers .
But this commitment to quality goes only so far .
Google is also interested in making lots of money , and as the economy continues to soften , it 's worth remembering Mountain View has the power to juice profits whenever it likes .
With AdWords controlling 70 per cent of the search advertising market , even the slightest turn of the dial can mean millions .
When I showed Outlines of Ambient Information to the Semantic Web Interest Group , it generated many pages of discussion , and I 've had multiple requests for further explanation .
What has led someone who 's worked on the Semantic Web for eight years to “ suddenly ” ditch it ?
The process was kickstarted in September 2007 when I got very interested in doing something useful with RDF .
The first thing I did was to write a crawler , and survey nearly twenty million triples in the wild to see what kind of data was out there .
I made a list of the top 500 ontologies , but none of them were very compelling , so I decided to concentrate on some things that might interest me , especially weather forecasts .
I set up a meteorology ontology , and exported thirty - five weather forecasts from the NOAA forecasts website .
The process for exporting the data was very fragile , which was annoying .
Next I decided to work on an RDF API called Trio , so that I could make RDF cool .
RDF , I figured , ought to be a lot simpler than it is at the moment ; I wanted to make it as easy to use as JSON .
Surely then the usecases would follow .
Indeed I was thinking about genealogy and all sorts of things , but first I wanted to do what TimBL was doing and work on a generic Semantic Web browser .
I started working on that , calling it Arcs , and I managed to create a sublime user interface for it .
But there was no use of it .
I was n't using any of the technologies for anything , except for things related to the technology itself .
The Semantic Web is utterly inbred in that respect .
The problem is in the model , that we create this metaformat , RDF , and then the use cases will come .
But they have n't , and they wo n't .
Even the genealogy use case turned out to be based on a fallacy .
The very few use cases that there are , such as Dan Connolly 's hAudio export process , do n't justify hundreds of eminent computer scientists cranking out specification after specification and API after API .
There are lots of other failings that I could point out about the Semantic Web , but I did n't want to do that .
I did n't want to turn into merely a griping and unconstructive commentator , which is what can happen when you only concentrate on the melancholy aspects of something like this .
So instead I thought : what kind of Semantic Web style things would I like to work on ?
What can computer science deliver , in the medium term ?
Some of those things are what I outlined in my article on Ambient Information .
I think that they 're things that Semantic Web developers would be interested in working on , except that they do n't really require many formats or specifications or even tools in some cases .
When we discussed this on the Semantic Web Interest Group , the conversation kept turning to how the formats could be fixed to make the use cases that I outlined happen .
“ Yeah , Sean 's right , let 's fix our languages ! ”
But it 's not the languages which are broken , except in as much as they are entirely broken : because it 's the mentality of their design which is broken .
You can't , it has turned out , make a metalanguage like RDF and then go looking for use cases .
We thought you could , but you can't .
It 's taken eight years to realise .
This is n't to say that advanced computational techniques have no place to play in our future .
Things like natural language processing and advances in cognitive science can be nothing but a benefit if the models that they produce are true advances in our knowledge .
The years of thinking and argument over RDF will still have happened , but its results must now be abandoned because they serve as a powerful distraction from the things that matter .
We all have a vote to cast in terms of the things that we work on .
I 've considered my vote very carefully , and RDF is the wrong candidate .
It 's not prudent , perhaps even not moral ( if that does n't sound too melodramatic ) , to work on RDF , OWL , SPARQL , RIF , the broken ideas of distributed trust , CWM , Tabulator , Dublin Core , FOAF , SIOC , and any of these kinds of things .
The counter - argument that the Semantic Web Interest Group folk gave at first before coming to some level of acceptance was that there are use cases , that I just have to look harder .
But that 's sorta the point : if you have to look hard , then you 're looking too hard .
The things that I outlined are not ones that I had to look hard for , because the annoyance of them not being solved is a daily and pervasive thing .
Go for the low - hanging fruit first !
Once the aura of self - delusion regarding the Semantic Web is stripped away , you 're left with two things .
An excellent community , which is one of the Semantic Web 's real strengths , and a whole lot of really cool things that computer scientists can be working on .
My current goals are to explore those use cases more thoroughly , and somehow integrate them with the community if I can .
This 'll be hard because the self - delusion is partly institutional , and people have invested such an amount of effort into this as to make it self - perpetuating .
But you wo n't have to just write - off all the work ; and indeed you can't .
It 's just that you can't be an effective computer scientist and a Semantic Web developer , with the current stack of technologies in the Semantic Web layer cake .
If I have to do these things without the community , then I will .
If you want to be trendy , perhaps you can call the sorts of things that I want to work on part of the “ semantic web ” , lowercase , not capitalised .
But in as much as this reminds me of the airy nothinghood that the Semantic Web espouses , it 's probably best to just start from scratch on the trendy terminology front as well .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama holds a five - point lead over Republican John McCain , with little immediate indication their final public debate did much to sway the presidential race , a Reuters / C- SPAN / ZOGBY poll showed on Friday .
Obama ’s edge over McCain held steady at 49 percent to 44 percent among likely U.S. voters in the four - day tracking poll , unchanged from results before the two men met on Wednesday for their third and last debate before the November 4 election .
The poll of 1,210 likely voters had a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points .
Pollster John Zogby said Friday ’s results -- in which the most recent day ’s results are added and the oldest day ’s results are dropped in an effort to measure changing momentum -- may not reflect the full impact of the debate .
“ Only one - quarter of this sample is post - debate , so we ’ll have to wait a few more days to see , ” he said .
“ We ’ll have to look tomorrow to see if there was any McCain boost at all . ”
Quick polls taken after Wednesday ’s debate judged Obama the victor , joining a string of surveys that show him ahead both in national polls and in most of the battleground states where the presidential election will be decided .
Obama , 47 , has focused on the economy while on the campaign trail , appealing to voters buffeted by the global credit crisis and wild stock market swings on Wall Street .

McCain , 72 , has sought to deliver his own economic message , along with aggressive attacks on Obama , but has failed to gain traction among crucial independent voters .
Obama held a 19 - point lead in this group on Friday , up 5 points from Thursday ’s figures .
“ It would seem the independents are solidifying around Obama , which would be important , ” Zogby said .
Other national polls have given Obama a double - digit overall lead , although most have him in a range of 2 to 9 points ahead .
Both candidates continue to do well with their core supporters , with Obama winning nine of every 10 black voters and a holding a 10 - point lead among women voters .
McCain held a narrow 1 - point lead among male voters and a larger 12 - point lead among whites .
Independent Ralph Nader drew 2 percent support in the poll , while Libertarian Bob Barr got 1 percent , both unchanged from Thursday .
The U.S. president is determined not by the most votes nationally but by a majority of the Electoral College , which has 538 members allotted to all 50 states and the District of Columbia in proportion to their representation in Congress .
Arkansas town imposes ' martial law ' style lockdown David Edwards and Diane Sweet
Published : Tuesday August 12 , 2008
Print This Email This HELENA - WEST HELENA -
A neighborhood here is on police lock down , all over a $ 6 , or maybe $ 8 , debt .
The feud started earlier this week , when a man recently released from jail refused to pay the money back to a neighbor , residents and authorities said .
A group of men jumped the ex-inmate and fired guns into the air and into homes , mostly after dark , residents and authorities said , prompting some people to sleep on the floors for fear of being struck by stray bullets .
The man and his buddies retaliated - with guns , as well - turning the already high crime neighborhood into what residents said sounded for a few nights like a combat zone .
As a consequence , Mayor James Valley on Thursday called for a lockdown of the roughly 10 - block neighborhood northwest of City Hall , in what was formerly West Helena .
No loitering .
No walking the streets .
" No hanging out . "
On Thursday night , 18 - 20 police officers carrying M - 16 rifles , shotguns and night - vision scopes saturated the " cur - 1 few zone " for 5 / 2 hours , arresting about eight people and confiscating drugs and loaded weapons , police said .
" It 's something akin to martial law in that particular area , " Valley said .
" It got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we did n't do something . "
Residents in the lock down area have mixed feelings about the mayor 's executive order , which Valley said he would keep in place until the City Council can come up with a long - term plan at its Aug. 19 meeting .
Some residents like the police presence .
Others call it overwhelming .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas calls it unconstitutional .
" In a way , I like it because they shot up my house , too , " said Oliver of 234 Second St . " And in a way , I do n't like it because a few minutes ago I had to walk to the store and the police stopped me and asked me what I was doing and where I was going . "
Oliver , a 29 - year - old with bloodshot eyes who was in his carport drinking a Natural Ice beer Friday afternoon , said his home had five bullet holes in it from the mayhem earlier in the week .
The lock down will be enforced 24 hours a day , according to the order , and all pedestrian and vehicle traffic will be subject to stop and investigation .
Moreover , the city 's Code Enforcement Department will be issuing nuisance - abatement evictions for people living in the lock down area in any house where at least three previous criminal violations have occurred , the order said .
The ACLU of Arkansas sent Valley a letter Friday , calling the order " blatantly unconstitutional on numerous grounds " and demanding that he lift the order immediately .
" First , such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the United States , barring riot , insurrection , or natural disaster , " ACLU attorney Holly Dickson wrote in the letter .
" Not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches , seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city . "
The letter also claims that the language in the order violates the Fourth Amendment and that placing adults under house arrest is unconstitutional .
" Notwithstanding the City Code and Curfew Order , the residents of Helena - West Helena have the right to sit under shade trees in their front yard , to ride their bicycles along the streets , protest this policy , and drive around the city with the full protections of the First , Fourth , and Fourteenth Amendments , " the letter continued .
Valley said he had n't read the letter as of Friday night but that he 's " not concerned about the ACLU . "
" I invite them to move in on Second Street and be up all night with people shooting at them , " Valley said .
" Thatâs my comment to them . "
Valley called the situation extraordinary .
People in the area had evaded police by falsely reporting criminal activity in other areas of town and falsely reporting shots fired from vehicles that did n't exist , Police Chief Fred Fielder said .
Ronald Scott , the city 's assistant police chief , said police are using common sense when dealing with pedestrians in the lock down area .
If they are polite and have a good reason to be out or walking , then police will let them go .
If they are suspicious or have " a smart mouth , " they will be told to get inside , leave the area or be arrested , Scott said .
Matt DeCample , a spokesman for Gov. Mike Beebe , said he is aware of the situation in Helena - West Helena but that the state has n't been asked to offer any assistance .
" It 's a municipal matter , " he said .
Beth Wiedower , field representative for the Arkansas Delta Rural Heritage Development Initiative , said the " crime wave " in no way should affect tourism in the city known for its jazz and blues .
Brenda Kelly , a resident in the lock down area , said she 's happy that the curfew is in place .
" Since this began , it 's more quiet and peaceful around here , " she said .
" I think they 're doing a wonderful job .
Prior to this , the kids were dealing drugs right in the middle of the street , stopping cars saying ' hey , hey , what you got . '
" You could n't walk down the streets .
Your little kids could n't , either .
We were just that scared . "
Other residents say their rights are being violated .
" It 's messed up , " said Daniel Pimpleton , 16 .
" You 're not free , and you 're supposed to be free .
You can't go outside and walk the streets .
Look - the entire area is empty .
There 's nobody out here . "
Pimpleton said police warned him that if he and his friends roamed the streets , they could be arrested .
Courtney Otis expressed similar disappointment about the lock down .
" We 're grown , and the mayor 's trying to give us a curfew , " he said .
" We do n't need no curfew .
The mayor is overreacting .
" He ca n't stop nobody from shooting .
If they 're going to shoot , they 're going to shoot . "
A copy of the ACLU 's letter to the Mayor of Helena - West Helena is available online here .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Sunday said he suspected “ we will see other major financial firms fail , ” but it did not need to be a problem .

“ It depends on how it is handled and how the liquidations take place , ” Greenspan said on the ABC program , “ This Week . ”
“ And indeed we should n’t try to protect every single institution .
The ordinary course of financial change has winners and losers . ”
Greenspan also said it was a very bad idea to get rid of short selling even though stock in major financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers and American International Group have been beaten down in recent days .
In July , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a temporary emergency rule to curb illegal short selling in 19 major finance stocks including Lehman and mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which have since been taken over by the government .
The SEC ’s emergency order ended in mid-August and the agency is not expected to reinstate the rule for those 19 firms or the rest of the market .
When asked whether the government should help Lehman the same way it helped Bear Stearns , Greenspan said the government is trying to do it in a different manner .
“ When Bear Stearns was bailed out , it drew a line under that level of firm , implying that anything that was larger than that firm was capable of getting federal assistance , ” he said .
“ Now if you generalize that , it is very clear that that is an unsustainable situation in the financial markets and in the markets . ”
The Fed and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson helped orchestrate JP Morgan ’s takeover of Bear Stearns , complete with a $ 29 billion promise to absorb losses .
Greenspan also said the chances of escaping a recession was “ less than 50 percent . ”
“ I ca n’t believe we could have a once - in - a - century type of financial crisis without a significant impact on the real economy globally , and I think that indeed is what is in the process of occurring .

An FCC technical report issued Friday makes it look more likely that the US government will sign off on a Google - led pitch to clear the white space spectrum for free use by Android .
The news could n't come at a worse time for T - Mobile .
With Google and a growing number of influential partners putting pressure on the FCC to make spectrum in the white spaces available for " free and open access , " a team of FCC technologists on Friday released a report suggesting that worries about wireless interference from so - called white spaces devices -- raised by T - Mobile and other parties -- are overblown .
Essentially , the FCC 's report finds that T - Mobile 's Advanced Wireless Services - 3 ( AWS - 3 ) spectrum does not need to be buffered by unused spectrum in order to prevent interference to T - Mobile 's emerging 3G commercial wireless network by such devices , which would implement networking services on otherwise unused frequencies .
Advertisement
T- Mobile purchased its AWS - 1 spectrum ( the 2110 - 2155 MHz band ) for more than $ 4 billion a few years ago .
Together with AT&T , Nokia Siemens Networks , MetroPCS , and the CTIA , T - Mobile had been arguing that recent FCC tests in Seattle prove that wireless operations in the AWS - 3 spectrum -- which run in the 2155 - 2180 band -- would interfere with mobile devices in T - Mobile 's AWS - 1 spectrum .
T- Mobile has been fighting off initiatives by the FCC to auction off the currently unused AWS - 3 spectrum , by M2Z Networks to offer a nationwide municipal Wi-Fi service on AWS - 3 , and by Google and an ever growing list of its partners to co-opt unused , " white " spaces in the wireless spectrum for free and open access by the public .
Ironically , though , with its upcoming G1 phone , T - Mobile is slated to start shipping the industry 's first Android device for use on its commercial WCDMA network on October 16 .
Meanwhile , rumors raged over the weekend that 1.5 million T - Mobile customers have already pre-ordered the G1 , a larger number of people than those who ordered Apple 's iPhone 3G on its first day .
As of this afternoon , however , those reports remained unconfirmed .
In the report released on Friday , FCC engineers said their recent tests in Seattle showed that the AWS - 1 spectrum could be used for wireless broadband services " without significant risk of harmful interference " to mobile devices running on T - Mobile 's AWS - 1 spectrum .
The commission also indicated that , consequently , it is n't necessary -- as T - Mobile had wanted -- to expand AWS - 1 to include the spectrum currently allocated to T - Mobile 's AWS - 3 as some sort of an interference buffer zone .
Opponents to the Google 's white spaces plan have included not just T - Mobile , but also the National Association of Broadcasters ( NAB ) and the wireless microphone industry .
These two groups contend that interference will be caused to HDTV and other digital TV signals if mobile devices start operating in currently unused white spaces next to spectrum allocated by the FCC for TV broadcasting .
Three weeks ago , following the New York City launch of T - Mobile 's Android - based G1 phone , Google co-founder Larry Page went to Washington , to urge the FCC to hurry up and make a decision about opening up the white spaces before the November elections .
While there , Page also blamed " politics " for earlier FCC test results which indicated that white spaces devices running on Android and Microsoft Windows Mobile platforms do , in fact , cause interference to TV broadcasting equipment and wireless microphones in white spaces adjacent to TV spectrum .
About a week later , two heavyweight industry coalitions -- the BSA , which includes Apple ; and the CCIA , which claims Linux distributor Red Hat as a member -- joined the Google - spearheaded Wireless Industry Alliance ( WIA ) .
Popularized by Google , the MapReduce paradigm has proven to be a powerful way to analyze large datasets by harnessing the power of commodity clusters .
While it provides a straightforward computational model , the approach suffers from certain key limitations , as discussed in a prior post :
The restriction to a rigid data flow model ( Map followed by Reduce ) .
Sometimes you need other flows e.g. , map - reduce - map , union - map - reduce , join - reduce .
Common data analysis operations , which are provided by database systems as primitives , need to be recoded by hand each time in Java or C/C++ : e.g. , join , filter , common aggregates , group by , union , distinct .
The programmer has to hand - optimize the execution plan , for example by deciding how many map and reduce nodes are needed .
For complex chained flows , this can become a nightmare .
Databases provide query optimizers for this purpose -- the precise sequence of operations is decided by the optimizer rather than by a programmer .
Three approaches have emerged to bridge the gap between relational databases and Map Reduce .
Let 's examine each approach in turn and then discuss their pros and cons .
The first approach is to create a new higher - level scripting language that uses Map and Reduce as primitive operations .
Using such a scripting language , one can express operations that require multiple map reduce steps , together with joins and other set - oriented data processing operations .
This approach is exemplified by Pig Latin , being developed by a team at Yahoo .
PigLatin provides primitive operations that are commonly found in database systems , such as Group By , Join , Filter , Union , ForEach , and Distinct .
Each PigLatin operator can take a User Defined Function ( UDF ) as a parameter .
The programmer creates a script that chains these operators to achieve the desired effect .
In effect , the programmer codes by hand the query execution plan that might have been generated by a SQL engine .
The effect of a single Map Reduce can be simulated by a Filter step followed by a Group By step .
In many common cases , we do n't even need to use UDFs , if the filtering and grouping criteria are straightforward ones that are supported in PigLatin .
The PigLatin engine translates each script into a sequence of jobs on a Hadoop cluster .
The PigLatin team reports that 25 % of Hadoop jobs on Yahoo today originate as PigLatin scripts .
That 's impressive adoption .
Another interesting solution in this category is Sawzall , a new scripting language developed at Google .
Sawzall allows map reduce operations to be coded using a language that is reminiscent of awk .
If your computation fits the Sawzall model , the code is much shorter and more elegant than C/C++/ Java Map and Reduce functions .
Sawzall , however , suffers from two drawbacks : it limits the programmer to a prefined set of aggregations in the Reduce phase ( although it supplies a big library of these ) ; and it offers no support for data analysis that goes beyond a single Map Reduce step , as PigLatin does .
Most important , Sawzall is not available outside of Google , while PigLatin has been open - sourced by Yahoo .
The second approach is to integrate Map Reduce with a SQL database .
Two database companies have recently announced support for MapReduce : Greenplum and Aster Data .
Interestingly , they have taken two very different approaches .
I will call Greenplum 's approach " loose coupling " and Aster Data 's approach " tight coupling " .
Let 's examine each in turn .
Greenplum 's loose - coupling approach ties together Greenplum 's database with Hadoop 's implementation of Map Reduce .
A Hadoop Map Reduce operation is visible as a database view within Greenplum 's SQL interpreter .
Conversely , Hadoop map and reduce functions can access data in the database by iterating over the results of database queries .
Issuing a SQL query that uses a map - reduce view will launch the corresponding map - reduce operation , whose results can then be processed by the rest of the SQL query .
Aster Data 's tight - coupling approach is more interesting : the database natively supports map reduce ( with no need for Hadoop ) .
Map and reduce functions can be written in a variety of programming languages ( C/C++ , java , python ) .
Aster has extended the SQL language itself to support how these functions get invoked , creating a new SQL dialect called SQL / MR .
One of the cool features is that map and reduce functions are automatically polymorphic , just like native SQL functions such as SUM , COUNT and so on : the programmer can write them once and the database engine can invoke them with rows with different numbers of columns and columns of different types .
This is a huge convenience over the Hadoop approach .
What are the pros and cons of these three different approaches ?
The advantage of the Pig Latin approach is that it works directly at the file level , and therefore it can express MapReduce computations that do n't fit the relational data model .
An example of such an operation is building an inverted index on a collection of text documents .
Databases in general are bad at handling large text and image data , which are treated as " blobs . "
The biggest disadvantages of the PigLatin approach is the need to learn an entirely new programming language .
There is a large group of developers and DBA 's familiar with SQL , and PigLatin does not have this support base .
The second disadvantage is that the developer has to code declarative query plans by hand , while SQL programmer can rely on two decades of work on SQL query optimizers , which can automatically decide the order of operations , the degree of parallelism , and when to use indexes .
The advantages and disadvantages of the SQL integration approach in general mirror those of the Pig Latin approach .
The loose coupling approach of Greenplum allows the use of files as well as relations , and therefore in principle supports file - based computations .
The burden is on the application programmer , however , to decide on the scheduling and optimization of the Hadoop portion of the computation , without much help from the database .
Aster 's tight - coupling approach , on the other hand , allows a much greater degree of automatic query optimization .
The database system is intimately involved in the way map and reduce operations are scheduled across the cluster , and can decide on the degree of parallelism , as well use strategies such as pipelining across map reduce and relational operators .
In addition , since the database system is solely in charge of overall resource allocation and usage , it also ensures sandboxing of user - defined code , preventing it from consuming too many resources and slowing down other tasks .
For computations that use only data in the relational database , Aster by far has the most elegant solution ; the weakness , of course , is that data stored outside the database is off - limits .
Update : Tassos Argyros from Aster Data points out that Aster 's implementation does in fact allow access to data stored outside the database .
The developer needs to write a UDF that exposes the data to the database engine .
All three approaches thus have their strengths and weaknesses .
It 's exciting to see the emergence of fresh thinking on data analytics , going beyond the initial file - oriented Map Reduce model .
Over time , these approaches will evolve , borrowing learnings from one other .
In time one or more will become the dominant paradigm for data analytics ; I will be watching this space with great interest .
Disclosure : I 'm an investor in Aster Data and sit on their Board of Directors .
McCain ’s ' that one ' takes off online
The puzzling reference to Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) as “ that one ” by Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) has become the most - discussed moment of a bland , forgettable presidential “ debate . ”
“ It ’s President That One to you , ” a poster on Daily Kos chided McCain .
Advertisement
A website , http://www.thatone08.com, is selling T - shirts featuring both McCain and Obama , and has a logo with Obama ’s rising - sun campaign changed to read “ Thatone . ”
There 's a “ that one ” Facebook page and a biography with every Obama reference changed to “ that one . ”
“ That one ” was named the winner of the dreary debate by both Arianna Huffington at The Huffington Post and John Dickerson at Slate .
Liberal critics argue that the expression was at least cranky and perhaps demeaning , as if referring to “ those people . ”
Some Obama supporters have joked that they thought McCain had forgotten Obama ’s name , and one Democrat suggested the slogan , “ That one ... that won . ”
The Obama campaign immediately e-mailed reporters to call attention to McCain ’s use of the phrase , when he said : “ My friends , I know you grow a little weary with this back - and - forth .
It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies , billions for the oil companies , and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney .
You know who voted for it ?
You might never know .
That one .
You know who voted against it ?
Me . ”
Maria Gavrilovic of CBS
News reported from the spin room in Nashville that the Obama campaign was using the comment to argue that McCain looked “ peevish , irascible , uncomfortable , odd . ”
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe told her it was an “ odd ” moment .
And Obama chief strategist David Axelrod noted that last time McCain did n’t look at Obama and now he is calling him “ that one . ”
Fox ’s Major Garrett reported to post - debate viewers : “ The Obama campaign only highlighted it for this reason :
They believe it was a moment of crankiness from John McCain , and that ’s kind of a button they like to push on John McCain . ”
Nicolle Wallace of the McCain campaign told CBS : “ I ’m shocked that at a moment of national crisis , where our economy is on the minds of every single person , I am shocked that they are again proving to be the fussiest campaign in American history . ”
Pundits at first were skeptical about the Obama spin .
On ABC ’s “ Nightline , ” senior Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos , who was at the debate hall , said : “ That did n’t really strike me , in the moment . ”
“ Me neither , ” anchor Terry Moran replied .
“ The Obama people are pushing it pretty hard , ” Stephanopoulos continued .
“ They ’re saying it showed disdain again .
What surprises me even more :
In the spin room tonight , the Republican National Committee is acting like they ’re going to keep saying ‘ that one ’ about Barack Obama .
I think that ’s a huge mistake . ”
“ I ’m missing the point of that , ” Moran said .
“ I ’m not sure I get it , either , ” Stephanopoulos said .
Moran concluded : “ I ’m not even sure it ’s that demeaning . ”

To make SQL Queries Case Sensitive using Collation .
You can make SQL Queries Case sensitive at the column level or Table level or DataBase level
Download source code for To make SQL Queries Case Sensitive
Introduction
How to make SQL queries case sensitive .
How to do it ?
If you installed SQL Server with the default collation options , you might find that the following queries return the same results :
CREATE TABLE mytable ( mycolumn VARCHAR ( 10 ) ) GO SET NOCOUNT ON INSERT mytable VALUES ( ' Case ' ) GO SELECT mycolumn FROM mytable WHERE mycolumn = ' Case ' SELECT mycolumn FROM mytable WHERE mycolumn = ' caSE ' SELECT mycolumn FROM mytable WHERE mycolumn = ' case '
You can alter your query by forcing collation at the column level :
SELECT mycolumn FROM mytable WHERE mycolumn = ' case ' AND CAST ( mycolumn AS VARBINARY ( 10 ) ) = CAST ( ' Case ' AS VARBINARY ( 10 ) ) SELECT mycolumn FROM mytable WHERE mycolumn = ' case ' AND CAST ( mycolumn AS VARBINARY ( 10 ) ) = CAST ( ' caSE ' AS VARBINARY ( 10 ) ) SELECT mycolumn FROM mytable WHERE mycolumn = ' case ' AND CAST ( mycolumn AS VARBINARY ( 10 ) ) = CAST ( ' case ' AS VARBINARY ( 10 ) ) -- if myColumn has an index , you will likely benefit by adding -- AND myColumn = ' case '
If you want to do this in a more global way , instead of modifying each individual query , you can force the collation at the database level , or at the column level , using the ALTER DATABASE and ALTER TABLE commands , respectively .
You can see the current collation level on the properties tab of the database server , through Enterprise Manager ( if you 're going to change this setting , MAKE NOTE OF THIS VALUE ) :
And you can see the description from running the following query :
SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX
( '< databasename > ' , ' Collation ' )
As changing this setting can impact applications and SQL queries , I would isolate this test first .
In SQL Server 2000 , you can easily run an ALTER TABLE statement to change the sort order of a specific column , forcing it to be case sensitive .
First , execute the following query to determine what you need to change it back to :
EXEC sp_help ' mytable '
The second recordset should contain the following information , in a default scenario :
Column_Name Collation
----------- ----------------------------------------------
mycolumn SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS
Whatever the ' Collation ' column returns , you now know what you need to change it back to after you make the following change , which will force case sensitivity :

Mrs Palin denies that she abused her position to settle a personal feud A group of Alaskan state employees have agreed to testify at a probe into alleged abuses of power by Republican vice - presidential nominee , Sarah Palin .
Mrs Palin , who is governor of Alaska , denies claims she acted improperly in firing a senior state official .
The seven officials had previously refused to testify to the Alaska Legislative Council .
The news comes after a weekend of fierce campaigning between the Obama and McCain camps .
Alaska 's attorney general said the seven public employees had agreed to give evidence to the Alaska Legislative Council about the affair which has become known as " Troopergate " .
Feud claims Mrs Palin is accused of removing Alaska Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan from his post after he had refused her request to fire her ex-brother - in - law , Mike Wooten , as a state trooper .
The investigation centres on the dismissal of Alaska 's public safety chief Mr Wooten was involved in a contentious divorce and child custody battle with her younger sister .
Critics say Mrs Palin was using her power as governor to pursue a personal feud .
But Mrs Palin insists that she fired Mr Monegan over disagreements about budget priorities .
An independent investigator , Steve Branchflower , is due to present his findings on 10 October .
Last Friday , an Alaskan judge rejected a lawsuit filed by Republican lawmakers which claimed the council had exceeded its authority when it ordered the probe .
Judge Peter Michalski said it was " legitimately within the scope of the legislature 's investigatory power to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the termination [ of ] a public officer " .
Republican politicians also claim the investigation , which began before Mrs Palin was named as running mate for presidential nominee John McCain , has become tainted by partisan politics .
A lawyer for the five legislators who brought the lawsuit claimed the timing and manner of the inquiry " violates the fundamental , affirmative individual constitutional right to fair and just treatment " .
Subpoena Mrs Palin 's husband , Todd Palin , had previously refused to testify under subpoena to the investigator , although he was not a plaintiff in the lawsuit .
Both sides are campaigning hard as the race enters the final month
It is not known whether he or Mrs Palin will now testify in the case , which analysts say could damage the final weeks of campaigning for Mr McCain .
The development comes after Mrs Palin sparked controversy during weekend campaign stops when she claimed Democratic rival Barack Obama had links with terrorists .
She said he had been " palling around " with an ex-member of US - based militant group Weather Underground .
The radical movement waged a violent campaign against the Vietnam War during the 1960s when Senator Obama was a child .
Mr Obama once served on a charity board with a former member of the group , Bill Ayers , but he has denied any close links with him and has denounced Weather Underground .
The Illinois senator rejected Mrs Palin 's accusations as " smears " and said Republicans were attempting to distract voters from the real issues .
The Obama campaign responded with a new advertisement , which will air nationally on cable TV stations , claiming Mr McCain has behaved erratically during the Wall Street meltdown and was " out of touch " on the economy .

A review of medical studies on Gulf War syndrome supports the theory that the still - hazy disorder was caused by a group of related chemicals found in pesticides used around military facilities and anti-nerve - gas pills given to soldiers , according to a study released Monday .
A similar chemical was also found in nerve gas that was inadvertently released when U.S. soldiers destroyed a munitions depot just after the 1991 war , according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The group of chemicals , known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors , has long been discussed as a possible cause of Gulf War syndrome .
The review “ thoroughly , conclusively shows that this class of chemicals actually are a cause of illness in Gulf War veterans , ” said Dr. Beatrice Golomb , an associate professor of medicine at UC San Diego and the author of the latest paper .
Advertisement
Other researchers , however , said the syndrome ’s symptoms are so varied that it ’s probably difficult to place the blame on a single cause .
“ It seems clear at this point , 17 years beyond the conflict , that the chances we will ever resolve this with any single ‘ smoking gun ’ exposure grows smaller with time , ” said Dr. Charles Engel , director of the Department of Defense Deployment Health Clinical Center at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington .
Gulf
War syndrome is a complex -- and controversial -- illness typically characterized by a variety of symptoms , including fatigue , muscle or joint pain and mood problems .
About 200,000 veterans are believed to suffer from it , according to the study .
But there is still uncertainty .
A panel of the federal Institute of Medicine said in 2006 that it could not say if there was a coherent set of symptoms that pointed to an identifiable syndrome .
Advertisement
Researchers have proposed a number of potential causes , including psychological stress and exposure to toxic materials from oil - well fires and depleted - uranium ammunition , experts said .
In toxic doses , acetylcholinesterase inhibitors cause unbridled signaling between cells , potentially leading to muscle paralysis , seizures and excess secretion in the airways .
Previous studies have estimated that at least 250,000 soldiers were exposed to some form of the chemical .
Golomb ’s study looked at more than 70 studies on Gulf War syndrome and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors .
Advertisement
She found that 18 of the 21 epidemiological studies looking at chronic health problems in Gulf War veterans showed a connection to at least one kind of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor exposure .
Golomb also noted several studies that found sick veterans were more likely to have an enzyme problem that lowered their ability to clear the chemicals from their bodies .
Several studies also found Gulf
War syndrome - like symptoms in farmworkers exposed to pesticides and victims of the 1995 sarin gas attacks in Japan .
Some of the studies showed similar enzyme deficiencies .
The analysis found few studies that confirmed connections to other causes for Gulf War syndrome .
Advertisement
“ The importance of this paper is that it brings together research from different realms , which are all parallel and point in the same direction , ” said Lea Steele , an epidemiologist who has served as scientific advisor to the Department of Veterans Affairs .
She was not involved in the analysis .
Engel , of Walter Reed , said he was unconvinced -- in part because there is little , if any , accurate measurement of chemical exposures during the war .
“ It is well known that significant error results from looking back years after the fact and asking people to try to recall potential exposures , ” he said .

Big Guns Come Out In Effort To Show RIAA 's Lawsuits Are Unconstitutional
from the this - ought - to - be - worth - watching dept
Imagine a statute which , in the name of deterrence , provides for a $ 750 fine for each mile - per - hour that a driver exceeds the speed limit , with the fine escalating to $ 150,000 per mile over the limit if the driver knew he or she was speeding .
Imagine that the fines are not publicized , and most drivers do not know they exist .
Imagine that enforcement of the fines is put in the hands of a private , self - interested police force , that has no political accountability , that can pursue any defendant it chooses at its own whim , that can accept or reject payoffs in exchange for not prosecuting the tickets , and that pockets for itself all payoffs and fines .
Imagine that a significant percentage of these fines were never contested , regardless of whether they had merit , because the individuals being fined have limited financial resources and little idea of whether they can prevail in front of an objective judicial body .
This Court should exercise its inherent power to allow background image redress to Joel Tenenbaum for Plaintiffs ' abuse of law and federal civil court process .
As detailed throughout this brief , Plaintiffs are using any and all available avenues of federal process to pursue grossly disproportionate -- and unconstitutional -- punitive damages in the name of making an example of him to an entire generation of students .
The case at hand warrants the use of inherent federal power not just because of what Plaintiffs are doing to Joel Tenenbaum in this Court , but because of the manner in which Plaintiffs are abusing the federal courts all across the country .
Plaintiffs have pursued over 30,000 individuals in the same way they have pursued Joel ....
For these 30,000 individuals , Plaintiffs have wielded federal process as a bludgeon , threatening legal action to such an extent that settlement remains the only viable option .
Joel Tenenbaum is unique in his insistence , in the face of it all , on having his day in court .
The federal courts have an inherent interest in deciding whether they will continue being used as the bludgeon in RIAA 's campaign of sacrificing individuals in this way .
In essence , Plaintiffs are using the prosecution of Joel Tenenbaum to extort other accused infringers : the accused are told to either pay the settlement , or else be exposed to the protracted litigation and potentially astronomical damages that Joel now faces .
See Milford Power Ltd. Partnership by Milford Power Associates Inc. v. New England , 918 F.Supp. 471 ( D. Mass. 1996 ) ( holding that " the essence of the tort of abuse of process is the use of process as a threat to coerce or extort some collateral advantage not properly involved in the proceeding " ) .
The intimidation tactics are working : of the 30,000 accusations the RIAA has leveled against individuals , only a single defendant has made her case in front of a judge and jury ... ( that sole defendant is now awaiting a new trial ) .
The RIAA intimidates and steamrolls accused infringers into settling before they have their day in court and before the courts can weigh the merits of their defenses .
The inherent dangers in allowing a single interest group , desperate in the face of technological change , led by a voracious , cohesive , extraordinarily well - funded and deeply experienced legal team doing battle with pro se defendants , armed with a statute written by them and lobbied and quietly passed through a compliant congress , to march defendants through the federal courts to make examples out of them should lead this Court to say " stop . "

People have been submitting this story nonstop , but I wanted to take some time to read the details before commenting on it .
It 's not the first time that folks have argued that the damages sought by the RIAA in various lawsuits against file sharers are unconstitutional .
However , the few times it 's been brought up in court , the arguments have n't been persuasive .
However , this time around , it looks like the big legal guns are getting involved , and the argument seems a lot more comprehensive and compelling .
In the past , it 's been noted that the RIAA has curiously avoided suing any Harvard students , with one of the theories being that Harvard had made it quite clear to the RIAA that it would fight back .
And , with Harvard law school at its disposal , and various professors there indicating that they had serious legal problems with the RIAA 's strategy , the RIAA simply decided to ignore any file sharing going on at that prestigious university .
However , for RIAA critic and well known law professor , Charles Nesson , waiting around for the RIAA to sue someone at Harvard was getting boring , so he went out and found a case to participate in .
Along with two third year law students , Nesson has hit back hard on the RIAA 's efforts in a court filing , where it 's noted that the very basis for many of the RIAA 's lawsuits is very likely unconstitutional .
He makes the argument that the Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement
Act of 1999 is very much unconstitutional , in that its hefty fines for copyright infringement ( misleadingly called " theft " in the title of the bill ) show that the bill is effectively a criminal statute , yet for a civil crime .
That 's because it really focuses on punitive damages , rather than making private parties whole again .
Even worse , it puts the act of enforcing the criminal statute in the hands of a private body ( the RIAA ) who uses it for profit motive in being able to get hefty fines :
Beyond just questioning the constitutionality of the law , Nesson argues that the court ought to punish the RIAA for its abuses of the law .
The filing goes on to describe in rather great detail just how this is an abuse of the law and the courts , noting that it is a " perversion of lawfully initiated process to illegitimate ends , " and citing the case law that suggests such behavior should be punished by the courts :
" One who uses a legal process ... against another primarily to accomplish a purpose for which it is not designed , is subject to liability to the other for harm caused by the abuse of process .
" And this is where it getsTo prove the abuse of the process , the filing uses the RIAA 's own words against it .
First , the writers note ( and cite the relevant cases ) that even if there is a " proper purpose " behind the filing , it 's an abuse of process if thepurpose in filing the lawsuit is different than the " proper purpose " behind the lawsuit .
And , then the authors point to multiple sources where the RIAA noted that the reason it was filing these lawsuits was not to punish these particular individuals for file sharing , but as part of its " deterrence " educational program .
From deterrence , Nesson shows how it 's actually used as more of a bludgeon to get students to settle , which is clearly not the " proper purpose " of the law :
This case is going to be worth watching closely .
It looks like the RIAA failed in its efforts to tiptoe around the legal bees ' nest of Harvard Law .

Y’know , these days , so many people with so many different motives are trying to tell me in so many ways what the “ truth ” is that I wonder whether I ’d recognize a “ truth ” — any “ truth ” at all .
I give up .
I ’ve collapsed under the oppressing weight of lies , prevarications , deceits , “ policy adjustments , ” rhetoric , no - longer - operative statements , attack ads , Perino -isms , cunningly packaged spin , and Rovian stump speeches with the rhetorical content equivalent to the unflushed contents of a toilet bowl .
Would someone please make possession of a Teleprompter a federal crime , punishable by listening to Rush Limbaugh 24/ 7 for life ?
Or Al Franken , for that matter ?
Can we stop the incessant harangue so reminiscent of “ Father Knows Best ” or , in the event Sarah Palin is speaking , “ Mother Knows Best ” ?
Or Hillary or Bill : “ We Know Best ” ?
Now , if you do what I did for a living for 20 years ( that journalism gig ) and get enough advanced degrees and then do the professor shtick for 15 years , presumably you have the intellectual capacity and analytical ability to ferret out the posings of these all - knowing rodents .
But it ’s too much .
This pervasive , invasive crap comes at you in massive waves of media - borne and commentator - massaged messages crafted with a solitary purpose — to take something from me .
It might be a vote .
It might be money .
It might be my soul .
But they want something , and they ’re willing to suspend any code of morality to get it .
And you know who they are , do n’t you ?
I surrender .
They win .
The constant rush of words blending into a sheen of believability ( polished quite nicely by those big - name “ journalists ” or CNN “ contributors ” purporting to “ interpret ” those words for the appropriate “ truth ” ) has exhausted me .
As the Borg said , “ Resistance is futile . ”
Because so many “ sources ” who have anointed themselves as “ credible ” have told me carefully orchestrated , artfully documented “ truths ” for so long , I no longer need to independently understand or articulate the political , social , cultural and economic “ truths ” around me .
I now depend completely on them to tell me the “ truth . ”
They tell me whose fault everything is .
So I blame whom they tell me to .
They tell me whom to fear , so I ’m afraid of those they tell me to be afraid of .
It ’s not that I no longer need to be told what to think and what to think about , it ’s just that it ’s become so much easier to be told rather than to choose .
When Telepromptered “ truth ” pours forth , I ’ll simply look for the applause sign and clap when it tells me to .
Yeah , that ’s it .
I ’ll look for that neon sign that signals me that the “ truth ” is about to stride onto stage .
It had better be careful , though .
That stage is already crowded .
Moral coda : Do n’t .
Trust .
What .

Pictured : Inside the £ 800 m Dubai hotel boasting a £ 13,000 - a- night suite and dolphins flown in from the South Pacific
It 's the latest word in Gulf excess - a sprawling £ 800 million resort boasting a £ 13,000 - a- night suite and dolphins flown in from the South Pacific , all atop a palm tree - shaped island .
Environmentalists have long criticised both the island and some of the features of the Atlantis hotel , set to open tomorrow .
Analysts wonder , separately , if global financial turmoil could someday crimp Dubai 's big tourist dreams .
But Dubai is not blinking : the 113 - acre resort on an artificial island off the Persian Gulf coast is among the city - state 's biggest bets that tourism can help sustain its economy once regional oil profits stop flowing .

Fantasy island : The Atlantis hotel has been built on an artificial island off the coast of Dubai
' You do n't build a billion - and - a - half dollar project just anywhere in the world , ' said Alan Leibman , president and managing director of Kerzner International , the hotel operator that teamed with Dubai developer Nakheel on the resort .
With its own oil reserves running dry , Dubai hopes to woo those eager to make money and those who know how to spend it - even as much of the global economy sours .
For years , the emirate - one of seven semi-independent states that make up the United Arab Emirates - has been feverishly building skyscrapers and luxury hotels .
A swirling glass sculpture by Dale Chihuly graces one of the lobbies
Even the corridors are sumptuous
A key piece of the strategy has been to cultivate an image in the West as a sun-kissed tourist destination despite its soaring summer heat , conservative Muslim society and relative dearth of historic sites .
Fueling the interest are belief - defying projects such as an indoor ski slope , the as - yet - incomplete world 's tallest skyscraper and a growing archipelago of man-made islands such as the Palm Jumeirah - the smallest of three such projects planned .
Much of the focus at Atlantis , modeled on a sister resort in the Bahamas , is on ocean - themed family entertainment .

The resort contains a giant open - air tank with 65,000 fish , stingrays and other sea creatures and a dolphinarium with more than two dozen bottlenose dolphins flown in , amid controversy , from the Solomon Islands .
But the hotel 's top floor aims squarely at the ultra - wealthy .
A three - bedroom , three - bathroom suite complete with gold - leaf 18 - seat dining table is on offer for £ 13,000 a night .
Dubai 's development has long been criticized by environmental activists , who say the construction of artificial islands hurts coral reefs and even shifts water currents .
They point to growing water and power consumption .

Last year , environmental groups and some residents of the Solomon Islands protested the decision to sell the dolphins , plus the 30 - hour plane flight needed to get them to Dubai .
Developers seem undaunted .
For the moment , the resort shares the sprawling island only with rows of high - end houses and construction sites .
But other international names are set to move in .
Donald Trump plans to open a hotel straddling the center of the palm , and the storied QE2 ocean liner will become a hotel and a tourist attraction docked alongside the island tree 's ' trunk ' .

The decor is uncluttered but exotic
An 1,800 - seat theatre nearby will house a permanent Cirque du Soleil show beginning in summer 2011 .
' Palm Jumeirah in and of itself will become one of Dubai 's major tourist attractions , ' said Joe Cita , chief executive of Nakheel 's hotel division .
Boosting the number of attractions on the island will not only entice more visitors , he said , but also persuade them to spend more time and money in the city .
By 2010 , Dubai aims to attract a staggering 10 million hotel visitors annually , up from about 7 million in 2007 .
Atlantis alone will increase the city 's hotel capacity by 3 percent .

So far , demand appears strong .
The Middle East had the highest hotel occupancy rates in the world during the first half of the year , with Dubai leading the region at 85.3 percent , according to professional services firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu .
Dubai also had the highest room rates in the region , although revenue growth is slowing , Deloitte noted .
Atlantis ' backers are optimistic they can fill its 1,539 rooms despite the economic uncertainty wracking some of the world 's richest economies .
Their focus is on well - heeled travelers from Europe , Russia , Asia and elsewhere in the Middle East .

' People will still take family holidays , ' Leibman said .
' Dubai is still good value when you 're paying in pounds , ( or ) you 're paying in euros . '
Nakheel and Kerzner are both privately held companies and do not release sales data .
Leibman said demand from tour groups looks strong well into the first part of next year .
Yet Marios Maratheftis , head of regional research for the Middle East , North Africa and Pakistan at Standard Chartered Bank in Dubai , said there is ' good reason ' to be concerned that global financial problems could hit Dubai 's tourism industry .
Nevertheless , he said , the city 's long - term outlook remains positive .
Another dining area provides a moody retreat

Kerzner has grown increasingly close to Dubai in recent years .
In 2006 , the company took itself private in a £ 2 billion deal partially bankrolled by a division of Nakheel 's state - owned parent , Dubai World .
Nakheel retains a large stake in the company .
Meanwhile , Nakheel 's hotel division has expanded rapidly .
The company 's holdings include New York 's Mandarin Oriental , the Fontainebleau in Miami Beach , and the W Hotel in Washington .
Its parent also owns a minority stake in MGM Mirage Inc. , and is teaming with the casino operator and Kerzner to build a massive multibillion - dollar casino on the Las Vegas Strip .
But do n't expect to find roulette wheels at Dubai's Atlantis .
Islamic prohibitions against gambling ensure casinos remain off - limits .

The World from Berlin Sarkozy Speech Bombs in Germany
French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday made a plea for an " economic government " for the euro zone .
It was not well received .
German politicians and commentators alike have blasted Sarkozy 's idea .
The considerable pushback to the bailout reflects discomfort with the people sounding the alarm .
Mr. Paulson , a creature of Wall Street , asked Congress for extraordinary powers to take bad loans off the hands of major financial institutions with a proposal that ran all of three pages .
Subprime mortgages have been issued with more paperwork than Mr. Paulson filled out in asking for $ 700 billion .
“ The situation is like that movie trailer where a guy with a deep , scary voice says , ‘ In a world where credit markets are frozen , where banks refuse to lend to each other at any price , only one man , with one plan can save us , ’ “ said Jared Bernstein , senior economist at the labor - oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington .
And yet , the more he looked at the data , the more Mr. Bernstein became convinced the financial system really does require some sort of bailout .
“ Things are scary , ” he said .
For nonfinancial firms during the first three months of the year , the outstanding balance of so - called commercial paper  short - term IOUs that businesses rely upon to finance their daily operations  was growing by more than 10 percent from a year earlier , according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Moody ’s Economy.com .
From April to June , the balance plunged by more than 9 percent compared with the previous year .
This week , the rate charged by banks for short - term loans to other banks swelled to three percentage points above the most conservative of investments , Treasury bills , with the gap nearly tripling since the beginning of this month .
In other words , banks are charging more for even minimal risk , making credit tight .
Suddenly , people who have spent their careers arguing that government is in the way of progress  that its role must be pared to allow market forces to flourish  are calling for the biggest government bailout in American history .
“ We are in a very serious place , ” said William W. Beach , an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington .
“ There is risk of contagion to the entire economy . ”
( CNN ) -- Memories of salvaging and stealing to avoid going hungry are part of the legacy of the Great Depression .
Some iReporters say they can't help but look at the current economy and feel the past holds lessons for the present .

Vlieg says her great grandfather tried to steal chickens after being laid off from mining .
Donna LeBlanc of Waxia , Louisiana , says she carries no credit to this day as a result of the frugality and self - reliance instilled in her by her family .
Her husband keeps the couple 's credit card and maintains a zero balance .
The Great Depression meant scary times for many households as a period of economic downturn spread throughout the world .
Historians trace its start to the " Black Tuesday " stock crash on October 29 , 1929 , and argue that the resulting global desperation set the stage for World War II .
LeBlanc said her grandparents were fortunate that they did n't have investments and could grow -- or catch -- their own food during the Depression years .
Her grandfather Lester was a " Cajun cowboy " often seen wearing a cowboy hat , and her grandmother Ida was a resourceful woman who spent much of the 1930s working as a store clerk .
LeBlanc , always told never to keep credit card debt , heard frightful stories from Ida .
iReport.com :

" She remembered vividly the barrels of flour , the bolts of cloth and the hunger in the faces of people as they begged for store credit , " LeBlanc said .
" The store must have been at least marginally successful , because my grandmother was able to purchase , a piece at a time , a complete six - person setting of Gorham Chantilly silverware for her trousseau , linens and even a Lane cedar chest to house her treasures . "
The couple would catch wild hogs , feed them corn for a year and eat them once the wild taste was out of the scavenging animals .
They also took advantage of available squirrel meat , a common food in the South at that time .
" It was a uniquely disgusting thing ... to see my grandfather take a stewed , skinned squirrel 's head , smack the skull 's dome with a heavy silver tablespoon , and dine on the brains , " LeBlanc said .
Years after the Depression , LeBlanc 's grandparents were well off once again .
Ida became a packrat and could n't help saving what she could .
When the family opened up the old cedar chest after she died , they found a decades - old treasure trove of sewing materials and other keepsakes .
iReport.com : " My dad used to cry when he spoke of that Great Depression "
The Great Depression turned many Americans into packrats who could n't bear to part with anything of potential value .
They could n't always afford to buy what they needed .

Is this the start of another depression ?
Pam van Hylckama Vlieg of Williamsburg , Virginia , says her great grandfather , Glen Surber , resorted to stealing food at times because he had hit rock - bottom .
Surber left the family behind in Saltville , Virginia , so he could head out to West Virginia 's coal mines .
After he got laid off , he found himself trying to steal chickens from a nearby farmer to feed his hungry family .
He hid behind a tree to wait for nightfall , but his plan was stymied when he found another person lurking in the shadows .
" Both men took off running and then they realized they each thought the other was the farmer , but they were both there to steal a chicken , " van Hylckama Vlieg said .
" Needless to say , that was another night of water bread . "
iReport.com : Can you imagine having to steal to eat ?
Digging into her memories , van Hylckama Vlieg says her great grandfather eventually found a work program after the New Deal and was able to rebuild his life .
She is confident we have n't hit another Depression and that we 've learned enough lessons from the past to avoid letting things get as bad as they were before .
" Poppy always said the world turns and everything that has happened would happen again .
I am sure if he were still with us today he would be warning us to start a garden and buy some chickens . "
Saving is a habitual behavior for those who have lived through the Great Depression , says Anjanette Sanchez of Globe , Arizona .
Her grandmother , Vera Vasquez , had a difficult time with the Great Depression and seemed to be scarred by it long after .
" She spoke of the time with great disgust in her voice as if it was the most awful time of her life , " Sanchez said .
" She mostly spoke of being hungry and having to wear old boots that did n't fit . "

Vasquez continued to save her things and always kept her freezer packed with food -- like frozen cactus to eat with her scrambled eggs -- because she 'd lived through harsh times .
There was never room for ice cubes .
" I guess to her , food was more valuable than ice , " Sanchez said .
" Her motto at the table was to eat as much as you want , but not to waste the food .
Take all you want , but eat all you take . "
Sanchez now passes on the same ideas to her children and reminds them not to be wasteful .

He spent a couple of weeks making the treacherous trip on board the boat , termed the Ark of Juneau .
" He was on a mission and he was going to do it no matter what , " Kolaski says .
She 's heard numerous stories about the hardships Satko endured , including being stopped while driving his unusual payload to Seattle , Washington , where the ark was to be launched .
The story is inspirational for the family and provides a sobering lesson about economic security for Kolaski .

" I 've learned to put my money away and do n't touch it , " she says .
Sheila Elrod of Atlanta , Georgia , says many secrets to success have been passed along through the years in her family .
" My grandfather , born in 1898 , was an established small businessman by 1929 , owning and managing a gas station and grill patronized by the mill workers .
As his children and grandchildren grew into adulthood , he reminded us of some guiding principles that he learned during the depression . "
Elrod says her grandmother worked inside the nearby mill because people of the time believed that one must " work hard , regardless of your status . "
" Oddly enough , she and her sisters were ladies that were taught all the graces of being ladies , " Elrod said .
" However , here 's an example that even ladies did n't shy away from hard work during that time .

Elrod said her grandfather had to be careful to whom he gave credit and learned many smart business secrets along the way .
He passed them along to Elrod :
Always do the right thing .
Take care of the customer .
Pay attention to details .
Know the people with whom you are doing business .
NEVER borrow money without a clear plan for how you will pay it back .
Richard Holland of Phoenix , Arizona , says his grandfather packed up a Ford Model T in search of a better life .
The family ended up taking shelter in a barn while Orville Holland continued onward to find work .
" In those days , telephones were few and far between across the Great Plains , and months elapsed with no word or money from my grandfather .
The coming winter was a serious concern as they considered the threat of living in the unheated barn . "

RIVERSIDE , Ohio ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Tuesday brushed aside a survey that showed him losing support among white women voters to John McCain since the Republican standard - bearer named Sarah Palin as his running mate .
A Washington Post / ABC
News survey published on Tuesday found most of McCain ’s surge in the polls since the Republican National Convention was due to a big shift in support among white women voters .
“ The notion that people are swinging back and forth in the span of a few weeks or a few days this wildly generally is n’t borne out , ” Obama told reporters during a campaign stop in Riverside , Ohio .
His campaign manager , David Plouffe , was more pointed when asked about the findings at a briefing on Monday , telling a Washington Post reporter , “ Your poll is wrong . ”
“ I do n’t think you ’ll find many others that back up a 20 - point reversal , ” Plouffe said .
“ We certainly are not seeing any movement like that . ”
The poll found that the race for the White House is a virtual tie since the parties ’ nominating conventions , with Obama , an Illinois senator , at 47 percent support of registered voters and McCain , an Arizona senator , at 46 percent .
An NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll released on Tuesday also showed Obama leading McCain by 47 percent to 46 percent , a statistical dead heat .
Obama ’s lead in that survey was down from 3 - point advantage in August and a 6 - point edge in July , NBC said .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Before the Democratic National Convention in late August , Obama held an 8 - point lead among white women voters , 50 percent to 42 percent , according to the Washington Post / ABC News poll .
After the Republican convention in early September , McCain was ahead by 12 points among white women , 53 percent to 41 percent , that survey found .
“ There is no doubt that Governor Palin attracted a lot of attention this week , ” Obama told the news conference .
“ It has brought excitement to the Republican Party . ”
“ What we ’re going to have to do is to see how things settle out over the next few weeks when people start examining who ’s actually going to deliver on the issues that people care about :
Who ’s got an education policy to improve the prospects for our children ?
Who ’s got a health - care plan that ’s going to help a whole bunch of women out there ? ” he said .
McCain surprised the electorate ahead of the Republican convention by naming the little - known Alaska governor as his vice presidential running mate .
Palin received high marks among supporters for her convention address , which included a scathing attack ridiculing Obama ’s experience and record .
Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president , defeated Hillary Clinton in the battle for the Democratic nomination , a long and bitter struggle that left many of the former first lady ’s supporters disaffected and angry .
Many of her backers were further angered when Obama ignored her in picking a vice presidential running mate , choosing instead longtime Delaware Sen .
Joe Biden .
A key question for the Obama campaign has been whether he would be able to maintain the support of Clinton ’s supporters .
A series of inspector general reports alleging cocaine use and government regulators literally jumping into bed with Big Oil would make a splash regardless of when it came .
But whether it was PR panache on the inspector general 's part or a happy coincidence , yesterday 's reports came just as Congress is set to debate expanding offshore drilling .
There will be hearings .
And Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) has argued that " the allegations of illicit and unethical behavior ... are directly related to the energy debate taking place in the Congress this week . "
The Republicans have been pushing hard for widely expanding domestic offshore drilling in recent months .
Yesterday House Democrats put forth a compromise :
The plan ( still sketchy ) would open up the entire U.S. coastline with the exception of Florida 's Gulf Coast while offering a host of sweeteners to encourage alternative energy programs .
Drilling off a state 's coast would require that state to " opt in . "
The bill would also , the New York Timesreports , " repeal some federal subsidies for oil companies and seek to improve the collection of royalty payments . "
Well , about those royalty payments .
Yesterday 's reports focus on the Minerals Management Service , an Interior Department agency that collects royalties from oil companies drilling on federal land .
And while the reports on sex and perks were by far the most colorful , they were the culmination of several critical reports on the chronically troubled office -- troubles that stretch back a decade and show that the coziness between government employees and oil companies has come with a cost .
One report focused on MMS officials ' lax handling of oil sales contracts -- companies were allowed to submit bids after deadlines or change the details of contracts .
The inspector general examined 718 bid packages and turned up changes to 118 that appeared to help the companies by $ 4.4 million .
But that was just a sample .
" The MMS administers tens of thousands of contracts , and inspections of those could reveal losses to taxpayers up to hundreds of millions of dollars , " the Denver Postreported , citing " former and current Interior sources . "
This June , a Government Accountability Office report found that an MMS oversight in 1998 and 1999 had potentially cost taxpayers billions of dollars in forgone royalties from drilling in the Gulf of Mexico -- namely from $ 4.3 billion and $ 14.7 billion .
So as debate gets going in Congress , just what is done to improve the MMS 's performance will be crucial .
The inspector general laid out a host of suggested reforms in his cover letter ( PDF ) accompanying his reports .
House reform committee Chair Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) will focus on the MMS partying , philandering and favor - taking in a hearing next week ( to the objections of Republicans , who wonder why such a hearing could n't have come earlier ) .
We 'll keep an eye on what finally emerges .
By Dave Lindorff
With the polls continuing to show Barack Obama holding a steady or even growing lead heading into Election Day , especially in the key swing states of Pennsylvania , Ohio , Florida , Colorado , New Hampshire and Virginia , and with Democratic challengers looking strong in at least 10 Senate races and dozens of open - seat or Republican - held House races , it ’s looking like this will be a big win for Democrats , both in the presidential and the Congressional races .
Hopefully one thing such an across - the - boards win will lead to would be a withering away of the self - destructive conspiracy - theory paranoia that has gripped much of the Left over the last eight years .
Once largely emblematic of the far Right , which saw black helicopters of the dreaded United Nations behind every mountain , Jews running everything , Communists working nefariously under every bed , fluoridation plots , an immigrant assault on the Anglo - Saxon gene pool , and a liberal cabal out to steal their assault hunting rifles , now the Left is awash in the same kind of fevered thinking .
Chief among the leftist conspiracy theories are that the Bush / Cheney administration was behind the 9 - 11 attacks , that the current administration has plans to cancel or annul the November 4 election and institute martial law , that there are plans for a “ false flag ” attack on American forces which will be used to justify an all - out war against Iran , that there is a false - flag terror attack planned inside the US set for before the election , designed to throw the vote towards John McCain , that the Wall Street meltdown and subsequent bail - out are a deliberate scheme to steal the nation ’s assets and funnel them into Republican pockets , and that Republican operatives have the technological capability , and plan to steal the current election by manipulating the results on the electronic voting machines used by many election districts .
In a variant of the Right ’s anti-Semitic ravings , the Left attributes god - like powers to the Israel lobby and its formal lobbying organization , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC )
Never mind that some of these conspiracies are mutually exclusive ( if Bush and Cheney are going to declare martial law , they should have no need to steal the election ) , or that it ’s getting pretty late in the game for others to actually happen .
The common thread running through these conspiracies is that “ they ” ( the Republicans , AIPAC or the ruling corporate elite , as the case may be ) , have superhuman powers beyond our wildest imaginations , as well as flawless execution , and are going to achieve their evil ends no matter what we do .
Following this line of thinking ( if it can be called that ) , there ’s no point in voting , because “ they ” are going to steal the election anyhow ( and that , of course , is if the election is even held next week ! ) .
There ’s no point in going to rallies or marches in Washington DC , because “ they ” are going to attack Iran and start World War III anyhow .
Public protest is also dangerous , because “ they ” are going to declare martial law , and then all of us who go out and publicly oppose the government will end up locked away in detention camps in the Mojavi desert .
I confess , as a journalist , to having unwittingly aided and abetted some of this conspiracy thinking , for example with my reporting on the evidence that all four of the so - called “ black boxes ” from the two planes that hit the World Trade Center on 9/11 were recovered , and that the FBI actually has them , despite its testimony to the contrary before the 9 - 11 Commission .
I make no apology for , and still stand by that report , which was based upon reliable sources at the National Transportation Safety Administration and in the New York Police Department , but I want to stress that such a report does not justify going beyond asking the logical question , “ What is the government hiding here ? ” to making the wild speculation that it means the government planned and carried out those attacks .
I also reported on solid evidence in 2006 that the Bush / Cheney administration was moving several aircraft carrier battle groups into position in the Persian Gulf in advance of Congressional off - year elections in what appeared to be possible plans for an attack on Iran .
I still believe that may have been the administration ’s game plan , but that it was derailed by senior Republican leaders who prevailed on James Baker , chair of the Iraq War Study Group , to release his team ’s bi-partisan study three months early , which called for negotiations with Iran and Syria in order to bring peace and stability to the Iraq region .
I would add that this is a far cry from imagining that the administration was planning to fake an Iranian attack on American forces .
I am not saying that governments do n’t engage in treacherous conspiracies .
Certainly the faked tale of a Gulf of Tonkin incident was a conspiracy designed to allow the Johnson administration to begin an all - out war against the Vietnamese .
And certainly there was a conspiracy in the Bush / Cheney administration during 2002 and early 2003 to mislead and lie to the Congress and the American people about Saddam Hussein ’s alleged links to 9 - 11 and to global terrorists .
But those relatively simple conspiracies actually prove my point — both have been clearly exposed thanks to leaks , turncoats , and good investigative reporting .
What I am saying is that the grander conspiracies being concocted in the more fevered brains of some people on the Left do not hold up under careful and critical inspection .
The biggest failings they share are two : first of all , conspiracies as grand as multi-state election thefts via electronic fraud , and the carrying out of a two - front , high - casualty mass terrorist act on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , require the cooperation of such large numbers of people that leaks , turncoats , informants and simple screw - ups are inevitable ; and secondly , this administration in particular has shown itself to be phenomenally inept , intellectually stunted , and tactically clueless .
The War in Iraq , which was supposed to be a “ cakewalk , ” has been an unmitigated disaster for Republicans .
The War in Afghanistan is a fiasco .
The War on Terror , while a success in terms of helping Republicans win seats in Congress in 2002 , and Bush to win re-election in 2004 , has been a bust longer term .
Management of the US economy has been a model of incompetence .
So has the grand plan to crush Democrats and create a dominant Republican Party for the next century .
The Rovian campaign strategy of lies , smears and dirty tricks , while initially successful , appears to have worn out its effectiveness in just three two - year national election cycles .
None of this would matter except that I think the Left ’s embrace of conspiracy - theories has become profoundly damaging to the whole progressive movement .
Conspiracy thinking produces a deep cynicism towards positive action and towards the kind of long - term organizing upon which real social and political change depends .
When people think that the fix is in , they are not inclined to put time and energy into the hard work of organizing unions , working to get local candidates elected to office , running for positions on party committees , etc .
Conspiracy thinking also leads people on the left to completely write off the Democratic Party as a vehicle for progressive change , as the notion that “ they ” run everything is broadened to include in the term “ they ” the elected Democrats in the White House and Congress .
Democrats may be weenies , but such a conflation of Republicans and Democrats is also self - defeating nonsense , as is the notion that Obama is “ just another tool ” of the corporate / imperialist power structure .
Democrats are not just Republicans by another name , and Obama is not just McCain or Bush with a better tan .
The reality is that if Obama is elected president , and if Democrats end up gaining solid control of Congress , it will be critically important for progressives to organize powerfully to press this new government to do the right things — promptly ending the two wars in the Middle East , taking strong and far - reaching action to tackle global warming , restoring some basic equity to the economic and tax system , making health care affordable and available to all , restoring the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , demanding punishment for those in the current administration who have committed crimes , and so on .
We cannot expect Obama , or the Democrats in Congress who have proven themselves to be such gutless compromisers , to take significant progressive actions on their own .
They must be driven by force of public action to do the right thing .
Maybe when this election goes right and is n’t stolen , making Obama the president , and debunking the vote - theft fear - mongers , and when Obama goes on to be inaugurated in January , without being blocked by a military coup , these paranoid conspiracy theories will fade away and people on the Left will start working to make change happen instead of imagining reasons why it ca n’t or just moaning that “ they ” are going to destroy us all .

The Fed : $ 446 billion
A simple way to look at how much financing the Fed has pumped into the housing market is to look at the change in the weekly balance sheet .
What you ’ll see immediately is that the total amount of Treasurys on its books has fallen by $ 311 billion compared with a year ago .
This has been replaced by $ 150 billion in collateral from the Fed ’s Term Auction Facilities , in which it is taking in a variety of collateral , much of which is presumed to be housing - related .
Another $ 29 billion is on its books in the form of collateral from Bear Stearns , which greased the wheels of that firm 's buyout by JPMorgan Chase .
Add to that $ 14 billion in discount window lending to banks and $ 88 billion in repurchase agreements , which the Fed has always done , but not in such great amounts or for such periods .
These repos are now from 15 to 90 days .
There ’s another $ 65 billion in swap lines to the European and Swiss central banks that designed to allow European banks to borrow dollars and finance their illiquid assets .
( See the accompanying video for more . )
We should also count the $ 100 billion of Treasurys the Fed loans out through another new facility designed to pump liquidity into the market .
Through that system , the Fed loans Treasurys and takes in collateral — again , some of it housing - related .
The Fed does n’t debit its Treasury line item for this because it says it ’s only loaning out the securities , but those loans are backed up , in part , by a variety of assets , including some from housing .
So the total for how much new financing the Fed has made available to markets : $ 446 billion .
Fed officials have said they 've never lost a penny on such lending in the past and they deal only with sound financial institutions .
( If you ’re not sound , you ca n’t borrow from the Fed , and staying current with the Fed is a good way to stay sound . )
They add that they have protection through haircuts or discounts , so that $ 100 of bonds could get only $ 95 of financing .
In addition , to some extent , as the Fed has made more financing available to real estate - related securities , it ’s made less financing available elsewhere .
But overall , it ’s opened up the spigots to finance real estate in a big way .
Note that the Fed wo n’t provide values of the types of collateral it holds against its loans .
Federal Home Loan Banks : $ 274 billion
This is an easier calculation than for the Fed .
The 12 Home Loan Banks provide financing to its 8,000 - plus banks that , in turn , is used to fund mortgages .
The amount of what FHLB calls “ advances ” to member banks has risen by $ 274 billion , to stand at $ 914 billion for the second quarter of 2008 .
The FHLBs say existing capital and member banks will absorb losses if they occur .
But there is an implicit government guarantee , on that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson reiterated recently .
The legislation in front of Congress allows Treasury to increase lending to FHLB .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac : $ 621 billion
Another easy calculation .
Just go look at the balance sheets of Fannie and Freddie and look at the increase in outstanding mortgage - backed securities .
That number tells you how much more mortgage guarantees the two giants have out there .
Combined , the figure is up by $ 582 billion .
Add in a $ 39 billion increase in Fannie Mae ’s portfolio to get to $ 621 billion .
But note that this is comparing 2007 with 2006 .
The numbers are almost certainly larger now .
Federal Housing Administration : $ 90 billion
Officials there tell me they have added $ 90 billion or so of insured loans since October .
Moreover , they have added loans from people they formerly did not lend to :
Now they 're doing refinancings and funding delinquent borrowers , folks they previously would n't deal with .
They say the phone is ringing off the hook as subprime borrowers look to FHA to help them get out of onerous loans .
This is a place where there could be real losses , and where losses are expected to grow .
The legislation in front of Congress authorizes up to $ 300 billion of FHA lending .
LONDON  Europeans are increasingly lashing out at the construction of mosques in their cities as terrorism fears and continued immigration feed anti-Muslim sentiment across the continent .
The latest dispute is in Switzerland , which is planning a nationwide referendum to ban minarets on mosques .
This month , Italy 's interior minister vowed to close a controversial mosque in Milan .
Some analysts call the mosque conflicts the manifestation of a growing fear that Muslims are n't assimilating , do n't accept Western values and pose a threat to security .
" It 's a visible symbol of anti-Muslim feelings in Europe , " says Danièle Joly , director of the Center for Research in Ethnic Relations at the University of Warwick in England .
" It 's part of an Islamophobia .
Europeans feel threatened . "
The disputes reflect unease with the estimated 18 million Muslims who constitute the continent 's second - biggest religion , living amid Western Europe 's predominantly Christian population of 400 million , Joly says .
Anti-Muslim sentiment
The clashes also represent a turnaround from the 1980s and '90s , when construction of large mosques was accepted and even celebrated in many cities .
" I think the tide has turned , " Joly says .
Indicative of the change :
• Supporters of the Swiss referendum collected enough signatures two weeks ago to call for a constitutional ban on minarets , the towers used to call worshipers to prayer .
No date has been set for the vote .
• Italy 's Interior Minister Roberto Maroni announced this month that he wants to close a Milan mosque because crowds attending Friday prayers spill onto the street and irritate neighbors .
In April , the city of Bologna scrapped plans for a new mosque , saying Muslim leaders failed to meet certain requirements , including making public its source of funding .
• In Austria , the southern province of Carinthia passed a law in February that effectively bans the construction of mosques by requiring them to fit within the overall look and harmony of villages and towns .
• Far - right leaders from 15 European cities met in Antwerp , Belgium , in January and called for a ban on new mosques and a halt to " the Islamization " of European cities .
The group said mosques act as catalysts for taking over neighborhoods and imposing Islamic ways of life on Europeans .
" We already have more than 6,000 mosques in Europe , which are not only a place to worship but also a symbol of radicalization , some financed by extreme groups in Saudi Arabia or Iran , " Filip Dewinter , leader of a Flemish separatist party in Belgium , told Radio Netherlands Worldwide at the conference .
Dewinter criticized a mosque being built in Rotterdam , Netherlands : " Its minarets are six floors high .
These kinds of symbols have to stop . "
Although the group in Antwerp represented minority political parties from Belgium , Austria and Germany , its cause resonates elsewhere .
Construction of a mosque in Cologne , Germany , drew protests from residents last year and sparked a political debate in Berlin over concerns that it could overshadow the city 's great Gothic cathedral .
In London , plans for a " mega- mosque " for 12,000 worshipers next to the site of the 2012 Olympics drew 250,000 - plus opposing signatures .
Current controversies over mosques represent an anti-Muslim attitude that initially sprang up after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the United States and the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005 , Joly says .
Aggravating those views are pressures from the influx of immigrants and growing population of Muslims throughout Europe .
Other events have fueled worries that many Muslims do n't accept Western values : widespread protests by Muslims after a Danish newspaper published cartoons of the prophet Mohammed in 2006 , and the 2004 murder of a Dutch filmmaker , Theo van Gogh , by a Muslim extremist in retaliation for a film about abuse of Muslim women .
Restrictions could backfire
Sakib Halilovic , an imam in Zurich , says Switzerland 's referendum to ban minarets " plays into the hands " of Muslim extremists by denying them a place to worship or limit what the mosque can look like .
" It will boost radical positions within the Muslim society in Switzerland , " Halilovic told the Swiss Broadcasting Corp. last week .
Some moderate Muslims say those against building more mosques sometimes have legitimate concerns .
" Truthfully speaking , we do n't need so many mosques , " says Irfan al - Alawi , international director of the Center for Islamic Pluralism in London .
" We have 1,600 mosques ( in Britain ) and a ( Muslim ) population of 1.6 million .
It 's become a business rather than a worship place . "
Al - Alawi , who opposes the London mega - mosque , says disagreements within a mosque can cause some members to branch off and want their own new building that is unnecessary .
The mosques often do n't fit in with neighborhoods or outnumber churches or other religious houses of worship , he says .

A loner hailed as a hero by animal lovers after he died trying to rescue three dogs is to be cremated next week and memorialized with a veterinary paramedic scholarship at Houston Community College .
Robert " Bob " Emery , 54 , who came here after Hurricane Ike to help clear storm debris , was killed the night of Sept. 27 after running onto the East Freeway to rescue three dogs trapped against the interstate 's concrete median .
" Man , we can't leave them dogs to die , " Emery 's friends recalled him saying seconds before he dashed into the road and was hit by a passing motorcycle .
Animal control officers later returned the dogs to their owners , an elderly couple who had looked for them for days .
The story of how Emery died quickly spread on the Internet , as did word that he could be buried as a pauper if authorities did n't find any relatives for the man , who was estranged from his family .
About all that was known in the days after the accident was that Emery came here from Florida , where he 'd recently been living in a run-down trailer on the beach in the Florida Keys .
Animal lovers vowed Emery would not be forgotten and offered money as well as flowers , a casket and even a burial plot .
Among those who took up his cause were Cheryl Lang , of the Houston nonprofit organization , No Paws Left Behind , and a Clear Lake - area resident , Kellye Nagata , who searched the Internet to ultimately locate a daughter who had n't seen Emery since she was 5 years old .
" I am very saddened that I could not find him in life , but somehow he found me in death , " Alaina Emery , 25 , said earlier this month from Pittsburgh .
" I wanted to hug him , to meet my son . "
San Jacinto Memorial Park and Funeral Home , of Houston , donated its help , including a service set for Oct. 22 at 2 p.m .
Alaina Emery plans to attend the service , and her father 's remains are to be sent back to Pittsburgh , where he grew up .
" It was an amazing story to me , " said funeral director Stan James , who has four dogs .
" I thought , ' We 've got to do something for this man . ' "
Contributions collected by Lang 's organization to memorialize Emery will go toward a $ 2,000 annual scholarship at the Veterinary Paramedic program at Houston Community College Northwest in Katy .
" Besides helping the dogs , he is going to help students that could use a break in order to keep helping animals , " said Pamela Huebner , director of the veterinary paramedic program .

Texas Congressman Ron Paul has warned that the amended bailout legislation that passed Congress on Friday is not only far worse than the original bill but is also unconstitutional .
Paul speaking just minutes after leaving the floor of the House on Friday , explained that the tax portion of the bill was written by the Senate , when under the Constitution only the House can originate tax bills .
“ That in itself was unconstitutional but it ’s been done before and it will be done again . ”
The Congressman said .
Paul highlighted that the passage of the bill defied logic because it was even worse than the original rejected version :
“ It ’s amazing , you take a very very bad bill , appropriating $ 700 billion , you ca n’t get enough votes to pass it so you take it back out , you make it much worse and take it up to over $ 800 billion . ”
Paul commented .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Today is an even sadder day that on Monday , ” Paul stated , “ Here today when the special interests got their two cents in , or their $ 10 million worth of lobbying in , the members switched their vote . ”
The Congressman decried the fact that 57 members , mostly so called conservatives , switched their votes on Friday .
He urged that those who have destroyed the economy and our freedoms not be allowed to dictate how the system is rebuilt in America .
Paul also compared the economic situation to that of the Soviet Union in 1989 , urging that the current economic meltdown stems from empire building foreign policy , and that we are now dealing with the bankruptcy of the United States .
Watch Ron Paul ’s reaction to the passage of the bailout :
Earlier in the day Ron Paul had taken the floor in the House to express his opposition to the bailout , stating that it represents an evasion of the real problem and more of the same inflationary practices that have caused the crisis in the first instance .

Now that tax attorneys have had a chance to review Gov. Sarah Palin ’s tax returns , which were released late last week , a new round of questions are being raised on tax - related websites .
One big issue that tax attorneys are pointing to is the fact that the Palins did not report as income the $ 43,490 that the state gave the family to cover travel expenses for Mr. Palin and the Palin children .
Had the Palins reported these payments as income , the couple would have had to pay taxes on it .
These tax attorneys note that neither Mr. Palin nor the children were employees of the state .
Nor were they traveling on behalf of the state .
There was some discussion that perhaps some portion of Mr. Palin ’s travel expenses might be excludable as income if there was a bona - fide business reason for his presence and if he assisted Mrs. Palin in her official duties .
But there was also uniform agreement that it would be hard to make a case for the not reporting the payments to the children as income .
“ The children ’s travel payments are clearly taxable income , ’’ said Jack Bogdanski , a tax professor at the Lewis and Clark Law School in Portland and a former advisor to the Internal Revenue Service .
“ The money paid for Todd Palin ’s travel might possibly turn out to be tax - free , but it would be quite a stretch . ”
Bryan T. Camp , a tax law professor at Texas Tech University School of Law , said “ There is no suggestion that either Todd or the kids are employed by the State of Alaska .
Maybe they should be . ”
Mr. Camp added “ The issue is whether Palin gets the $ 43,000 tax free – no income tax , no Social Security tax , no Medicare tax , not a dime . ”
His conclusion :
The payments are taxable .
So if that is the case , how much might the Palins owe ?
Mr. Bogdanski said that , at the least , the family should have reported the $ 24,728 in children ’s travel reimbursements .
He calculates a tax bill of $ 6,000 , based on a tax rate of between 25 and 28 percent .
There would also be additional interest payments since last April 15 .
The other area attracting attention is Mr. Palin ’s snowmobiling racing and whether it is a legitimate business ( which allows the Palins to deduct snowmobiling expenses ) or whether it is a hobby , for which no deductions will be allowed .
The Palin ’s deducted $ 9,000 in business losses from snowmobiling .
This tax - loss would not be allowed if the activity is a hobby .
The I.R.S. rule is that if an activity produces a profit in three of the past five years , is a businesses and not a hobby .
But the Palins released tax returns for only two years , so it is impossible to tell .
One year showed a $ 9,000 loss , the other year a slight profit .
Another I.R.S. test is whether making a profit — and not just having fun in the snow — was the “ predominate , primary or principal objective ” of Mr. Palin ’s snowmobiling .
As Mr. Camp writes , the tax question is : “ Why does he do it ?
Love of sport or love of lucre ? ”

( Fortune Magazine ) -- Bob Riley wanted to help .
It was Sunday , Oct. 5 , and the Alabama governor was on the phone with Neel Kashkari , a Treasury Department official who the next day would be named by Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson as interim leader of the government 's just - approved $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program .
But Riley could n't wait for Kashkari 's role to become official .
He needed to impress upon the new bailout boss the seriousness of the exploding financial crisis in Jefferson County , home to Birmingham .
Riley argued that it was urgent that the federal government come to the aid of his state - now .
As he would describe it in a follow - up letter to Kashkari , the situation in Jefferson County was " the single biggest threat to the municipal bond market today and a poster child for how the subprime mortgage crisis is hurting Main Street America . "
For months now , Riley and other civic leaders in Alabama have been battling to avert what appears almost certain - that Jefferson County will file for Chapter 9 protection , in what would be the largest municipal bankruptcy in our nation 's history .
The county has fallen hopelessly behind on payments to service the $ 3.2 billion it borrowed - on reckless terms - from Wall Street over the past decade to build a new sewer system .
As Fortune went to press , the Jefferson County Commission was days away from a vote that could make the bankruptcy official .
Simply put , municipalities are n't supposed to go bankrupt - and rarely do , at least compared with businesses .
According to a study by the law firm Mintz Levin , since the bankruptcy laws were written in 1934 , there have been fewer than 600 filings for Chapter 9 , which provides for the reorganization of municipalities .
That 's about how many private sector Chapter 11 filings occur , on average , every two weeks .
Local governments using stable tax income to pay off money borrowed at a fixed rate may not be sexy , but over history this arrangement has tended to be a pretty reliable bet .
Every decade or so , something big and scary does happen in the normally staid world of public finance :
There was a near miss in the ' 70s when New York City almost went broke ( " Ford to city : drop dead " was the famous headline in the Daily News ) ; in the ' 80s the Washington Public Power Supply System ( or WPPSS ; the traders called it " Whoops " ) defaulted on $ 2.25 billion in loans when it stopped construction of two nuclear power plants ; and California 's Orange County went into Chapter 9 in the '90s , after the county treasurer made bad bets on interest rates and lost $ 1.6 billion .
But the saga of Jefferson County stands apart .
Unlike previous municipal meltdowns , it is a financial disaster that was to a large degree invented , packaged , and sold by Wall Street .
And there are striking parallels to the wider credit crisis that has enveloped the financial world - with overeager borrowers , willing enablers , and dangerously complex financial instruments .
' Magical stuff '
Why punish yourself , local officials were asked , by paying off high - fixed - rate loans when you can lower your payment with auction - rate and variable - rate securities and hedge your bets with swaps ?
" Magical stuff , " is how David Bronner , CEO of the $ 35 billion Alabama state pension fund , describes the financing , " You 're telling everybody , ' Look how much money you saved , ' and you forget the risk side of the equation . "
The list of potential losers in the county 's bankruptcy includes some of the biggest names in banking - past and present .
The county 's lead underwriter , which brought to market $ 2.2 billion in debt , is JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , which , ironically , has been getting a lot of good press lately - including in Fortune - for its survival skills .
It 's less surprising , perhaps , that two of the county 's biggest counterparties in derivatives trades were Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers .
While Governor Riley scrambles to negotiate a settlement , local officials around the country are watching anxiously to see what will happen if the county does enter Chapter 9 .
Authorities in Connecticut , Florida , and Nebraska , among other states , have recently cut or delayed new financing .
And Vallejo , Calif. , defaulted on over $ 200 million back in May .
Jefferson County 's bankruptcy would only increase the pressure on an already tight muni market .
A soap opera
In Birmingham , though , the macro issues take a back seat to the local drama .
Since April , when the county 's credit rating was cut to D , the lowest level , and the crisis escalated , the feuding among the state 's economic brain trust has provided a daily soap opera for the papers .
That Jefferson County got taken by Wall Street is clear .
But as if that was n't bad enough , there has been plenty of waste and corruption over the years too .
There have been 22 indictments , 21 convictions , and one guilty plea so far in an ongoing investigation by federal authorities , and the list keeps growing .
Everyone knows that the ultimate target is Larry Langford , the controversial but as yet unindicted mayor of Birmingham .
Langford , who served as president of the Jefferson County Commission when most of the riskiest refinancing was completed , has been accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of accepting more than $ 156,000 in cash and benefits from brokers who had business with the county .
To have the city 's mayor end up in jail would be embarrassing , sure .
But it would be nothing compared to the lasting damage to job creation and economic growth that Birmingham 's civic leaders - still fighting the legacy of the city 's civil rights battles in the 1960s - fear from a Chapter 9 bankruptcy .
Yet despite Governor Riley 's efforts , there is a feeling of inevitability about what will happen .
" The stench of this is starting to permeate across the whole state , " says Bronner .
More and more , people just want a resolution .
In the beginning , the people of Jefferson County were n't asking for anything special , just a working sewer system - one that did n't overflow whenever it rained , spilling raw sewage into the creeks that drain the Jones Valley basin where Birmingham lies .
Lawsuits by environmentalists forced the issue , and in December 1996 , Jefferson County signed a consent decree , agreeing to clean things up within ten years .
Early estimates of how much it might cost ranged all the way from $ 250 million to $ 1.2 billion .
In other words , no one had a clue .
As it happened , even the highest estimates were wildly low .
Year by year the project expanded and the budget ballooned .
Consider the case of the multimillion - dollar tunneling machine .
In the late 1990s , Jefferson County began drilling a sewer tunnel beneath the scenic Cahaba River .
But a citizen uproar ensued , and the tunnel was halted halfway through .
In the end , county officials had to pay nearly $ 20 million to extract the machine from the hole and return it to the contractors .
The modest junior hockey arena in this small eastern Washington agricultural hub is an ideal gathering place for local families .
It ’s also a crucial front in the Department of Homeland Security ’s war against suicide bombers .
During the tests of crowd surveillance technology , an array of surveillance cameras , infrared cameras , and millimeter - wave radar is used to scan fans of the Western Hockey League ’s Tri-City Americans , who play at the town ’s 6,000 - seat Toyota Center .
Software algorithms -- complex image - processing formulas called video analytics -- instantly analyze the data and images .
Advertisement
Privacy advocates and critics of Homeland Security spending object to the idea of training all that high technology on law - abiding citizens .
But hockey fans in this languid Columbia River town near Oregon do n’t seem to mind being test subjects .
“ We ’re trying to figure out how to protect large venues from terrorist attacks , ” said Nicholas Lombardo , project manager for Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , one of nine Department of Energy national laboratories .
The lab , in nearby Richland , is coordinating the testing , which initially focuses on pedestrians and will expand to include vehicles in coming years .
In general , the security technology is looking for three things : suicide bombers on foot , suspicious packages left behind and vehicles that may carry explosives .
The goal is to identify assailants long before they reach fixed points , like box office windows or bag - search areas .
By pushing detection to 500 feet earlier than traditional checkpoints , the system is able to start tracking people approaching the building from a distance .
Advertisement
Another goal is to inspect every person in a crowd of thousands -- probing for heat generated by concealed explosives , scanning for weapons and analyzing odd behavior .
Video streams of crowd movements are fed into computers .
If the program detects someone running away from the event or loitering or leaving a package behind , the behavior is highlighted for an operator .
The operators at the Kennewick arena are local law enforcement officers hired to run the equipment from inside a nearby trailer .
Watching a wall of flat screens , they can focus all of the different types of cameras on a single person , then decide whether to stop and interrogate the person .
Lombardo hired mock suicide bombers to mix with hockey fans and sneak simulated explosives to the building .
Early tests detected some small devices , but Lombardo declined to discuss specific results .
Tests also netted two hockey fans , one for carrying a concealed beer can , another for wearing something suspicious that turned out to be a cast .

Potential customers for the new security system include the Transportation Security Administration , the Secret Service and the Department of Defense .
The military deploys some similar technologies in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Most of the methods are already commercially available , but they have “ not been fused together before , ” said James Tuttle , Homeland Security director of explosives for the science and technology directorate .
But Kennewick and Richland , which along with Pasco make up what is known as the Tri-Cities , is near the huge Hanford Site , formerly the Hanford Nuclear Reservation , which was established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project .
That background entered into the decision to allow the tests , said Jeff Kossow , the Toyota Center ’s executive director .
“ Because of what ’s happened in our history , people here are more accustomed to higher levels of security , ” he said .
Advertisement
Notices about the tests are posted in many places around the arena , though it ’s hard to miss the roof - mounted cameras or the tripod - based infrared and wave radar devices .
Patrons can enter a rear door if they object to being scanned .
Michelle McGuire is president of the Tri-City Hockey Booster Club .
Players in the team ’s league are age 16 to 20 , and the National Hockey League drafts out of it .
Fans have not objected to being spied upon , McGuire said .
“ No complaints , ” she said .
“ I do n’t have a problem with it . ”
Advertisement
Although hometown hockey moms do n’t object , privacy advocates cringe .
“ This is a silly waste of money , ” said Barry Steinhardt , director of the American Civil Liberties Union ’s technology and liberty program .
“ It ’s about turning the entire population into a suspect class .
Everybody is a suspect . ”
Steinhardt criticized Homeland Security for field - testing “ exotic technologies ” that often produce many false positives , divert security resources , and result in interrogations and searches based on the thin evidence .
Mass surveillance systems do n’t work , said Simon Davies , director of Privacy International , a London - based advocacy group that focuses on surveillance and privacy issues raised by governments and corporations .
Advertisement
“ Some of the technology being tested is of questionable value , and some constitute an outrageous invasion of privacy , ” Davies said in an e-mail interview .
“ The millimeter - wave radar is a fancy name for a device that electronically removes your underwear . ”
Lombardo adamantly denies that .
The images his equipment captures reveal “ no modesty concerns , ” he said .

A 60 - minute DVD , titled " Obsession : Radical Islam 's War Against the West , " is being distributed in millions of newspapers across the country this week primarily in swing states through an advertising purchase by a shadowy group called the Clarion Fund .
Editor & Publisher reports :
" Despite some protests from Muslim and liberal activists , the newspapers -- all hard hit by drops in ad revenue in recent months -- have explained that the DVD does not violate their usual standards ; see our exchange with The New York Times below .
A spokesperson there said the Times last Sunday inserted 145,000 DVDs in its papers delivered in the following markets : Denver , Miami / Palm Beach , Tampa , Orlando , Detroit , Kansas City , St Louis , Cincinnati , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Milwaukee / Madison .
Note :
These are all in swing states .
The documentary showcases scenes of Muslim children being encouraged to become suicide bombers , interspersed with shots of Nazi rallies .
' The threat of Radical Islam is the most important issue facing us today , '' reads the sleeve of the DVD .
'' But it 's a topic that neither the presidential candidates nor the media are discussing openly .
It 's our responsibility to ensure we can all make an informed vote in November . ''
It was shown on Fox News just before the 2006 mid-term elections , and conservative activist David Horowitz screened the film on college campuses during 2007 .
An article at the group 's site , www.radicalislam.org, endorsed John McCain as the strongest candidate this past week , then was pulled down .
The DVD carries on - screen text near the outset that it is not indicting most Muslims . "

This week is going to be big for American energy policy .
By week ’s end , it is likely that we will see the US Congress vote on any number of energy bills , including one put forth by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) , as well as the New Energy Reform Act of 2008 , which has been endorsed by the so - called “ Gang of 10 ” Senators , who have since swelled in number to 16 , and now 20 members .
If you ’re even remotely like me , you ’re surely growing tired of the battle between the Democratic leadership in the House and Senate and the GOP minority that demands new offshore drilling .
Unfortunately for all of us , few congressional Democrats have had the gall to stand up and say what ’s been on all of our minds – offshore drilling is n’t the answer .
That was , until last Friday ’s Bipartisan Energy Summit , when Rhode Island Senator Sheldon
Whitehouse seemingly decided that he ’d had enough .
Whitehouse asked his fellow Senators and the energy experts from any number of different backgrounds whether , given the numerous problems facing our country , offshore drilling should be our # 1 priority .
The silence should speak for itself .
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/wnJAIeEgjSM&hl=en&fs=1]
WHITEHOUSE : Gentlemen , we ’re in the middle of a near total mortgage system meltdown in this country .
We have a health care system that burns 16 percent of our GDP , in which the Medicare liability alone has been estimated at $ 34 trillion .
We ’re burning $ 10 billion a month in Iraq .
This administration has run up $ 7.7 trillion in national debt , by our calculation .
And there is worsening evidence every day of global warming , with worsening environmental , national security and economic ramifications .
In light of those conditions , do any of you seriously contend that drilling for more oil is the number one issue facing the American people today
No , it does n’t seem so .
Many thanks to Senator Whitehouse for saying what so many of us have had on our minds for so long , and proving the point that no one else could .

Oil prices fell almost $ 9 a barrel on Friday to their lowest level in more than a year as the slowing global economy led the International Energy Agency to cut its forecast for global demand .
Crude oil for November delivery settled down $ 8.89 , at $ 77.70 a barrel , the lowest since October 2007 .
The decline came after the energy agency , which is based in Paris , cut its forecast for 2008 global demand by 240,000 barrels a day .
The agency now estimates daily demand this year of about 86.5 million barrels , an increase of 0.5 percent from last year  the slowest growth in 15 years .
It also cut its forecast for 2009 demand by 440,000 barrels a day , to 87.2 million barrels , a 0.8 percent increase over this year ’s demand .
Prices for commodities soared in the first half of the year , with crude oil prices peaking at $ 145.29 a barrel in July .
But the financial crisis and the accelerating slowdown have pushed prices down .
Is there sinister subtext in McCain ads ?
There was never any chance that it would be a placid affair , a presidential race free of mud-slinging and shabby attack ads .
It will surprise only the political naif that Sen .
John McCain ’s promised campaign of high - mindedness is entirely dependent on favorable polling data , or that Sen. Barack Obama ’s platitudinous calls for “ hope ” and “ change , ” his admonition that we must knock down “ walls ” and erect “ bridges , ” are tactfully short on specifics .
But it is with a certain amount of puzzlement that many observers have watched the issue of race injected into the campaign .
Last week , after the McCain team released two seemingly innocuous , though pointed , advertisements — one accusing their opponent of vapidity , the other of messianism — a steady stream of mainstream , Obama - friendly commentators and bloggers cried foul .
In a video titled “ Celeb , ” McCain juxtaposed Obama with famous paparazzi quarry Paris Hilton and Britney Spears .
To most , the message was clear , if a little ham - handed : Like Hilton and Spears , Obama is famous for being famous ; he 's more flash than substance .
Advertisement
But was there a deeper message ?
In the past week and a half , the liberal blogosphere has become a virtual Bletchley Park of racial cryptographers teasing out the sinister motives and subtexts of McCain ’s campaign advertising .
In a web - only column , The New York Times editorial page charged that the ad was a “ racially tinged attack ” like the one that “ ran against Harold Ford , a black candidate for Senate in Tennessee in 2006 .
That assault , too , began with videos juxtaposing Mr. Ford with young , white women . "
The American Prospect ’s Ezra Klein huffed that the McCain campaign is “ running crypto- racist ads . ”
Bill Press , former co-host of CNN's Crossfire , proclaimed that the “ Celeb ” spot was " deliberately and deceptively racist . "
Polk Award - winning blogger Josh Marshall wrote that “ the McCain campaign is now pushing the caricature of Obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women . "
The online hyperventilation quickly passed through to the Sunday chat show circuit .
If this was n’t dog - whistle politics , said Democratic strategist Donna Brazile on " This Week With George Stephanopoulos , " then “ why not use Denzel Washington or Bono ? ”
( Brazile is a frequent decoder of subterranean racism , having previously accused former President Bill Clinton of being racially insensitive for calling Obama ’s view of the Iraq war a " fairy tale . " )
MSNBC ’s perpetually outraged host Keith Olbermann inveighed against the “ almost subliminal racism , a black man with two women . ”
When the video briefly flashed Berlin ’s Victory Column on the screen — where Obama addressed 200,000 adoring fans — New York Times columnist Bob Herbert saw a “ phallic symbol . ”
But it was n’t just the Britney - Paris ad that channeled voters ’ inner Orval Faubus .
McCain ’s follow - up video joked that the star - struck press corps had anointed him “ The One , ” a man that could not only “ do no wrong ” but could also probably , with powers bestowed by the media , part the Red Sea .
Cue the clip of Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments .
Here , too , was the specter of racism .
“ When you see this Charlton Heston ad , ‘ The One , ’ that ’s code for , ‘ He ’s uppity ; he ought to stay in his place , ' ” political consultant David Gergen told his mystified co-panelists on “ This Week . ”
“ It ’s the subtext of this campaign .
Everybody knows that . ”
To no one ’s surprise , Brazile agreed .
And if that was n’t enough subliminal race - baiting for one week , Slate ’s Tim Noah wondered if a playful Wall Street Journal article on Obama ’s eating habits was — you guessed it — larded in racial code words .
“ My point is that any discussion of Obama ’s ‘ skinniness ’ and its impact on the typical American voter , ” Noah wrote , “ ca n’t avoid being interpreted as a coded discussion of race . ”
McCain has n’t run a clean campaign , but neither has he run a back - handedly racist one .
As Stephanopoulos remarked on “ This Week , ” the senator has been “ scrupulous about not raising race in any way ” and has gone out of his way to denounce anti-Obama ads run by local Republicans .
But for those who believe America to be irredeemably racist , those who believe , contrary to all available evidence ( such as the astounding success of the Obama campaign ) , that racial prejudice in America has n’t diminished but has simply shape - shifted and “ gone underground , ” it must be profoundly disappointing that McCain has n’t submitted an updated “ Southern strategy . ”
It is , therefore , vital that he is at least accused of doing so .
It would be wise for the Obama campaign to either discourage or leave these schizophrenic , and often scurrilous , accusations to his legion of online and media supporters .
And so far , it has done just that , responding that while the “ Celeb ” video displayed a deep cynicism , it did n’t suggest racist intent .
Indeed , the Obama campaign has deliberately minimized discussion of divisive racial issues .
Once an unambiguous supporter of affirmative action , he now argues that his support for the policy is nuanced , and he recently said that he does n’t believe his children should benefit from racial preferences .
At a campaign stop last week , he squashed the idea that , as president , he would support financial reparations for the decedents of slaves .
So let us dispense with a few important caveats : Racism remains a persistent , though much diminished , force in American life .
There exist voters , motivated by irrational racial animus , who will pull the lever for McCain , and there will doubtless be those who accept the fantastical misinformation of anti-Obama chain e-mails claiming a relationship between the senator and Islamic radicalism .
And it can be convincingly argued that , regardless of who played the race card first , this election is inextricably linked to the issue of race in America .
It is no small achievement that merely a half - century after the legal dismantling of Jim Crow , an African - American is a half - step from the Oval Office .
But readers of racial tea leaves should tread carefully .
If McCain ’s ad blitz is responsible for narrowing Obama ’s lead , those vacillating voters wo n’t take kindly to suggestions that they have been swayed by their own subconscious racism .

< a href = " http://warehouse.carlh.com/article_160 ">theWAREHOUSE : Bacon Popcorn</a>
NOTE : Before anyone cries foul :
Like an idiot , I did n't google to see if this had been done until after I had taken photos and written half the article .
So , when you 're done here , also check out Nosheteria - from just over a year ago .
I think mine has better photos , though .
And a dog .
So I 've noticed a lot of theWAREHOUSE articles have been rather food related lately , have n't they ?
Yes , they have .
Do n't worry , the lamps are almost done .
Really .
I mean , maybe another month worth of weekends ... but almost .
Anyone want to buy me a high powered , table mounting belt sander ?
Anyway in the meantime we have today 's article : Bacon Popcorn !
It 's only " pco " away from Bacon Porn .
I got some real popcorn for my wife for Christmas .
Not the stuff you do in the microwave .
This is the real kernels you can either pop in an air popper or in a skillet .
The flavor is much better and it only takes a little longer - plus it 's probably healthier for you .
Well we 'll be taking care of that last part today .
Because , you see , when you pop the popcorn in a skillet , you use " 1 - 3 tablespoons of oil " put down first .
But it does n't specify what kind .
We 've been using vegetable oil .
I thought to myself the other day that since it does n't really specify , the popcorn must not be really picky .
If any kind of oil works , why not grease ?
Why not ... bacon grease ?
Pardon the awful colors in the first picture .
It originally turned out pretty dark and orangey , so I think this is a little better .
Bad Carl , bad !
Anyway , I like that the hormel logo is on an upside down Bart Simpson head .
I guess that each strip of bacon puts out about 3 / 4tbsp of grease , so even just using three strips of bacon would have fit within the instructions ' recommended 1 - 3 of oil just fine , but I did n't know if it might take extra .
Plus , you know , it 's bacon .
So . I wanted more bacon .
Bacon. Bacon . Bacon .
Bacon .
After a few minutes I started to get scared .
Was the awesomeness of my pork strips choking out those poor delicate kernels ?
But finally I heard the pitter - patter of little pig- soaked poppings !
I think perhaps if anything there might have been too much grease , choking out and coating the kernels a little too thickly .
The popcorn did seem to not pop as fully and fluffily as with the other oils .
On the other hand , it might have been because I had to occasionally open the lid to move the bacon to keep it from burning .
Of course , the popcorn does n't really care about being under a lid - it 's just to keep it contained .
Bacon popcorn !
How did it taste ?
I 'm a little disappointed to say that it only took on a very mild flavor of bacon from the grease .
Of course it was nice that there were full strips of bacon to crumble up with it right there , so that enhanced it a bunch and brought it up to moderate .
This could be a perfect place to use the recently created bacon salt .
That 's our dog in the background of that last photo .
You can bet your sweet potato she want some bacon .
Who does n't ?
Even vegans want bacon .
All in all a very worthy experiment that needs a bit of enhancement .
A handful of diced jalapenos , a bit of shredded cheese , and the aforementioned bacon salt and this could be perfect nacho cheddar bacon popcorn .

Or maybe I have such BSG withdrawal symptoms that I find it cool no matter how tasteless it really is .
In any case , the amazing craftsmanship its undeniable , as the extra shots clearly show .

[ Bit - Tech ]
I ’ve been playing with OAuth a bit lately .
The OAuth specification fulfills a role that some people saw as a failing of OpenID : programmatic access to websites and authenticated web services .
The expectation that OpenID would handle these cases seems a bit misguided since the two uses cases are quite different :
OpenID is designed on the principle of letting arbitrary OpenID providers talk to arbitrary relying parties and vice versa .
OpenID is intentionally vague about how the provider authenticates the user .
The only restriction is that the authentication must be able to fit into a web browsing session between the user and provider .
While these are quite useful features for a decentralised user authentication scheme , the requirements for web service authentication are quite different :
There is a tighter coupling between the service provider and client .
A client designed to talk to a photo sharing service wo n’t have much luck if you point it at a micro- blogging service .
Involving a web browser session in the authentication process for individual web service request is not a workable solution : the client might be designed to run offline for instance .
While the idea of a universal web services client is not achievable , there are areas of commonality between different the services : gaining authorisation from the user and authenticating individual requests .
This is the area that OAuth targets .
While it has different applications , it is possible to compare some of the choices made in the protocol :
The secrets for request and access tokens are sent to the client in the clear .
So at a minimum , a service provider ’s request token URL and access token URL should be served over SSL .
OpenID nominally avoids this by using Diffie - Hellman Key Exchange to avoid evesdropping , but ended up needing it to avoid man in the middle attacks .
So sending them in the clear is probably a more honest approach .
Actual web service methods can be authenticated over plain HTTP in a fairly secure means using the HMAC - SHA1 or RSA - SHA1 signature methods .
Although if you ’re using SSL anyway , the PLAINTEXT authentication method is probably not any worse than HMAC - SHA1 .
The authentication protocol supports both web applications and desktop applications .
Though any security gained through consumer secrets is invalidated for desktop applications , since anyone with a copy of the application will necessarily have access to the secrets .
A few other points follow on from this :
The RSA - SHA1 signature method is not appropriate for use by desktop applications .
The signature is based only on information available in the web service request and the RSA key associated with the consumer , and the private key will need to be distributed as part of the application .
So if an attacker discovers an access token ( not access token secret ) , they can authenticate .
The other two authentication methods — HMAC - SHA1 and PLAINTEXT — depend on an access token secret .
Along with the access token , this is essentially a proxy for the user name and password , so should be protected as such ( e.g. via the GNOME keyring ) .
It still sounds better than storing passwords directly , since the token wo n’t give access to unrelated sites the user happened to use the same password on , and can be revoked independently of changing the password .
While the OpenID folks found a need for a formal extension mechanism for version 2.0 of that protocol , nothing like that seems to have been added to OAuth .
There are now a number of proposed extensions for OAuth , so it probably would have been a good idea .
Perhaps it is n’t as big a deal , due to tigher coupling of service providers and consumers , but I could imagine it being useful as the two parties evolve over time .
So the standard seems decent enough , and better than trying to design such a system yourself .
Like OpenID , it ’ll probably take until the second release of the specification for some of the ambiguities to be taken care of and for wider adoption .
From the Python programmer point of view , things could be better .
The library available from the OAuth site seems quite immature and lacks support for a few aspects of the protocol .
It looks okay for simpler uses , but may be difficult to extend for use in more complicated projects .
BOTH SIDES AGREE TO CHANGE VP DEBATE RULES , PALIN TO DEBATE CARIBOU " I am about to blow the opponent away . "
-- Sarah Palin
Satire by R J Shulman
ST . LOUIS  ( PTSD News ) 
In a stunning turn of events , Joe Biden has been replaced with a caribou for Thursdays vice presidential debate at Washington University .
 The media has been absolutely unfair and cruel to Governor Palin ,  said Rick Davis of the McCain campaign , so its only fair that she gets a level playing field for this debate . 
 Finally , Sarah will get a fair shot ,  a Palin spokesperson said .
 We think with the new rules , this debate will be right on target . 
The caribou , named Nedib , has been flown into St. Louis from Barrow , Alaska .
 America get ready for a real shootout ,  Palin told a cheering crowd at an evangelical rally in Sikeston , Missouri .
 I am about to blow the opponent away . 
Clancy Franklin , a spokesperson for Joe Biden , said he was fine with the last minute change .
 She can debate a post , for all I care ,  Franklin said ,  Shell still come in second .
We need Joe on the campaign trail .
 I am going to take time from my nap to watchicate this debate ,  said President [ sic ]
Bush , because I have looked into the eyes of the caribou and I was able to get a sense of his soul . 
The lipstick crisis has already taken its toll as Helene Curtis , a leading lipstick manufacturer on the verge of bankruptcy , has just been taken over by the federal government .
 We cannot afford to have such a venerable institution like Helene Curtis fail simply because of their high exposure to selling sub - prime lipstick ,  a government official said .
 This issue is not about lipstick ,  Ralph Nader said , it is about a pig being a pig , even if lipstick has been applied to that pig . 
Sally Fineburg of PETA agreed ,  Pigs are in danger of being mistreated to such an extent by these politicians that they are going to become an endangered species . 
Trevor Markham of the Rand Institute disagreed ,  there will always be pork in Washington . 
The ABC poll said lipstick was the most important issue for Americans by more than a five - to - one margin over the economy , the war in Iraq , healthcare , the energy crisis and global warming .
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 100 points .

This is the fifth post in an article series about MIT 's lecture course " Introduction to Algorithms . "
In this post I will review lectures seven and eight , which are on the topic of Hashing .
Many applications require a dynamic set that supports dictionary operations insert , search , and delete .
For example , a compiler for a computer language maintains a symbol table , in which the keys of elements are arbitrary strings that correspond to identifiers in the language .
A hash table is an effective data structure for implementing dictionaries .
Lectures seven and eight cover various implementation techniques of hash tables and hash functions .
Lecture 7 : Hashing I
Lecture seven starts with the symbol - table problem -- given a table S , we 'd like to insert an element into S , delete an element from S and search for an element in S .
We 'd also like these operations to take constant time .
The simplest solution to this problem is to use a direct - access ( or direct - address ) table .
To represent the dynamic set , we use an array , or direct - address table , denoted by T , in which each position , or slot , corresponds to a key .
Using direct - address table , the dictionary operations are trivial to implement .
Direct - Address - Search ( T , k ) return T[ k ] Direct - Address - Insert( T , x ) T[key [ x ] ] = x Direct - Address - Delete( T , x ) T[key [ x ] ] = NIL
Direct addressing is applicable when we can afford to allocate an array that has one position for every possible key .
It is not applicable when the range of keys can be large ( as it requires a lot of space for the array T ) .
This is where hashing comes in .
The lecture continues with explanation of what hashing is .
Hashing uses a hash function h ( k ) that maps keys k randomly into slots of hash - table T .
There is one hitch : two keys may hash to the same slot .
We call this situation a collision .
Fortunately , there are effective techniques for resolving the conflict created by collisions .
One of the simplest collision resolution techniques is called chaining .
In chaining , we put all the elements that hash to the same slot in a linked list :
Collision resolution by chaining .
Each hash - table slot T[j ] contains a linked list of all the keys whose hash value is j .
For example , h(k 1 ) = h(k 4 ) .
Professor Leiserson then analyzes the running time of insert , delete and search operations .
It is concluded that the expected running time operations is still O ( 1 ) , under assumption that the number of hash - table slots is at least proportional to the number of elements in the table .
The other half of the lecture is devoted to hash functions and another way of resolving collisions -- resolving collisions by open addressing , and probing strategies ( search ) for open addressing -- linear probing and double hashing .
A good hash function should distribute the keys uniformly into the slots of the table and the regularity in the key distributions should not affect uniformity .
Two hash function creating methods are introduced - the division method , which defines h( k ) = k mod m , and the multiplication method , where h( k ) = ( A·k mod 2 w ) > >( w- r ) , where w is bits in a word , A is an odd integer between 2 w - 1 and 2w , and r is lg(m ) .

Lecture 8 : Hashing II
Lecture eight starts with addressing a weakness of hashing -- for any choice of hash function , there exists a set of keys that all hash to the same value .
This weakness can lead to denial of service attacks on the application using hashing .
The idea of addressing this problem is to choose a hash function at random !
This is called universal hashing .
The lecture then moves to a mathematically rigorous the definition of universal hashing and explains one of many ways to construct a universal hash function .
The other half of the lecture is devoted to perfect hashing .
Perfect hashing solves a problem of constructing a static hash table ( such as a hash table stored on a CD ) , so that searches take O ( 1 ) time guaranteed ( worst - case ) .
The key idea in creating such hash table is to use 2 - level universal hashing , so that no collisions occur in level 2 .

Officials said that , since the incident on Wednesday , a lieutenant in the New York Police Department has been stripped of his gun and badge , and the officer who fired the gun has been placed on administrative duty .
Volkswagen is moving right along with its plan to put a plug - in hybrid on the road by 2011 , road - testing a " Twin Drive " Golf that goes 30 miles on lithium - ion battery power alone .
The proof - of - concept test mule roaming Berlin uses a diesel - electric drivetrain , but VW says the production model will ditch the 1.4 - liter turbodiesel in favor of a 1 - liter turbocharged gasoline engine .
Although the VW engineers discussing Twin Drive during the debut of the sixth - generation Golfcalled the engine a " range extender " – the same term GM uses for the gasoline engine in the Chevrolet Volt – it 's not .
The engine in VW 's Twin Drive system actually drives the wheels , whereas the engine in the Volt only charges the battery as it approaches depletion .
Be that as it may , the plug - in Golf runs on electricity alone to about 30 mph , at which point the engine takes over , according to the engineers who told Motor Trend about the system .
Twin Drive ditches the transmission , a move that helps compensate for the weight of the electric motor and the 350 - pound Sanyo battery pack mounted under the trunk .
The electric motor provides sufficient torque to get the car moving up to 30 mph , at which point the engine takes over with a single gear ratio roughly equivalent to top gear in a conventional car .
The electric motor also provides additional oomph for hard acceleration .
Regenerative braking helps keep the 12 kWh battery charged , and there 's an " e- mode " for tooling around town under battery power alone .
With no transmission , reverse gear is handled by the electric motor , according to Motor Trend .
Although VW is eager to put a demonstration fleet on the road , there 's still no word on when , or if , the automaker will put the cars in showrooms .
But as we noted when we first told you about Twin Drive , the German government is eager to see plug - in hybrids on the road ASAP and announced a $ 23.5 million dollar program to help automakers develop such vehicles within four years .
Germany 's environmental minister , Sigmar Gabriel , says there could be 1 million hybrids on the road in Germany by 2020 and 10
million a decade after that .
With any luck , some of them will be VWs .

" I understand your frustration and your cynicism , because while you 've been carrying out your responsibilities - most of the people here , you 've got a family budget .
If less money is coming in , you end up making cuts .
Maybe you do n't go out to dinner as much .
Maybe you put off buying a new car .
That 's not what happens in Washington . "
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - A gunman took 11 children hostage at a school in Maine on Friday but was tackled by police after surrendering his gun to a child without firing a shot , local media reported .
WABI - TV said the children , all around 10 years old , were unharmed in the incident at the school in Stockton Springs , a coastal town of 1,617 people about 50 miles east of the state capital Augusta .
Randall Hofland , 55 , who had been wanted by authorities who say he pointed a gun at a police officer on October 23 , was taken into custody after holding the children hostage for about 20 minutes , the Bangor Daily News reported .
The hostage drama is the latest in string of security alerts involving guns at American schools since two teenagers killed 12 fellow students and a teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999 .
The conscious psychological motive for this behavior , regardless of its effect , is typically not deterrence but what some psychologists call just - deserts retribution .
In a landmark 2002 study , psychologists at Princeton University had more than 1,000 participants evaluate vignettes describing various crimes and misdemeanors , and give sentencing recommendations .
The psychologists found that people very carefully tailored their recommended sentences to the details of the infraction , its brutality and the record of the perpetrator .
That is , people valued punishment for its own sake , as a measured consequence for behavior , not as a deterrent .
In a study published last year , University of Pennsylvania psychologists demonstrated how easy it was to influence how often , or how intensely , people acted on such urges to punish .
The researchers had students participate in several variations of the investment game .
Afterward , another group of students entered the laboratory , examined the results of earlier games and had the option to punish players who they thought deserved it .

The Heads of State
A striking pattern emerged among these judges .
When allowed to mete out their punishments anonymously , they docked players ’ earnings very little  about one dollar on average , or 10 percent of the allowed maximum .
But when being watched by the researchers and other participants , the judges ’ fines tripled in value .
“ This suggests that when given the opportunity to punish third parties , people do n’t do it much , ” said Robert Kurzban , who conducted the study with Peter DeScioli and Erin O’Brien .
“ They may be happy to see others do it , but they do n’t like to do it themselves . ”
The sense of betrayal Americans feel toward Wall Street , and the financial tumult ’s effects on 401 ( k ) accounts and small businesses , has certainly made many people less laissez - faire in their attitudes toward punishment , Dr. Kurzban said .
And there is nothing anonymous about the debates over the economic rescue plan , whether in Congress or at the water cooler : people are stating their views to an audience , and the collective fairness instinct is stoked to high heat .
Fortunately for the economy , researchers say , a strong countervailing psychological force is also at work : the instinct to forgive , and to cooperate .
Punishments are balanced by peace offerings , and in fact researchers have come close to calculating the rough ratio most people employ .
Running thousands of computer variations of the investment game , scientists have found that the strategies that pay off the most are tipped toward cooperation .
World 's Most Famous Twin Moguls : Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen
and her twin sisterwere born in 1986 and are best known for playing the role of Michelle Tanner on the sitcom Full House .
Since then , they have continued their ' celebrity ' through television , film , interviews and most lucrative of all , commercial endorsements .
The 22 - year - old mega millionaires have been on Forbes list yearly since 2002 , and in 2007 ranked as the eleventh richest women with a fortune estimated at $ 100 million .
During the 1990's they cleaned up in the preteen market with clothing , books , fragrances , magazines , movies and posters .
Mattel jumped on the bandwagon from 2000 - 2005 with Mary - Kate and Ashley fashion dolls .
Both young women tried New York University but dropped out without earning degrees .
The pair have a clothing line for young girls in Wal - Mart stores and have launched their own fashion lines :
The Row and Elizabeth & James .
The New York Times declared Mary - Kate a fashion icon for pioneering her signature ' homeless ' look , aka Bohemian chic .
Sister Ashley was called out by PETA on their 2006 Worst Dressed list for wearing fur .
The young women have an older brother Trent and a younger sister Elizabeth .
They also have half siblings Taylor and Jake who were born to their father with his second wife .
Their parents David Olsen and Jarnette Fuller Olsen divorced in 1995 .
Mary - Kate checked into a Utah rehab facility for six weeks in 2004 for treatment of an eating disorder .
Rumors of drug use were denied by the Olsens ' publicist who said : " Mary - Kate was not admitted for drugs .
Period . "
In 2006 , Ashley filed a $ 40 million lawsuit against National Enquirer for their headline " Ashley Olsen Caught In Drug Scandal " .
The publication featured an unflattering photo where the actress had her eyes half closed which the actress claims added to the malicious intent .
Her sister Mary - Kate Olsen was also caught up in media hype following the death of Heath Ledger .
She repeatedly refused to cooperate with investigators who wanted to question her about the drugs found in his bedroom .
The bottom line is that multi-million dollar status is not a guarantee of a wonderful existence .
The young women have been in the spotlight since they were babies .
Now that they are in control of their own destiny , they find it challenging to remain on the ' down low ' in the midst of a media that watches their every move .

Two lives ruined by social stigma
by Jeremy Hooper
Sometimes it seems like our work in the field of gay activism is coming to a close .
But then we wake up and remember that we still live in a world where some consider being perceived as a gay to be a worse fate than being perceived as a murderer .
This from News 4 , Jacksonville :
JACKSONVILLE , Fla . -- A 19 - year - old who turned himself in to police on Thursday says he killed a man he believe was spreading rumors about homosexuality .
Police said Hector Sanchez is accused in the shooting death of 24 - year - old Levi Rollins , whose body was found inside a car parked in a Westside cemetery in July .
...
Sanchez told investigators that he was angry that Rollins was telling people that Sanchez was homosexual and " he decided to do something about it . "
In a taped confession , Sanchez told detectives that he invited Rollins over to smoke some marijuana .
After sitting in the parking lot of an apartment complex , Sanchez said he pulled a gun and shot Lopez several times .
He told police he went to his apartment , changed clothes , then drove Rollins ' car to the cemetery and left .

Police : Teen Admits To Killing Man Over Homosexual Comment [ News 4 Jax ]
Gee , what in Florida could POSSIBLY be leading young folks to swallow the message that being gay is the worst thing imaginable ?
Your thoughts
Who was Lopez ?
Posted by : Cindi Knox | Sep 26 , 2008 3:00:18 PM
Opps , Cindi -- Looks like News 4 mixed up the name .
They clearly meant Levi Rollins .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Sep 26 , 2008 3:22:23 PM
" he was angry that Rollins was telling people that Sanchez was homosexual and " he decided to do something about it . "
Who wants to bet this was AFTER Sanchez fucked Rollins ?
Posted by : Scott | Sep 29 , 2008 7:54:14 AM
Levi was one of my best friends , have some respect and if you dont know what really happened or dont know either of the victims then watch your comments you wouldnt want anyone saying those things about your loved ones , let him rest in peace !!

" Social Helix makes sharing , managing , and publishing your events easier so you can spend more time with your friends . "
There are many conversations between designers and engineers that go back and forth about the performance of animations in JavaScript .
Often there is an expectation of animations to run consistently ( same speed , same step size , same in all browsers , etc. ) , and as awesome as that would be , this pushes at the limitations of JavaScript .
Many designers experience a great working animation on a demo page , and in turn , expect that the animation can be plugged into a complex JavaScript library , whilst preserving its performance .
Again , as wonderful as this would be , there are a few things that need further explanation .
Today s article will look at a simple animation in 3 top libraries : YUI , jQuery , and Prototype / Scriptaculous ; and show how uniformly all the animations work well on a simple page , but degrade as the page becomes busier .
Many of you probably know that there are a number of issues affecting how well an animation works in JavaScript : how busy the client machine is , how much CPU / memory your browser dedicates to JavaScript , how much JavaScript is needed to run a given page , and how much work the JavaScript is already doing ; to name a few .
Also , animation libraries use a combination of the setTimeout or setInterval methods of JavaScript , which are notoriously inaccurate (+/- 15 ms ) , and / or ( new Date ( ) ) .milliseconds ( ) to attempt to smooth animation , but it is fairly easy for an entire step in the animation to be skipped .
The summary is that the more complex a page gets the less consistent that animations become .
I choose to compare these three libraries because : YUI is my library of choice , as it was designed by engineers for engineers ; Prototype / Scriptaculous is probably the most used library ( thanks to ruby on rails and cakePHP ) ; and jQuery is the most popular designer - used library .
However , I expect that GWT , Mootools , Dojo , Mochikit , and all the others to behave about the same .
---
For this experiment we are building 3 animations that increase the width of an element from 100 px to 400 px , and then the reverse , using each library independently .
Fortunately , both YUI and jQuery use self - contained namespaces , so they dont conflict with Prototype .
Here is the code required for each :
Example 1 : jQuery
var isOpenedJquery = false , isJQueryAnimated = false ; var jQueryCallback = function ( ) { if (! isJQueryAnimated ) { isJQueryAnimated = true ; isOpenedJquery = ! is OpenedJquery ; j Query ( #containerAnimateJQuery ) .animate ( {width : isOpenedJquery ?
400 px : 100 px } , 1000 * globalDuration , null , function ( ) {isJQueryAnimated = false ;} ) ; } } ; jQuery ( # triggerAnimateJQuery ).click ( jQueryCallback ) ;
Example 2 : Prototype
var isOpenedPrototype = false , isAnimated Prototype = false ; var prototypeCallback = function ( ) { if (! is AnimatedPrototype ) { isOpenedPrototype = !
is OpenedPrototype ; isAnimated Prototype = true ; Effect .
BlindDown ( containerAnimatePrototype , {duration : globalDuration , scaleY : false , scaleX : true , scaleFrom : isOpenedPrototype ?
100 : 400 , scaleTo : isOpenedPrototype ?
400 : 100 , after Finish : function ( ) {isAnimated Prototype = false;} , afterUpdate : function ( ) { YAHOO.util.Dom.setStyle ( containerAnimatePrototype , height , 20em ) ; }} ) ; } } ; $ ( trigger Animate Prototype ) .observe ( click , prototypeCallback ) ;
Example 3 : YUI
var isOpenedYui = false ; var containerAnimate = { inYUI : new YAHOO.util.Anim ( containerAnimateYUI , { width : { to : 100}} , globalDuration ) , outYUI : new YAHOO.util.Anim ( containerAnimateYUI , { width : { to : 400}} , globalDuration ) } ; var yuiCallback = function ( ) { if (! ( containerAnimate.outYUI.isAnimated ( ) || containerAnimate.inYUI.isAnimated ( ) ) ) { isOpenedYui = !
is OpenedYui ; containerAnimate[isOpenedYui ? outYUI : inYUI ].animate ( ) ; } } ; YAHOO.util.Event.on ( triggerAnimateYUI , click , yuiCallback ) ;
All implementations use a click event callback on a button to trigger animating .
There is a global globalDuration variable that can be adjusted on the demo page ; YUI and Prototype / Scriptaculous use seconds , while jQuery uses milliseconds .
The callback function first checks to ensure that we are not already animating , which is done by setting a boolean via a callback for Prototype / Scriptaculous and jQuery , and calling the isAnimated method on the Anim object in YUI .
Then we use a isOpened boolean to determine whether to animate in or out .
In Prototype / Scriptaculous and jQuery we call 1 - off methods that runs the animation , whereas in YUI we create Anim objects and call the animate methods .
Take a look at the demo , here .

What I Learned
Sarah Palin waits to speak to the crowd in Green , Ohio , on Wednesday .
GOP donors critical of Palin 's pricey threads
The Republican National Committee ’s $ 150,000 investment in Sarah Palin ’s wardrobe has prompted some teeth gnashing among the party ’s big donors about its political sensibility and a feisty debate among campaign finance specialists about its legality .
“ As a Republican Eagle and a maxed - out contributor to McCain ’s general campaign , I ’d like my money back – he can still have my vote , ” complained one irate donor on Wednesday .
Advertisement
“ I ’m not one who says a candidate should n’t wear fine clothes , ” he added .
“ I ’d just like to think they were successful enough in the private sector to have afforded their wardrobe with their own money , not the party ’s or the campaign ’s , which is really our money as contributors . ”
Another big donor was sympathetic to the effort , but critical of the execution .
The Alaska governor was tapped by Arizona Sen .
John McCain to become his vice presidential running mate just days before the Republican National Convention in Minnesota , the donor noted .
Given the short notice and the Palins ’ relatively modest means , “ she could probably not go into her closet at home in Alaska to come up with a wardrobe appropriate for her status as a vice presidential candidate , " he said .
“ Having said that , $ 150 K is big money , ” he added .
“ It kind of makes it worth running .
Even if you lose , you ’ve got a whole new closet . ”
Other donors , in other e-mails and interviews , said the costs were worth the investment .
Palin has proven to be a major draw at campaign rallies , and her strong performances and appearance provides a polished and professional image on television , one donor noted .
In addition , he suggested , the bad press only means the GOP base will unite even further behind the McCain - Palin ticket .
As Republican donors absorbed the news , the consensus among several prominent Washington - based attorneys was that the purchases were legal , albeit in a fuzzy area of the law .
Campaign finance laws prohibit candidates from spending donor cash to their authorized personal campaign committee on costs “ that would exist irrespective of the candidate ’s election campaign , ” including clothing , vacations and gym memberships .
But the law does not prohibit such expenditures by party committees , and Congress has killed legislation to expand the personal use ban to those and other types of political committees .
The fuzzy part in the Palin case is that the RNC used money from an account designated for “ coordinated , ” or shared , expenditures with the McCain - Palin candidate account .
The Federal Election Commission , which interprets federal campaign finance laws , has never been asked to address this issue .
And legal experts say the key question is :
From which side of the joint account was the money drawn ?
Noting that the expenses were reported by the RNC and not the McCain - Palin campaign , Ken Gross , a law partner at Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom who advises corporations on campaign finance laws , concluded : “ The bottom line is that this is party committee money .
These are not campaign funds . ”
Wiley Rein lawyer Jan Baran , an adviser to several Republican candidates and committees , agreed with Gross , but added that the Palins may still be forced to comply with tax laws .
“ The receipt of goods and services by the taxpayer usually constitutes reportable ‘ income ’ , ” Baran said .
Consequently , Palin may have to declare the value of the fashion gifts as income and pay taxes on it .
“ She might be able to offset some of the taxes by donating the items to charity after the campaign , Baran said , “ although she will only be able to deduct the fair market value at that time . ”
The campaign said Tuesday that Palin intends to donate the clothes to charity after the election .
Let ’s not forget , John McCain was involved in the Keating Five scandal when he was 54 years old .
Barack Obama is 47 .
That means McCain was 7 years OLDER than Obama when he had his Keating Five ethics scandal .
That ’s not a youthful indiscretion .
That ’s a man ten years from retirement age who ’s doing some pretty unethical things , showing that he has some pretty bad character flaws .
Joe and I will be exploring the Keating Five Scandal all week , and then some .
John McCain likes to talk about his character .
So let ’s talk about it .
Remember , he was 54 years old when he got himself into this unethical mess .
Here at TPM , we ’re watching all the senate races really closely .
But I ’ll confess to a special personal interest in the Minnesota contest pitting Al Franken against Sen. Norm Coleman .
I ’m a longtime fan of Franken ’s and I think I can call him a friend .

Apparently there is a debate tonight .
The funny thing about it is I really do n’t even care .
There is , quite honestly , nothing Obama could say that would make me not vote for him .
His opening statement could be “ My name is Barack Hussein Obama , and I am a muslim , and winning this election is all part of a plot to turn the United States into my own personal caliphate , ” and I would shrug and vote for him anyway because at least he would go about it in a competent manner .
Compared to the last eight years with C+ Augustus and Darth Cheney and the possibility of four more with Johnny Drama and Bible Spice , that would be preferable .
The only thing I am really interested in is seeing if he can get McCain to erupt in anger .
At any rate , this is a debate , and as such , we must have a drinking game .
Use this thread to set up the ground rules .
Some starters :
McCain lies - 1 drink
McCain lies blatantly - 1 drink
McCain says “ My friends ” - 1 drink
McCain says “ My friends ” and includes the weird and awkward forced smile that screams CHILD TOUCHER - 1 drink
McCain says Obama is out touch – one sip
McCain says “ I put country first ” — two sips
McCain says Obama will raise taxes for Middle class – 2 shots
Any mention of POW , Viet Nam , service to country - 1 drink
“ Ready on Day One ” - One drink
Blatant pandering over Israel / Georgia / wherever - 1 drink
Discussing the surge - 1 drink

This general election season has seen its share of campaign narratives .
Some areas of focus have centered on less - than - salient subjects ( see Fox News ' near - daily coverage of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright during the primary season ) .
Some have focused on race and gender .
In fact , until the U.S economy took a nosedive , the campaign narratives struggled to focus on actual campaign issues .
Now that the election has found its primary area of focus i.e. the economy , the American voting public has directed its support to Democratic Party Presidential Candidate Barack Obama ( D - IL ) .
Pundits across the political spectrum insist that Obama 's support is derived from the financial disaster that has struck the nation .
Conservative commentators have even gone so far as to maintain that the Obama camp is taking political advantage of a crisis situation to push ahead its agenda and lock the narrative on the economy .
While these attempts at conventional wisdom are certainly the safe bets where Republican , Democratic , and Independent analysts are concerned , the actual explanation for Obama 's widespread popularity in this election season may deal with a far more personal and complex matter related to human needs .
In short , Barack Obama 's vision for America successfully identifies and addresses the satisfaction of many salient areas crucial to improving the quality of life for the American working class - a suite of values Abraham Maslow conceptualized as his " Hierarchy of Human Needs " .
In order to initiate a discussion of the connection between Barack Obama ’s public policy solutions and their relationship to the fulfillment of Maslow ’s Hierarchy of Needs , it is first necessary to understand precisely what Maslow ’s Hierarchy consists of and the relative levels in play .
Work is performed based on an individual ’s needs on personal , social , and financial levels .
Rarely does an individual work if there is not some real or perceived need to perform the work .
These needs can be traced to the following basic hierarchy :
Maslow 's hierarchy of needs
1 Physiological
Thirst , sex , hunger
2 Safety
Security , stability , protection
3 Love and Belongingness
To escape loneliness , love and be loved , and gain a sense of belonging
4 Esteem
Self - respect , the respect others
5 Self - actualization
To fulfill one 's potentialities
In order to satisfy the primary needs of the pyramid , one must achieve a level of work that provides basic necessities , such as food , shelter , and tools for sufficient health .
This work is performed on a paid basis and is contingent upon satisfactory compensation from affluent class production owners and managers .
Maslow ’s Hierarchy of Needs is generally satisfied at the very primary level , as most paid work allows an individual to be able to avoid the maladies associated with starvation and thirst .
However , these needs can diminish when the upper levels of the hierarchy , which stress gaining a sense of belonging , increased self - esteem , and an intrinsic , self - actualization value that constitutes continuous human development , are taken into account .
For years , public policies promulgated by Republican administrations have stopped short of fulfilling Levels 2 - 5 - which in public policy terms means an inability to penetrate into needs related to security , stability , and protection .
By comparison , Obama 's public policy solutions seek to satisfy these needs via universal health care and more equitable economic policies .
The levels of Maslow 's Hierarchy addressed by Obama 's proposed policy initiatives do not stop at the aforementioned safety needs .
The need for self - actualization via attaining the personal value of one ’s work is essential if the individual is to continue upon the path of continuous development both personally and professionally .
Joan M. Kiel , writing for the Journal of Instructional Psychology to explicate regarding intrinsic values in 1999 ( Vol. 26 ) , points out , " Self actualization is defined as " a process of becoming " , " the process of development which does not end " , ( Heylighen , 41 ) , " the individual doing what he is fitted for - `what a man can be , he must be ' " , ( Maslow 91 ) , " a desire to become more and more what one is ' , ( Maslow , 92 ) , and " " being a mature , fully human person in whom the human potentialities have been realized and actualized " , ( Mittleman , 116 ) .
( Kiel , 1999 , p. 167 ) .
So where do these values and their relationship to fulfilling Maslow 's Hierarchy of Needs become congruent with Barack Obama 's public policy solutions and their acceptance by the low and middle - income working class ?
Perhaps this congruence is to be found within the bold , sweeping nature of the tax , health care , foreign policy , and accompanying economic policies that promise relief for the working class .
Promises made to the working class via incremental adjustments simply have not delivered meaningful and measurable results to address many of the public policy problems that have plagued the working class for decades .
By virtue of its perpetually - increasing demands for progressively higher production , capitalism imposes very tight restrictions on an individual ’s ability to meet Maslow ’s Needs that are related to self actualization outside the workplace .
This is primarily due to capitalism ’s predilection toward failing to compensate workers at a rate congruent to that by which an organization and its aggregate economy grow .
As B.D. Jones and F.R. Baumgartner explain via their article in the Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory in 2005 , " It is critical to understand that a straightforward incremental policy process will invariably lead to an outcome change distribution that is normal .
And vice versa : any normal distribution of policy outcome changes must have been generated by an incremental policy process .
Any time we observe any nonnormal distribution of policy change , we must conclude that incrementalism cannot alone be responsible for policy change .
That is why distributional analyses are so critical to policy studies . "
( Jones and Baumgartner , 2005 ) .
In other words , incrementalism threatens to provide more of the same where current capitalist practices strain the worker ’s ability to receive just compensation .
Incrementalism fails to bring about any significant social or policy changes – and thus struggles to be linked with any substantive improvements or policy changes that can work to better satisfy Maslow ’s Hierarchy of Needs .
Barack Obama seeks to revamp the modern definition of " paid work " by formulating and implementing more equitable public policies .
For working - class Americans , this means a reversal of the inequitable wage distribution and taxation system that has sought to widen the gap between the income classes .
The meaning of paid work as commonly defined is an unattractive and tedious description .
However , work need not be an arduous concept as commonly defined if utilized within the scope of Maslow ’s needs and defined via Herzberg ’s motivations .
This is because work can be defined as a lifelong process in search of self - actualization – but with almost limitless potential for the individual with regards to development .
Kiel points this out in the example of the ‘ open triangle ’ , stating , " In this new " Open Triangle " Model , the boundlessness of self actualization is evident .
There is no end to one 's potential - the process of development does not end .
Workplaces utilize management development , quality circles , and continuous quality improvement initiatives to foster employee and company growth .
The self actualizing person has also been defined as one " who is eager to undergo new experiences , and learn new ideas and skills " ( Heylighen , 42 - 3 ) .
It is today and not fifty years ago that people are engaged in " lifelong learning " .
Again there is a boundlessness conveyed here as one desires to move forward in new endeavors .
This is what the open triangle espouses . "
( Kiel , 1999 , p. 167 )
The aforementioned processes of self - actualization pre-suppose that basic Level One needs have been met via gainful paid work that satisfies essential tiers of Maslow ’s hierarchy .
Unfortunately , work has long been defined by most , if not all , of the dissatisfaction factors as related by Herzberg where the low and middle income classes are concerned .
In particular , company policies , work conditions , and insufficient salaries have left the members of these classes struggling to realize work as a self - actualization tool .
Present capitalist economic practices act as barriers to this development , as insufficient compensation parameters hold many individuals struggling to satisfy the primary needs according to Maslow .
An inability of the low and middle income worker to realize the economic value of his work leaves his focus and energy striving to maintain the minimal standard of living and results in under - developed self - actualization .
For those assigned a status at or near poverty , this presents the two - tiered definition of work that allows it to neither satisfy the primary needs requirements nor the advanced needs components that lead to self - actualization .
Therefore , the opportunity to succeed , have one ’s work recognized , have successful work maintained , and attaining consistent advancement and personal / professional growth remains the definition of work for the affluent class and those who are sufficiently compensated for their paid work .
Those struggling for recognition and accompanying financial compensation are made to struggle to overcome the barriers of paid work that leave their process of becoming bereft of any viable opportunity to succeed .
Upon crossing the threshold of poverty and the low - income result of wage disparities , the worker is able to define work as a method of achieving personal growth and the advancement that so often follows .
If workers across the board are to define work as a lifelong learning process that leads to becoming more and more of what one truly is , then these economic barriers must be quashed and a process of equity implemented on a broad scale to the aggregate profit of the society .
By virtue of Barack Obama 's economic , social , and foreign public policy solutions , he is better able to connect with the American working class - and thus stands alone as the candidate best able to improve the quality of life and the value of work for those lacking fulfillment of one or more of Maslow 's Hierarchy of Needs .
This explains why his popularity has been so consistent during the primary and general election seasons - and why he stands to be inaugurated as the next President of the United States .

Whether young people get drunk as a purposeful behavior or as an unintended consequence depends on what country they live in , according to new research on young people in seven countries .
The research finds that young people 's views on alcohol and drunkenness were influenced more by culture than by factors such as age and sex .
The research , sponsored by the International Center for Alcohol Policies ( ICAP ) , also finds striking similarities about drinking among young people in different parts of the world including :
--
Their introduction to alcohol was typically by parents during a family celebration ;
-- Alcohol consumption was primarily associated with enjoyment and socializing ;
-- Drinking mostly took place at gatherings ( parties , sporting events ) and in public venues ( bars , clubs ) ;
-- A " successful drinking experience involved socializing and avoided problems ;
--
An awareness of drinking as a means of self - medication .
Data from the focus groups are included in a new book , " Swimming with Crocodiles : The Culture of Extreme Drinking . "
The focus groups were conducted in Brazil , China , Italy , Nigeria , Russia , South Africa , and United Kingdom .
" Tragically , too many young people purposefully pursue drunkenness as a form of ' calculated hedonism ' bounded by the structural and cultural factors that affect young people in different countries , " says Fiona Measham , PhD , co-editor of the book and criminologist at Lancaster University .
" We need to work to change this culture of extreme drinking , " says Marjana Martinic , PhD , co-editor and vice president for public health at ICAP .
" We need to look at cultures in countries like Italy and Spain where moderate drinking is an ordinary , every - day part of family life . "
Research on young people 's drinking shows that rates of drunkenness and extreme drinking are significantly lower in the Mediterranean countries than in Northern European countries .
For example , 49 percent of Swedish 17 - year - olds report having been drunk , compared with around 10 percent of Italian , French , and Greek youth .
" Changing the culture of extreme drinking requires looking beyond traditional responses and getting all relevant stakeholders involved , " concludes Dr. Martinic .
" This means governments , the public health community , the beverage alcohol industry , the criminal justice system , and civil society must have a role in reducing extreme drinking among young people . "
Dr. Martinic says there are a wide range of interventions to help reduce extreme drinking among young people , particularly interventions at three key settings : school , work , and community .

It 's well known in Washington state that Republican gubenatorial candidate Dino Rossi is essentially a subsidiary of the Building Industry Association of Washington ( BIAW ) .
Check that -- a subsidiary of the corrupt BIAW .
Washington 's attorney general has filed suit against the organization , along with the tweedle dum to its dee , the Master Builders Association ( MBA ) , last week .
The two organizations have been funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars into Republican campaigns , particularly Rossi's .
The state 's Public Disclosure Commission found the BIAW and MBA guilty of multiple " egregious " campaign finance violations , which led to the AG 's suit .
Documents released today reveal that Republican gubernatorial candidate Dino Rossi was not only aware of the Building Industry Association of Washington ’s ( BIAW ) illegal fundraising activities , but that he actively solicited funds on their behalf from at least one organization , the Master Builder ’s Association ( MBA ) .
According to a summary of events posted by attorney Knoll Lowney :
When MBA leadership met ... on May 21 , 2007 at a “ Chair Officers Meeting , ” the discussion turned to BIAW ’s pending request for campaign funds .
While discussing the request , all three of the MBA ’s top officers reported that they had received calls from Dino Rossi .
The one call for which additional detail is provided clearly confirms that Rossi called to support a MBA contribution to the BIAW ’s governor ’s race war chest .
The minutes leave no question that Dino Rossi spoke to this officer about whether and when MBA would give to the BIAW ’s governor campaign fund .
The officers receiving calls from Rossi were then - MBA President Doug Barnes , First Vice President Joe Schwab , and Second Vice President John Day .
Rossi called not one , but at least three MBA board members to solicit funds for “ the BIAW ’s war chest , ” a war chest that was explicitly described at the MBA ’s previous meeting as “ a fund for Rossi . ”
And it is clear , both from the context of this excerpt , and from the stated response to Rossi from MBA Second VP John Day , that the subject of those calls was indeed these solicited funds .
What should now be absolutely obvious to even the most objective observer is that Rossi was an active participant in the BIAW ’s illegal fundraising scheme … a scheme for which the PDC found the BIAW guilty of multiple “ egregious ” violations of Washington ’s campaign finance and disclosure laws , and which is now being prosecuted by the Attorney General ’s office .
But it is important to note that even if the BIAW had scrupulously conducted its campaign within the letter of the law ( and it did n’t ) , Rossi would still be guilty of a major violation of our campaign statutes , for it is absolutely positively 100 % illegal ( not to mention grossly unethical ) for a candidate to coordinate activities with an independent expenditure campaign .
Seems that Washington State Republican gubenatorial candidate Dino Rossi is a bona fide part of the Republican Culture of Corruption .
It is hard , these days , to find a law - abding Republican anymore !
From Daily Kos
So , was Rossi an unwitting beneficiary of these illegat activities , or was he an active participant ?
Well , we can get it right from the horse 's ass ( yes ... that 's the name of the website ) : So Rossi was a DIRECT PARTICIPANT in these illegal activities .
Yet ANOTHER corrupt Republican who disregards the laws that the rest of us have to follow .
The Republican Culture of Corruption still plagues this country .
America must reject this kind of crap ... and it HAS been .
Rossi 's disregard for the law should be his downfall if voters care ANYTHING for values , honesty and the law .
FREMONT , California – Solar cells have been converting sunlight into electricity for years , but scientists have been much less successful at turning that technology into money .
Now , in a staid Bay Area office park , a converted hard - drive factory with a shiny new façade has begun churning out unconventional solar tubes that could change the economics of solar power .
The highly - automated factory belongs to Solyndra , a three - year - old company that has received $ 600 million in venture capital and $ 1.2 billion in orders for its new modules , which look like curtain rods .
Those big investors are betting the company 's unique product will soon blanket commercial buildings across the world .
Instead of the standard panels mounted on racks that have dominated solar for the last 20 years , Solyndra 's cylindrical solar modules collect sunlight more efficiently across a broader range of angles and catch light reflected off the roof itself .
The solar cells also contain no silicon , which has been a costly component of most solar systems .
Targeted at a highly specific market — office and big - box rooftops — and with signed contracts in hand , the company , along with a small cadre of other well - funded solar startups , are racing to turn their scientific and engineering marvels into profitable businesses .
The scramble , the money , and the size of the prize — a big slice of the trillions of dollars made in energy — remind the company 's founder , Chris Gronet , of his earlier experience in the industry that became the basis for the information revolution .
" We think the solar industry or market look very similar to the way semiconductor manufacturing was 20 years ago , " Gronet , Solyndra 's CEO , told Wired.com .
" We say , ' Wow this is familiar .
We 've been through this before . ' "
All types of solar power have experienced growth in the wake of increasing awareness of the risks of climate change and the rising costs of fossil fuels .
A report released last week by Lux Research , a solar - focused analysis firm , predicts that the total solar market will grow from $ 33.4 billion in 2008 to $ 100.4 billion in 2013 .
While traditional silicon - based solar cells continue to underpin most solar systems , there is a broad expectation among industry analysts and insiders that these new thin - film solar cells , such as Solyndra is making , will experience rapid growth .
While thin - film cells are n't as efficient at using the sun 's energy as their silicon competitors , they cost less to produce .
Instead of using wafers of material , a la computer chips or traditional solar PV , thin - film solar cells use tiny amounts of material deposited in ultra thin layers along the surface of glass or metal .
In Solyndra 's case , vice president of business development Kelly Truman said that their process uses just a bit more than a micron of copper indium gallium diselenide , or CIGS .
Using less of the expensive photovoltaic material drives the cost of their production down .
For years , CIGS technology had appeared the most promising for cheap solar power .
The National Solar Technology Roadmap , created by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , states that steady efficiency improvement " could ultimately allow CIGS to achieve the lowest module costs and levelized cost of energy among all PV technologies . "
The total solar market can be broken into three main pieces : solar for utilities , residential installations and commercial buildings .
Solyndra is focusing exclusively on the commercial side .
What Gronet envisions is solar panels installed on your average Home Depot or Ikea , generating a substantial percentage of the company 's power needs right on site .
On the roof of the Solyndra office buildings , they 've installed the first Solyndra array .
What 's striking about the system is how simple it appears :
The solar tubes look like reverse fluorescent light bulbs that generate electricity rather than using it .
The mounting system is also light and small , as you can see in the image .
They do n't have to be bolted to roofs because the spacing between the cylinders makes them less susceptible to wind damage than traditional flat solar panels .
But despite the industry 's high hopes , CIGS solar cells have proven very difficult to manufacture at industrial scales .
Greentech Media analyst Michael Kanellos said that the risks for CIGS thin - film players have " increased dramatically " over the last few months with the worsening financial system and increased competition .
" Some CIGS will survive , but a lot of these companies might only leave a wet spot on the pavement , " Kanellos wrote in an e-mail to Wired.com .
Kanellos noted that Solyndra 's cylindrical design was advantageous , but also the most difficult to manufacture .
" Everyone else is having trouble making efficient flat CIGS panels .
Curving adds another layer of complexity , " Kanellos wrote .
" It is part of the reason that their contracts call for the delivery of their solar panels from now to 2012 . "
Only two other CIGS - based thin - film manufacturers have managed to start cranking out actual saleable product .
Nanosolar and Global Solar started selling cells last year .
Solyndra , after hundreds of millions of dollars of investment , generated its first revenue in the third quarter of this year .
If Gronet and his team can work out the manufacturing challenges and navigate the difficult financial waters , their unique design and tightly focused business model could lead them to profitability , even after government subsidies in Europe phase out .
" In any unsubsidized world , which is a few years down the road , you need a cost structure that allows you to compete , " Gronet said .
" Our panel , because it 's CIGS and thin film , will beat the costs of any silicon system . "

U.S. Headed for ' Heightened Alert ' Stage Exclusive : Major events on the horizon prompt a surge in anti-terror efforts .
July 28 , 2008  --
Government officials have been quietly stepping up counterterror efforts out of a growing concern that al Qaeda or similar organizations might try to capitalize on the spate of extremely high - profile events in the coming months , sources tell ABC News .
Security experts point to next month 's Olympics as evidence that high - profile events attract threats of terrorism , like the one issued this past weekend by a Chinese Muslim minority group that warned of its intent to attack the Games .
Anti-terror officials in the U.S. cite this summer and fall 's lineup of two major political parties ' conventions , November 's general election and months of transition into a new presidential administration as cause for heightened awareness and action .
This is what the Department of Homeland Security is quietly declaring a Period of Heightened Alert , or POHA , a time frame when terrorists may have more incentive to attack .
According to drafts of government memos described to ABC News , the period would run roughly from this August through July 2009 .
During this time , homeland security analysts will be asked to redouble efforts to study terrorism leads .
And a number of agencies will be asked to review emergency response plans to a variety of attacks , from improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) to biological weapons .
Officials also are being asked to make sure they are prepared for all contingencies during the transition from the Bush administration to that of the next president .
In a recent interview , FBI director Robert Mueller told ABC News of his concerns for homeland security .
" When you have a series of events like this which are very public , where you have a number of people that are congregated together , we take additional precautions , " he said .
" That means identifying , focusing on the intelligence that 's available and scrutinizing it to pieces and running it to ground , to putting in place the precautions to assure the particular events go according to plan and free from terrorist attacks , " he said .
At the moment , the nation 's public threat level will remain at yellow , or " elevated , " but not orange , or " high . "
The reasons :
There are no specifics indicating an attack on the U.S. is imminent , and U.S. officials do not want to be accused of trying to inject themselves into the presidential campaign .
" That 's a balancing act , " said Jerry Hauer , former Homeland Security official and ABC News consultant .
" They really have to focus on these events and this critical time we 're going through as a nation , but they have to be very careful about the public message to not make it look political or like they 're fearmongering . "
Government officials point to the Sept. 11 attacks , which happened just nine months into a new administration , and the Madrid train bombings , which were carried out just three days before Spain 's 2004 general election .
They say history suggests a need to take potential threats seriously -- especially in the very near future .

Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs by Edward M. Brecher and the Editors of Consumer Reports Magazine , 1972 Chapter 33 .
Why alcohol should not be prohibited
In contrast to the many logical arguments in favor of alcohol prohibition , the one decisive argument against such a measure is purely pragmatic : prohibition does n't work .
It should work , but it does n't .
The evidence , of course , was accumulated during the thirteen - year period 1920 - 1933 .
The arguments in favor of prohibition before 1920 were overwhelming .
The Eighteenth ( Prohibition ) Amendment passed both houses of Congress by the required two - thirds majority in December 1917 , and was ratified by the required three - fourths of the forty - eight state legislatures a bare thirteen months later .
After experiencing alcohol prohibition for thirteen years , however , the nation rebelled .
The Twenty first ( Prohibition Repeal ) Amendment passed both houses of Congress by the required two - thirds majority in February 1933 - and this time it took less than ten months to secure ratification by three - fourths of the forty eight state legislatures .
Alcohol prohibition was not repealed because people decided that alcohol was a harmless drug .
On the contrary , the United States learned during Prohibition , even more than in prior decades , the true horrors of the drug .
What brought about Repeal was the slowly dawning awareness that alcohol prohibition was n't working .
Alcohol remained available during Prohibition .
People still got drunk , still became alcoholics , still suffered delirium tremens .
Drunken drivers remained a frequent menace on the highways .
Drunks continued to commit suicide , to kill others , and to be killed by others .
They continued to beat their own children , sometimes fatally .
The courts , jails , hospitals , and mental hospitals were still filled with drunks ,
In some respects and in some parts of the country , perhaps , the situation was a little better during Prohibition - but in other respects it was unquestionably worse .
Instead of consuming alcoholic beverages manufactured under the safeguards of state and federal standards , for example , people now drank " rotgut , " some of it adulterated , some of it contaminated .
The use of methyl alcohol , a poison , because ethyl alcohol was unavailable or too costly , led to blindness and death ; " ginger jake , " an adulterant found in bootleg beverages , produced paralysis and death .
1
The disreputable saloon was replaced by the even less savory speakeasy .
There was a shift from relatively mild light wines and beers to hard liquors - less bulky and therefore less hazardous to manufacture , transport , and sell on the black market .
Young people - and especially respectable young women , who rarely got drunk in public before 1920 now staggered out of speakeasies and reeled down the streets .
There were legal closing hours for saloons ; the speakeasies stayed open night and day .
Organized crime syndicates took control of alcohol distribution , establishing power bases that ( it is alleged ) still survive .
Marijuana , a drug previously little used in the United States , was first popularized during the period of alcohol Prohibition ( see Part VIII ) ; and ether was also imbibed ( see Chapter 43 ) .
The use of other drugs increased , too ; coffee consumption , for example , soared from 9 pounds per capita in 1919 to 12.9 pounds in 1920 .
2
The list is long and could be lengthened  but we need not belabor the obvious .
During the early years of alcohol Prohibition , it was argued that all that was wrong was lack of effective law enforcement .
So enforcement budgets were increased , more Prohibition agents were hired , arrests were facilitated by giving agents more power , penalties were escalated .
Prohibition still did n't work .
The United States thus learned its lesson with respect to alcohol .
More remarkable , the mere memory of Prohibition , forty years after Repeal , is still so repellent that no proposal to revive it would be taken seriously .
Since alcohol is treated as a nondrug , however , the relevance of the lesson to other drug prohibitions has been overlooked .
The Twenty - first ( Repeal ) Amendment left power in the states to retain statewide alcohol prohibition and made it a federal offense to ship alcoholic beverages into a dry state .
Statewide alcohol prohibition , however , failed like national prohibition .
State after state repealed its statewide alcohol prohibition laws ; Mississippi's , in 1966 , was the last to go .
In summary , far more would be gained by making alcohol unavailable than by making any other drug unavailable .
Yet the United States , after a thirteen - year trial , resolutely turned its face against alcohol prohibition .
Society recognized that prohibition does not in fact prohibit , and that it brings in its wake additional adverse effects .
All of the drugs discussed in this Part , including alcohol , have important medicinal or social uses .
All are subject to the same kinds of misuse .
Establishing a social policy designed to maximize the benefits and to minimize the damage done by these drugs is a challenge for the future .
But the first step toward that goal is surely apparent today : to make known the simple fact that the widely publicized perils of the barbiturates are in fact the perils of alcohol and that the other drugs in this class are not without hazard .
When the United States eventually arrives at a sound policy for any of these drugs , this policy will almost certainly be a consistent policy for all of them .
And society will seek to minimize for all of them what we have characterized in this Report as " the lure of the warning . "

Barnes & Noble ( BKS ) has decided they want no part of Borders ( BGP ) right now , the WSJ reports .
Borders , which put itself up for sale in March after disclosing liquidity problems , only has a market cap of $ 344 million , after declining 61 % over the past 52 weeks .
Still Barnes & Noble was concerned about two issues in particular :
tight lending markets that likely would make it difficult to arrange the proper financing
the long length of some of the leases that Borders has signed ( i.e. that makes it harder to dump the worst Borders stores )
The synergies would have been obvious with potential cost reductions in redundancies like backroom operations and a plethora of corporate expenses .
And it 's always possible BKS could return with a bid , but Borders wants a deal done by September .
Considering Borders is a cash - flow business with a tiny market cap , private equity firms will surely be taking a look .
But 's it 's not clear they 'll want it , either .

The trip to meet the Ma Lieng people at Ke Village , Vietnam , was a bit like a chapter out of a Brothers Grimm fairy tale .
For starters , to reach the village I had to get ferried across a chocolate river in something resembling a dugout canoe .
And , when I got there , I was met with a tribe of villagers who were almost supernaturally tiny .
The river ’s chocolate hue was due to heavy rains flushing the nation ’s soil to the sea – also making the river abnormally swollen and swift .
Carrying expensive camera equipment in a very suspect - looking vessel , with a freeboard of only a few inches , was disconcerting to say the least – every person ’s slightest movement rang alarm bells , and I had to work hard not to overcompensate in our bid to keep the canoe upright .
We made it to the other side , though , our gear dry , albeit with our nerves a little jangled .
Entryway to the Ke Village , home to the Ma Lieng people
So , whew , welcome to the Ke Village .
This visit was in stark contrast to our trip to see the Black Thai , at Na Sai , only a few days earlier , as you shall see .
Who Are the Ma Lieng ?
The Ma Lieng are not only small in stature – they are also , population - wise , the smallest minority group in Vietnam .
The Ma Lieng were only discovered in the 1980s – a dispersed population of , at the time , less than 500 individuals found in the heavily forested and mountainous Vietnam / Laos border districts of Quang Binh province in central Vietnam .
The new Ho Chi Minh highway we took to get here roughly equates to what the Americans called the Ho Chi Minh trail ( what the Vietnamese called the Truong Son Road , after the mountain range it went through ) .
This trail was the main support route for transferring soldiers , weaponry and supplies from northern Vietnam to the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam in the south .
The forested region of the Ma Lieng was thus hard hit by bombing during the American ( Vietnam ) War .
Since discovering the Ma Lieng , the Vietnamese government , in their well - intended bid to help this almost extinct minority , have encouraged the tribe to move down from the hills , closer to the roads where they can be more easily accessed and supported .
The villagers have obliged , and , as a consequence , are now somewhat out of their element .
Ke Village is now one of five Ma Lieng settlements in the region ( Ke , Chuoi , Cao , Ca Xen & Rao Tre Villages ) .
Inside a traditional Ma Lieng home – a simple structure , built to last only a few seasons
Historically , the Ma Lieng were semi-nomadic .
They did n’t travel large distances , but , rather , were forced to move regularly due to their traditional slash and burn method of farming .
They would scorch the land , then cultivate for a few seasons until yields diminished , then move on to another area .
Sustainable farming was really ‘ not their thing ’ .
Aside from the little they grew , they supplemented their diet with roots and herbs from the forest .
The forest had sustained them for generations .
It was all they knew .
And so , in the early days , after they had moved down closer to the roads , visitors would often discover the new settlements empty – as the Ma Lieng would return to the life they knew by day , only returning to the village to sleep at night .
Why So Small ?
It could be surmised that a lack of nutrition is the cause for their reduced stature ( most are less than 1.5 metres tall ) .
A study of other pygmies around the world has come to a more complex conclusion though – indicating that a shortened life span ( the Ma Lieng have a life span of around 59 years , a full 12 years less than the 71.3 year figure for the overall population ) has caused these tribes to adapt by becoming fertile , and ceasing their teenage growth , sooner .
Of course , either way , the nutrition aspect would still factor in – either as a direct or indirect cause – as nutrition effects life span .
Andy Kenworthy , a fellow PRI contributor , takes notes
Meeting the Ma Lieng
Meet Cao Van Dung ( left – roughly pronounced ‘ Zoong ’ ) – Ke Village chief and respected elder .
Mr. Dung greeted us warmly , and escorted us to the village ’s new community building where we sat to hear him speak on current village issues .
Dung was quick to say that life had improved for his community .
“ We now have enough to eat ” , he said , and “ life was very hard before . ”
He explained that villagers were now beginning to keep animals and home gardens .
But he continued to say that their problems were not all solved .
Top of his list of concerns was their agricultural experimentation .
Gardening in a way that does n’t deplete the soil is something completely new for the Ma Lieng .
Rather than their traditional slash and burn mentality , the need to stay in one place makes careful land management and nutrient cycling a primary focus .
But , experimental learning can be painful – particularly when you have a village of dependent mouths to feed .
A failed harvest means more than just a lesson learnt on the road to discovery .
Even a short visit to the village made me think that what they lacked the most , perhaps , was confidence .
Unlike the Black
Thai who have a long tradition of capably working the land and applying ingenious inventions to their work , the Ma Lieng are having to learn whole new methods for maintaining their existence , and discouragement seemed to be their biggest impediment .
As we spoke , while the other elders in the meeting sat to one side , with their eyes nailed to the floor ( see pic above ) , the conversation inevitably drifted to the need for outside assistance .
Like many developing communities , there is a clear temptation for the people to feel help must always come from outside their borders , by way of charity , as opposed to cultivating and harvesting talents and ingenuity hidden within their own community .
SPERI Head of Community Development ,
Dam Trong Tuan , hands one of several

representative for distribution
For example , Mr. Dung had expressed they had stopped raising pigs some time ago , but were now going to try again .
When I asked why they had stopped , he said it was because the pigs had been getting sick .
When I asked why they were getting sick ( in a Permaculturist ’s bid to test observational learning ) , he responded that they “ do n’t have the vaccines ” that wealthy people have .
I had asked what was the cause , not the cure – but the leap to the need for an outside help , rather than looking at what can be adjusted to remove the problem at source , was immediate .
For them the cause was not an animal management issue , but the lack of an external input .
Two Ways to ‘ Help ’
This way of thinking has been inadvertently encouraged by the Vietnamese government .
When working to provide housing for the Ke Villagers , the government simply did the obvious – hired contractors to quickly build some simple , ‘ adequate ’ housing structures .
A government - built house for the Ma Lieng
This is where contrasting two currently divergent ways of working for the Ma Lieng becomes not only interesting , but critically important if we are to really address the fundamental problems the Ma Lieng face .
One way seeks to merely , and hurriedly , patch the problems with feel - good solutions that help little in the long term ( although they do help some outside contractors in the short term ) , and the other way , well , really wants to address village issues with meaningful , holistic answers .
The house pictured above is a simple one - room structure – one that has , significantly , entirely ignored important traditional beliefs in its construction .
For the Ma Lieng , like many indigenous Vietnamese , an important aspect of a ‘ home ’ , as opposed to a ‘ house ’ , is the household altar and the supporting ‘ spirit pole ’ ( or ‘ Cot Ma ’ ) next to the altar at one corner of the structure .
The spirit pole , the foundation of the home , is always hand - picked by the person who will own the home .
It should be free of climbing vines , and be impressive in its overall appearance .
After the house is built , the spiritual leader of the village worships the spirits ( most of the indigenous minorities hold pantheistic beliefs ) and dedicates the spirit pole .
Indeed , before , during and after the construction , the spiritual leader will make no less than five visits to dedicate the pole and prepare the home for habitability .
In this spiritual sense , by the standards of most of the indigenous peoples here , the contractor - built home above is unfit for habitation .
And , in a practical , and psychological sense , the house fails yet again .
Practically , because if something needs fixing with the structure , the Ma Lieng are unable to do it for themselves , as it has been built wholly without their input or involvement , so they do not understand how to repair or rebuild it .
Psychologically , because receiving this ‘ gift ’ of a house is demeaning and removes the potential for skill - and self - respect - building guidance and instruction .
Working With the Ma Lieng – ‘ Teaching them to Fish ’
An alternative method , which is proving far more successful , is being implemented by PRI ’s sister organisation – SPERI ( Social Policy Ecology Research Institute ) .
SPERI had staff live in Ke Village for a total of five years ( one staff member was there for three years alone ) , so they could grow to understand their culture , their traditional methods of agriculture and handicrafts , and to develop a relationship with the people .
SPERI has also , with generous contributions from outside donors , been essentially providing housing for the inhabitants of Ke Village – but in this case the Ma Lieng are involved throughout the entire process .
The outcome is that the villagers work alongside skilled craftsmen , learning and gaining confidence as they build a place they really feel comfortable with – a place they can truly call ‘ home ’ .
A SPERI / Ma Lieng collaboration
A Ma Lieng original structure now becomes a house extension , next to the new home
The Ma Lieng are very pleased with the work of their own hands
SPERI is endeavouring to do a similar work with gardening and animal husbandry .
Teaching the Ma Lieng to farm sustainably around their new permanent homes is critical to their long term viability .
The ambition now is to establish a Farmers ’ Field School ( FFS ) , a smaller community - level version of the larger regional training site at HEPA , where the villagers can learn the theory and practice of Permaculture design principles .
In short , SPERI is working to bring solutions to the Ma Lieng people in a way that supplements their traditional knowledge , rather than supplanting it .
Instead of imposing rapid , thoughtless interventions ( that in effect say “ no – you ’re doing it wrong , here ’s how it should be done instead ” ) , this way of working means the Ma Lieng are less likely to totally discard their valuable accumulated knowledge , and as such can find value and self - respect in their own cultural identity – giving them the psychological armaments that will help them move forward in their new environment .
Like Na Sai , I look forward to visiting the Ma Lieng at Ke Village again , and having the time to get more first hand accounts of their lives .
For now , the glimmer of hope I saw in the words and eyes of some of the inhabitants is mirrored in my own mind , as I witness the work being done on the ground to help these people up onto their feet , so they can live their own lives with dignity , and in harmony with the resources and people around them .

EU erkennt das Wahlergebnis in Belarus nicht an !
По-русски / English / Italiano / Türkçe / Français / Spanish
Wir Weißruss * innen brauchen eure Hilfe .
Unser Handeln ist nicht länger von Angst geprägt , sondern von Hoffnung .
Update zur Situation : Weißrussland hat am 9 .
August gewählt .
Die offiziellen ersten Ergebnisse zeigen Lukashenko mit über 80 % aber in allen internationalen Wahllokalen bekam die Oppositionsführerin Svetlana Tikhanovskaya über 80 % der Stimmen .
Als Antwort zu den gefälschten Ergebnissen gingen letzte Nacht hunderttausende Weißruss * innen auf die Straße .
Über 3000 Menschen wurden festgenommen und eine Person wurde bei den Zusammenstößen mit der Polizei getötet .
Wir wollten lediglich faire Zählungen der Ergebnisse und stattdessen wird mit Gummigeschossen und Tränengas auf uns geschossen .
Lukashenko hat gestern das Internet im gesamten Land blockiert , damit wir uns nicht koordinieren und unsere Familienangehörigen kontaktieren können .
Wir wissen nicht , ob es denen gut geht .
Könnt ihr euch vorstellen , dass bei Wahlen in Deutschland die Kandidat * innen und ihre Familien festgenommen werden , lediglich weil sie sich für das Kanzleramt bewerben ?
Oder dass die Familien der Kandidat * innen heimlich ihre Kinder außer Landes bringen müssen , um nicht vom Geheimdienst geschnappt zu werden ?
Dass Massenverhaftungen von Passanten durch nicht gekennzeichnete Spezialeinheiten der Polizei durchgeführt werden ?
Der gegenwärtige Präsident ist seit 26 Jahren an der Macht .
Es ist ausgeschlossen , dass so viel Macht in den Händen einer einzelnen Person auf demokratischem Wege verbleiben kann .
Diese Macht basiert auf Angst , Korruption und ständigen Verhaftungen durch den Geheimdienst .
Allein seit Mai wurden hunderte Menschen bei friedlichen Kundgebungen für freie und faire Wahlen festgenommen , darunter Menschenrechtsaktivisten , Journalisten und Passanten .
In Weißrussland könnt ihr bereits für das Teilen dieser Petition verhaftet werden .
Es ist für uns nicht sicher die Stimme zu erheben .
Aber ihr seid vor dem aktuellen Regime ebenfalls nicht sicher , egal wo ihr lebt .
Ein Land , welches nicht mit anderen Ländern kooperiert , Atomkraftanlagen ohne richtige Genehmigungen baut , internationale Kriminelle versteckt und das als Puffer für kontroverse Geschäfte mit nicht - demokratischen Staaten dient , ist für euch alle gefährlich .
Aus diesem Grund sind die Wahlen so wichtig .
Doch wir benötigen dringend die Hilfe von Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel , um den internationalen Druck auf die weißrussischen Behörden zu erhöhen .
Fordere die Bundesregierung auf , offiziell die Ergebnisse der Wahl abzulehnen .
Fordern Sie die Freilassung der 3000 politischen Gefangenen ( inklusive der Präsidentschaftskandidaten und ihren Familien )
Mehr denn je haben hunderttausende von Weißruss * innen keine Angst davor , sich für eine Veränderung stark zu machen .
Journalisten , TV - Moderatoren und andere Personen des öffentlichen Lebens gehen im ganzen Land protestierend auf die Straßen .
Bitte unterschreibt , teilt und postet diese Petition .
Danke !
After years of acquiescence , the markets have started to ask whether the euro zone has the machinery to launch a Paulson - style rescue in a fast - moving crisis .
Who has the authority to take charge ?
The ECB is not allowed to bail out countries under EU treaty law .
The Stability Pact bans the sort of fiscal blitz that has kept America afloat .
Yes , treaties can be ignored .
But as we are learning , a banking system can implode in less time than it would take for EU ministers to congregate from the far corners of euroland .
October 6th , 2008 by D.Billy
From The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe , Vol. 1 , No. 11 , November 1983 :
On September 16 , 2008 , CIA Director and former Director of the NSA Michael V. Hayden came to speak to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council .
WeAreChangeLA decided to go and join the conversation .
Stewart Howe , taking the civil approach while referencing a speech Hayden gave to the CFR last year , asked the Director whether , in the post - 9/11 United States of America , we were , in fact , witnessing the controlled demolition of the Constitution and Bill of Rights under the guise of a War on Terror .
During Hayden ’s answer , Jeremy Rothe - Kushel , taking a disruptive approach , asked Hayden whether it was possible that a couple of Mossad agents could have been documenting ( and celebrating btw ) in the minutes after the 1st hit on the WTC , while Hayden and almost the entire military - intelligence command structure learned about it from CNN .
Really , this is their story .
Most , including Hayden , allegedly attributed the 1st attack to " pilot error . "
It is our duty as Americans to confront , with the power of truth spoken , those war criminals who are , under guise of a War on Terror , waging war on We the People and our Republic , and who have declared the entire planet to be their war - zone .
Only a truth , justice and peace revolution based on love will prevail .

It seems Glenn Beck has a solution for all that ails John McCain :
He wants McCain to take off the kid gloves and start calling out Obama and " all of these guys " as Marxists :
He 's bringing up these topics in the wrong way .
Not as a political strategist or a politician or anything else , just as a guy who says , OK :
The problem with all of these guys is they 're all Marxists -- they 're all Marxists .
They 're all spread the wealth .
So look , I 'm not going to tie you to these people any more than they have to , but -- but -- I mean , all the way from Frank Marshall Davis to your Reverend , they all preach Marxism .
Now , you say to Joe the Plumber , I 'm going to take some of your wealth and give it to somebody else , that 's Marxism .
Well , no that is n't Marxism , unless your understanding of it is at about fifth - grade level .
But that 's beside the point , is n't it ?
We 've already graduated from wingnuts calling Obama and the Democrats " socialists " to " Marxists . "
Next : " Pinkos " and " Commies . "
We 're not just living in Nixonland .
We 're living in McCarthyville .
I guess the next step in the devolution of the right is for the white hoods to come out .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
It is time for some straight talk about what America is being told about our financial institutions .
First : listen to the words or our most esteemed financial leaders .
In March of last year , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson delivered an upbeat assessment of the economy , saying growth was healthy and the housing market was nearing a turnaround .
" All the signs I look at " show " ' the housing market is at or near the bottom , " Paulson said in a speech to a business group in New York , adding that the U.S. economy is " very healthy " and " robust . "
At about the same time last March 2007 , Ben Bernanke , Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve , told Congress , " At this juncture , the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the sub - prime market seems likely to be contained . "
Then , in June of 2007 , Bernanke declared , " We will follow developments in the sub - prime market closely .
However , fundamental factors — including solid growth in incomes and relatively low mortgage rates — should ultimately support the demand for housing , and at this point , the troubles in the sub - prime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system . "
He followed that up in October of last year with this statement : " It is not the responsibility of the Federal Reserve — nor would it be appropriate — to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions .
But developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets , and the Federal Reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy . "
Just last March , 2008 , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson reassured us all with these words : " We ’ve got strong financial institutions ...
Our markets are the envy of the world .
They ’re resilient , they ’re ... innovative , they ’re flexible .
I think we move very quickly to address situations in this country , and , as I said , our financial institutions are strong . "
What is the truth ?
The truth is deception .
After reading the above quotes , it should be clear that politicians and government bureaucrats are lying to the public when they say that everything is all right .
They do not know .
Our economy and banking system is so complex and intertwined that no one knows where the next shoe will drop .
Therefore , it is in our best interest to cut through all the crap and examine the facts with a skeptical eye .
Last week , bank stocks , which had been falling fast , suddenly soared higher based on earnings reports that were horrific , but not catastrophic .
Talking heads were calling a bottom in the financial crisis .
The bank with the largest increase in share price was Wells Fargo .
Their earnings exceeded analyst expectations and the stock went up 22 % in one day .
Wells Fargo owns $ 84 billion of home equity loans , with half of those in the two leading foreclosure states , California and Florida .
Coincidently , Wells Fargo decided to extend its charge - off policy in the 2nd quarter from 120 days to 180 days in an effort to give troubled borrowers more time to reach a loan workout .
Or , did they reduce their write - offs for the 2nd quarter to beat analysts expectations .
Many people are still living in houses twelve months after making their last mortgage payment .
Their banks have not started foreclosure proceedings .
Is this due to incompetence by the banks , or is this a way to avoid writing off the loss ?
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) , the little - known national agency responsible for establishing standards of financial accounting and reporting , has seemingly joined the cover - up by delaying the implementation of new rules that would have made banks stop hiding toxic waste off their balance sheets .
New rules would have made banks put these questionable assets on their balance sheet and require a bigger capital cushion .
Is anyone surprised that bank regulators , the Treasury and Federal Reserve urged a delay in implementation of new FASB rules .
They can manipulate the facts because the average American does n’t understand or care .
Is an FDIC Bailout in Our Future ?
During the S&L crisis in the early 1990s , 1,500 banks failed .
So far , seven banks have failed in 2008 , the largest being IndyMac .
The FDIC has about $ 53 billion in funds to handle future bank failures .
The IndyMac failure is expected to use $ 4 to $ 8 billion of those funds .
Average Americans will lose $ 500 million in uninsured deposits in this failure .
The FDIC says that they have 90 banks on their " watch list . "
They do not reveal the banks on the list , so little old ladies with their life savings in local banks will be surprised when they go belly up .
Based on the fact that IndyMac was not on their " watch list . "
I would n’t put too much faith in their analysis .
Some 8,500 banks operate in the U.S. Based on an independent analysis by Chris Whalen from Institutional Risk Analytics , 8 percent of all banks , or around 700 banks have been identified as " troubled . "
This is quite a divergence from the FDIC estimate .
Should you believe a governmental agency that wants the public to remain in the dark to avoid bank runs , or an independent analysis based upon balance sheet analysis ?
The implications of 700 institutions failing are huge .
U.S. banks hold roughly $ 6.84 trillion in bank deposits .
Almost $ 2.6 trillion of these deposits are uninsured .
There is only $ 274 billion of the $ 6.84 trillion as cash on hand at banks .
This means that $ 6.5 trillion has been loaned to consumers , businesses , developers , etc .
The FDIC has $ 53 billion to cover $ 6.84 trillion of deposits .
Does that give you a warm feeling ?
Based on historical trends , some experts estimate that we are only in the early innings of bank write - offs .
The write - offs will at least equal the previous peaks reached in the early 1990s .
If several more large banks such as Washington Mutual or Wachovia were to fail , it might wipe out the FDIC fund .
If the FDIC fund is depleted , guess who will pay ?
Right again , another taxpayer bailout .
What is a Level 3 Asset ?
Other banks have been moving assets to Level 2 and Level 3 in order to put off the inevitable losses .
The definitions are as follows : Level 1 Assets that have observable market prices .
Level 2
Assets that do n’t have observable prices , but they have inputs that are based upon them .
Level 3
Assets are where one or more of the inputs do n’t have observable prices .
Their value relies on management estimates , often based on computer modeling .
In other words , the banks do their own " no doc " asset valuation .
Warren Buffet ’s view on the financial institution practice of valuing sub - prime assets on the basis of a computer model rather than the free market price states : " In one way , I 'm sympathetic to the institutional reluctance to face the music .
I 'd give a lot to mark my weight to ' model ' rather than to market . "
So , the managements of the banks that loaned money to people who could never pay them back are now responsible for estimating what these assets are worth .
According to analyst and commentator Bill Fleckenstein : " Recently , the portfolio of Cheyne Finance , one of the more infamous structured - investment vehicles , or SIVs , was sold at 44 cents on the dollar .
I suspect that similar assets are not marked anywhere near that valuation on financial institutions ' balance sheets .
So , the game of ‘ everything 's contained ’ continues , albeit in a different form . "
The mountain of Level 3 assets clogging up America ’s economic arteries is massive .
Next Shoes to Drop — How High Will the Losses Go ?
Banks and security firms have reported $ 468 billion of losses thus far .
Bridgewater Associates , a well respected analytical firm , believes things will get much worse .
According to Bridgewater , the models used have grossly underestimated the actual losses .
They doubt the financial institutions will be able to generate enough capital to cover the losses .
According to the report : " Lenders would have to curtail loans by roughly 10 - to - one to preserve their capital ratios .
This would imply a further contraction of credit by up to $ 12 trillion worldwide unless banks could raise fresh capital . "
Not all of these losses are in the sub - prime market .
According to the report , more than 90 % of the losses from sub - prime loans have already been written off .
Unfortunately , the losses from the prime and Alt - A loans , that is loans based primarily on high credit scores , could be much larger than we have already seen .
The sizes of these shaky loan portfolios are much larger than the sub - prime portfolios .
Further , Bridgewater expects about $ 500 billion in corporate losses that must be written off .
This leads to the current estimates of keen - eyed experts such as Bill Gross , the well respected manager of the world ’s largest bond fund , who expects financial firms to write down $ 1 trillion .
Gross predicted , " About 25 million U.S. homes are at risk of negative equity , which could lead to more foreclosures and a further drop in prices .
The problem with writing off $ 1 trillion from the finance industry 's cumulative balance sheet is that if not matched by capital raising , it necessitates a sale of assets , a reduction in lending or both that in turn begins to affect economic growth . "
NYU economist Nouriel Roubini believes that losses could reach $ 2 trillion .
The other shoes have begun to drop .
Last week Amex reported a 40 % decline in earnings as their wealthy super - prime customers are not paying their bills .
So , even the well off are struggling .
CB Richard Ellis , the largest commercial real estate broker in the country has reported an 88 % decline in earnings .
So , commercial real estate is imploding .
Bennigans and Mervyn ’s filed for bankruptcy this week .
The consumer is being forced to cut back on eating out and shopping .
The marginal players will fall by the wayside .
Big box retailers , restaurants , mall developers , and commercial developers are about to find out that their massive expansion was built upon false assumptions , a foundation of sand , and driven by excessive debt .
The U.S. banking system is essentially insolvent .
The Treasury , Federal Reserve , FASB , and Congress are colluding to keep the American public in the dark for as long as possible .
They are trying to buy time and prop up these banks so they can convince enough fools to give them more capital .
They will continue to write off debt for many quarters to come .
We could have a zombie banking system for a decade .

It does not necessarily represent the views of his employer , and is not sponsored or endorsed by them .
If we do n’t own our minds , we ’re like pawns in a game where we ’re not the player .
We ’re being played .
Corporations , governments , advertisers and even religions ( oops , I said it ) have gone to great lengths to control your mind .
Sometimes their tactics are obvious , but most of the time they are downright sneaky .
If we want to ensure that we ’re living for ourselves and not serving some corporation ’s agenda , we have to put on our mental armor .
We have to arm our minds so we can first know when their is an assault on our sovereignty .
Here are 10 tools you can use to avoid brainwashing and retain the ownership of your mind :
1. Decrypt media spin .
The media uses many different tools and angles to sensationalize things that are n’t inherently sensational .
“ Experts generally agree ” can mean a community college professor and “ recent surveys find ” can mean the polling of 10 people .
Be wary of any claims where the sources are n’t explicitly stated .
( See this article for understanding media spin . )
2. Break through the hype .
Have you ever noticed that the most genuinely talented people do n’t feel the need to convince you of their ability ?
If something is authentically awesome , it advertises itself .
All hype is n’t necessarily bad , but having some man scream at you about the amazing cleaning power of OxyClean is most likely an attempt to scare you into believing something .
3 . Do n’t buy into scare tactics .
This approach is most popular among the military .
This is for an obvious reason : to make you conform and adhere to the purpose of the larger whole .
On one hand , I understand why they have to do what they do .
But on the other , I am wary of any group the discourages questioning the command .
If you do n’t think the purpose of your troop ’s mission ethical , sorry , you do n’t get an opinion .
If you do n’t agree with the chain of command , too bad .
Sometimes we think there is no other choice but to follow the leader with our heads down .
But if we just look a little further , there ’s usually another way we did n’t see before .
4. Survey says .
Surveys and statistics are often skewed to support the agenda of the presenter .
Just because a survey says something , does n’t mean you have to believe it .
Even if it ’s from a reputable source , keep in mind that everyone has an agenda .
Even Green Peace .
Even Obama .
Even your mom .
5 . Be conscious of subliminal messages .
Advertisers have cleverly discovered that they can sell you something much easier if it ’s associated with a certain lifestyle .
A Mercedes equals luxury and high class ; a Jeep means you ’re rugged and adventurous .
Cut through the BS .
You define the way you live ; your lifestyle does n’t define you .
6 . Do n’t be a sheep .
The word “ authority ” derives from the word author , which simply means the one who originated the idea .
It does n’t mean they are right , or that they are the end of the line .
Get as many different opinions as possible before making a decision and trust your common sense .
7 . Be certain , or circumvent .
Have you ever noticed that extremely enthusiastic people have an uncanny ability to sway others ?
Their unshakeable certainty lures others into follow them , simply because they do n’t have a strong opinion one way or the other .
If you do n’t know , do n’t let someone else ’s certainty force you to make a choice .
Do your own research and come to your own conclusion .
8. Listen to your gut .
Follow your gut / intuition .
If you think something ’s shady , chances are it is .
Your mind will usually want to prolong making a decision until it gets all the facts straight .
You ’ll usually find that after you ’ve sorted everything out your gut was right all along .
Save yourself some time and trust yourself .
9. Avoid groupthink .
Following the crowd is fine if you ’re making that choice consciously .
We ’ve all heard the saying “ if so and so told you to jump off a cliff , would you do it ? ” I always thought that that was the most idiotic question .
That does n’t prove anything .
That ’s just stupid .
And it ’s not what I ’m talking about here .
What I mean is following the group because you ’re afraid of standing out .
You ’re afraid of being seen , being heard .
Because , geez , if you do that you might actually have to defend your opinion .
Do n’t be afraid to be different .
Ghandi was different .
Einstein was different .
People used to think they were crazy , radical and had possible birth defects ( just kidding ) .
Now they are considered geniuses .
10 .
Do n’t be a trend - junkie .
“ Newly reformulated ” shaving cream is often just a newly reformulated packaging design .
If you have to buy a new version of your camera , phone , or iPod every 6 months , are you buying it , or is it buying you ?
Do you really own your things , or do they own you ?

A reporter covering the Palin event went to talk to Obama supporters who were asked to leave .
Joe was near a second group of protestors who got tossed .
And he got some push back for investigating as well .
Here is the story from the reporters at the Palin Rally from the News - Record :
After the rally wound down , he went to find some Obama folks and see if he could talk to who got put out .
That ’s when at least one guy from the crowd decided he needed to interject his opinion into the conversation .
As Joe tells it :
I sidled up to one of the Obama supporters and asked why they were there , what they were trying to accomplish .
As he was telling me a large , bearded man in full McCain - Palin campaign regalia got in his face to yell at him .
“ Hey , hey , ” I said .
“ I ’m trying to interview him .
Just a minute , okay ? ”
The man began to say something about how of course I was interviewing the Obama people when suddenly , from behind us , the sound of a pro-Obama rap song came blaring out of the windows of a dorm building .
We all turned our heads to see Obama signs in the windows .
This was met with curses , screams and chants of “ U.S.A ” by McCain - Palin folks who crowded under the windows trying to drown it out and yell at the person playing the stereo .
It was a moment of levity in an otherwise very tense situation and so I let out a gentle chuckle and shook my head .
“ Oh , you think that ‘s funny ?! ” the large bearded man said .
His face was turning red .
“ Yeah , that ‘s real funny … ” he said .
And then he kicked the back of leg , buckling my right knee and sending me sprawling onto the ground .
We ’re big boys and girls who put ourselves out there and part of the job is tacking flak from both sides .
Certainly I have heard complaints from Democrats about “ the media ” and have been accused of being too conservative .
But I have never had the sense that a Democrat was going to get physical in that kind of way .
Even though McCain and Palin have taken a kinder gentler tone in their speeches , there was still a real undercurrent of anger at the rallies I covered this week .
本日、キャズム会議こ と 「 第4 回 ネットと家電のキャズムを超えろ！会議 〜ヤフー×AQUOS 大手 Webサービスと家電の連携が生むもの、めざすもの〜」に参加してきました。
いつも通り、おもしろい内容だったのですが、会議のかなり後半にPoBoxやiPhoneの文字入力システムを作った増井俊之さんが特別ゲストとして登場したのにはびっくりしました。
しかも僕の隣の席に座っていました ( 笑 ) ちらっと隣を見ると、増井さんはEeePCとE-mobileを利用しており、あれ、Macじゃないのかと思った次第です。
キャズム会議の議事録自体は多くのblogで取り上げられると思うので、ここではキャズム会議での増井さんの発言を紹介したいと思います。そもそも、増井さんはキャズム会議の最後の最後で登場したので、そこまで多くの発言はしていないのですが、それでも切れ味抜群のいい意味で空気を読まない発言をしていました。以下の語録は、録音したわけではないので、正確ではないかもしれませんが、ニュアンスははずしてないと思います。
TVの横にPC置いてTVとPCつなげばいいよ TVとネットの連携を題目にし、Yahoo!、AQUOS関係者がいる前での最初の発言です。家ではTVの横にMac Miniを設置しているとのことで、TVなんかでネットの情報見るより、直接TVにPCつないでしまえばいいという発言。まぁ、しかし、これ確かにそうなんですよね。ネット好きが自分のやりたいことをテレビでやろうとするなら、この方法が一番てっとり早い。インターフェースはどうしますかというその後に続いた質問に対して「 Apple Remoteでだいたいできるし、どうしても出来ないことがあったらそのためのインターフェースを書いてしまえばいい」という発言も素敵でした。その後にただよった、「そりゃ、増井さんならいくらでも書けるだろうけどさ」という空気がたまりませんでした。
リモコンという呼び名をそろそろ止めませんか これは、TVとネットの連携の時に必ず話題になるリモコンでの入力が面倒だという話題が出たときの発言。増井さん曰く、「リモコンというものは機器をリモートでコントロールすることが前提となっている。そうではなくて、機器とは関係なく自分がやりたいことを実現するための最適なインターフェースが必要だ」というような趣旨のことをおっしゃっていました。これはインターフェースの専門家っぽい意見ですね。「リモコンという考え方だと機械の仕組みを熟知していないと操作ができない。本当は、機器ではなく、自分がやりことを簡単に行えるためのインターフェースを設計するべきだ」というような発言をしていました。
チャンネルを変えたときに、どうして変えたのかを入力させれば簡単にリコメンド機能は作れますよ。
「リコメンド機能とかは今の技術でも作れるんでしょうか？」という質問をされたときの回答です。つまり、人間がチャンネルを変えるという行為には番組がイヤ、つまらなかった、おもしろかったけど他にも見たい番組があった、面白かったが他に予定があったみたいな理由があり、その情報を取得すれば正確にリコメンド出来るということでした。これは確かになーっと感心しました。
As the pace of medical innovation slows to a crawl , how do drug companies stay in profit ?
By ' discovering ' new illnesses to fit existing products .
But , says Ben Goldacre , for most problems the cure will never be found in a pill
When you 've been working with bullshit for as long as I have , you start to spot recurring themes : quacks and the pharmaceutical industry use the exact same tricks to sell their pills , everybody loves a " science bit " - even if it 's wrong - and when people introduce pseudoscience into any explanation , it 's usually because there 's something else they 're trying desperately not to talk about .
But my favourite is this : alternative therapists , the media , and the drug industry all conspire to sell us reductionist , bio-medical explanations for problems that might more sensibly and constructively be thought of as social , political , or personal .
And this medicalisation of everyday life is n't done to us ; in fact , we eat it up .
In 2007 the British Medical Journal published a large , well - conducted , randomised controlled trial , performed at lots of different locations , run by publicly funded scientists , that delivered a strikingly positive result : it showed that one treatment could significantly improve children 's antisocial behaviour .
The treatment was entirely safe , and the study was even accompanied by a very compelling cost - effectiveness analysis .
Did this story get reported as front - page news in the Daily Mail , natural home of miracle cures ( and sinister hidden scares ) ?
Was it followed up on the health pages , with an accompanying photo feature , describing one child 's miraculous recovery , and an interview with an attractive happy mother with whom we could all identify ?
No .
This story was unanimously ignored by the entire British news media , despite their preoccupation with antisocial behaviour , school performance and miracle cures , for one very simple reason : the research was not about a pill .
It was about a cheap , practical parenting programme .
Meanwhile , for over five years now , newspapers and television stations have tried to persuade us , with " science " , that fish - oil pills have been proven to improve children 's school performance , IQ , behaviour , attention , and more .
As I have documented with almost farcical repetitiveness in this paper , these
so - called " fish - oil trials " were so badly designed that they amounted to little more than a sham .
In the case of the biggest , " the Durham trial " , the county council has refused even to release the results , which I have every reason to believe were unflattering .
I 'm not desperately interested in whether fish - oil capsules improve children 's IQ , and I say this for a number of reasons .
Firstly , I 'm not a consumer journalist , or a lifestyle guru , and I am not in the business of handing out " readers ' health advice " .
Also , if you think about it rationally , any beneficial effects of fish oil on school performance will probably not be all that dramatic .
We do not have an epidemic of thick vegetarians , and humans have shown themselves to be as versatile as their diets are diverse , from Alaska to the Sinai desert .
But I would n't start with molecules , or pills , as a solution to these kinds of problems .
The capsules Durham are promoting cost 80 p per child per day , while it spends only 65 p per child per day on school meals , so you might start there .
Or you might restrict junk - food advertising to children , as the government has recently done .
You might look at education and awareness about food and diet , as Jamie Oliver recently did very well , without recourse to dodgy pseudoscience or miracle pills .
But you might also step away from obsessing over food just for once and look at parenting skills , teacher recruitment and retention , orsocial exclusion , or classroom size , or social inequality and the widening income gap .
Or parenting programmes , as we said right at the beginning .
In fact , Durham 's GCSE results , where the " trial " was performed , improved far more in the year before the fish - oil pills were introduced , after a huge input of extra funding and , more importantly , extra effort from local teachers and the community .
But the media do n't report stories like that : because " pill solves complex social problem " , even if it 's not true , is a much better angle .
The fish - oil story is by no means unique : repeatedly , in a bid to sell pills , people sell a wider explanatory framework , and as George Orwell first noted , the true genius in advertising is to sell you the solution and the problem .
Pharmaceutical companies with serotonergic antidepressant drugs to sell have worked hard , in their direct - to - consumer advertisements and their lobbying , to push the " serotonin hypothesis " for depression - the idea that low serotonin causes low mood - even though the scientific evidence for this theory is growing thinner every year .
Meanwhile the nutrition supplements industry promotes dietary deficiencies as their treatable cause for low mood .
But this fish - oil story is also a classic example of a phenomenon more widely described as " medicalisation " , the expansion of the biomedical remit into domains where it may not be helpful or necessary .
In the past , commentators have portrayed this as something that doctors inflict on a passive and unsuspecting world , an expansion of the medical empire ; in reality , it seems that these reductionist biomedical stories can appeal to us all , because complex problems often have depressingly complex causes , and the solutions can be taxing and unsatisfactory .
In its most aggressive form , this process has been characterised as " disease - mongering " .
It can be seen throughout the world of quack cures - and being alive to it is like having the scales removed from your eyes - but to understand its relevance to the pharmaceutical industry , we need a quick primer in medical history .
Before 1935 doctors were basically useless .
We had insulin , morphine for pain relief - a drug with superficial charm , at least - and we could do operations fairly cleanly , although with huge doses of anaesthetics , because we had n't yet sorted out well - targeted muscle - relaxant drugs .
Then suddenly , between the 1930s and the 1970s , science poured out an almost constant stream of miracle cures .
Everything we associate with modern medicine happened in that time : antibiotics , dialysis , transplants , intensive - care units , heart surgery , every drug you 've ever heard of , and more .
For people who were ill , the difference was spectacular .
If you got TB in the 1920s you died , pale and emaciated , in the style of a romantic poet .
If you got TB in the 1970s , then in all likelihood you would live to a ripe old age .
You might have to take rifampicin and isoniazid for months on end - they 're not nice drugs , and the side - effects make your eyeballs and urine turn pink - but if all goes well you will live to see inventions unimaginable in your childhood .
Times have changed .
The pharmaceutical industry is in trouble : the golden age of medicine has creaked to a halt , the low - hanging fruit of medical research has all been harvested , and the industry is rapidly running out of new drugs .
Fifty " novel molecular entities " a year were registered in the 1990s , but now it 's down to 20 , and many of those are just copies of other companies ' products , changed only enough to justify a new patent .
So the story of " disease mongering " goes like this : because they cannot find new treatments for the diseases we already have , the pill companies have instead had to invent new diseases for the treatments they already have .
Recent favourites include social anxiety disorder ( a new use for SSRI antidepressant drugs ) , female sexual dysfunction ( a new use for Viagra in women ) , the widening diagnostic boundaries of " restless leg syndrome " , and of course " night eating syndrome " ( another attempt to sell SSRI medication , bordering on self - parody ) to name just a few : all problems , in a very real sense , but perhaps not necessarily the stuff of pills , and perhaps not all best viewed in reductionist biomedical terms .
In fact , you might consider that reframing intelligence , loss of libido , shyness and tiredness as medical pill problems is a crass , exploitative , and frankly disempowering act .
Selling us crude biomedical mechanisms may well enhance the placebo benefits from pills , but these stories are also seductive precisely because of what they edit out .
In the media coverage around the rebranding of Viagra as a treatment for women in the early noughties , and the invention of female sexual dysfunction , for example , it was n't just the tablets that were being sold : it was the explanation .
Glossy magazines told stories about couples with relationship problems who went to their GP , and the GP did n't understand their problem ( the first paragraph of any medical story in the media ) .
Then they went to the specialist , and he did n't help either .
But then they went to a private clinic .
Here they did blood tests - hormone profiles , esoteric imaging studies of clitoral bloodflow - and then they understood .
The solution was in a pill , but that was only half the story , and the diagnosis was almost more important : she had a mechanical problem Rarely was there a mention of any other factors , that she was feeling tired from overwork , that he was exhausted from being a new father , or finding it hard to come to terms with the fact that his wife was now the milky mother of his children , and no longer the nubile sex vixen he first snogged on the floor of the student union building to the sound of Do n't You Want Me? by the Human League in 1983 .
This is because we do n't want to talk about these issues , any more than we want to talk about social inequality , the disintegration of local communities , the breakdown of the family , the impact of employment uncertainty , changing expectations and notions of personhood , or any of the other complex , difficult factors that play into the apparent rise of antisocial behaviour in schools .
This wishful deafness to the clamour of reality reaches its purest form in our newfound obsession with food , as if it was the most important lifestyle risk factor for ill health , as if every technical detail should be devoured and acted on , for the promise of eternal zest .
From the Daily Mail 's ongoing project to divide all the inanimate objects in the world into ones that either cause or cure cancer , to daytime television 's obsession with the healing power of this week 's magic berry , there is no end to this material .
Should you believe it ?
No .
I have demonstrated time and again how these claims are flawed in their own specific cases .
But something more interesting is being ignored in the background .
The World Health Organisation 's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health reported this week , and it contained some chilling figures .
Life expectancy in the poorest area of Glasgow - Calton - is 28 years less than in Lenzie , a middle - class area just eight miles away .
That is a lot less life , and it is n't just because the people in Lenzie are careful to eat goji berries for extra antioxidants , and a handful of brazil nuts every day , thus ensuring they 're not deficient in selenium , as per nutritionists ' advice .
People die at different rates because of a complex nexus of interlocking social and political issues including work life , employment status , social stability , family support , housing , smoking , drugs , and possibly diet , although the evidence on that , frankly , is pretty thin , and you certainly would n't start there .
But we do , because it 's such a delicious fantasy , because it 's commodifiable and pushed by expert PR agencies , and in some respects this is one of the most destructive features of the whole nutritionist project , graphically exemplified by figures such as Dr Gillian McKeith PhD .
Food has become a distraction from the real causes of ill health , and also , in some respects , a manifesto of rightwing individualism .
You are what you eat , and people die young because they deserve it .
You hear it from people as they walk past the local council estate and point at a mother feeding her child crisps : " Well , when you look at what they feed them , " they say , " it 's got to be diet , has n't it ? "
They choose death , through ignorance and laziness , but you choose life , fresh fish , olive oil , and that 's why you 're healthy .
You 're going to see 80 .
You deserve it .
Not like them .
Genuine public - health interventions to address the social and lifestyle causes of disease are far less lucrative , and far less of a spectacle , than anything a lifestyle magazine editor or television commissioner would dare to touch .
What prime - time TV show looks at food deserts created by giant supermarket chains , the very companies with which the stellar media nutritionists so often have their lucrative commercial contracts ?
What glossy magazine focuses on how social inequality drives health inequality ?
Where 's the human interest in prohibiting the promotion of bad foods , facilitating access to healthier foods by means of taxation , or maintaining a clear labelling system ?
There is no glamour in " enabling environments " that naturally promote exercise , or urban planning measures that prioritise cyclists , pedestrians and public transport over the car .
There are no votes , it seems , in reducing the ever - increasing inequality between senior executive and shop - floor pay .
When do you ever hear about elegant ideas like " walking school buses " ?
Somewhere near you , a softly spoken public - health official has probably tried to interest your local paper in a story on them ; presumably the latest urgent food - fad news left no space .
We love this stuff .
It is n't done to us , we invite it , and we buy it , because we want to live in a simple universe of rules with justice , easy answers and predictable consequences .
We want pills to solve complex social problems like school performance .
We want berries to stop us from dying and to delineate the difference between us and the lumpen peasants around us .
We want nice simple stories that make sense of the world .nd if you make us think about anything else more complicated , we will open our mouths , let out a bubble or two , and float off - bored and entirely unphased - to huddle at the other end of our shiny little fishbowl eating goji berries .

The academic skills of two students may be separated only by the width of a cigarette paper , so the two highest - ranked universities in the UK have turned to trying to discover whether applicants are capable of thinking outside of their own subject disciplines and can construct an argument out of thin air and native wit .
Some of those questions have now been released by Oxbridge Applications , an indepepent education consultancy which helps coach students in the application process .
How would you get on ?
Below are some of the questions apparently asked by the universities which should be answered in around 100 words .

info on cnc machine energy usage
for building a cnc look here for parts
order from Sony Creative Software Inc. through cnc machining blog for our special hookup
Here is an interview with Mark Summers president of President CNC Software at Mastercam , Mastercam stood out to me as one of the few manufacturing companies that made greening even an issue worth mentioning .
Even the smallest steps taken to minimize the damage done by industry is immensely important in these critical times off the bottom line .
With all the harm that manufacturing causes the earth and how much we rely on it to keep our world turning it seems more important then ever to bring our attention to this .
Society is held together by technology and manufacturing and it is companies like this who make an effort to preserve our earth so important in our rapidly changing times
What are the environmental efforts being made right now by the manufacturing industry as a whole ?
Mark : I do n’t know if there is enough information to summarize the efforts made by the manufacturing industry but my guess is that many businesses are at least thinking about these issues and many will act in the next few years in various ways .
Where does Mastercam stand in this context , how do you measure up or exceed expectations or current industry standards for greening .
Mark :
The expectations are vague and not official unless you ’re LEEDS certified so it ’s up to the decision makers in each company to decide what level of sustainability to integrate .
However I think we measure up pretty well in the green department .
We have made both small improvements and large improvements in the way we operate our facility and the way we use energy .
Small ideas include using dishes , glasses and ceramic coffee mugs instead of throw away items .
( We have six energy star dishwashers ) .
We compost all of our coffee grounds and food waste so as not to use fossil fuel to haul garbage around for no good reason .
In our recent building addition we made sure to use low V.O.C. paint and PVC free carpet to improve our indoor air quality .
We ’ve installed a fresh air heat exchanger so that we do n’t lose valuable heat when bringing in fresh air from outside .
All of the windows in the building open if occupants want fresh air when weather permits and a large amount of windows allow us to use more natural light rather than electric lights , which are energy efficient fluorescent lights .
All of the lumber in the addition was FSC ( Forest Stewardship Council ) certified .
All of our printing is done on 100 % recycled paper with environmental ink and over time we have been printing less and supplying more documents electronically .
Many of the employees work from home 2 or 3 days a week to reduce fuel usage .
Like most businesses the real opportunity to make a difference in energy usage is the way a building is heated and cooled .
Our 50,000 sq. ft. building is 100 % geothermal and does not have a backup system .
We have 46 wells that are 300 feet deep that extract either heat or cold out of the ground to heat or cool the building and make our hot water as well .
Since the only energy source we use is electricity we decided to install a 72 kw photovoltaic system to make some of our own .
The solar system is newly installed but it appears we are making about 30 % of the electricity that we use .
That portion of our electricity will cost the same for about 30 years which is the predicted life of the solar panels .
Do you think technology has the ability to make our society sustainable , what social and scientific steps do you feel are needed to make this happen .
Mark :
Yes , I think we have the technology to be 100 % sustainable but it will take time and large investments and a change in our living standards .
The laws of nature will eventually demand that we all become sustainable in our work and home life and making changes sooner rather than later will allow a smoother and less painful transition .
The social steps that need to happen are mostly financial to start with since cost seems to have a way of getting everyone ’s attention .
Keeping fuel prices high via taxes will keep the pressure on all of us to pay greater attention to the way we live .
Lobbying for low fuel costs to keep the economy going is short term thinking and just putting off the inevitable .
A small amount of pain now might avoid real problems in the future .
This theoretical fuel tax revenue could be used for tax credits and rebates to help fund more homes and businesses that invest in alternative energy .
If the U.S. government can find a way to spend over half a trillion dollars to fight a war we can surely find the same amount of money to invest in more clean energy ideas that could actually avoid a war .
You were a “ green ” company before “ green ” really existed .
What is the history of your company ’s progress with its environmental efforts ?
Mark :
We have always tried to pay attention to our energy and material usage .
My depression era parents might have had some influence in this area .
We built our first building in 1989 about five miles from our current building and incorporated a geothermal system and passive solar system .
Oil deliveries and burning oil in a furnace never really made much sense to me .
Are you noticing any other manufacturing companies going green or being socially responsible ?
If not , why do you think this is and what would it take to change this trend .
Mark : I know of one local shop that is environmentally aware and is in the process of installing a 32kw photovoltaic system to make some of their electricity .
The Connecticut Clean Energy
Fund offers a generous rebate for this type of system and I am certain that other shops are acting .
Some businesses are motivated to save money and some are motivated to save the environment .
Either way works .
What is your view on the peak oil crisis and how it will and has affected industry and manufacturing ?
The peak oil crisis and high energy cost spike was a much needed wake up call for all of us .
Hopefully the recent drop in oil prices wo n’t allow us to forget that we need to pay attention and make some changes .
I think most people realize that was just a little taste of what ’s coming and we need to be ready when cheap energy is no longer available .
There are many ways to “ be ready ” .
Take advantage of the energy incentive programs that are available right now .
Hire an energy company to audit your operation and then act on at least some of the advice .
Use less energy and make some of your own .
Almost any business can afford a few solar panels and encourage recycling and shutting the lights off .
Do something and then tell people about it , in that order .
Are there any new greening initiatives at your company , underway or being discussed ?
We ’re not obsessed with green ideas since we still need to spend most of our time operating the business so it stay healthy but we do talk about energy and environmental ideas regularly .
Lately we have been monitoring many of our electronic devices to see how much power they used when turned “ off ” .
You might be surprised to learn that many of these devices such as computers , printers , fax machines , cable boxes , dvd players etc. steal your power all the time .
A $ 25 Kill A Watt meter will help you uncover these electric injustices and will surely pay for itself in short order provided you act on your findings .
Another current project is to add more computerized controls to our HVAC system to make sure it runs only when necessary .
For example , many people forget to adjust the heat or AC when they leave at night or the weekends .
A computer can make that adjustment easily and with more consistency than a human and save lots of energy in the process .
In other words , an efficient system that is n’t controlled properly is n’t really that efficient .
How does the lax environmental regulations in China and India fit into the global environmental solution .
( this question is intentionally open ended , anything interesting you have to say on this , would be good )
Well , we all live in the same world and the responsibility level of other countries affects us all .
My opinion is that the countries that care about the goal of sustainability and environmental responsibility should first offer technical and financial help to the countries that need it if they can .
If the offending countries ignore sincere help then the heat should be turned up and we should reduce or avoid doing business with countries that do n’t toe the line .
Countries are just a collection of people and policies and sometimes a repercussion needs to be felt before action takes place .
When my kids leave the lights on in their room I take the bulbs out of the offending light to send a small message .
A country might need a larger message in a similar fashion .
What new and exciting things are happening right now over at Mastercam ?
We are continuously working on new ideas for our CAD CAM product called Mastercam as we have been for 25 years and this year has proven to be successful as well .
Our cautious but constant growth allows us to serve our customers as they expect now and in the foreseeable future and we will continue our ever present goal of reaching sustainability .

As many of our readers may have noticed we went down for over an hour on Saturday , but in all my years of hosting this is the first time I ’ve seen such a large outage caused by the domain registrar failing .
Apparently , a number of Register.com ’s partner name servers went down ( although Register.com itself stayed up ) .
This affected not only my accounts and web servers , but the partner ’s main websites themselves .
In other words , I could n’t even visit the affected registrar ’s website for support information or to open a ticket .
Luckily , I found the company ’s phone number buried in Google ’s cache .
Upon waiting 25 minutes on the phone , I finally spoke to an operator who informed me they were ‘ aware of the problem ’ and gave me to a few alternative links to use to access my account information , none of which worked .
I ’m not sure what happened today but I can only imagine the number of websites that must have been affected if an entire group of registrar ’s were offline .
The PlayStation Network version of Bionic Commando : Rearmed will support Remote Play and rumble , producer Ben Judd has confirmed , with more surprises to come .
Judd , writing on the US PlayStation Blog , said Remote Play had been tricky to implement in Capcom 's upcoming side - scrolling downloadable title .
" This one was n't as easy [ as DualShock 3 support ] to add and , matter of fact , there is one point where we had to ' creatively ' reprogram the controls to give players the illusion of using two sticks ( you 'll know when you see it ) , " he explained .
" The classic 2D side - scrolling graphics really fit with the PSP and just make the PSN version all the more cooler . "
Remote Play allows PS3 owners to play certain games and do multimedia things on the PSP remotely .
On the subject of rumble support , Judd said , " we all know that games that vibrate are better and besides ... there really is no reason not to implement a feature that has become the industry standard . "
Not content with all that , the Capcom man hinted at more treats for people who buy the PSN version of Bionic Commando : Rearmed , promising " one more very cool surprise for those of you who purchase the PSN version " but refusing to elaborate for now .
Elsewhere in the post - the first in a series running up to the game 's launch - Judd discussed female chopper pilot Haley and the Hagle Breaker Assault Shotgun .
He also spoke about the game 's Medals system .
There are 12 to collect , apparently , so presumably it 's analogous to the Xbox 360 version 's 12 Xbox Live Arcade Achievements .
There 's no discussion of Trophy support , however .
Bionic Commando : Rearmed is a retooled version of the classic 2D NES platform - shooter , which is due out soon to pave the way for Capcom 's upcoming 3D re-imagining of the game .
It 's also in development for 360 and PC .
Adet Söktürücü İlaçlar Bebek Düşürür Mü
Adet Söktürücü İlaç Gebeliği Sonlandırır mı ?
Emziren Anne Adet Söktürücü Kullanabilir mi ?
sorusu çok ciddi bir sorudur .
Adet söktürücüler 'i bu amaçla kullanmak son derece yanlış bir uygulamadır .
Bilinçsiz bir şekilde kullanılmış ise de sonuçları çok ağır ödenmektedir .
Adet söktürücü dediğimiz ilaçlar aslında tamamen hormon içerikli ilaçlar olup kadınların adet kanaması olamadığı dönemlerde , adet kanamasının olmasını sağlamaktadır .
Kadınlar pek çok sebebe bağlı olarak adet kanaması olamayabilirler .
Bunlardan en önemlileri , hormon bozukluğu , menopoza girme , kist , miyom gibi rahim içi hastal ıklar yaşamalarıdır .
Adet kanaması bu tür hastal ıklarda ya erken gelir yada geç gelerek kadınlarda bir çok sıkınt ıya neden olur .
Adet kanamasını gerçekle ştiren şey aslında vücuttaki hormonlardır .
Ökstrojen hormonu ve progesteron hormonunun baş rol oynadığı adet döngüsünün ilk yar ısında ökstrojen hormonu yüksektir .
Progesteron hormonunun ise yükselerek istenilen seviyeye gelmesi sonucunda düşmesi adet kanamasının gerçekle şmesini sağlar .
Adet söktürücü ilaçlar ise progesteron hormonu içerikli ilaçlar olup vücutta eksik yada yeterli seviyede olması sonucunda bu ilaçlar ile alınan hormon takviyesi ile adet kanamasının gelmesi sağlanır .
Mutlaka bu tür ilaçlar doktor kontrolünde alınmalı ve hangi sebeple bu bozukluk yaşan ıyor bilinmelidir .
Doktorunuz gerek görür ise bu tür ilaçlar alınmalıdır .
Ayrıca gebe kalma riski olan tüm kadınların adet söktürücü ilaç kullanmadan önce gebelik testi yaptırması gereklidir .
Bazı adet söktürücü diye bildiğimiz ilaçlar hormon takviyesi ile bebe ğin rahim duvarına tutunmasını sağlasa da bu tür ilaçların doktor kontrolünde alınması gereklidir .
Her adet söktürücü ilaç da birbiri ile aynı özellikte değildir ve bebek için son derece zararlıdır .
Adet söktürücü ilaçlar ve isimleri size bu konuda çok detaylı bilgi verecektir .
Hamile olduğunu bilmeden içilen bu tür ilaçlar bebeğin sağlığı açısından çok zararlıdır .
Bu ilaçlar bebeğin düşmesine neden olmasa bile bebeklerde zeka geriliği ve özürlülük durumu yaratmaktadır .
Bir anne için bebeğinin sağlıklı olarak doğması her şeyden önemlidir .
Bebek birden bire yoğun bir hormon alır ve sağlığı bozulur .
Bazı gebeliklerde zeka geriliğinden ve sağlığının bozulmasından dolayı düşüklerde yaşanmaktadır .
Bu sebeple bir kadının eğer hamile kalma riski var ise mutlaka gebelik testi yaptırarak bu tür ilaçları kullanması gereklidir .
Fark etmeden ve test yaptırmadan kullanılan bu tür ilaçlar gebeliğin anlaşılması ile hemen bırakılmalıdır .
Bazı kadınlarda ilaç kullanılsa da adet kanaması gelmez ve doktor tarafından gebelik testi yapılır ve kadının gebe olduğu ortaya çıkar .
Gebelik durumunda hangi ilacı ne sıklıkla ve ne kadar ald ığınızı doktorunuza söyleyiniz .
Doktorunuz bebek için tehlikeli olup olmadığını anlayacaktır .
Gerekli görülür ise bebeğe test yaptır ılarak olumsuz bir sonuç var mı bakılmaktadır .
Maalesef bazı gebeliklerde bebeğin sağlığının bu ilaçlar tarafından bozulması neticesinde , anne istemeden de olsa bebeğini aldırmak zorunda kalabilir .
Bu tür bir üzücü durumla karşılaşmamak adına mutlaka her hamilelik riski taş ıyan kadının mutlaka bu tür hormon içerikli ilaç kullanmadan gebelik testi yaptırması gereklidir .
Mutlaka adet söktürücü ilaçlar doktor kontrolünde alınmalıdır .
Adet söktürücü kullanılmasını gerektiren hastal ıklar çok detaylı anlatılmıştır .
Anne ve çocuk hakkında da aradığınız bir çok konuda bilgi bulabilirsiniz .
Sadece hamilelikte değil emzirme döneminde de kullan ılan adet söktürücü ilaçlar süt ile bebeğe geçmektedir .
Bebekte çok ciddi sağlık sorunlarına neden olduğu için kesinlikle emzirme döneminde bu ilaçların kullanılması önerilmez .
Annenin her yediği bebe ğin etkiler .
Anne yeşilliği bir miktar fazla yese bebe ğin kakası bile yeşil renklerde olur .
Annenin yediği her şey anne sütüne geçmektedir .
Bu sebeple bu yoğun kadınlık hormonu içeren ilaçlarda bebeğe sür ile geçmektedir .
Bebekte ciddi sağlık sorunları yaşanmasına ve özellikle cinsiyet sorunu yaşanmasına neden olur .
Hiç bir anne bu tür bir olumsuzluk yaşanmasını istemeyeceği için bu tür ilaçları ne hamileyken nede emzirirken kullanmamalıdır .
Wind in the Willows became an instant hit when it was published A competition to write a modern Wind in the Willows has been launched to mark the 100th anniversary of Kenneth Grahame 's classic book .
Grahame 's riverbank tale of Toad , Mole , Ratty and Badger became a huge hit when it was published on 8 October 1908 .
A museum in Oxfordshire wants to see how the characters would cope with 21st century living .
Paul Mainds , of Henley 's River & Rowing Museum said , it was a chance for Wind in The Willows fans to get creative .
" The Wind in the Willows is one of the great treasures of children 's fiction , " he said .
" Kenneth Grahame knew all about the power of the river on the imagination , and on our real lives .
WIND IN THE WILLOWS IN 2008 ?
Will Ratty have to look for love online as the number of water voles in the UK continues to fall ?
Will Toad
Hall get repossessed as the credit crunch bites ?
Toad 's natural habitats are in decline Will Badger get an ASBO for spreading Bovine TB ?
" This competition gives authors the opportunity to re-animate these themes and make them more relevant for today 's young readers , especially in light of the environmental issues that now effect our rivers and the wildlife that lives in and around them . "
Meanwhile , a new exhibition at the Bank of England museum will chart the the non-literary career of Grahame .
Visitors to the exhibition will be able to see his hand - written letter of resignation for the first time , along with other letters , notes and pictures relating to his 30 - year employment at the bank .
The Wind in the Willows was published just months after Grahame left the bank , blaming ill - health and mental pressures for the decision .
Grahame 's resignation letter will be displayed at the Bank of England In his resignation letter , written on 15 June 1908 , he said the " constant strain " of the post meant he was " very anxious " and feared " further deterioration of brain and nerve " .
Other letters and exhibits in the new display , which will open at the museum in London on Wednesday , refer to an incident in 1903 when a gunman entered the bank and fired shots at Grahame .
Museum curator John Keyworth said Grahame was a very shy , intelligent man .
He said : " Grahame 's bank career is little - known , but it is very likely that his 30 - year career had some influence on his writing ; either the direct influence of colleagues on the famous characters he created or the atmosphere of life at the grand old institution imbuing his work . "

What are these ?
A pioneering Chinese company is to market pasteurised Tibetan yak milk in Beijing , Shanghai and Guangzhou , in the hope that it will become a new superfood in the world 's most populous country .
At 24 yuan ( £ 2 ) for a small 250 ml carton , Feifan - meaning ' uncommonly good ' - costs several times as much as cow 's milk .
' It 's very natural , green , pure and high - quality .
That 's our big selling point - we aim at the high - end market , ' said Ding Pengcheng of the Treasure of the Plateau Yak Milk Company .
Over the next three years , the firm is to spend millions to crack the domestic and international markets , with the help of state investment .
Yaks produce fewer than 300 litres of milk a year , while cows yield 35 times as much .
The firm pays Tibetan farmers 16 yuan or more per litre ; eight times the price of standard milk .
The China Nutrition Society , a Ministry of Health - backed research institute , claims the amino acids , calcium , and vitamin A in yak milk are considerably higher than in cow 's milk .
Its appeal depends as much on the mystique of its origins as its nutritional qualities .
Feifan is undergoing extra safety checks because of China 's recent milk contamination scandal .
Yet in the long run such concerns could boost the desire for products that combine modern hygiene with unsullied , back - to - the - land imagery .
Tsering Droma is a typical Tibetan herder who can now look forward to tapping the Chinese market .
Born into a herding family , she tends 30 yaks on steep slopes near the Karola pass .
The animals are central to Tibetan culture : their butter is melted into tea and fuels the lamps that light monasteries .
Dung keeps fires burning ; bones are carved into beads .
Yaks provide Droma and her family with everything they need .
' Female yaks are very important to us : we can get milk , make butter and cheese and get extra money by selling it .
For the males , they can be used for transport , ' she said .
' We can sell the yak skins and the meat and hair .
All the parts can be sold .
Then we buy things like grain . '
But 100 miles away in Lhasa , the Treasure of the Plateau company is transforming this hand - to - mouth livelihood into a serious business .
It is marketing the traditional staple as a superfood for aspirational middle - class households across China and beyond .
Steam seeps from the pipes of its Tetrapak production line as it heats gallon after gallon of milk to 130C .
In 2003 , the firm sold just over 2 m yuans worth of goods ; this year it is on course to bring in up to 90 m yuan .
Each day the local market consumes between three and six tonnes of its yoghurt .
The company 's first batches of milk arrived in bowls , carried on herders ' backs , and often with the unwelcome additions of insects and yak hair .
Now they come in clean containers , usually delivered by motorbike or car - proof , says the company , that it is raising local incomes .
That does not make it immune from controversy surrounding economic development .
Its expansion into markets around China would be all but impossible without the Tibet - Qinghai rail line , which critics say has damaged the environment and speeded the erosion of Tibetan culture .
Seventy per cent of the firm 's 110 staff are Tibetan , but only a few are in senior posts .
' Our company carries out a lot of training for our Tibetan staff , but most of them do n't have higher , college - level education , ' Ding said .
At the least , the company , and the government money behind it , are supporting long - impoverished herders .
The authorities have been heavily criticised for forcibly settling nomads .
But this state investment is helping some to increase their incomes without having to abandon their heritage .
It is what officials call ' development with Tibetan characteristics ' .
And yaks are as Tibetan as they come .
Tactic : Dress a small band of Alaskan National Guard troops in Russian military attire and stage an invasion of the Alaskan border , sending the rest of Alaskan National Guard troops , on Palin 's orders , to successfully capture or kill the " Russian invaders . "
Strategy : Ends questions about Palin 's national security credentials .
----
Tactic :
In addition to claiming McCain invented the Blackberry , assert that he also invented the wheel , sliced bread , fire , the missionary position , whiskey , apple pie , sliders , cleavage , Beanie Babies , oxygen , blow jobs , sunlight , bikinis , pasteurization , nuggies , the handshake , ice cream , poll dancing , Penicillin , the wave , hot dogs , the Theory of Relativity , beer nuts , New Journalism , indoor plumbing , low - rise jeans , Method Acting , rap , Twister , funnel cake , the printing press , soft pretzels , the phrase " dude , " the color blue , moving pictures , " bringing sexy back , " nougat , and baseball .
Strategy : Highlights McCain 's superior record of accomplishment .
Bonus : no time left in the campaign season for media to fact - check effectively .
----
Tactic : Sarah Palin " accidentally " shoots First Dude in the face during moose - hunting expedition .
Strategy : Secures Cheney base .
----
Tactic : Outdoing David Blaine 's most recent stunt of hanging upside - down for 60 hours , Palin hangs upside down for the remainder of election season .
Strategy : Ca n't speak to reporters -- or " gotcha " - seeking voters -- with all that blood rushing to your head .
Dangerous ?
You bet .
But a win - win for us :
If she makes it , she 's a hero and successfully nips all press questions in the bud .
If she does n't , McCain makes her an American martyr : " Sarah Palin could 've asked her aides to bring her down at anytime , but for the sake of her country she refused to let her feet ever touch the ground .
A shining example of patriotism and selflessness for generations of Americans to come . "
He will then put Romney on ticket with no time for media to fully vet him .
----
Tactic : Potential " October Surprise " : McCain fakes own death days before the election , only to rise court - side like a phoenix ( or Jesus ) at an actual Phoenix Suns basketball game later that night .
Strategy : Leverages McCain's " Comeback Kid " campaign season persona , exemplifies " Country First " slogan ( surmounting even death to serve country in time of need ) , and locks up evangelical vote .
----
Tactic : Build an actual " Bridge to Nowhere " out of cookie dough .
Strategy : Americans love cookie dough .
( Internal polls also reveal Americans do n't mind earmarks when they are delicious . )
----
Tactic :
If reporter brings up the Keating Five , McCain says , " I love Dave Brubeck . "
If reporter replies , " Dave Brubeck ? " McCain responds , " Are you saying you do n't like Jazz ?
Jazz was created in America .
Why do you hate America ? "
Strategy : Internal polls show most Americans think the Keating Five was a successful late ' 50s / early '60s jazz band .
----
Tactic :
Whenever McCain or Palin wants to avoid answering a question , they respond by saying " Lorna Doone . "
Strategy :
This answer will throw reporters off - balance and cause them to switch topic .
Example :
REPORTER : How can you claim to run on change when you voted with President Bush 90 % of the time ?
MCCAIN : Lorna Doone .
REPORTER : I 'm sorry ?
MCCAIN : Lorna Doone .
REPORTER : I 'm not sure what you 're referring to , Senator .
Is n't that a brand of cookie ?
MCCAIN : That 's correct .
REPORTER :
So what does that have to do with this question ?
MCCAIN : Lorna Doone .
REPORTER : OK , Senator , let 's move on .
[ See recent Meet the Press with Tom Brokaw to witness approximate efficacy of such a technique . ]
----
Tactic : Promise every American a free rape kit .
Strategy : Obscures evidence that Palin , as Mayor of Wasilla , charged rape victims for their own kits .
Plus , Americans love free shit .
----
Tactic : Create first " Co- Vice Presidency " in which Dick Cheney shares Vice Presidential duties with Palin .
Strategy : Nullifies fears of Palin 's inexperience .
Cheney will be there to guide her hand in furthering Bush administration policies while simultaneously helping to push through Palin initiatives such as book banning , ensuring a second Cold War with Russia , mandatory arm bands , and appointing her BFF from high school for Secretary of the Interior because " as a bona fide pet lover , she has two cats , a dog and three hamsters . "
----
Tactic : Change date of Election Day from Nov. 4 to Nov. 27 , Thanksgiving Day .
Strategy : Turkey consumption releases tryptophan .
Tryptophan induces drowsiness .
Drowsiness will deter millions of Americans from dislodging themselves from their couches to vote .
( Internal polls show majority will get as far as undoing top button of jeans before passing out . )
----
Tactic : McCain wears sunglasses round - the - clock .
Strategy : Lends him a younger , rock star ( think Bono ) vibe while also masking that blinky " helter skelter " eye .
----
Tactic : Another potential " October Surprise " -- McCain reveals he 's traced a call pinpointing Bin Laden 's whereabouts , telling Americans in a live national address , " My friends , it 's coming from inside your home .
Get out of the house !
I repeat , get out of the house ! "
Strategy : More Americans abandon their homes , leaving them ineligible to vote in November .
----
Tactic : Palin speaks only in tongues for remainder of campaign season .
Strategy : Could n't be worse than what she 's said in English .
----
Tactic : More Fembots ( aka " Pfotenhauers " ) .
Strategy :
In a one - on - one debate with Obama advisers or surrogates , internal polls show McCain senior adviser Nancy Pfotenhauer causes heterosexual men to lose focus of the topic 87 % of the time and women , bi-curious or gay , 84 % of the time .
----
Tactic : Officially hire Bill Clinton as a McCain / Palin surrogate .
Strategy :
He 's more effective than most of our own people .
----
Tactic :
In next presidential debate , direct McCain to preface each comment with , " In my day , we did n't have [ fill in the blank ] .
Strategy : According to internal polls , McCain is not coming off as crotchety , narrow - minded and out of touch enough to satisfy the over 80 crowd .

The Wounded - Courier is the satirical news division of MediaBloodhound .
It appears the Illinois GOP ( ICFST ) is concerned that they might be LaRouched .
For those that do n’t recall , the Illinois Democratic Party slated two guys with ethnic names in the 1986 election and two LaRouche candidates with names like Fairfield and Hart .
Fairfield and Hart won and so Adlai Stevenson formed a third party ticket to compete leaving the loons to themselves .
So now they have the inexperienced Steve Sauerberg running against two loons who they are terrified might win !
Sauerberg is a doctrinaire conservative Republican and family doctor .
Nothing exciting and he has all of $ 67,000 in the bank .
This time , the GOP primary contest features three contenders who have never held a public office .
It has been a below - the - radar race featuring a party - backed candidate against a perennial contender with a controversial past that includes making anti-Semitic remarks and a fringe candidate who has made the elimination of toll roads a top agenda item .
The state Republican Party took the unusual step of issuing a primary endorsement of Steve Sauerberg , a Willowbrook family practice physician , in part to try to marginalize his challengers .
But some Republicans have expressed fears that Sauerberg ’s low - volume campaign might not be enough to defeat Andy Martin and Mike Psak , a result that would cast further doubt on the GOP ’s relevance in Illinois .
Andy Martin is the assclown who started the Obama is a Muslim smear .
One challenger , Martin , has been a frequent candidate in Illinois and Florida in the last three decades .
His last appearance on the state ’s Republican primary ballot was two years ago , when he received 6,095 votes in finishing last in a five - way race in which more than 729,000 ballots were cast .
In 1973 , the Illinois Supreme Court refused to allow Martin admission to the bar , saying he lacked the fitness to be an attorney .
Federal courts have repeatedly sanctioned him for what judges said is his filing of hundreds of largely meritless legal actions .
In early January , a Cook County judge tossed a lawsuit Martin filed against the Tribune alleging the newspaper portrayed him in a false light , contending that his name was not surveyed in a poll of the GOP primary candidates for governor that showed he had less than 1 percent support .
Judge Stuart Palmer ruled Martin ’s allegations about the poll appeared to be “ simply wrong ” in that Martin ’s name was included in the survey .
Palmer also rejected the lawsuit , in part , because he said Martin had failed to adhere to a federal court injunction preventing him from initiating lawsuits in state courts without filing a document reciting his litigation history .
In his past , Martin also has expressed anti-Semitic views .
When he ran for Congress in Connecticut in 1986 , the name of his congressional campaign committee included the phrase “ to exterminate Jew power in America , ” Federal Election Commission records show .
In a 1983 personal bankruptcy case , he referred to a federal bankruptcy judge as a “ crooked , slimy Jew , who has a history of lying and thieving common to members of his race . ”
In a related court filing in the case , he also expressed sympathy to the perpetrators of the Holocaust .
And there ’s more .
Circle ’em up and fire .
I think after the gift of Keyes I can not ask for Martin to win this , though I ’ll be delighted to watch Andy McKenna try and spin that .
So let us ask the question that should be on the mind of every thinking person in the world at this moment :
If John McCain becomes the 44th president of the United States , what are the odds that a blood clot or falling object will make Sarah Palin the 45th ?
The actuarial tables on the Social Security Administration website suggest that there is a better than 10 % chance that McCain will die during his first term in office .
Needless to say , the Reaper ’s scything only grows more insistent thereafter .
Should President McCain survive his first term and get elected to a second , there is a 27 % chance that Palin will become the first female U.S. president by 2015 .
If we take into account McCain ’s medical history and the pressures of the presidency , the odds probably increase considerably that this bright - eyed Alaskan will become the most powerful woman in history .
As many people have noted , placing Palin on the ticket has made these final months of the already overlong 2008 campaign much more interesting .
Is Palin remotely qualified to be president of the United States ?
No .
But that ’s precisely what is so interesting .
McCain not only has thrown all sensible concerns about good governance aside merely to pander to a sliver of female and masses of conservative Christian voters , he has turned this period of American history into an episode of high - stakes reality television :
Do n’t look now , but our cousin Sarah just became leader of the free world !
Tune in next week and watch her get sassy with Pakistan !
Americans have an unhealthy desire to see average people promoted to positions of great authority .
No one wants an average neurosurgeon or even an average carpenter , but when it comes time to vest a man or woman with more power and responsibility than any person has held in human history , Americans say they want a regular guy , someone just like themselves .
President Bush kept his edge on the “ Who would you like to have a beer with ? ” poll question in 2004 , and won reelection .
This is one of the many points at which narcissism becomes indistinguishable from masochism .
Let me put it plainly :
If you want someone just like you to be president of the United States , or even vice president , you deserve whatever dysfunctional society you get .
You deserve to be poor , to see the environment despoiled , to watch your children receive a fourth - rate education and to suffer as this country wages -- and loses -- both necessary and unnecessary wars .
McCain has so little respect for the presidency of the United States that he is willing to put the girl next door ( soon , too , to be a grandma ) into office beside him .
He has so little respect for the average American voter that he thinks this reckless and cynical ploy will work .
And it might .
Palin ’s nomination has clearly excited Christian conservatives , and it may entice a few million gender - obsessed fans of Hillary Clinton to vote entirely on the basis of chromosomes .
Throw in a few million more average Americans who will just love how the nice lady smiles , and 2009 could be a very interesting year .
Tune in next week and watch cousin Sarah fuss with our nuclear arsenal ... .

About a month and a half ago , Egbert " Bert " Praetorius , a former video engineer who invented the video rewind , passed away at 90 .
His grandson Matt Radigan has provided Wired.com with an old newspaper article about Praetorius , recognizing the engineer for his achievement in discovering how to play video in reverse smoothly .
The article says Preatorius , a Wpix engineer , won the " highest suggestion award , " rewarding him $ 350 .
The Suggestion Committee called Praetorius ' invention a " significant technical innovation in television , " which , at the time , was being quickly adopted by TV shows .
The article includes other inventors who received prizes as well .

FTP ( file transfer protocol ) is used by many would - be webmasters and bloggers for uploading files to their host servers .
It ’s not a wise choice to use your browser to transfer files via FTP – that ’s not what browsers are built for .
But with FireFTP , you get the best of both worlds with a full FTP client right within Firefox itself .
The FTP file transfer protocol , one of the earlier ways of transferring files on the Internet , has plenty of life in it .
Since many ISPs these days limit the size of files you can transfer via e-mail , FTP remains a very effective way of sharing files .
It has plenty of useful features , including the ability to compare directories and subdirectories , keeping directories in sync , and automatically reconnecting and resuming file transfers .
You may become somewhat confused the first time you use the program .
Do n’t expect to type in an FTP location into the Firefox address bar and get FireFTP to work , because it wo n’t .
Instead , you have to first open FireFTP by choosing Tools , FireFTP .
Then create a new account for each FTP site from a button on the top left - hand side of the screen .
After that , it ’s all straightforward .

I ’m a liberal Democrat .
And I do not favor same - sex marriage .
Do those positions sound contradictory ?
To me , they fit together .
Many seem to believe that marriage is simply a private love relationship between two people .
They accept this view , in part , because Americans have increasingly emphasized and come to value the intimate , emotional side of marriage , and in part because almost all opinion leaders today , from journalists to judges , strongly embrace this position .
That ’s certainly the idea that underpinned the California Supreme Court ’s legalization of same - sex marriage .
But I spent a year studying the history and anthropology of marriage , and I ’ve come to a different conclusion .
Marriage as a human institution is constantly evolving , and many of its features vary across groups and cultures .
But there is one constant .
In all societies , marriage shapes the rights and obligations of parenthood .
Among us humans , the scholars report , marriage is not primarily a license to have sex .
Nor is it primarily a license to receive benefits or social recognition .
It is primarily a license to have children .
In this sense , marriage is a gift that society bestows on its next generation .
Marriage ( and only marriage ) unites the three core dimensions of parenthood -- biological , social and legal -- into one pro-child form : the married couple .
Marriage says to a child :
The man and the woman whose sexual union made you will also be there to love and raise you .
Marriage says to society as a whole :
For every child born , there is a recognized mother and a father , accountable to the child and to each other .
These days , because of the gay marriage debate , one can be sent to bed without supper for saying such things .
But until very recently , almost no one denied this core fact about marriage .
Summing up the cross-cultural evidence , the anthropologist Helen Fisher in 1992 put it simply : “ People wed primarily to reproduce . ”
The philosopher and Nobel laureate Bertrand Russell , certainly no friend of conventional sexual morality , was only repeating the obvious a few decades earlier when he concluded that “ it is through children alone that sexual relations become important to society , and worthy to be taken cognizance of by a legal institution . ”
Marriage is society ’s most pro-child institution .
In 2002 -- just moments before it became highly unfashionable to say so -- a team of researchers from Child Trends , a nonpartisan research center , reported that “ family structure clearly matters for children , and the family structure that helps children the most is a family headed by two biological parents in a low - conflict marriage . ”
All our scholarly instruments seem to agree :
For healthy development , what a child needs more than anything else is the mother and father who together made the child , who love the child and love each other .
For these reasons , children have the right , insofar as society can make it possible , to know and to be cared for by the two parents who brought them into this world .
The foundational human rights document in the world today regarding children , the 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child , specifically guarantees children this right .
The last time I checked , liberals like me were supposed to be in favor of internationally recognized human rights , particularly concerning children , who are typically society ’s most voiceless and vulnerable group .
Or have I now said something I should n’t ?
Every child being raised by gay or lesbian couples will be denied his birthright to both parents who made him .
Every single one .
Moreover , losing that right will not be a consequence of something that at least most of us view as tragic , such as a marriage that did n’t last , or an unexpected pregnancy where the father - to - be has no intention of sticking around .
On the contrary , in the case of same - sex marriage and the children of those unions , it will be explained to everyone , including the children , that something wonderful has happened !
For me , what we are encouraged or permitted to say , or not say , to one another about what our society owes its children is crucially important in the debate over initiatives like California ’s Proposition 8 , which would reinstate marriage ’s customary man-woman form .
Do you think that every child deserves his mother and father , with adoption available for those children whose natural parents cannot care for them ?
Do you suspect that fathers and mothers are different from one another ?
Do you imagine that biological ties matter to children ?
How many parents per child is best ?
Do you think that “ two ” is a better answer than one , three , four or whatever ?
If you do , be careful .
In making the case for same - sex marriage , more than a few grown - ups will be quite willing to question your integrity and goodwill .
Children , of course , are rarely consulted .
The liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin famously argued that , in many cases , the real conflict we face is not good versus bad but good versus good .
Reducing homophobia is good .
Protecting the birthright of the child is good .
How should we reason together as a society when these two good things conflict ?
Here is my reasoning .
I reject homophobia and believe in the equal dignity of gay and lesbian love .
Because I also believe with all my heart in the right of the child to the mother and father who made her , I believe that we as a society should seek to maintain and to strengthen the only human institution -- marriage -- that is specifically intended to safeguard that right and make it real for our children .
Legalized same - sex marriage almost certainly benefits those same - sex couples who choose to marry , as well as the children being raised in those homes .
But changing the meaning of marriage to accommodate homosexual orientation further and perhaps definitively undermines for all of us the very thing -- the gift , the birthright -- that is marriage ’s most distinctive contribution to human society .
That ’s a change that , in the final analysis , I can not support .

Do n't have a caption for the photo .
In fairness to McCain , I remember the situation that produced this photo .
The usually confused and always uncomfortable in his own skin McCain was looking to shake hands with the moderator , Bob Schieffer , immediately after the debate , and suddenly realized he was going around the table in the wrong direction to meet up with Schieffer .
The picture was caught just as McCain realized this , made an exaggerated halt and was about to turn around .

Is everyone aware that McCain said when referring to the Kennedy assassination " ... the intervention - err tragedy in Dallas . "
I read about this and checked my recording of the debate .
He really does say it very clearly at about 26 minutes in .
If that 's what he actually thinks of the assassination of a president who is the terrorist !
And Obama should watch out !
What 's everyone think of this ?
Where would a word like " intervention " innocently come from in the mind of McCain ?
I can't think of an innocent origin .

I 've got to believe he meant " intervention " in the sense that the assassination intervened between the agreement and the ability to carry it out .

My first reaction , as he was saying it , was that it was the residual from a really sick Republican inside joke , so oft - repeated that he did n't realize his screw - up , but there 's just been so much heinous shit from his party for so long , it 's gotten to the point where my default assumption is always that it 's as bad as bad can be .
I haul myself up out of those defaults so as to keep from going insane .
I 'm going to be SO glad when this election is over that I think I 'm going to buy a bottle of champaign to celebrate the polls closing on the 4th of November .
Just that .

Click to viewSometimes temptation can be all - consuming , especially when you 're still chasing a repeat of your first high .
That 's why , Hollywood , we 're staging this sequel intervention - because sometimes , it 's like you 're on crack .
We heard the perverse rumors about a Blade Runner 2 .
They mercifully proved to be moot , yet we were admittedly quick to believe them .
Why ?
Because time and time again , you 've let us down by creating crappy , money - grubbing updates to lucrative properties .
It 's time to face reality :
With the exception of , say , The Empire Strikes Back and Spider - Man 2 , the majority of sci- fi-ish sequels wo n't match their predecessors in quality .
So we 've provided you with this 12 - step list of movies that need no continuation , to get you started in your quest for a new , righteous life .
Seriously , back off .

Metropolis ( 1927 )
With the economy imploding , we know what The Suits are thinking :
Why not tap into the zeitgeist by remaking this stylish , silent , futuristic thriller about socioeconomic - class chasms ?
Added bonus :
At the heart of the film is a hot stripper robot - total box office bullion !
To paraphrase Nigel Tufnel , speaking about his precious vintage guitar in Spinal Tap : " Do n't touch it … do n't point , even . "
No , do n't even look at it .

Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( 1977 )
After the success of his UFO - sighting film , Stephen Spielberg expressed interest in revisiting the property , which haunted our minds and stoked our imaginations as we pondering these mysterious aliens .
Soon after , he made the cuddly E.T. instead .
Smart man .

History of the World , Part I ( 1981 )
It 's a joke , you see : what with history traditionally recalled in successive volumes .
As much as we'd love to see the musical " Jews in Space " - which was teased in Mel Brooks ' cinematic romp through times of yore - we'd hate to see this stellar concept stretch into an SNL type skit gone too long .
Plus we 'll always have The Schwartz .
The Thing ( 1982 ) The late Vincent Canby , one of the New York Times ' greatest critics , once referred to John Carpenter 's remake of 1951's The Thing From Another World as a " a foolish , depressing , overproduced movie . "
Which is naturally why we consider it a classic .
Carpenter , the Sci Fi Channel , and Strike Entertainment ( Slither , Dawn of the Dead ) , and have respectively tried to resurrect the property .
And just last year , it was announced that the latter had succeeded , forging an ( unholy ? ) alliance with Universal for a prequel .
Nicely played , Strike , nicely played .
But a prequel still feels like a sequel even though it is a prequel .
( We 'll pause while you think that through . )

12 Monkeys ( 1995 ) A dude goes back in time and hangs at a mental hospital while trying to stop an earth - plaguing virus , in this gripping , plot - twisting head trip .
Anything more would simply be anti-climactic .

24 Monkeys ?

The Running Man ( 1987 ) We know what you 're thinking .
The awesome , sensational Running Man - about a to - the - death reality show for felons - would make a perfect obvious tie - in soon enough .
It takes place in 2019 !
Which is coming up .
Like , relatively soon .

As we learned , the game show - as - moral - decay metaphor simply is n't shocking anymore .
Besides , we 've been getting our fix of dystopian competitions from Japanese competition shows anyhow .

Akira ( 1988 ) A thriller about a covert government op and a guy teeming with supernatural powers , this is an apocalyptic epic of sweeping beauty and challenging complexity .
To attempt to improve upon - or even mimic - this classic would be utter hubris .

Armageddon ( 1998 ) Despite popular disdain , the hysterically ridiculous doomsday asteroid flick made a killing , internationally , at the B.O .

Donnie Darko ( 2001 ) Director Richard Kelly 's break - out movie was dark , intriguingly time - twisty , and made ghoulish use of a rabbit .
It also went on to become a surprise cult hit , which is why the industry is so ready to juice it with a story about the creepy misadventures of his little sister ( Sparkle Motion ! ) while on a roadtrip .
( Nightstalker director Chris Fisher will helm the follow - up . ) S. Darko , as it's called , was said to have started shooting in May .
But , as we learned from the original , it 's never too late to change fate and put this risky proposition out of its misery .

Ghost Rider ( 2007 ) Nicolas
Cage 's painful paean to the flame - headed motorcycle enthusiast made a decent chunk of change , so a follow - up is already in development .
But it 's never too late to do the right thing and snuff it out of its misery .
According to the actor , there 's been talk about " going international with that character .
Taking him into Europe , having him go on a motorcycle . "
Perhaps we should use that Penance Stare on the sinful filmmakers - apparently the fate of the Western world depends on it .
I Am Legend ( 2007 ) The lucrative , Will Smith - starring adaptation of the Richard Matheson book initially found its stride , then missed the plot mark completely - that the infected vampire / zombies are , in fact , evolved humans - in its frustrating , off - putting second half .
Still , not ones to pussyfoot around , Warner Bros. , eager to cultivate another franchise , has obtained the sequel rights .
But forgive us if we doubt Hollywood 's commitment to the fine source material , given the tendency to transform anything cerebral into a mindless popcorn flick .

Watchmen ( 2009 ) Zach Synder recently took the high road and declared that he 's doubtful he 'd direct a second Watchmen without the Hollywood - loathing Alan Moore 's involvement - which pretty much settles that .

( CNN ) -- Georgian leaders may be blaming Russia for the conflict raging in South Ossetia , but former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said Thursday " there is no doubt " that Georgia provoked the clash .
Mikhail Gorbachev told CNN's Larry King that Russia called extra troops into Georgia to stem violence .
Gorbachev told CNN's Larry King that Russia moved additional forces into South Ossetia in response to " devastation " in the South Ossetia city of Tskhinvali .
" This was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town , against a sleeping people .
This was a barbaric assault , " said Gorbachev , the last president of the former Soviet Union .
But Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , who also appeared on CNN's " Larry King Live " Thursday , said he was " profoundly shocked " that Mikhail Gorbachev would use a television appearance " for basically vindicating lies and deceptions . "
Last week , Georgia said it launched an operation into South Ossetia after a cease - fire was broken with artillery fire from Russian separatists that killed 10 people including civilians and peacekeepers .
It accused Russia , which also has peacekeepers in the region , of backing the separatists .
Hours later , the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Russian authorities said 10 Russian peacekeepers had been killed and 30 wounded in an attack by Georgians .
" Western television did n't show what happened in Tskhinvali , " Gorbachev said .
" Only now they 're beginning to show some pictures of the destruction .
So this looks to me like it was a well - prepared project .
And with any outcome , they wanted to put the blame on Russia . "
Watch Gorbachev discuss " barbaric assault " »
He called Georgia 's claims that Russia is attempting to dismantle its democracy " all lies from beginning to end . "
In response , Saakashvili expressed disappointment with the sentiments from Gorbachev , who he said he once respected .
" This is the man , Mr. Gorbachev , who helped to , you know , bring down KGB kingdom .
And he is the one who is , you know , justifying what the KGB people are doing right now in my country , " Saakashvili said .
" Shame on him .
Shame on you , Mr. Gorbachev , for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the Soviet Union . "
Gorbachev also said the United States is jeopardizing its fragile relationship with Russia by backing Georgia .
Watch Gorbachev discuss U.S. - Russia relations »
" There is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both U.S. and Russia interests , and the interests of other countries , and the interests of stability , particularly in the hotspots in different continents , " said Gorbachev , who won the Nobel Peace Price in 1990 .

Gordon Brown 's proposals to detain terrorism suspects without charge for up to 42 days thrown out by peers
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
The government is expected to tear up its plans to detain terrorism suspects for up to 42 days without charge after peers overwhelmingly rejected the proposal .
Jacqui Smith , the home secretary , is set to annouce plans to drop the specific proposal on detention without charge but retain the substantive part of the government 's counter - terror bill .
The move comes after the House of Lords backed an amendment to block the detention plans by 309 to 118 , a majority of 191 , during the committee stage of the bill .
In a face - saving measure , the government will publish separate legislation on 42 days that it will hold in abeyance in case it is ever needed .
Although a government defeat had been widely predicted , the scale of the rebellion will be seen as a huge victory for civil liberties campaigners and will have made Smith wary of trying to force the measure through the Commons again .
The damage to the prime minister , Gordon Brown – who as recently as this morning continued to urge peers to back the bill – may be limited by the financial crisis dominating the headlines .
Brown has declined to say whether he would use the Parliament Act to force the legislation on to the statute books .
If he did , there would probably be a prolonged period of " ping - pong " with peers - the process in which an amended bill is thrown back and forth from one chamber to another for repeated votes .
If this was to end in deadlock , Brown would have to wait a year before using the Parliament Act.
Campaigners against 42 - day detention believe that the prime minister is not prepared for such a battle , as he cannot guarantee another Commons majority .
Opponents of the bill claimed that any extension of the current 28 - day limit for detaining suspects without charge was unnecessary and would erode civil liberties .
Ministers argued that the increasing complexity of terror plots meant police needed more time to gather evidence .
The measure was passed in the Commons in June by nine votes after the nine Democratic Unionist MPs supported the government .
Since then , the number of opposition MPs has increased by two .
John Howell replaced Boris Johnson , who had already stood down as MP for Henley and therefore did not vote , and John Mason won Glasgow East for the SNP from Labour .
Tony Blair suffered his first Commons defeat over an attempt to extend detention to 90 days in 2005 .
Parliament agreed instead to the 28 - day limit that is currently in place .
Sarkozy : " In his message to the participants , French President Nicolas Sarkozy called Arabic the " language of the future , of science and of modernity , " and expressed the hope that " more French people share in the language that expresses great civilizational and spiritual values . "
As one of the last remaining members of the European race not yet taken over by the pods ; I have nothing left to cling to but David Icke 's theory that our planet is currently under the control of a race of reptilian extraterrestrials , and that our political leaders are in fact these aliens incognito .
As obviously ridiculous and patently fictitious as this story may be , it almost seems more plausible than the bizarre events I am witnessing before my very eyes .
Arabic is the : ' language of the future , of Science and of modernity ' ?
What an audacious insult to generations of francophone Kings , artists , scientists : chemists , physicists , astronomers , archaeologists , anthropologists ; architects , engineers , musicians , writers , fashion designers , philosophers , palaeontologists and physicians .
It seems to me the French language has served the French people quite well .
But who knows to what heights of genius Louis Pasteur , Sully Prudhomme , Albert Camus , and the Sun King may have ascended if only they had been employing a Middle Eastern linguistic system rather than that primitive , obsolete Indo - European gibberish foolishly defended by Charles Martel and his merry band of cultural bigots at Tours .
Sarkozy : " We must invest in the Arabic language ( because ) to teach it symbolizes a moment of exchange , of openness and of tolerance . "
What ?
exchange , openness , and tolerance ?
The only exchange in which the Muslims of Europe are interested is an exchange of European civilisation for that of the new Islamic Caliphate setting itself up in our homeland .
And will the Muslims requite this programme of Arabic 101 by teaching French in their madrasas ?
Openness ?
This seems a rather one sided proposition .
We are expected to be open to Islam whilst the Muslims are entirely closed minded and hostile in regards to our own culture .
A culture the Muslims indeed regard as decadent and degenerate , and deserving of supplanting by their own .
Openness ?
Yes , I can imagine our women will find great enthusiasm for the openness of the Burkha and sequestration from society as prisoners within their own homes .
And Gays must be particularly beside themselves with excitement at the prospect of this new openness coming to their ville française .
Tolerance ?
You mean for cartoons and books or anyone who is n't abjectly deferential to Muslim sensibilities ?
You mean like the tolerance shown for the peaceful Pro-Köln rally ?
I see .
I am sure Salman Rushdie , Theo van Gogh , Sherry Jones and her publisher Martin Rynja , you know , the fellow almost tolerated to death by a Muslim plot to fire bomb his home because they did n't like his client 's book ?
- would be all simply thrilled and deeply comforted to hear of this tolerance .
It is quite beyond my abilities of comprehension to even attempt an understanding of an obviously diseased mind such as Sarkozy's .
Not only does this man have a claim on being the greatest traitor in French history ; he is also an incomparable fool .
I have news Monsieur le President .
When Europe falls to the Ummah , you as a Jew , will be among the first treated to Islamic charity and tolerance along with the other 600,000 Jews of France , who , along with 62 million of their countrymen , should be calling for your head .
YouTube on Tuesday rebuffed a request from John McCain ’s presidential campaign to examine fair - use issues more carefully before yanking campaign videos in response to DMCA takedown notices .
" Lawyers and judges constantly disagree about what does and does not constitute fair - use , " YouTube ’s general counsel Zahavah Levine wrote in a letter Tuesday .
" No number of lawyers could possibly determine with a reasonable level of certainty whether all the videos for which we receive disputed takedown notices qualify as fair - use . "
" We hope that as a content uploader , you have gained a sense of some of the challenges we face everyday in operating YouTube , " she added .
The McCain campaign on Monday fired off a letter to YouTube complaining that the company had acted too quickly to take down McCain ’s videos in response to copyright infringement notices .
McCain campaign general counsel Trevor Potter argued that several of the removed ads , which had used excerpts of television footage , fall under the four - factor doctrine of fair - use , and should n’t have been removed .
But citing the DMCA , a controversial copyright law that McCain voted to approve a decade ago , Levine pointed out that YouTube risks being sued itself if it does n’t respond promptly to takedown notices .
" If … service providers do not remove the content to such notice , they do so at their own risk because they lose their safe harbor , " she wrote .
Further , Levine argued , the fair - use analysis is complicated , and the creators of the videos are better equipped to perform it .
The uploader can then issue a DMCA counter - notice if they believe they ’re on solid legal ground , and YouTube will restore the video .
" You Tube does not possess the requisite information about the content in user - uploaded videos to make a determination as to whether a particular takedown notice includes a valid claim of infringement , " Levine wrote .
" The claimant and the uploader , not YouTube , hold all of the relevant information in this regard , including the source of any content used , the ownership rights to the content , and any licensing arrangements in place between the parties . "
" The real problem here is individuals and entities that abuse the DMCA takedown process , " she added .
" We look forward to working with Senator ( or President ) McCain on ways to combat abuse of the DMCA takedown process on YouTube , including by way of example , strengthening the fair - use doctrine , so that intermediaries like us can rely on this important doctrine with a measure of business certainty .

Were it not for ever - greater increases in central - bank money and the market expectation that governments are about to make taxpayers shoulder commercial banks ' huge losses , the fiat money systems would presumably collapse right away .
International interbank short - term lending rates say it all : the latest drastic increases in yield spreads between money - market rates and official central - bank rates are indicative of the growing reluctance among banks to extend loans to each other , for fear that borrowers could default on their payment obligations ( see graph below ) .
Under today 's fiat - money regime , banks , under governments ' auspices , increase the money stock " out of thin air " whenever they extend loans .
The money supply is built on credit , which , in turn , hinges on peoples ' confidence in banks and banks ' confidence in their borrowers ' ability and willingness to service their debt .
As confidence leaves the system , banks refrain from extending loans and demand repayment of outstanding loans , and the money stock contracts .
Economies that have for decades been fuelled by ever - higher doses of credit and money fall into depression — that is , declining production , employment , and prices .
Where the Losses Come From
To better understand the drop in confidence in the paper - money system , one should take a look at the issue of banks ' accounting losses and payment losses .
Assume , for instance , a bank buys a corporate bond for , say , US$ 100 and records it in its balance sheet .
If the bond price declines to , say , US$ 50 ( due to rising market yields ) , the bank would have to make a write - down .
The resulting US $ 50 loss would , via the profit - and - loss account , reduce the bank 's recorded equity capital .
As long as the issuer of the bond continues to service his debt , however , the bank would recover its investment over the time .
The accounting loss would not diminish the banks ' capacity to pay its obligations vis -à - vis its own depositors and creditors .
If , however , the market price of the bond declines because its issuer no longer pays , the banks ' incoming cash flows would be lower than hitherto expected , resulting in a payment loss — and this could , if payment losses are large , make the bank default on its obligations .
The Issue of a Loss of Confidence
An accounting loss can easily develop into a payment loss .
This is because bad news about banks ' financial health ( profit warning ) can trigger a loss of confidence .
Such a market reaction is rational , given the system of fractional - reserve banking .
Under fractional - reserve banking , banks keep just a fraction of their immediate payment obligations ( basically sight deposits ) in the form of cash .
As a consequence , they cannot meet all their payment obligations should customers whish to withdraw their sight deposits all at once .
However , banks enjoy a privilege granted by the government .
Central banks , the holders of the money supply monopoly , can provide banks with whatever amount of cash is needed .
With central banks acting as lender of last resort , the chances for a bank run , initiated by private savers , have been greatly reduced .
What spells trouble , however , is an institutional bank run : banks lose confidence in each other .
Most banks rely heavily on interbank refinancing .
And if interbank lending dries up , banks find it increasingly difficult , if not impossible , to obtain refinancing ( at an acceptable level of interest rates ) .
Maturity Transformation and Credit Derivatives
An institutional bank run is particularly painful for banks involved in maturity transformation .
Most banks borrow funds with short - and medium - term maturities and invest them longer - term .
As short - and medium - term interest rates are typically lower than longer - term yields , maturity transformation is a profitable .
However , in such a business , banks are exposed to rollover risk .
If short - and medium - term interest rates rise relative to ( fixed ) longer - term yields , maturity transformation leads to losses — and in the extreme case , banks can go bankrupt if they fail to obtain refinancing funds for liabilities falling due .
Growing investor concern about rollover risks has the potential to make a bank default on its payment obligations : interest rates for bank refinancing go up , so that loans falling due would have to be refinanced at ( considerably ) higher interest rates .
The latest price action clearly suggests that banks active in maturity transformation could be up for quite some trouble ( see graphs below ) .
In an environment of rapidly declining confidence in the banking system , investor concerns about derivative instruments , credit derivatives in particular , may well accelerate the very forces that disintegrate the fiat - money regime .
To be sure , there is nothing wrong with credit derivatives as such .
Credit derivatives are instruments that help to value , trade , and reallocate existing risks among market participants , thereby making the financial system more efficient .
However , the outstanding expansion of credit derivatives , heaped upon a gigantic paper - credit pyramid , has been stimulated to a great extent by central banks ' chronic low interest rates , having made investors search for yield pick - up and ignore credit and market risks .
There is little experience with how the financial positions of market participants would be affected in the case of major players going bankrupt .
The extraordinary size and complexity of the credit - derivative market could pose a substantial unwinding challenge in the event of the exit of several major counterparties .
Closing out and replacing positions could lead to drastic changes in underlying financial - asset prices .
As investors cannot be sure that all market participants could weather the consequences of a default in the underlying credits or the effects of a prolonged disruption to market liquidity , confidence in the solidity of the monetary order may drop even faster in times of market stress .
Postponing the Ultimate Disaster
The issues outlined above are symptoms of the crumbling monetary ( dis ) order .
Their underlying causes are to be found in the government - sponsored expansion of bank credit and money .
It is a system that stretches the monetary demand beyond the economies ' economic resources .
By artificially lowering the interest rate through credit expansion , central banks induce inflation - induced boom - and - bust - cycles , which lead to unsustainable debt levels .
In all western countries overall debt levels as a percent of GDP have gone up strongly in recent decades .
Whenever financial markets set out to end the disastrous process through , for instance , a decline in economic activity , governments and their central banks will do whatever it takes to keep the fiat - money system going : lowering interest rates by increasing credit expansion and increasing the money supply .
In the current situation , however , banks ' capacity to keep expanding the credit and money supply has been greatly diminished : accounting losses and — due to waning confidence in the system — presumably also payment losses erode banks ' equity capital further in the time to come .
With their far - reaching coercive power , however , governments may , at least temporarily , be in a position to prevent an imminent implosion of the credit and money system .
Governments can decide to redistribute peoples ' incomes on the grandest scale : shoring up banks ' eroding equity capital or guaranteeing financial institutions ' assets or liabilities , or nationalizing the banking / finance industry .
At a more technical level , central banks can be made to refinance banks directly , thereby replacing the interbank markets altogether .
In such a regime , central banks would presumably not only fix the short - term ( overnight ) interest rate but medium - to longer - term interest rates as well .
Alternatively , central banks can prop up banks ' capital base by taking over their loss - making assets — a procedure already adopted by the US Federal Reserve and by other central banks , as they have also started accepting securities of questionable value in their open - market operations .
When central banks form an international cartel — with the purpose of preserving the fiat - money system — domestic banks would n't default , even if their payment obligations are denominated in foreign currency ( which the national central bank cannot produce ) : central banks would simply lend money to each other .
Abandoning the Path Towards Inflation
By increasing the base money supply in the interbank market , guaranteeing financial institutions ' liabilities or nationalizing the banking industry , governments suppress free - market forces , which could move the system back towards equilibrium .
There should be little doubt that , after decades of government sponsored credit and money - supply expansion , such a correction would be economically painful , accompanied by further bank failures and output and employment losses .
However , it is hard to see how fighting the symptoms of the unfolding monetary fiasco could solve its underlying cause .
Starting the printing presses would n't solve the debt crisis either .
Hyperinflation would cause economic and political damage to the greatest possible extent .
To qualify as a remedy to present ills , government action needs to be constrained to a far - reaching reform of the monetary systems , which , if implemented properly , would neither cause deflation nor inflation .
[ 1 ]
Markets need to be liberalized to the greatest extent to allow prices to adjust back to equilibrium .
A return to sound money is needed .
This would , as outlined by many Austrian economists , require putting an end to government 's monopoly over monetary affairs .
The power for determining the quantity and quality of money must be returned to free - market forces .
Money in the hands of the government and its central bank would sooner or later become the ruin of the free societal order .

A series of financial setbacks left Wanda Dunn facing eviction from the house in Pasadena where her family had lived for generations .
Dunn , 53 , told neighbors that she would rather die than leave .
Early Monday , the day of her expected eviction , firefighters pulled her body out of the house as it burned .
She apparently had set it on fire before shooting herself in the head , authorities said .
“ We knew it was going to happen , ” said Steve Brooks , who lived across the street .
“ It was nobody ’s fault ; it was everybody ’s fault . ”

As Brooks watched the flames , he noticed that Dunn had left two of her plants on his porch , along with a note : “ Please take good care of us or find us a good home . ”
She also had left several inexpensive toys , along with the name and address of a charity organization .
On Sunday night , Dunn spent hours moving boxes and packing her car , said next - door neighbor Scott Harden .
He knew about the foreclosure and eviction , and Dunn ’s suicide threat , so he “ was on red alert . ”
About 5 a.m. the next morning , Harden said he smelled smoke and saw flames in Dunn ’s house in the 1000 block of North Wilson Avenue , and immediately called 911 .
But Harden said he and other neighbors thought Dunn had already left .
He said they were stunned to learn that she was still inside .

“ When they brought her out , we were all really surprised , ” he said .
The suspected arson fire engulfed the living room and dining room , but firefighters were able to douse the flames within 15 minutes , said Pasadena Fire Marshall Mark Fasick .
Firefighters found Dunn in bed in a back room , with a gun lying nearby .
Firefighters tried to revive Dunn and took her to Huntington Hospital , where she was declared dead , Fasick said .
A longtime friend of Dunn was living in her garage at the time of the fire but was unhurt , authorities said .

The stucco house and garage were crowded with newspapers , books and clothes , making it difficult for firefighters to make their way through , Fasick said .
The Los Angeles County coroner ’s office plans to perform an autopsy this week to determine if Dunn died from the gunshot wound , but Pasadena police Lt. John Dewar said that is the most likely cause and that the death is presumed to be a suicide .
“ She was made aware of Monday ’s eviction , ” he said .
“ That may have been what precipitated the arson and death . ”
Police are still trying to determine the history of the house ’s ownership .

Neighbors said Dunn ’s grandparents owned the house before it was passed down to her parents and then to Dunn and her sister .
A few years ago , neighbors said , Dunn and her sister took out a loan on the house but could n’t repay it and had to sell .
The new owner , who let Dunn continue to live there and pay rent , lost the home to foreclosure in May , neighbors said .
Washington Mutual bank was listed in property records as the current owner .
Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department officials showed up on Dunn ’s doorstep a few weeks ago and then again Friday to tell her that she had until Monday to pack up her stuff and go , neighbors said .

Though Dunn kept to herself and rarely participated in neighborhood events , she was n’t shy about her financial situation .
One day a few weeks ago , she showed up on Brooks ’ doorstep with a stack of papers about her house and asked for help .
Brooks said he believed that Dunn had previously worked as a nurse , but that she had been unemployed for more than 10 years .
He said she did n’t have much money and often kept her house dark , except for one low - watt lightbulb .
In the past , Brooks said he had helped mow Dunn ’s lawn and fix her water heater .
On Tuesday morning , yellow police tape was wrapped around the house and the windows were boarded up .
Smoke had left black marks above the front door and flames had broken at least one window .
The woman living in the garage , Alicia Suarez , packed up some of her belongings and moved them into a storage area .
Suarez said she had known Dunn for 30 years and that Dunn was “ desperate . ”

“ She would rather lose her life than lose her house , ” Suarez said .
The apparent suicide occurred just one week after a Porter Ranch man having financial problems shot and killed his wife , three children and mother - in - law before taking his own life .
Ken Kondo , a spokesman for the L.A. County Department of Mental Health , said the agency ’s crisis hotline recently has received numerous calls about housing , job and financial concerns .
He said people are encouraged to reach out to help friends and family during this time of economic uncertainty .
If someone is feeling suicidal , he said , assistance is available at the county ’s 24 - hour hotline at ( 800 ) 854-7771 .

“ The most important thing is to ask for help , ” he said .

McCain ad re-spins false Bridge to Nowhere yarn Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 8 , 2008
Print This Email This
One would think that the definition of stopped would be as unambiguous as that of the word is , but John McCain 's campaign seems to be in need of a dictionary as it hits the airwaves with a new ad making the discredited claim that Sarah Palin " stopped the Bridge to Nowhere . "
The Republican presidential ticket has adopted the " change " mantle and is trying to paint the Alaska governor as a " true maverick " standing up to government waste for not building the nearly $ 400 million bridge to an island with 50 residents .
Problem is , as the Associated Press is quick to note , " Palin was for the infamous bridge before she was against it . "
Democratic candidate Barack Obama 's campaign was quick to pillory the latest McCain ad , pointing reporters to at least five articles noting the false claim and accusing McCain of continuing to " repeat the lie , " in a separate statement .
 Despite being discredited over and over again by numerous news organizations , the McCain campaign continues to repeat the lie that Sarah Palin stopped the Bridge to Nowhere , " Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said .
" John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 % of the time and he and Sarah Palin will continue Bush 's economic policies , his health care policy , his education policy , his energy policy , and his foreign policy .
McCain and Palin will say or do anything to make people believe that they will change something besides the person sitting in the Oval Office .
That 's the kind of politics people are tired of , and it 's anything but change . "
Beginning just before the Republican convention last week , McCain 's campaign seemed to pivot sharply from the argument it had been offering up all year : that the 72 - year - old Arizonan who 'd served more than 20 years in the Senate had more experience than Obama .
Instead , McCain was working furiously to reclaim his " maverick " image , in an apparent play to attract Democrats and independent voters , and he and Palin are offering themselves as able to offer " change " -- essentially co-opting Obama 's message since he entered the presidential race more than a year and a half ago .
The Washington Post 's Howard Kurtz points out just how far McCain 's campaign is stretching the truth regarding Palin and the bridge .
The Arizona senator has made a crusade of battling pork - barrel " earmarks , " but the whopper here is that Palin opposed her state 's notorious Bridge to Nowhere .
She endorsed the remote project while running for governor in 2006 , claimed to be an opponent only after Congress killed its funding the next year and has used the $ 223 million provided for it for other state ventures .
Far from being an opponent of earmarks , Palin hired lobbyists to try to capture more federal funding .
Whether the GOP ticket will pay a political price for its continued and blatant misrepresentation of the Bridge to Nowhere tale it is using to prop up that message remains to be seen .
McCain 's latest ad can be viewed below :
Man Convicted for Sexual Harrassment Based on Body Odor
It seems Taku Uemura , a 21 - year old Maritime Self Defense Force member has a singular characteristic , his unforgettable body odor .
Uemura , apparently , unaware of his distinctive â€œboxing - gloveâ€ musk took it upon himself to strike up a conversation with a woman he had groped last June .
Although , the woman had not seen his face clearly due to a clever “ baseball - cap - in - the - faceâ€  disguise , Uemura could not hide his body smell .
The women ’s testimony of the event and her description of Uemura ’s unique odor proved to presiding Judge Astsushi Miwa that Uemura was the perpetrator .
“ It was a pretty strong and extremely distinctive odor , ” the judge said .
He was sentenced to two - years imprisonment .

This is very uncomfortable to watch but hilarious .
The audience at this comedy show was told not to laugh at any of the comedian 's jokes and to make matters worse , the heckling was so bad he had to leave the stage .
This was part of an ongoing prank war between two friends .
Who says that McCain does n’t understand the Internet .
Well , come to think of it , he does n’t .
But he seems to have found a new way to get free airplay for his political ads .
Simply fill them with lies about your opponent !
Then the liberal blog - o - sphere will endlessly analyze your ads , your opponent will have to respond to them , morning shows will titter about them , and so on .
This pushes them out to many times more viewers than originally saw them on TV , and at no cost .
After all , a candidate who has to hold a campaign event in a German restaurant when his opponent is giving a speech to 200,000 people in Germany probably has to settle for running ads in the late night slot on minor cable channels .

Billboard advertising presents a commanding venue for your company message .
Signage is oversized , colorful and difficult to ignore on your daily commute .
Traditional billboards consist of vinyl sheets glued to the billboard ’s frame , and require high labor costs to install and remove .
In contrast , electronic billboards feature colorful moving graphics that can be changed remotely via the Internet .
Boards can be shared by several advertisers on a rotating basis , notes Street Authority .
The best way to make your billboard to be more effective is to make it more conspicuous
So you can use some ascenders .
Here are some examples :
The Linux Foundation has published the results of a study that the organization conducted in order to compute the approximate financial value of the Linux platform .
Based on the results of the study , the Linux Foundation has concluded that it would cost $ 1.4 billion to develop the Linux kernel from scratch and $ 10.8 billion to develop the complete platform stack .
The Linux Foundation 's study is based on methodology devised by David Wheeler for a similar project in 2002 .
Wheeler developed a tool that uses the Constructive Cost Model ( COCOMO ) to extrapolate the value of software from the number of lines of code , the average salary of software developers , and an assortment of other factors .
When Wheeler used this tool on the source code of the entire Fedora package archive six years ago , he computed the value of the platform at $ 1.2 billion .
The volume of code and number of packages has grown enormously since then .
The Linux Foundation used the same approach for their new study and determined that the present value of the source code in the Fedora archives has grown to $ 10.8 billion .
Counting the lines of code is obviously a very unscientific way to compute value , and the numbers should n't be viewed as anything other than a ballpark estimate .
But it 's still moderately instructive — especially when viewed alongside Wheeler 's historical results .
The methodology has a bunch of very obvious limitations that the Linux Foundation has documented for the sake of clarity .
They note that the Fedora package archives include a lot of components that are n't necessarily found in other distributions and that some distributions have many more packages .
There is enormous variance in the pieces that are included in Linux installations used in different contexts , like desktop and server systems .
Another serious limitation in this method is that it fails to account for all of the significant effort and developer time that was invested to reduce bloat and decrease the size of the code base .
The paper published by the Linux Foundation includes some other statistical data , too .
For example , it says that rewriting the 204 million lines of code that are included in Fedora 9 would require 60,000 person - years of development time .
Incidentally , the report reveals the components of the platform that have the highest volume of source code .
The Linux kernel tops the list with 5,961,705 , and the top ten includes the GNU Compiler Collection , the OpenOffice.org productivity suite , the Eclipse IDE , the Mono .NET runtime , and the Firefox web browser .
Although the dubious methodology falls short of providing an authoritative answer to the question of Linux 's value , the paper 's big takeaway message still comes through loud and clear .
The Linux ecosystem includes an enormous amount of code that represents a significant investment in developer effort .
Companies can get a lot of value by using and participating in the advancement of a shared code base .

1947 : After 13 years of grinding and polishing , the Palomar Observatory mirror is completed at Caltech .
It was , at the time , the largest telescope mirror ever made in the United States , measuring 200 inches in diameter .
Following its completion , the disk was mounted in Palomar 's Hale Telescope and first used in January 1949 to take pictures of the Milky Way .
Edwin Hubble was the first astronomer to make images using the new scope .
The mirror began as a 20 - ton piece of molten Pyrex , a new glass blend , at the Corning Glass Works in upstate New York .
Pyrex expands and contracts far less than regular glass , making it less prone to distortion , a problem that plagued the 100 - inch mirror already in operation at Palomar .
After being heated to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit , the Pyrex was poured into a ceramic mold .
It was carefully cooled at an average rate of one or two degrees per day for 11 months , then allowed to reach room temperature .
11
After that it was shipped west to Caltech in Pasadena , where the glass was painstakingly ground to perfection in a process lasting more than a decade .
The era of giant telescopic lenses began in the 1700s , when astronomers recognized that the bigger the lens ( or reflecting mirror ) , the better the image .
In 1774 , English astronomer William Herschel mounted several 9 - inch mirrors in a 10 - foot - long telescope and recorded , with satisfaction , that he had spent the first night looking at " Saturn 's rings and two belts in great perfection . "
Herschel followed that up with a 48 - inch behemoth , requiring a telescope so large that it could no longer be manually operated .
This led to the building of the world 's first observatory , a 60 - foot high , wood - framed structure that looks nothing like a modern observatory .
The Palomar Observatory opened in the 1930s after astronomer George Hale ( for whom the telescope is named ) determined that the Mt. Wilson Observatory was no longer an ideal site because of the encroaching lights of a growing Los Angeles .
The new site he chose was atop Mount Palomar , 100 miles southeast of Pasadena .
The Hale Telescope is one of seven operational scopes at Palomar .
It was the largest optical telescope in the world until completion of Hawaii's 10 - meter Keck I telescope in 1993 .

That way newcomers wo n't be overwhelmed in an environment of such general erudition .
The dynamics of popular enthusiasm for formal education are roughly reflected in presidential history .
George Washington 's classroom education was sparse .
His successor , John Adams , was a Harvard - educated lawyer .
In the next century , seven out of 23 presidents never attended college .
The 20th century saw only one of 19 presidents , Harry Truman , occupy the White House sans degree .
The first chief executive elected in the new millennium possesses degrees from the best - known brand names in American learning : Harvard and Yale .
President Bush is also the first man to preside over the United States with an MBA .
We will never know what might have happened with an MBA in the White House when the market crashed in 1929 ; the pressing need for them had not yet been invented .
The Master of Business Administration is the great American contribution to the ubiquity of postgraduate degrees .
It was an honorific cooked up in the 1930s , an era when businessmen might have had reason to be wary of entitling themselves .
It is worth noting that among the most highly regarded presidents of the 19th century , only one , Thomas Jefferson , attended college or university .
Abraham Lincoln , Andrew Jackson , and Grover Cleveland were all self - educated .
These three are generally recognized as more original and independent than most of their executive peers .
Early leading American businessmen were far less likely to be well schooled than politicians .
Our first millionaire , John Jacob Astor , had no formal training .
The first really big player on Wall Street , transportation tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt , took a notoriously wry view of pedagogy .
He once famously remarked , " If I had an education , I would not have had time to learn anything else . "
The slogan fails to appear beneath his name at the university bearing it in Nashville .
Andrew Carnegie was a telegrapher and then worked his way up in the Pennsylvania Railroad ; his book learning was extensive , but he acquired it from the library , not a blackboard .
Jay Gould 's experience as a surveyor and tannery manager served as his Wall Street apprenticeship .
J.D. Rockefeller was a bookkeeper and a clerk .
Henry Ford was a self - taught mechanic .
E.H. Harriman learned his financial skills as a Wall Street flunky , and hence , J.P. Morgan dubbed him the " two - dollar broker . "
Of all early American magnates , Morgan was the only one with a college degree whose name is a household word today .
And of the above mentioned , he was the lone standout who was born already rich .
None of these facts justifies gratuitous attacks on the value of a college degree .
But if certain kinds of diplomas are to qualify their holders for special opportunity to acquire wealth and power , then the performance of this elect is rightly subject to our utmost scrutiny .
The evidence that the media are routinely indulgent of society 's golden boys is ample if not overwhelming .
The reciprocal arrangements between government and Wall Street are so pervasive that reporters and readers alike are long inured and oblivious to the blatancy of vested interest .
The members of this world - shaking club are linked , almost to a man , through alma mater .
When we examine what is required for an ordinary applicant to enter America 's most exclusive universities , it is difficult to understand why these skills are relevant to success in the marketplace .
The ability to distinguish between several similar obscure words unlikely to be used in a lifetime may be unusual but how it could facilitate successful business strategy is less than apparent .
The career benefits of youthful contacts made at America 's most exclusive universities , however , are obvious to everyone .
What is a lot less obvious is what , exactly , are the talents of the guys who rise to the top of established business empires .
A damned good lot of them seem to specialize in finding ways of producing revenue but not much of anything else .
Well into the 20th century , journeymanship in a business was a natural route to an executive position in big - time corporate America .
People with the hands - on experience in mechanics , sales , manufacturing , and agriculture were residing at the top of many fields of trade .
As late as the 1950s , entrepreneurs with widely divergent perspectives arising from a vast array of influences and experiences held sway in American industry .
Those back roads are almost unknown to anyone aiming at a pinnacle of commerce today .
People bound for upper management in large public companies have usually immersed themselves in a conformity campaign from high school and few of them ever emerge from it .
They join large organizations and acquire the talent of enduring both maddening redundancy and contradictory policies .
A life sentence of lengthy meetings begins at about age 16 for the future " success , " ensuring that only masochists can couple their careers to an engine on the fast track .
None of this takes the aspiring executive very far , though , without mastering the sublime art of the grovel .
Genuine self - respect and human decency are the very qualities the modern leadership process is designed to purge .
Upstanding individuals are as poisonous to the corporatocracy as kryptonite is to Clark Kent .
Old - school " idea " men sank or swam on the profitability of the innovations they backed .
Modern corporate stardom is a different game .
The survivor must have the guts to wait for the risks taken by others to start paying off before deciding which side he was always on .
Leadership , in the corporate lexicon , is a process of finding pulpits above a captive audience of hapless peons .
The White House , of course , is the ultimate pulpit .
That it was reached by an MBA whose fortune was built on cronyism and public largesse is an irony even incumbents regents at Vanderbilt University appreciate .
What percentage of similar men can weigh down the top of society before the structure begins to creak and twist in strong winds ?
Education , as a means of spreading uncommon abilities further down the line of aptitude , is a great boon to prosperity .
But the use of college degrees as clubs to clear the field of otherwise able competitors is a desperate measure of control that , intentionally or not , rigs the competition .
Still the MBA grip on corporatocracy has many loyal defenders ideating in the halls of think tanks , publishing in the rags and newspapers , and doing the TV circuit .
Apparently it is possible for an executive to take a once - solvent , even thriving , company , turn it into a government dependent , and remain worthy of fabulous remuneration from stockholders .
Tales of big business have always included a healthy supply of sordid anecdotes .
No number of them , though , ever seems to crack the mystique commonly associated with high finance .
The idea that it is all so very arcane tends to overwhelm small investors ' natural skepticism .
But corporate glamour awes those in the thick of it as well .
Every new rung on the ladder leaves executives feeling more delphic .
Delusions of grandeur are at the heart of every leadership crisis .
As the economy heated up in the 1980s , boomer careers began to take off , along with their salaries .
This dynamic meshed with individual - income - tax - shelter legislation in a way that dumped money onto the NYSE and the other exchanges .
Between 1980 and 2000 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by over 1,000 % .
During this same period , the population grew by roughly 25 % and average incomes slightly more than doubled .
Clearly government inducement was a major factor .
Still , the gurus and experts never hinted at any risk of overcapitalization .
The conventional wisdom implied perpetual opportunity on Wall Street .
When P/E ratios predictably went through the roof , as the pool of bidders for common stocks and other securities mushroomed over night , experts generally failed to take note of any relationship between those factors .
This process was institutionalized by tax legislation .
Whatever the intentions , government action shifted huge amounts of capital into Wall Street products .
Today a large percentage of the boomer generation is desperate that the Dow Jones Industrial Averages , buoyed by stock purchases for their retirement accounts , maintain present levels and advance .
One of the things that kept investment bank employees busy over the last 25 years was inventing new ways to absorb so much funding .
In 2000 , a New Jersey teenager , Jonathon Lebed , was pressured by the SEC to surrender $ 285,000 he had garnered in so - called pump - and - dump schemes .
But it was difficult to understand how his methods were more morally compromised than those of some the most recognizable brokerage houses in the world .
They almost invariably touted highly stocks their research departments " independently " assessed for market worth .
Lebed , under any other pseudonym , was nothing more than " some random guy " on the Internet and certainly never enjoyed the cachet of a Morgan Chase , Bear Stearns , Goldman Sachs , Salomon Brothers , or any number of other name brands of the day .
The SEC never suggested any of them surrender the billions , if not trillions , they gained in fees and other revenue from recommending stocks that temporarily bubbled .
The uncredentialed are barred from fleecing gullible investors while licensed financial experts may even charge for their harmful advice .
In 1995 , Britain 's oldest merchant bank , Baring Brothers , was ruined by Nick Leeson , an arbitrageur who turned 28 one day before the company was declared insolvent .
Leeson was not a college graduate .
He was able to wreak fiscal havoc through a lengthy series of bad bets and the lax accounting supervision of his employer .
Losses that had accumulated to 204 million pounds in December 1994 were quadrupled into the first 7 weeks of 1995 .
The process took nearly 3 years to reach fruition and through much of it Leeson was able to convince superiors of huge successes as the bank met his margin calls .
Financial writers the world over were astounded that such an established institution could proceed so recklessly .
The stakes were paltry , however , by comparison to the present crisis , which ultimately involved wagering against much larger odds .
The current situation was carefully engineered using the most sophisticated resources of thousands of the largest corporations in the world .
It was based on a simple formula : everyone wants a nice house .
American builders were able and willing to create this wealth .
All that was lacking was the means to pay them .
This was just the kind of metafiscal obstacle that the ivory towers of commercial philosophy were poised to surmount .

This mystery was left to be plumbed by carpenters and their helpers during lunch as they raised another 4,500 square footer .
Zachary Karabell , on the Wall Street Journal Op - Ed ( " Bad Accounting Rules Helped Sink AIG " ) , phrased things a bit differently :
What AIG was saying then , and what others from Lehman to Bear Stearns to the world at large have been saying since , is that the losses showing up are n't " real . "
Yes , the layer upon layer of derivatives built on the foundation of mortgages is mind - boggling .
One reason that AIG had floated beneath the radar screen of the business media ( relative to Wall Street investment firms ) is that its business model is so complex and opaque that it is impossible to describe simply .
It was briefly in the news in 2005 , after it was accused of improper accounting by the SEC and the New York attorney general .
Then it faded from view , until now .
" Reality , " wrote American philosopher C.S. Pierce ( who was something of an " expert " himself unfortunately ) , " is that whose character is independent of what anyone might think . "
Whether computer - generated models , paradigms , and virtual realities would have caused the logician ( who died in 1914 ) to hedge or expand this definition we 'll never know .
But Mr. Karabell 's succeeding paragraph doubtless would have been worthy of Pierce 's attention :
Among its many products , AIG offered insurance on derivatives built on other derivatives built on mortgages .
It priced those according to computer models that no one person could have generated , not even the quantitative magicians who programmed them .
And when default rates and home prices moved in ways that no model had predicted , the whole pricing structure was thrown out of whack .
( Emphasis added ) .
Alas , computer - generated models , like MBAs , were unable or unwilling to submit to a limitation as confining as a finite supply of money .
" Facts are stubborn things " is a line that frequently crops up in Wall Street Journal editorials .
Indifference to the actual size of the market for a product priced to require annual interest payments alone that , in many cases , nearly equaled average American income took stubbornness too .
No one needed an advanced degree or even a computer to recognize the defects of a scheme that ignored such facts .
But maybe we underestimate them ; did Wall Street kingpins know all along that the problem would be resolved by simply printing more money ?
However random and anarchic the markets appear under a fractional - reserve central - banking system , the end results have unnerving consistency .
The decision makers in government and commerce have a philosophy of liquidity that borrows from Homer Simpson on his favorite liquid asset : " Here 's to alcohol : the cause of , and the solution to , all of life 's problems . "
Later in his article , Karabell says ,
A few years from now , there will be a magazine cover with someone we 've never heard of who bought all of those mortgages and derivatives for next to nothing on the correct assumption that they were indeed worth quite a bit .
That knowledge does n't comfort anyone with assets retaining " underlying " value that is caught in a liquidity crunch .
What it means is that Wall Street 's obliviousness to fiscal reality has once again facilitated the concentration of private property into fewer hands .
The bungling incompetence of our betters inevitably leads to the further enserfment of everyone .
And in the meantime , the magnitude of the present crisis is undoubtedly serving as cover for countless varieties of new financial mischief .
Society 's economic vigilantes are presently enraptured by the lofty abstractions of Bernanke , Paulson , and numerous senators whose righteous indignation is roused at last .
Just how Uncle Hank garnered his towering cash cache from Goldman Sachs is irrelevant .
That foundering Wall Street icon has been shored up by Warren Buffett in a way that is eerily reminiscent of Richard Whitney 's purchase of 10,000 shares of US Steel in October of 1929 .
The experts just keep on giving and we'd better start asking how much more elite guidance we can stand .
The important thing , they assure ever so reluctantly , is that the uncredentialed masses pony up .
No one ever said that people who do n't drag letters behind their names will be rendered slaves in this country .
Properly educated businessmen mind what they do say as much as what they do n't .
The latest line is that government bailouts are good investments .
This comes from politicians , ex-politicians , TV personalities , and people who run the cocktail circuit from the west side of the District to the east side of Manhattan .
" Remember Chrysler ? " is the ubiquitous refrain .
" We all made out big on that one . "
Skeptics might have difficulty recalling it as quite so clear cut .
Sure , number three , of the one - time " Big Three , " is still with us , but who got what out of that sweetheart deal remains hazy .
Money passing back and forth from the amorphous fiscal blob in DC and listed corporations is as difficult to follow as a shell game .
Finding our end of the " profits " is like trying to unravel one of the more enigmatic derivatives .
So what everyone ends up doing is taking their word for it that all is soundly managed .
" In five or ten years , " the suits reassure us between cigar puffs , " everyone will be sitting pretty . "
The public is expected to sit blinking like a corporate mistress in a James Thurber cartoon .
Last March , when Congress began hearings on the credit crisis , Representative Tom Davis of Fairfax County , Virginia cautioned that highly compensated CEOs and ex-CEOs of ruined corporations should not be " sacrificed " like " virgins to a volcano . "
Thankfully , he was able to restrain himself from allusions to the crucifixion .
With an MBA president , a Wall Street fat cat at Treasury , and an academician at the Fed , those lustful volcanoes will be settling for virgins into the indefinite future .
Barren harvest or no , the witch doctors of venture capital will be dancing in their leis , feasting on pork and poi , and making those ageless jokes about what all the poor people must be doing .

The Financial Times called the summit “ the most ambitious private sector drive yet to reduce waste and pollution in China ’s export - focused manufacturing industries . ”
“ Our environmental footprint is primarily through our supply chain as a company , ” says Matt Kistler , head of Wal - Mart ’s global sustainability efforts .
“ So we have the ability to really build a world - class , better quality , better value supply chain . ”
In the United States alone , it is estimated that Wal - Mart sells about $ 30bn of merchandise every year .
All this stuff is made by about 30,000 factories in China , and makes up 10 % of all US imports .
Yesterday Wal - Mart also promoted the “ Green Supply Chain Initiative ” led by the Environmental Defense Fund ( EDF ) , a non-profit group that has been working with Wal - Mart on sustainability issues in the US .
This initiative aims to work with individual suppliers on energy saving and other issues .
Wal - Mart hopes to extend the plan to other US and European retailers , and another 20,000 factories .
However , how does this initiative co-exist with Wal - Mart ’s other salient goal , of continuing to reduce prices ?
Conrad McCarron , head of supply chain program at As You Sow , which co-ordinates pressure on companies from ethical investors says , “ If you go to a supplier that is already feeling the squeeze financially , and you say that they need to reduce energy and stop waste water , how do they do that given that Wal - Mart ’s business model is basically to pay less year after year ? ”
And another question : how will Wal - Mart ’s efforts to green their supply chain , affect the people who work in those factories ?
To me it seems as though implementing fair labor and trade practices needs to be closely aligned with any effort to go green .
How can we talk about ecological “ sustainability ” without touching on the human aspect of that ?
It ’s all one issue .

If you ’re gonna strap on your stilettos and take off the gloves — or whatever her combative wardrobe maneuver is — at least own up to what you ’re doing and take responsibility for it .
In what was apparently her first local TV interview , Sarah Palin told Keith Cate of WFLA in Tampa yesterday that her Ayers line of attack on Obama was just her response to the “ news of the day ” from the New York Times :
About that wardrobe …
There are still aspects of the Republican National Committee ’s shopping sprees on behalf of Gov. Sarah Palin and her family that are murky .
Some of the fashion experts consulted Wednesday , for instance , about the $ 150,000 in purchases that appeared on Federal Election Commission records were puzzled by where all of that money had gone , given what they had seen of Ms. Palin ’s wardrobe .
Consider also the $ 4,902.45 charge at Atelier New York , a high - end men ’s store , presumably for Ms. Palin ’s husband , Todd , the famous First Dude .
Karlo Steel , an owner there , said he had gone through the store ’s receipts for September , twice , and found no sales that matched that amount , nor any combination of sales that added up to the total .
Because the store carries aggressively directional men’s wear , he caters to a small clientèle and knows most of his customers by name , as well as the history of their purchases .
When The Caucus called Mr. Steel back to ask him to also check August sales just in case , Mr. Steel said he found one purchase that came close to the amount in the campaign finance reports but said that he knew who that customer was and it certainly was not Mr. Palin .
Neither was it Jeff Larson , the Republican consultant who showed up in campaign finance records as the one who footed the initial bill before being reimbursed by the R.N.C .
The store carries expensive cut - up T - shirts and tricky suits from avant - garde designers , like Raf Simons , Yohji Yamamoto and Ann Demeulemeester , none of whom typically create beltway - appropriate attire .
“ We have no recollection of that sale and no idea what they are talking about , ” Mr. Steel said .
There was similar confusion when The Caucus spoke with Jon and Wing Witthuhn , owners of Pacifier , a high - end children ’s boutique in Minneapolis , where records show two charges of $ 98 , one at Pacifier ’s downtown location and another at its store in the northeast part of the city .
Mr. Witthuhn clearly recalled one of the $ 98 charges because it was the night of Sept. 3 , just hours before Ms. Palin ’s speech at the Republican National Convention .
A woman burst into his store , he recalled , saying she needed outfits for several children , including a 6 - month - old boy .
Mr. Witthuhn explained they did not carry clothes beyond toddler age but helped her pick out a blue - striped convertible romper by Egg Baby ( $ 60 ) , a matching monkey - ear hat ( $ 32 ) and Trumpette baby socks ( $ 6 ) .
After the woman explained her shopping was related to the convention and paid with a credit card number she read off of a Blackberry , it dawned on Mr. Witthuhn that he was potentially helping to outfit one of the country ’s most famous infants — Trig Palin , Ms. Palin ’s youngest .
Sure enough , when Mr. Witthuhn turned on the television that night , there was Trig Palin wearing the outfit purchased at Pacifier , right down to the socks — but sans the monkey - ear hat .
But as for the other $ 98 charge , both Mr. Witthuhn and his wife , Wing , were stumped .
After going through their receipts , Mrs. Witthuhn found another $ 98 purchased on Sept. 9 but it was for clothing for a 2 - year - old — the Palins do not have a 2 - year - old .
The purchase was a little black t- shirt featuring the Ramones , as well as a striped hoodie , a pair of pants with a tiger on it and a pair of cargo pants , all from Tea Collection .
“ Sounds like somebody is using it for personal use , ” Mrs. Witthuhn said .
When Republican officials were queried , they said they had no concerns about any illegitimate charges and said they considered the matter closed .
At least one mystery , however , has been solved .
The F.E.C. records showed a “ Lisa L. Kine ” was reimbursed for more than $ 2,000 in charges , including those made at Pacifier , as well as others at Macy ’s , the Gap , Steinlauf & Stoller , a sewing supply store in New York , and Oshman Brothers , for “ tailoring supplies . ”
The New York address listed traces to Lisa Kline , not Kine .
Could this be the mystery stylist for Ms. Palin ?
Some blogs jumped to the conclusion that this must be Lisa Kline , the owner of several trendy boutiques in Los Angeles often frequented by celebrities , including Paris Hilton and Britney Spears .
The blog , daddytypes.com , fueled the speculation by e-mailing the Witthuhns a video of Ms. Kline , and Mr. Witthuhn said he was “ pretty sure it ’s her !
CRAZY !!! ”
Mrs. Witthuhn said today that her husband was “ 85 percent ” sure but not 100 percent .
Calls on Wednesday by The Caucus to a business and home phone number found for the R.N.C. ’s Lisa Kline in New York were not returned .
But a search of business records identifies the Los Angeles Lisa Kline as Lisa W. Kline , not L .
And Kate Diamond , a spokeswoman for Lisa Kline in Los Angeles , e-mailed that she wished she could accept the publicity from the connection but , alas , “ Lisa has done no shopping for the Palins . ”

The latest batch of CNN / Time swing state polls came out today , and they show that Obama has small leads in 3 states that George W. Bush carried in 2004 North Carolina , Nevada , and Ohio .
He has a big 10 point lead in Virginia .
Most telling is that the McCain campaign ’s Bill Ayers and ACORN attacks against Barack Obama are not working .
Obama leads McCain 51 % - 47 % in North Carolina .
The margin is similar in Nevada where Obama leads 51 % - 46 % .
In Ohio , Obama leads 50 % - 46 % , and the candidates are tied with suburban voters at 48 % .
The big prize for Obama is in Virginia where he leads McCain , 54 % - 44 % .
The key to the Democratic Party ’s recent success in the state has been in northern Virginia , where Obama is leading McCain by a 2 - 1 margin .
The good news for McCain is that he has opened up a nine point lead in West Virginia , 53 % - 44 % .
The really bad news for McCain is that a majority of voters in Virginia , Ohio , and North Carolina say that Bill Ayers and ACORN wo n’t affect their votes .
In Virginia , where the Obama - Ayers attacks have been their most vicious , 62 % of those surveyed said that they are familiar with Ayers , and he wo n’t affect their vote .

Fifty seven percent said that they were familiar with ACORN , and that it wo n’t affect their vote .
In Ohio , 50 % said that Ayers would n’t affect their vote , and 27 % said that it might .
31 % said that ACORN may affect their vote , but 50 % said that it would n’t .
In North Carolina 52 % said that they were familiar with Ayers and he would not affect their vote , compared to 29 % who said that Ayers might affect their vote .
Fifty percent said that they were familiar with ACORN and it would not affect their vote , compared to 29 % who said that it might .
There a few worse positions for a presidential candidate to be in , then to have to defend your home turf less than two weeks before the presidential election .
The two most realistic possibilities for Obama on this list are Virginia and North Carolina .
Ohio is a true toss up that could tip either way by a point or two .
Nevada could be placed in the same category as Ohio .
Barring a total collapse by his campaign , McCain will carry West Virginia , but Virginia due to its shifting demographics and North Carolina with its large youth and African American vote look ripe for the picking by Obama .
Obama has so many red states in play , and no blue states to defend that he can afford to lose Ohio and Florida , and still have plenty of ways to make the electoral math work in his favor .
Nobody should be surprised if Obama wins Iowa , Virginia , and Colorado .
Wins in Virginia and Iowa or Colorado , along with carrying all of the 2004 blue states , will be enough to put Obama in the White House .
McCain would have to repeat Bush ’s 2004 performance to win the election by 16 electoral votes .
However , this scenario looks highly unlikely .
At the end of the day , it looks like this race has stabilized .
Since the markets collapsed these state polls have been trending to Obama , and McCain has not been able to change the momentum .
I think that it will tighten a little by Election Day , but McCain has limited cash , and has to win in too many places to have a solid chance at a comeback .

Nearly two weeks ago , it was becomimg apparent that central bank liquidity operations were not merely ineffective , but had become counterproductive in getting banks to lend to each other .
As FT Althaville noted :
Liquidity is being thrown at the system , but it ’s just making things worse .
By pumping in more money central banks are n’t addressing the fundamental concerns of the banks at all .
Going cold turkey is a very unpleasant thing , but the solution is n’t more drugs , even if they alleviate short term pain .
In assuming they can rely on central bank money market operations – which will be expanded ( as is the case ) when the going gets tough – banks are naturally avoiding lending to each other .
True to recent form , three month dollar Libor rose today and measures of stress in the money markets hit new highs .
Reluctance to lend is not surprising , particularly since the determination of settlement prices of over $ 400 billion of Lehman credit default swaps is today , a big source of anxiety .
From Bloomberg :
The cost of borrowing in dollars in London for three months rose as cash injections and interest - rate cuts by 10 major central banks failed to thaw a credit freeze that put stocks on course for their worst week in 30 years .
The London interbank offered rate , or Libor , that banks charge each other for such loans climbed 7 basis points to 4.82 percent today , the British Bankers ’ Association said .
The rate in Tokyo jumped to the highest since 1998 even as the Bank of Japan added more than $ 30 billion to the banking system .
The overnight dollar rate tumbled 262 basis points to 2.47 percent … .
“ Central banks are trying to supply liquidity , and in many cases it just comes back to them , ” said Robin Marshall , director of international fixed income in London at NCL Smith & Williamson , which oversees about $ 20 billion in assets .
“ There ’s a real problem in getting people to put their money to work .
The fear of counterparty risk is so intense that the only bank prepared to lend at the moment is the central bank ” ….
Banks in South Korea stopped giving credit to importers …..
The Bank of Japan added 3 trillion yen ( $ 30.3 billion ) to the banking system and the Reserve Bank of Australia pumped in A$ 2.63 billion ( $ 1.8 billion ) .
The European Central Bank today loaned banks $ 94 billion for four days …
The Libor - OIS spread , a gauge of cash scarcity , climbed to a record 366 basis points ….
The difference between what banks and the Treasury pay to borrow money for three months , the so - called TED spread , was at 422 basis points .
It widened to 423 basis points yesterday , the most since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1984 .
“ While the authorities across the globe have taken a host of unprecedented measures to shore up confidence , nothing seems to be working , ” Rajiv Setia and Piyush Goyal , strategists at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York , wrote in a report .
“ Participants are increasingly unwilling to bear counterparty risk with any entity , other than the government , at any price . ”
Bond market commentator John Jansen worries this morning that Treasury prices are not behaving as expected , and may be a sign of a turn in sentiment against the dollar :

All that money you ’ve lost — where did it go ?
Any ideas ?
Come on lets talk ……
John McCain should never be president .
Let 's get that out of the way .
Forget about his abrupt dumping of his wife and kids for Cindy Hensley , the heir of the Budweiser fortune .
That was an asshole move , but it was years ago , even if it did thoroughly piss off the man he 's trying to channel in his bid for the presidency , Ronald Reagan .
Forget too about his friendship with the inveterate scumbag Charles Keating and McCain 's rather revolting membership in the Keating Five .
Again , it was years ago and he managed to slime his way out of it with minimal damage done .
Forget his ( literal ) embrace of George W. Bush after Bushie 's campaign spread vicious rumors ( illegitimate black babies , anyone ? ) about him during the 2000 election .
That was just a pragmatic move by a politician who decided to lay down his spine for his ambition .
And even forget about his undying support for the war in Iraq and his vague promise of more war to come .
That 's a fair election issue ( wrong as it may be ) and one that should probably percolate through the electorate .
But this Sarah Palin thing , well , dammit , now he 's disqualified .
This bird he chose as his running mate has way too much family drama in her life to qualify her to run the local PTA , let alone the free world .
She has a tiny baby with Down 's Syndrome and now we learn that her 17 - year - old daughter is pregnant with a baby of her own , which she 's keeping .
( You do n't think that family has had long and hard thoughts about the right to choose lately do you ? ) .
Look , this should n't be a moral thing ( though the Religious Right would have a field day if it were a Democrat in the same situation ) .
It might be a good argument against abstinence training , though .
And it certainly sets a lousy example .
But it really boils down to a 17 - year - old making a huge mistake .
Bristol Palin had the world in her hands and now , as her parents have conceded , she 's going to have to grow up way too fast .
But the point is that we should n't even know about Bristol Palin .
It 's not fair to her and it 's not fair to us .
This should be a drama for the Palin family , or at best , the state of Alaska .
Absurdly , thanks to McCain , now it 's America 's concern .
McCain et al spilled the beans about Bristol because rumors were circulating on the Internet that Sarah Palin 's new baby is actually Bristol 's too .
So when was the McCain camp planning on spilling the secret ?
After the election ?
Unforgivable .
Do n't tell me this is a private matter .
It 's not , even though Republican die - hards are going to say that opinions like mine are offensive and sexist ( yes , you 're going to start hearing Republicans sounding like Gloria Steinem ; every criticism of Palin is going to be " demeaning to women " ) .
Think about it .
If McCain wins this thing , the only thing separating Palin from the presidency will be a 72 - year - old man with a history of cancer .
She will be your president .
Sorry , but that puts everything on the table , most certainly the fact that her minor daughter is having a baby .
Again , how can a woman with two new babies under her care -- and a troubled teenaged daughter that obviously needs a lot of help to build her future -- possibly have time to run the country ?
Her hands are full .
Both of them .
In ten years , she might be ready .
But the dough is still in the oven ( in more ways than one ) .
Even if Palin did have the time , even if she was a modern Superwoman as they say ( though such phenomena do n't exist ) , she 's not qualified for the job and McCain should know it .
Let 's see , she was Miss Wasilla , mayor of a backwoods town , and a sports reporter ?
Hey , she did get to be governor of faraway Alaska , but she 's had the job for only 20 months , hardly enough time to prove herself .
And now we have all this drama over babies ' mamas .
It 's a ridiculous diversion from real issues -- and I wonder if McCain and his people did n't welcome it , considering what their party has done to the country .
The whole thing is an insult , no matter how you look at it .
When I told my 13 - year - old son about it , he was incredulous .
I asked him what he thought of it .
" That 's messed up , " is all he said .
I can hear people across the country saying the same thing .
That 's the first response , no matter how much spin a bunch of soulless politicos try to put on it .
Palin should step down and McCain should find another pick .
Lastly , this is n't about Sarah Palin , either .
It 's all about John McCain .
And he 's proving to be one very bad joke .
-- Okay , one last thing :
This does not quite kill the rumors about the other baby , Trig , being Bristol 's as well .
Just by way of information check out this video from a slightly creepy guy who lays out the case .
Daniel James was paralysed during a training session Police are investigating the death of a paralysed rugby player who travelled to a Swiss assisted suicide clinic .
Daniel James , 23 , of Worcester , died on 12 September in a clinic where he had travelled with the intention of killing himself , an inquest heard .
West Mercia Police said a man and a woman had been questioned .
Mr James ' parents said that their son had tried " several " times to kill himself before he " gained his wish " .
Assisted suicide is illegal in the UK .
However , the practice is tolerated by the authorities in Switzerland .
The parents defended their son's decision , saying he was " an intelligent young man of sound mind " who was " not prepared to live what he felt was a second - class existence " .
The clinic Dignitas , where all known British assisted suicides have taken place , said that due to privacy laws it could not disclose whether Mr James was one of its members .
BBC
News correspondent Fiona Trott said there were reports that the man and woman being questioned were Mr James ' mother and father , although this had not been confirmed by the family 's solicitor .
Mr James played rugby for England Under 16s and England students and was tipped for a future in the professional game .
But during a training session at Nuneaton Rugby Club he suffered a collapsed spine in a scrum in March 2007 .
The former pupil at Worcester Royal Grammar School was paralysed from the chest down .
' Investigation ongoing '
An inquest into his death was opened and adjourned on 19 September .
A trust set up in his name after his accident has raised nearly £ 25,000 for spinal research .
Det Insp Adrian Todd , of West Mercia Police , said : " A police investigation is ongoing and officers have spoken with a man and a woman in connection with the case .
" A report will later be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service and an inquest into the death will take place in due course . "
Mr James ( centre ) played for England Under 16s and England students BBC correspondent Imogen Foulkes , in Berne , said assisted suicide has raised issues of concern in Switzerland .
She said it was permitted as long as the person carries out the act themselves and the helper has no " direct interest " .
Dignitas offers help to people to end their lives if they are suffering a terminal illness , a chronic condition ( including paralysis ) or a mental illness .
The only stipulation is that a patient has expressed a wish to die and this has been certified by a doctor .
But the actions of Dignitas have provoked controversy and disquiet in Switzerland .
The issue of assisted suicide is now the subject of a government inquiry , the results of which are expected to be released early next year .
The inquiry will look at the counsel and care provided by assisted suicide groups and the practice of offering assisted suicide to non-Swiss citizens .

What are these ?
After the gradual collapse of this 3.7 - mile - long area of plateaus , the remains settled as a large outcropping of mesas and layered rocks .
Scientists have formulated many possible explanations for the different layers , including dust , sand , volcanic ash or lake deposits .
The color variations in the image ( sand is represented in blue ) might indicate further erosion .
Studying the material composition of the hills and knobs will aid scientists in determining the geological history of Mars , and help determine whether humans could ever settle atop such a jagged landscape .

Gov. Corzine of New Jersey chimed in that a family of five would not get any more money than a family of four .
And , he said , McCain makes no special provision for people who have health problems , a group that pays extra in the private market , if they can even find an insurer that will sell them a policy .

The unexpected rejection by the US Congress of the Bush Administration financial rescue plan , TARP on September 29 has opened up the spectre for the first time of a 1931 - style domino wave of worldwide bank failures .
That is already underway across the US banking spectrum with the failure , nationalization or forced liquidation in the past two weeks of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , of the giant Washington Mutual mortgage lender , of the nation ’s fourth largest deposit bank , Wachovia .
That was on top of a wave of smaller bank failures that began with IndyMac in the spring .
For some it is appealing and more simple to grasp the magnitude of these titanic events in the US - centered financial world by assuming it is all part of a pre-planned grand conspiracy by the Money Masters , what in the 1920s in the USA was termed the Money Trust , to control the entire financial world .
Paulson ’s plan , the one essentially rejected on September 29 by the House of Representatives , would have done nothing to recapitalize the troubled banks .
That recapitalization could cost an added hundreds of billions on top of the $ 700 billion toxic waste disposal .
As the details of the present crisis reveal , there are huge ideological fault lines making for chaos and a potential meltdown of the Laissez Faire financial system .
That present system , which was built on the back of Wall Street financial and banking deregulation since 1987 when Alan Greenspan , a devout follower and close friend of radical individualist Ayn Rand , became Wall Street ’s man at the Federal Reserve for almost 19 years , is over now with the failure of the Henry Paulson $ 700 billion bailout scheme .
Governments worldwide now face no alternative but to begin the painful process of putting the financial genie back in the bottle and re-regulating an out - of - control financial system .
The failure of the UK Government and the US Government to address that fundamental issue is behind the present crisis of confidence .
A brief look at history
The Great Depression in Germany in 1931 began with a seemingly minor event — the collapse of a bank in Vienna , Creditanstalt , that May .
For readers interested in more on the remarkable parallels between that crisis and that of today , I recommend the treatment in my earlier volume , A Century of War : Anglo - American Oil Politics and the New World Order .
That Vienna bank collapse in turn was triggered by a political decision in Paris to sabotage an emerging German - Austrian economic cooperation agreement by pulling down the weakest link of the post - Versailles system , the Vienna Creditanstalt .
In the process , Paris triggered a series of tragic events that led to the failure of the German banking system over a period of several weeks .
The post -1919 Versailles System , much like the post -1999 US Securitization System , was built on a house of cards with no foundation .
When one card was removed , the entire international financial edifice crumbled .
Then , in 1931 , there was an inept Brüning government in Germany , which believed severe austerity was the only solution , merely feeding unemployment lines to pay the Young Plan German reparations to the new Bank for International Settlements in Basle .
Then , in 1931 George Harrison , a Germano - phobe , was the inexperienced Governor of the powerful New York Federal Reserve .
Harrison was a member of the anglophile Skull & Bones , the elite Yale University secret society which also included George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush as initiates .
Harrison , who went on to coordinate the secret Manhattan Project on the development of the Atomic bomb under fellow Skull & Bones member , War Secretary Henry Stimson , believed the crisis had started not from abroad but with German bankers trying to make a profit at the expense of others .
Within weeks of rumor and jitters , the New York Bankers Trust , ironically today a part of Deutsche Bank , announced it would be forced to cut the credit line to Deutsche Bank and by July 1931 began to pull its deposits from all big Berlin banks .
Harrison insisted the Reichsbank dramatically raise interest rates to stabilize things , only turning bad into worse as a credit crisis across the German economy ensued .
The Bank of England Governor , Montagu Norman , while somewhat more supportive of Luther argued that his friend Hjalmar Schacht was better suited to manage the crisis .
On July 13 , 1931 , a major German bank , Darmstädter - und Nationalbank ( Danat ) failed .
That triggered a general a depositors ’ run on all German banks .
The Brüning government merged the Danat with a weakly capitalized Dresdner Bank , and made large state guarantees in an effort to calm matters .
It did n’t .
New York Fed governor , Harrison , who was personally convinced it was a ‘ German ’ problem , barked orders to Reichsbank chief Hans Luther on how to manage the crisis according to archival accounts .
A foreign drain on Reichsbank gold reserves ensued .
The rest is history , the tragic history of the greatest most destructive war of the 20th Century , with all the suffering that ensued .
At that time in history , the American banking elite saw itself , despite a stock market crash and Great Depression in America , as standing at the dawn of a new American Century .
The decline of the American Century
Today , in 2008 , some 77 years later , a German Finance Minister stands before the Bundestag announcing the end of that American Century .
Today the German government encourages a fusion of Dresdner with Commerzbank .
Today Deutsche Bank , which some years ago acquired Bankers Trust in New York in a merger wave , appears to be in a stronger position than its American counterparts as Wall Street investment banks , some more than 150 years old as the venerable Lehman Bros. , simply vanish in a matter of days .
The American financial Superpower crumbles before our eyes .
In March 2008 there were five giant Wall Street investment banks , banks which underwrote Mortgage - Backed Securities ( MBS ) , corporate bonds , corporate stock issues .
They were not deposit banks like Citibank or Bank of America ; they were known as investment banks —
Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch , Goldman Sachs , Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns .
The business of taking deposits and lending by banks had been split during the Great Depression from the business of underwriting and selling stocks and bonds — investment banking — by an act of Congress , the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 .
The law was passed amid the collapse of the banking system in the United States following the bursting of the Wall Street stock market bubble in October 1929 .
That Glass - Steagall act was a prudent attempt by Congress to end the uncontrolled speculative excesses of the Roaring Twenties by New York finance .
It established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to guarantee personal bank deposits to a fixed sum that restored consumer confidence and ended the panic runs on bank deposits .
In November 1999 , after millions spent lobbying Congress , the New York banks and Wall Street investment banks and insurance companies won a staggering victory .
The US Congress voted to repeal that 1933 Glass - Steagall Act. President Bill Clinton proudly signed the repeal act with Sandford Weill , the chairman of Citigroup .
The man whose name is on that repeal bill was Texas Senator Phil Gramm , a devout advocate of ideological free market finance , finance free from any Government fetters .
The major US banks had been seeking the repeal of Glass - Steagall since the 1980s .
In 1987 the Congressional Research Service prepared a report which argued the case for preserving Glass - Steagall .
The new Federal Reserve chairman , Alan Greenspan , just fresh from J.P. Morgan bank on Wall Street , in one of his first speeches to Congress in 1987 argued for repeal of Glass - Steagall .
The repeal allowed commercial banks such as Citigroup , then the largest US bank , to underwrite and trade new financial instruments such as Mortgage - Backed Securities ( MBS ) and Collateralized Debt Obligations ( CDOs ) and establish so - called structured investment vehicles , or SIVs , that bought those securities .
Repeal of Glass - Steagall after 1999 , in short , enabled the Securitization revolution so openly praised by Greenspan as the " revolution in finance . "
That revolution is today devouring its young .
That securitization process is at the heart of the present Financial Tsunami that is destroying the American credit structure .
Citigroup played a major part in the repeal of Glass–Steagall in 1999 .
Citicorp had merged with Travelers Insurance company the year before , using a loophole in Glass - Steagall that allowed for temporary exemption .
Alan Greenspan gave his personal blessing to the Citibank merger .
Phil Gramm , the original sponsor of the Glass - Steagall repeal bill that bears his name , went on to become the chief economic adviser to John McCain .
Gramm also went on to become Vice Chairman of a sizeable Swiss bank , UBS Investment Bank , in the USA , a bank which has had no small share of troubles in the current Tsunami crisis .
Gramm as Senator in 2000 was one of five co-sponsors of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 .
A provision of the bill was referred to as the ‘ Enron loophole ’ because the it was later applied to Enron to allow them unregulated speculation in energy futures , a key factor in the Enron scandal and collapse .
The Commodity Futures Modernization Act , as I described in my earlier piece in May , Perhaps 60 % of Today ’s Oil Price is Pure Speculation , allowed investment bank Goldman Sachs ( coincidentally the former bank of Treasury Secretary Paulson ) , to make a literal killing in manipulating oil futures prices up to $ 147 a barrel this summer .
Paulson ’s impressive interest conflicts
The actions of Treasury Secretary Paulson since the first outbreak of the Financial Tsunami in August of 2007 have been directed with one apparent guiding aim — to save the obscene gains of his Wall Street and banking cronies .
In the process he has taken steps which suggest more than a mild possible conflict of interest .
Paulson , who had been chairman of Goldman Sachs from the time of the 1999 Glass - Steagall repeal to his appointment in 2006 as Treasury head , had been one of the most involved Wall Street players in the new securitization revolution of Greenspan .
Naming him to head the Government agency now responsible for cleaning up the mess left by Wall Street greed and stupidity was tantamount to putting the wolf in charge of guarding the hen house as some see it .
Paulson showed where his interests lay .
He is by law is the chairman of something called the President ’s Working Group on Financial Markets , the Government ’s financial crisis management group that also includes Fed Chairman Bernanke , the Securities & Exchange Commission head , and the head of the Commodity Futures Exchange Commission ( CFTC ) .
That is the reason Paulson , the ex-Wall Street Goldman Sachs banker , is always the person announcing new emergency decisions since last August .
Two weeks ago , for example , Paulson announced the Government would make an unprecedented $ 85 billion nationalization rescue of an insurance group , AIG .
True AIG is the world ’s largest insurer and has a huge global involvement in financial markets .
AIG ’s former Chairman , Hank Greenberg — a close friend of Henry Kissinger , a former Director of the New York Fed , former Vice Chairman of the elite New York Council on Foreign Relations and of David Rockefeller ’s select Trilateral Commission , Trustee Emeritus of Rockefeller University — was for more than forty years Chairman of AIG .
His AIG career ended in March 2005 when AIG ’s board forced Greenberg to resign from his post as Chairman and CEO under the shadow of criticism and legal action for cooking the books , in a prosecution brought by Eliot Spitzer , then Attorney General of New York State .
In mid September , in between other dramatic failures including Lehman Bros. , and the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Paulson announced that the US Treasury , as agent for the United States Government , was to bailout the troubled AIG with a staggering $ 85 billion .
The announcement came a day after Paulson announced the Government would let the 150 - year old investment bank , Lehman Brothers , fail without Government aid .
Why AIG and not Lehman ?
What has since emerged are details of a meeting at the New York Federal Reserve bank chaired by Paulson , to discuss the risk of letting AIG fail .
There was only one active Wall Street banker present at the meeting — Lloyd Blankfein , chairman of Paulson ’s old firm , Goldman Sachs .
Blankfein later claimed he was present at the fateful meeting not to protect his firm ’s interests but to ‘ safeguard the entire financial system . ’
His claim was put in doubt when it later emerged that Blankfein ’s Goldman Sachs was AIG ’s largest trading partner and stood to lose $ 20 billion in a bankruptcy of AIG .
Were Goldman Sachs to go down with AIG , Secretary Paulson would have reportedly lost $ 700 million in Goldman Sachs stock options he had , an interesting fact .
That is a tiny glimpse into the man who crafted the largest bailout in US or world financial history some days ago , the failed TARP — Troubled Asset Relief Program — a proposed $ 700 billion financial stabilization scheme which , in Paulson ’s original version would have allowed him or his Treasury successor to use $ 700 billion , with no oversight or accountability , to buy bad or worthless assets from financial institutions he deems worthy of help .
As respected economist , Nouriel Roubini pointed out , in almost every case of recent banking crises in which emergency action was needed to save the financial system , the most economical ( to taxpayers ) method was to have the Government , as in Sweden or Finland in the early 1990 ’s , nationalize the troubled banks , take over their management and assets , and inject public capital to recapitalize the banks to allow them to continue doing business , lending to normal clients .
In the Swedish case , the Government held the assets , mostly real estate , for several years until the economy again improved at which point they could sell them onto the market and the banks could gradially buy the state ownership shares back into private hands .
In the Swedish case the end cost to taxpayers was estimated to have been almost nil .
The state never did as Paulson proposed , to buy the toxic waste of the banks , leaving them to get off free from their follies of securitization and speculation abuses .
Paulson ’s plan , the one essentially rejected on September 29 by the House of Representatives , would have done nothing to recapitalize the troubled banks .
That recapitalization could cost an added hundreds of billions on top of the $ 700 billion toxic waste disposal .
Serious conservative banker friends I know who went through the Scandinavian crisis of the 1990’s are scratching their head trying to imagine how crass the Paulson TARP scheme was .
That crass and politically obvious bailout of Wall Street by the taxpayers , what some refer to as ‘ Bankers ’ Socialism — socialize the costs of failure onto the public , and privatize the profits to the bankers — is a major factor behind the defeat of the TARP compromise version .
But there is an added element .
John McCain decided to boost his flagging Presidential campaign by trying to profile himself as a ‘ political Maverick ’ one who opposes the powerful Washington vested interests .
He flew into Washington days before the TARP was to be approved by a panicked Congress and conspired with a handful of influential Republican Senate friends , including Banking Committee ranking member , Senator Shelby , to oppose the Paulson TARP .
What emerged , with McCain ’s backing , was a political power play that may well have brought the United States financial system to its knees , and McCain ’s Presidential hopes with it .
Power and greed are the only visible juice driving the decision - makers in Washington today .
Acting in the long - range US national interest seems to have gotten lost in the scramble .
As I wrote last November in my Financial Tsunami five part series on the background to today ’s crisis , all this could be foreseen .
It is what happens when elected Governments abandon their public trust or responsibility to a cabal of private financial interests .
It will be interesting to see if anyone in Washington realizes that lesson .
Whatever next comes out of Washington , however , one thing is clear , as reflected in what German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Bundestag .
This is the end of the world as we knew it .
The American financial Superpower is gone .
The only important question will be what and how will the alternative be .

No Identity Protection is Guaranteed
Under the best circumstances , most identity protection services can only provide a few ways to prevent identity theft .
That ’s because the protections they offer only operate at the credit bureau level , which reports on transactions related to credit cards , loans , and mortgages .
Things like obtaining fake driver ’s licenses , receiving medical care under a false name , and giving a fake SSN to avoid arrest typically do n’t go through the credit bureaus so identity protection services are n’t able to help .
The problem with any sort of identity protection is that nothing is foolproof .
Protecting yourself at the credit bureau level only works as long as the agency issuing the credit actually goes through the bureaus .
If they do n’t , they have no idea that you ’ve put protective measures in place , and they may go ahead and issue credit to an impostor .
It ’s almost impossible to protect yourself against driver ’s license or medical fraud because most state agencies and healthcare providers do n’t run checks at all and assume the information is legitimate .
It ’s also very easy for a thief to steal a credit card or bank account number and treat themselves to a shopping spree that you learn about only after you ’re missing the funds .
A protection service cannot stop these types of transactions .
Only constant vigilance and some proactive steps on your part can help to prevent identity theft , and even then , you wo n’t have a 100 % guarantee .
Do n’t Pay to Protect Your Identity
So if it ’s so hard to protect your identity , what can you do and should you pay someone else to do it for you ?
The answer to the second question is a definitive “ No . ” What most identity protection services claim to do , you can take care of on your own for free .
You ’ll get the same level of protection and have control over the process ( and you wo n’t be giving out your personal information to yet another company , which puts you at risk if their database is ever compromised ) .
As for what you can and should do , below are the four main protections that many of these services employ and how to do them yourself .
Then I have some ideas that go beyond their protection .
1. Set a Fraud Alert
This is free to do .
All you have to do is call one of the bureaus or visit their website and answer the questions .
You do n’t even have to speak to a person .
The alert is then passed from the bureau you contacted to the other two — you do n’t even have to contact the other two , it ’s done for you .
The alert is good for 90 days and lets credit issuers know that you may have been the victim of fraud and that they should request additional information or documentation before issuing credit .
It does n’t stop the issuance of credit but it does , if followed correctly by the issuer , cut down on incidents of identity theft .
You can renew the alert every 90 days .
2. Remove Your Name From Pre-Approved Credit Card Offers
Contact Opt- Out Prescreen or call 1-888-567-8688 ( 888-5-OPT - OUT ) to remove your name from pre-screened credit card offers .
Contact the Direct Marketer ’s Association to be removed from many junk mailing lists .
The DMA is the largest database used by solicitors , so opting out with the DMA greatly reduces junk mail .
Read the privacy policies of companies you do business with and find out how to let them know that you do n’t want your information shared .
If you get junk mail with a prepaid mailer , you can stuff their materials into the envelope and write , “ Remove me from your list ” on the material .
This usually works , although it may take awhile .
Make certain when doing business online that you uncheck any boxes that say , “ Contact me with future offers , ” or similar .
Many websites pre-check these for you in the hopes you wo n’t notice , leaving it to you to opt out of their crap .
3. Order Your Free Credit Reports and Monitor Them
You are entitled to one free credit report per year from each of the three major credit reporting agencies , Experian , TransUnion , and Equifax .
You get these reports through AnnualCreditReport.com and should only use this site .
Others that sound similar require you to pay .
But do n’t request them all at once .
Since you can get one per year from each service , you can request one every four months to keep a constant eye on your credit .
So , for example , if you request from Equifax in January , wait until May to request one from TransUnion .
Then request one from Experian in September .
Then , when January rolls around , you request from Equifax again and keep the cycle going .
This means you ’re seeing your credit report once every four months which lets you catch potential problems quicker than if you look at it only once a year or less often .
4. Keep Important Records
Keep records of your credit card numbers , bank accounts , insurance cards , and driver ’s license information ( and contact information for each agency ) separate from your wallet or purse .
Make photocopies of sensitive items that you carry and keep them in a secure location separate from your wallet .
If your wallet or purse is stolen , you can quickly contact each bank and card issuer and notify them of the theft so they can shut down your accounts and open new ones .
Other Ways to Prevent Identity
Theft for Free
If you want to go beyond these services ( and you should ) , here are other steps you can take to help secure your identity .
Use a cross-cut shredder
Shred anything with your SSN , bank account numbers , address , or other personal information .
Be especially sure to shred pre-approved credit card offers and balance transfer checks .
Get a cross-cut shredder or “ confetti ” shredder because these reduce your papers to tiny bits that are almost impossible to put back together .
Some shredders make strips which are too easy for a thief to put back together .
Freeze your credit
This is n’t free , but the peace of mind is worth it .
It is similar to a fraud alert except that it cannot be ignored by a lender .
A fraud alert merely tells a lender that you may have been a victim of fraud and that they should request proper identification and verification before issuing credit .
However , a freeze locks your credit file so that it cannot be viewed at all unless you “ unfreeze ” it .
There is a fee to freeze your credit and another fee when you want to unfreeze it , so if you ’re actively pursuing loans this option is n’t for you .
Freezing your credit also means that you ca n’t be spontaneous about getting credit .
If you ’re shopping and see a great same as cash deal or want a store credit card , you ’ll have to wait because you ’ll have to unfreeze your credit before you can apply .
Freezing and unfreezing are n’t instant — there are a few days of processing time — so be prepared to wait if you need credit in a hurry .
Do n’t let your credit or debit cards out of your sight
It is common for restaurants to take your card away and run the payment at a register out of your sight .
Unfortunately , some servers are dishonest and run your card through a “ skimmer ” that captures the card ’s information so a new one can be made .
Bring cash to restaurants that you know will take your card away .
Also do n’t let a clerk in a store take your card out of your sight .
Some dishonest clerks will say they have to get manager approval of your transaction , then go to a back room and skim your card .
Be wary of ATM ’s that look altered
Thieves will attach skimmers to ATM slots to capture card information and PIN’s .
You may notice that the slot looks lumpy or not firmly attached to the machine , or as if there is another piece of hardware attached to the front .
If it looks fishy , do n’t use it .
This is less likely to happen at bank ATM ’s since they are more aware of the problem and may be more religious in checking their machines .
However , it can happen anywhere so be vigilant .
Protect your PIN
When at an ATM , cover the keypad with your hand and do the same as you tap in the information on pads in stores .
In a store , you can avoid entering your PIN altogether by running the transaction as “ credit ” rather than “ debit . ”
It does n’t change how you withdraw your money , you just do n’t have to enter your PIN .
Do n’t get caught by phishing scams or phone scams
You hear it all the time , but it bears repeating :
Never give personal information out over the phone unless you initiate the call and never enter information into a form you reached by a link in an email .
Always type the website directly into your browser and navigate from there .
If in doubt , call the company that sent the email or made the phone call and ask if it ’s legitimate .
Spring for an unlisted phone number
Having an unlisted phone number cuts down on the number of phone solicitations you receive and cuts down on people just pulling a phone number and address out of the book and giving it as their own .
It also cuts down on some junk mail solicitors that compile their lists from phone listings .
Do n’t give out your SSN unless you have no other choice
Many places that ask for your SSN ( except banks or those issuing credit ) will accept another identifier if you ask .
Many are aware of the problems of identity theft and may be willing to work with you .
If someone asks for your SSN , ask why they need it and if there is an alternative and , if you ’re not satisfied with the answer , consider whether or not you ’re willing to take the risk .
Do n’t carry your SSN with you
Do n’t carry anything with your SSN in your wallet or purse unless you are going to need it that day .
If your wallet or purse is stolen it ’s a pain to cancel and reissue credit cards and bank accounts , but it ’s so much worse if the thief gets your SSN in the bargain .
While you ’re at it , purge your wallet of any credit cards , insurance cards , or other identifying information you do n’t use on a regular basis to cut down on the items a thief has access to .
Protect your computer
Install antivirus and anti-spyware protection on your computer to prevent anyone from installing malicious software that can capture your personal information or transmit it to another party .
Make certain websites are secure before entering personal information ( look for “ https ” in the web address and / or a lock icon in the browser window ) .
Do n’t enter personal information when using public computers at schools , universities , libraries , coffee shops , etc .
You do n’t know what kind of protection , if any , they have in place .
Leave information off your checks
Do n’t put your SSN , phone number , or driver ’s license number on your checks .
In the old days , the advice was to put this information on checks to speed processing and verification .
But now this is just more information that a thief can use against you .
Only put your name and address on a check .
If the person taking the check requests additional information , you can give it if you feel comfortable ( but do n’t give the SSN — they do n’t need that ) , but otherwise do n’t give it out .
Monitor your accounts online
Many banks and credit cards now offer online access to your accounts .
Take advantage of this and monitor your accounts daily or every other day to check for suspicious activity .
This gives you a chance to quickly catch a thief before there is too much damage .
If you only wait for the monthly statement , you may be too late .
Sign up for e-billing and e-statements
Receiving bills and account statements electronically cuts down on the chances of someone intercepting your information in the mail , either through intentional theft or in the even your mail just goes to the wrong place .
Buy a safe
Keep sensitive documents ( tax returns , bank statements , passports , Social Security cards , etc. ) in a safe .
If your home is broken into , a safe may keep your information out of the wrong hands .
Alternatively , you can rent a safe deposit box at your bank but this can be inconvenient if you need the documents and the bank is closed .
And do n’t keep documents any longer than necessary .
Shred or burn statements , tax returns , and old bills that you no longer need .
Be careful with your mail
Opting out of junk mail and signing up for e-billing and e-statements where possible will greatly decrease your risk of mail - related identity theft , but you can go further .
Do n’t leave sensitive outgoing mail in your mailbox for pickup .
It can easily be stolen while you ’re not looking .
Take it to the post office .
If you ’re going to be out of town , either have your mail held at the post office or have a trusted friend pick it up .
Do n’t let it pile up in the box where thieves can get to it .
Retrieve your mail as soon as possible .
If you are n’t home when the mail comes , get it out of the box as soon as you get home .
Do n’t leave it there overnight .
You might also consider a locking mailbox .
These are so mail deliverers can open and close them , but after that , you ’ll need a combination or a key because it ’ll reset for the next day ’s delivery .
Do n’t leave personal information out in the open
Each day there are more stories of contractors or delivery people who enter homes and steal the homeowners ’ identities .
Maybe they left their checkbook out in the open , or an old bank statement , or an insurance claim with their SSN on it .
In any event , the contractor simply needs to copy the information and they ’re able to steal the homeowners ’ identity .
If you ’re having contractor services or deliveries , make certain that any compromising information is out of sight and preferably locked up .
And be sure to keep an eye on the people who are in your home .
Bottom Line : You Do n’t Have to Pay for Protection
Yes , you can pay a service to do some of these things for you , but if the protection you ’re paying for is no better , or possibly worse , than what you can do yourself for free , why pay for it ?
Taking some simple steps and using some common sense can go a long way toward protecting your identity .
There is no guarantee , even with companies that charge you for protection .
If you ’re the victim of a particularly savvy or determined thief you may still have your identity stolen .
However , if you are proactive about protecting yourself , you ’ll be able to identify potential problems sooner than if you do nothing .

A frequently asked question is : how realistic is the scene in 2001 : A Space Odyssey where astronaut Bowman makes a space - walk without a helmet ?
How long could a human survive if exposed to vacuum ?
Would you explode ?
Would you survive ?
How long would you remain conscious ?
The quick answers to these questions are : Clarke got it about right in 2001 .
You would survive about a ninety seconds , you would n't explode , you would remain conscious for about ten seconds .
Astronaut Bowman ejected into space without a helmet
Could You Survive ?
The best data I have comes from the chapter on the effects of Barometric pressure in Bioastronautics Data Book , Second edition , NASA SP - 3006 .
This chapter discusses animal studies of decompression to vacuum .
It does not mention any human studies .
page 5 , ( following a general discussion of low pressures and ebullism ) , the author gives an account of what is to be the expected result of vacuum exposure :
" Some degree of consciousness will probably be retained for 9 to 11 seconds ( see chapter 2 under Hypoxia ) .
In rapid sequence thereafter , paralysis will be followed by generalized convulsions and paralysis once again .
During this time , water vapor will form rapidly in the soft tissues and somewhat less rapidly in the venous blood .
This evolution of water vapor will cause marked swelling of the body to perhaps twice its normal volume unless it is restrained by a pressure suit .
( It has been demonstrated that a properly fitted elastic garment can entirely prevent ebullism at pressures as low as 15 mm Hg absolute [ Webb , 1969 , 1970 ] . )
Heart rate may rise initially , but will fall rapidly thereafter .
Arterial blood pressure will also fall over a period of 30 to 60 seconds , while venous pressure rises due to distention of the venous system by gas and vapor .
Venous pressure will meet or exceed arterial pressure within one minute .
There will be virtually no effective circulation of blood .
After an initial rush of gas from the lungs during decompression , gas and water vapor will continue to flow outward through the airways .
This continual evaporation of water will cool the mouth and nose to near - freezing temperatures ; the remainder of the body will also become cooled , but more slowly .
" Cook and Bancroft ( 1966 ) reported occasional deaths of animals due to fibrillation of the heart during the first minute of exposure to near vacuum conditions .
Ordinarily , however , survival was the rule if recompression occurred within about 90 seconds .
...
Once heart action ceased , death was inevitable , despite attempts at resuscitation .... [ on recompression ]
" Breathing usually began spontaneously ...
Neurological problems , including blindness and other defects in vision , were common after exposures ( see problems due to evolved gas ) , but usually disappeared fairly rapidly .
" It is very unlikely that a human suddenly exposed to a vacuum would have more than 5 to 10 seconds to help himself .
If immediate help is at hand , although one 's appearance and condition will be grave , it is reasonable to assume that recompression to a tolerable pressure ( 200 mm Hg , 3.8 psia ) within 60 to 90 seconds could result in survival , and possibly in rather rapid recovery . "
Note that this discussion covers the effect of vacuum exposure only .
The decompression event itself can have disasterous effects if the person being decompressed makes the mistake of trying to hold his or her breath .
This will result in rupturing of the lungs , with almost certainly fatal results .
There is a good reason that it is called " explosive " decompression .
Will You Stay Conscious ?
The Bioastronautics Data Book answers this question : " Some degree of consciousness will probably be retained for 9 to 11 seconds ....
It is very unlikely that a human suddenly exposed to a vacuum would have more than 5 to 10 seconds to help himself . "
A larger body of information about how long you would remain conscious comes from aviation medicine .
Aviation medicine defines the " time of useful consciousness " , that is , how long after a decompression incident pilots will be awake and be sufficiently aware to take active measures to save their lives .
Above 50,000 feet ( 15 km ) , the time of useful consciousness is 9 to 12 seconds , as quoted by the FAA in table 1 - 1 in Advisory Circular 61 - 107 ( the shorter figure is for a person actively moving ; the longer figure is for a person sitting quietly ) .
The USAF Flight Surgeon 's Guide figure 2 - 3 shows 12 seconds of useful consciousness above 60,000 ft ( 18 km ) ; presumably the longer time listed is based on the assumption that Air Force pilots are well - trained in high - altitude procedures , and will be able to use their time effectively even when partially disfunctional from hypoxia .
Linda Pendleton adds to this : " An explosive or rapid decompression will cut this time in half due to the startle factor and the accelerated rate at which an adrenaline - soaked body burns oxygen . "
Advisory Circular 61-107 says the time of useful consciousness above 50,000 ft will drop from 9 to 12 seconds down to 5 seconds in the case of rapid decompression ( presumably due to the " startle " factor discussed by Pendleton ) .
A slightly more general interest book , Survival in Space by Richard Harding , echoes this conclusion :
" At altitudes greater than 45,000 feet ( 13,716 m ) , unconsciousness develops in fifteen to twenty seconds with death following four minutes or so later . "
and later :
" monkeys and dogs have successfully recovered from brief ( up to two minutes ) unprotected exposures ... "
Would Your Blood Boil ?
No .
Your blood is at a higher pressure than the outside environment .
A typical blood pressure might be 75/120 .
The " 75 " part of this means that between heartbeats , the blood is at a pressure of 75 Torr ( equal to about 100 mbar ) above the external pressure .
If the external pressure drops to zero , at a blood pressure of 75 Torr the boiling point of water is 46 degrees Celsius ( 115 F ) .
This is well above body temperature of 37 C ( 98.6 F ) .
Blood wo n't boil , because the elastic pressure of the blood vessels keeps it it a pressure high enough that the body temperature is below the boiling point -- at least , until the heart stops beating ( at which point you have other things to worry about ! ) .
( To be more pedantic , blood pressure varies depending on where in the body it is measured , so the above statement should be understood as a generalization .
However , the effect of small pockets of localized vapor is to increase the pressure .
In places where the blood pressure is lowest , the vapor pressure will rise until equilibrium is reached .
The net result is the same . )
Would You Freeze ?
No .
A few recent Hollywood films showed people instantly freezing solid when exposed to vacuum .
In one of these , the scientist character mentioned that the temperature was " minus 273 " -- that is , absolute zero .
But in a practical sense , space does n't really have a temperature -- you can't measure a temperature on a vacuum , something that is n't there .
The residual molecules that do exist are n't enough to have much of any effect .
Space is n't " cold , " it is n't " hot " , it really is n't anything .
What space is , though , is a very good insulator .
( In fact , vacuum is the secret behind thermos bottles . )
Astronauts tend to have more problem with overheating than keeping warm .
If you were exposed to space without a spacesuit , your skin would most feel slightly cool , due to water evaporating off you skin , leading to a small amount of evaporative cooling .
But you would n't freeze solid !
Has Anybody Ever Survived Vacuum Exposure in Real Life ?
Human experience is discussed by Roth , in the NASA technical report Rapid ( Explosive ) Decompression Emergencies in Pressure - Suited Subjects .
Its focus is on decompression , rather than vacuum exposure per se , but it still has a lot of good information , including the results of decompression events involving humans .
There are several cases of humans surviving exposure to vacuum worth noting .
In 1966 a technician at NASA Houston was decompressed to vacuum in a space - suit test accident .
This case is discussed by Roth in the reference above .
He lost consciousness in 12 - 15 seconds .
When pressure was restored after about 30 seconds of exposure , he regained consciousness , with no apparent injury sustained .
A few further details are given here .
Before jumping to the conclusion that space exposure is harmless , however , it is worth noting that in the same report , Roth includes a report of the autopsy of the victim of a slightly longer explosive decompression incident :
" Immediately following rapid decompression , it was noted that he began to cough moderately .
Very shortly after this he was seen to lose consciousness , and the picture described by the physicians on duty was that the patient remained deeply cyanotic , totally unresponsive and flaccid during the 2 - 3 minutes [ to repressurise the altitude chamber ] down to ground level .
... " Manual artificial respiration was begun immediately ...
The patient at no time breathed spontaneously ; however , at the moment ground level was reached he was seen to give a few gasps .
These were very irregular and only two or three in number .
...
" The conclusion of the [ autopsy ] report was as follows : " The major pathologic changes as outlined above are consistent with asphyxia .
It is felt that the underlying cause of death in this case may be attributed to acute cardio - respiratory failure , secondary to bilateral pneumothorax ... " "
Many other cases of death following decompression are noted in the aviation literature , including one spaceflight incident , the Soyuz - 11 decompression accident , in 1971 .
A recent analysis of this accident can be found in D. J. Shayler , Disasters and Accidents in Manned Spaceflight .
On the subject of partial - body vacuum exposure , the results are not quite as serious .
In 1960 , during a high - altitude balloon parachute - jump , a partial - body vacuum exposure incident occurred when Joe Kittinger , Jr. lost pressurization in his right glove during an ascent to 103,000 ft ( 19.5 miles ) in an unpressurized balloon gondola , Despite the depressurization , he continued the mission , and although the hand became painful and useless , after he returned to the ground , his hand returned to normal .
Kittinger wrote in National Geographic ( November 1960 ) :
" At 43,000 feet I find out [ what can go wrong ] .
My right hand does not feel normal .
I examine the pressure glove ; its air bladder is not inflating .
The prospect of exposing the hand to the near - vacuum of peak altitude causes me some concern .
From my previous experiences , I know that the hand will swell , lose most of its circulation , and cause extreme pain ....
I decide to continue the ascent , without notifying ground control of my difficulty . "
at 103,000 feet , he writes :
" Circulation has almost stopped in my unpressurized right hand , which feels stiff and painful . "
But at the landing :
" Dick looks at the swollen hand with concern .
Three hours later the swelling will have disappeared with no ill effect . "
The decompression incident on Kittinger 's balloon jump is discussed further in Shayler 's Disasters and Accidents in Manned Spaceflight :
[ When Kittinger reached his peak altitude ] " his right hand was twice the normal size ...
He tried to release some of his equipment prior to landing , but was not able to as his right hand was still in great pain .
He hit the ground 13 min. 45 sec. after leaving Excelsior .
Three hours after landing his swollen hand and his circulation were back to normal . "
See also from Leonard Gordon , Aviation Week , February 13th 1996 .
Finally , posting to sci.space , Gregory Bennett discussed an actual space incident :
" Incidentally , we have had one experience with a suit puncture on the Shuttle flights .
On STS - 37 , during one of my flight experiments , the palm restraint in one of the astronaut 's gloves came loose and migrated until it punched a hole in the pressure bladder between his thumb and forefinger .
It was not explosive decompression , just a little 1/8 inch hole , but it was exciting down here in the swamp because it was the first injury we 've ever head from a suit incident .
Amazingly , the astronaut in question did n't even know the puncture had occured ; he was so hopped on adrenalin it was n't until after he got back in that he even noticed there was a painful red mark on his hand .
He figured his glove was chafing and did n't worry about it ....
What happened : when the metal bar punctured the glove , the skin of the astronaut 's hand partially sealed the opening .
He bled into space , and at the same time his coagulating blood sealed the opening enough that the bar was retained inside the hole . "
Explosive Decompression
The discussion here has focussed only on exposure to vacuum .
However , in general the action of being exposed to vacuum will also involve a rapid decompression .
This event is generally known as " explosive decompression , " and apart from the simple effect of vacuum on the body , the explosive decompression event itself will be hazardous .
As noted , explosive decompression will be particularly bad if the decompression subject attempts to hold his or her breath during decompression .
In The USAF Flight Surgeon 's Guide , Fischer lists the following effects due to mechanical expansion of gases during decompression .
Gastrointestinal Tract During Rapid Decompression .
One of the potential dangers during a rapid decompression is the expansion of gases within body cavities .
The abdominal distress during rapid decompression is usually no more severe than that which might occur during slower decompression .
Nevertheless , abdominal distention , when it does occur , may have several important effects .
The diaphragm is displaced upward by the expansion of trapped gas in the stomach , which can retard respiratory movements .
Distention of these abdominal organs may also stimulate the abdominal branches of the vagus nerve , resulting in cardiovascular depression , and if severe enough , cause a reduction in blood pressure , unconsciousness , and shock .
Usually , abdominal distress can be relieved after a rapid decompression by the passage of excess gas .
The Lungs During Rapid Decompression .
Because of the relatively large volume of air normally contained in the lungs , the delicate nature of the pulmonary tissue , and the intricate system of alveolar airways for ventilation , it is recognized that the lungs are potentially the most vulnerable part of the body during a rapid decompression .
Whenever a rapid decompression is faster than the inherent capability of the lungs to decompress ( vent ) , a transient positive pressure will temporarily build up in the lungs .
If the escape of air from the lungs is blocked or seriously impeded during a sudden drop in the cabin pressure , it is possible for a dangerously high pressure to build up and to overdistend the lungs and thorax .
No serious injuries have resulted from rapid decompressions with open airways , even while wearing an oxygen mask , but disastrous , or fatal , consequences can result if the pulmonary passages are blocked , such as forceful breath - holding with the lungs full of air .
Under this condition , when none of the air in the lungs can escape during a decompression , the lungs and thorax becomes over - expanded by the excessively high intrapulmonic pressure , causing actual tearing and rupture of the lung tissues and capillaries .
The trapped air is forced through the lungs into the thoracic cage , and air can be injected directly into the general circulation by way of the ruptured blood vessels , with massive air bubbles moving throughout the body and lodging in vital organs such as the heart and brain .
The movement of these air bubbles is similar to the air embolism that can occur in SCUBA diving and submarine escape when an individual ascends from underwater to the surface with breath - holding .
Because of lung construction , momentary breath - holding , such as swallowing or yawning , will not cause sufficient pressure in the lungs to exceed their tensile strength .
Decompression Sickness .
( also known as " Bends " )
Because of the rapid ascent to relatively high altitudes , the risk of decompression sickness is increased .
Recognition and treatment of this entity remain the same as discussed elsewhere in this publication .
Hypoxia .
While the immediate mechanical effects of rapid decompression on occupants of a pressurized cabin will seldom be incapacitating , the menace of subsequent hypoxia becomes more formidable with increasing altitudes .
The time of consciousness after loss of cabin pressure is reduced due to offgassing of oxygen from venous blood to the lungs .
Hypoxia is the most immediate problem following a decompression .
Physical Indications of a Rapid Decompression .
...
( a) Explosive Noise .
When two different air masses make contact , there is an explosive noise .
It is because of this explosive noise that some people use the term explosive decompression to describe a rapid decompression .
( b) Flying Debris .
The rapid rush of air from an aircraft cabin on decompression has such force that items not secured to the aircraft structure will be extracted out of the ruptured hole in the pressurized compartment .
Items such as maps , charts , flight logs , and magazines will be blow out .
Dirt and dust will affect vision for several seconds .
( c) Fogging .
Air at any temperature and pressure has the capability of holding just so much water vapor .
Sudden changes in temperature or pressure , or both , change the amount of water vapor the air can hold .
In a rapid decompression , temperature and pressure are reduced with a subsequent reduction in water vapor holding capacity .
The water vapor that cannot be held by the air appears in the compartment as fog .
This fog may dissipate rapidly , as in most fighters , or not so rapidly , as in larger aircraft .
( d) Temperature .
Cabin temperature during flight is generally maintained at a comfortable level ; however , the ambient temperature gets colder as the aircraft flies higher .
If a decompression occurs , temperature will be reduced rapidly .
Chilling and frostbite may occur if proper protective clothing is not worn or available .
( e) Pressure .
How Fast Will A Spaceship Decompress If It Gets Punctured ?
The decompression time will depend on how big the hole is .
For a fast estimate , you can assume that the air exiting through the hole will travel at the speed of sound .
Since the atmosphere drops in pressure as it moves through the hole , the effective rate at which the atmosphere leaves is at about 60 % of the speed of sound , or about 200 meters / second for room - temperaure air ( see derivation by Higgins ) :
P = P o exp [ -( A/ V ) t*( 200m /s ) ]
The seminal paper on the subject is by Demetriades in 1954 : " On the Decompression of a Punctured Pressurized Cabin in Vacuum Flight . "
The decompression rate can be derived for laminar viscous flow ( that is , near atmospheric pressure ) using Prandtl 's equation in the limit Po / P is zero , and assuming a simple aperture ( a pipe of zero length ) .
The gas flow conductance is C visc = 20 A liters / second ( for A in square centimeters ) .
As the pressure decreases the flow changes to molecular flow , and the depressurization rate decreases by about a factor of two .
This is for air at 20 C ; for the case of pure oxygen , the leak rate is about 10 percent slower .
For reference , when the pressure drops to about 50 % of atmospheric , the subject will be entering the region of " critical hypoxia " ; when the pressure drops to about 15 % of atmospheric , the remaining time of useful consciousness will have decreased to the 9 - 12 seconds characteristic of vacuum .
Professor Andrew J. Higgins of McGill University had written a more detailed answer to the question of how fast a spacecraft will decompress through a given size hole ; which I have reprinted with his permission here .

Today we pull open the drawer in the motel bureau and face the need to have a Moral Center , that core set of behaviors and ethics that governs the way we conduct ourselves and live our lives .
Whatever your beliefs may be , I happen to be non-religious .
I do not believe that supernatural deities exist .
There 's nothing evil or wrong about that .
I view the God of Abraham in the same way that the average Christian , Muslim , or Jew views Shiva , Athena , or Odin .
There 's nothing evil or wrong about doubting the actual divinity of those characters either .
Yet a common generalization made by some religious people is that the non-religious lack a Moral Center .
More than once , in late night bull sessions with religious friends , I 've been told that faith is a necessary component for developing a sound Moral Center .
The implication is that religious beliefs play an important role in the development of a normal , healthy system of ethics and personal conduct .
Without religious faith , one is less likely to become a " moral " person .
Thus , one of many reasons that people of faith want to reach out to the non-religious is to help them to find a Moral Center ; both for their own good so that they can be saved , and for the good of society so they 're not running around being immoral and unethical .
My response to the religious people — after thanking them for the assumption that I am an immoral person — is to compare our Moral Centers and see where these supposed differences lie .
If you knew me personally , you would probably find me to be a generally upstanding person , like yourself , who stays out of trouble , brushes his teeth , walks his kids to school , and tries not to shout too much in the library .
Like you , I am generally an honest person .
I do n't cheat people in business .
I do n't steal or commit crimes any worse than speeding on the freeway .
I lie all the time , but only when the lie is a helpful one , e.g. : " Yes , you look great in those parachute pants . "
Like you , I play fair in sports , even against unfair opponents .
I try to be a gracious loser , and occasionally even a gracious winner .
Like you , my family is the most important thing in my life .
Preserving the love , trust , and happiness in my family absolutely outweighs all other priorities in my life .
Like you , I have a clear sense of right and wrong .
Generally , behavior that injures someone else is wrong , and most of us ( religious or not ) avoid doing that whenever possible .
Like you , if I see a complete stranger drop their wallet , I 'll spring into action like Batman to return it to them .
It would never occur to either you or I to keep it or expect a reward for returning it .
If I see an elderly woman , I do n't run over , punch her in the face and steal her purse ; and neither does a religious person .
But note that no religious person ever says " I would love to punch out that old woman , but I can't because the restrictions of my religion forbid it . "
Nobody is going to do something like that , because it 's so obviously wrong .
Rarely or never does any basically good person — and that 's most of us — need religious commandments to stop them from doing something wrong .
In summary , my Moral Center is essentially the same as yours .
It comes from the basic goodness of human nature , and my own sense of right and wrong that is universally shared among all people .
It does not stem from having read any particular set of religious commandments , or from fear of punishment from a deity .
Since I formed this ethical system in the lack of a religious context , how could my Moral Center be so similar to that of the average Christian or Buddhist ?
I argue that everyone 's basic Moral Center comes from human nature , the nurture of societal interaction , and the sense of right and wrong .
Since everyone already has these things , the need to credit religion as an additional source is redundant and thus wholly unnecessary .
A common retort from religious people is that their particular God gave me those things : common sense , and the ability to tell right from wrong .
If that 's so , and everyone ( atheists included ) has been gifted with all the fundamentals needed to develop a Moral Center , then we 're still left at the same place .
A religious upbringing is still superfluous .
Religion is an important and favored part of life for most people .
Its practice brings them satisfaction in many ways .
But religion is absolutely not necessary to become a good person , or to have a sound Moral Center .
Philanthropists , educators , doctors , and emergency workers have the same general breakdown of religious affiliation ( including no religion ) as the population at large , because they are the population at large .
Embrace this species you belong to , its strengths , its accomplishments , its knowledge , and seek not to divide it by qualities that do n't matter ; because it is the only group you will ever irrevocably be a part of .

At a rally late today in Minnesota , John McCain addressed the heated comments , including calls to violence , coming from some supporters at his rallies this week :
“ I am enthusiastic and encouraged by the enthusiasm and I think it ’s really good , ” McCain said .
“ We have to fight and i will fight but we will be respectful .
I admire Sen. Obama and his accomplishments and I want to be respectful .
Here ’s the ( updated longer version ) video of a portion of McCain ’s remarks :
Late Update : Ana Marie
Cox is on the ground at the rally and reports :
Indeed , [ McCain ] just snatched the microphone out the hands of a woman who began her question with , “ I ’m scared of Barack Obama … he ’s an Arab terrorist … ”
“ No , no ma’am , ” he interrupted .
“ He ’s a decent family man with whom I happen to have some disagreements . ”
Later Update :
In the expanded version of the video above , I do n’t hear any reference to terrorist when the woman calls Obama an Arab .

ANAHEIM – Blizzard 's executive vice president of game design Rob Pardo has his hand in just about everything the company does , so though I was scheduled to speak to him specifically about Diablo III , our conversation meanders a bit .
We start off discussing the newly - revealed Wizard class the firm had only that morning revealed as a part of the latest Diablo title , but soon we 're covering everything from Blizzard 's efforts to stem the tide of cheaters in their online games to the company 's efforts to bring their games to the silver screen .
This marks the third interview in my series of talks from Blizzcon 2008 which includes chats with World of Warcraft lead producer J. Allen Brack and StarCraft II lead designer Dustin Browder .
The final part , an interview with Blizzard CEO and co-founder Mike Morhaime on the company 's current and future plans , should appear soon .
Wired :
You guys just announced the Wizard .
Can you tell us about that ?
Rob Pardo : [ Laughter ]
Wired :
Ok , how about a general overview of the class .
What does it ... ok , say , what in Diablo II would it most closely relate to ?
Pardo : The Wizard ’s probably most analogous to the Sorceress .
Yeah , so the Wizard is definitely our most traditional mage , magic class .
The Wizard , you ’re going to see – this is the class that ’s going to cast the Magic Missile , have the Chain Lightning abilities .
He also has kind of " time manipulation , reality distortion " abilities .
Things like that .
Wired :
You ’d say this is a more area - attack - focused class than , say , the Barbarian ?
Pardo :
Well one of the things about Diablo is that every class has to have area effect abilities , because it really is a game of “ you against many creatures . ”
So I ’d say that all the classes really have target abilities and area effect abilities because it 's really important – its not a game like WoW . **
WoW is a game that really focuses on interdependency , so we assume , especially in a dungeon , that classes will have other classes to kind of work with .
In Diablo we have to take the paradigm that “ you 're on your own . ”
So every class has to be self - sufficient .
Of course we have synergies and ways that we can play co-op , but every class really does have to be self - sufficient .
Wired :
So there is n’t going to be ... a lot of people have been concerned that because World of Warcraft has been so ridiculously successful for you guys that Diablo III is going to push towards becoming more of an MMO where you ’re going to see more of a focus on playing the online component , having parties of people , that kind of thing .
Is that the direction you ’re going with it ?
Pardo :
We wanna make Diablo III even better for online play for sure but that does n't necessarily mean we want it to be an MMO .
I mean , we ’ve been a company focused on multiplayer gameplay for a really long time now , so its something like WoW is just an expression of that philosophy and belief .
With Diablo III we certainly want to make co-op a lot more fun , we wanna make PvP a lot more fun , but its not an MMO in the sense of WoW at all .
Wired : Speaking of it being online , with Diablo II and the first Diablo , really quickly after the game was released and , again , after every patch , there is this huge amount of people who hack the game , find ways to work around the system .
What are you guys doing in Diablo III to prevent that ?
Obviously that makes playing less fun for people who are n’t cheating .
Pardo :
With online games it ’s definitely challenging to keep people from modifying the game , or hacking the game , but it ’s something we take very seriously .
It ’s something that , you look at a lot of our efforts in our other games and – we have a full - blown Hacks Team now at Blizzard – we ’ve developed our own kinda anti-hack software called “ Warden ” which we use in World of Warcraft to try to detect a whole variety of known hacks .
We ’ve put technology in all of our games to help with a whole variety of those sort of hacks and to detect those sort of things .
We keep it pretty serious .
There ’s nothing specific that we 're doing just for Diablo III , it ’s kinda more of a Blizzard effort to prevent cheating across the board .
Wired :
Is it going to be the exact same “ Warden ” software in Diablo III as in World of Warcraft ?
Pardo :
It will be adapted , but it ’s something that was made for all of our games .
Wired :
Along with that , there ’s a huge segment of the fanbase and a huge segment of the media who came down on EA recently when they released Spore and it had that ridiculous DRM system that only allowed you to put it on three computers .
There was a huge uproar .
Obviously you need some kind of DRM otherwise people would just blatantly pirate your game over and over again .
What kind of solutions are you guys looking at for Diablo III ?
Pardo :
The thing that I think helps us , is that since our games have such a huge multiplayer component , Battle .
net really is our most effective DRM .
If you wanna play online on Battle .
net with other players you ’re going to have to have a legitimate copy .
That ’s really kinda been the thing that ’s always saved us from a lot of the PC piracy that I think hurts a lot of other single - player - only games .
Wired :
You ’re not going to have something where the game has to phone home every time you turn it on ?
Pardo :
No , there ’s no particular plans for that .
We do now have the online store where we ’re doing digital distribution on your account .
In those particular cases you have to be online to actually download the game , but once you have it , you 're fine .
I think our approach – if you want to use an analogy – we take an approach that ’s more similar to Steam than EA , let ’s say .
Wired : Speaking of which , Steam has been a huge success .
Do you have any plans of releasing your games through their system , or is it going to be one of these things where you say : “ We ’re a big enough company , we can do it ourselves ? ”
Pardo :
I think we ’re probably currently in the mindset that we ’re going to digitally distribute just on Battle .
net .
I do n’t know if our strategy will change in the future .
I think it ’s something that we ’re just trying to get really good at doing ourselves for now .
Wired : When Diablo II came out , I remember , I first bought it and the computer I had had like 128MB of RAM , which was over the system requirements , but I did n’t really feel like I got the full experience of the game running perfectly until I had something like 2GB of RAM .
It seems that the Diablo series is very RAM - dependent , traditionally .
Is that going to be the case with Diablo III ?
Are we going to need 6GB of RAM to run it at full everything ?
Pardo : I do n’t know if my memory serves me well enough to speak too intelligently on that , but I do n’t think there ’s anything actually about Diablo that ’s particularly RAM - dependent .
I think all of our games ... one of the philosophies we have is to always try to cater to a pretty low system spec .
We really wanna make sure that as many gamers as possible can play our games , and I think that ’s really the trick to being successful on PC anyway .
If you ’re only catering to the upper two percent of systems then you ’ve really narrowed down your userbase .
We always try to appeal broadly .
Now , at the same time , we want a lot of our graphics and all of our features to look good , so it really depends on what features you 're gonna enable and what kind of system you have for what kind of experience you ’re going to get .
Wired :
Do you guys have any idea what the system requirements are going to look like ?
Pardo : Ohhh ...
Why do I forget the answer to this question ?
We do .
I ’m not sure what we ’ve released .
I can totally get that information to you in the future though .
Wired :
That would be great .
Pardo :
But I ca n’t remember and I do n’t wanna misquote .
Wired : Absolutely , yeah .
Diablo II introduced the Horardric Cube .
It was a big success .
Everybody likes the crafting component .
Pardo : Mmhmm .
Wired : Is Diablo III going to have an equivalent crafting system ?
Pardo : I would n’t say “ equivalent . ”
I mean there ’s things that were cool about the Horardric Cube , there ’s things that were kinda silly about it , but we certainly want to have some features in the game that allow people to do some sort of crafting .
I wanna leave that intentionally vague because it ’s kind of a ... there are some features that we ’ll be going into in the future .
We ’ll talk more succinctly about “ what are we doing instead of the Horardic Cube ? ”
Wired : I was just at the StarCraft II panel and they revealed that StarCraft II is going to be released as a trilogy ...
Pardo : “ They ? ”
It was me !
Wired : Yeah !
You can see what the scheduling is doing to my memory .
So , it ’s going to be released as a trilogy .
The Diablo series has always had expansions .
Are you guys going the same route ?
The trilogy ?
At least one expansion ?
I ’m assuming at least one expansion .
Pardo :
We have n’t decided those sorts of things yet .
I would probably assume the same thing .
At least an expansion or something , but we have n’t , to be honest , decided anything like that yet .
It ’s a similar sort of development in StarCraft II .
We did n’t decide out of the gate that we were gonna do the trilogy idea .
We have n’t really got to the point yet with Diablo III to discuss what future products are going to look like .
Wired :
And are you guys worried that the fans are going to see – specifically with StarCraft II – that they ’re going to see it and say “ Oh !
They ’re coming out with an expansion so they must ’ve held back content from the original release to put in the expansion ! ”
Is there a concern that you ’re going to be upsetting your fans that way ?
Pardo : With StarCraft ?
Wired : Yeah .
Pardo :
Well I guess it ’s really the way you look at it :
If you really think that we could do a 90 - mission campaign then , I guess you could view it as we ’re holding something back , but if you look at the fact that we ’ve never done a campaign of that size before within a shipping product ...
I mean , the Terran campaign is gonna be as big as any of our full - blown RTS campaigns with all the races from the past .
So , I really definitely do n’t look at it as holding back anything .
We ’re really just trying to deliver a bigger story across three games .
Wired : I ’ve got my MacBook Pro here , as I already told you , I love it , I ’m totally down with the whole Apple zealotry .
Pardo : [ Laughter ]
Wired :
You guys have been huge supporters of gaming on the Mac for a long time .
You ’ve been one of the only computer gaming companies that supports this stuff .
Diablo III ?
Going to be Mac and PC ?
Released at the same time ?
Pardo : Absolutely .
Yeah , absolutely .
Wired :
And also , do you guys have any plans to do iPhone stuff ?
Pardo :
We have no concrete plans right now to do anything on the iPhone .
We are starting to talk about doing some things on mobile but it is n't something that ’s a big primary strategy of ours right now .
Wired : World of Warcraft , when it was released ... obviously people saw a lot of parallels between that and the Diablo series , for instance , the entire item system .
A lot of ideas that originated in Diablo then carried over into World of Warcraft .
Is there going to be any crossing back over from WoW to Diablo III ?
Are you borrowing ideas from the World of Warcraft system for Diablo III ?
Pardo : I do n’t know if I would look at it quite like that .
Yeah , they ’re both within the RPG genre which is typically a very item - based sort of game .
I think with each of our games , we always look for ideas from our games , we look for ideas from other games ; a lot of times we even find ideas that do n’t even come from the obvious game genres .
I ca n’t think of anything specific that ’s carrying over from WoW into Diablo III ’s item system , but ...
Wired :
You guys are n’t going to have Murlocs popping up as enemies ?
That kind of thing ?
Pardo : [ Laughter ]
That ’d be cool actually .
That ’s a cool idea .
Murlocs could fit within the Diablo universe .
Wired :
They fit everywhere !
Absolutely !
Pardo :
Yeah , you ’ve just gotta make sure you get the sound right .
Wired : Exactly .
That ’s key .
I have no idea if you guys are even remotely close to knowing this , but when – broad , ballpark estimate – can we expect to see Diablo III on retail shelves ?
Pardo :
When it ’s ready .
Wired : Ok ... alright ...
Pardo : [ Laughter ]
Wired :
Is that like 2 years from now ?
A decade from now ?
Pardo : I do n’t ...
I do n’t know how far out it is , but it ’s still fairly early in development .
I think when people see it , it feels so polished and so finished , but the reality is we have a very small portion of the game done right now .
A lot of the way we develop is :
We wanna make sure the game is really fun and the visual fidelity we want ... we wanna make sure we have a small area that feels really done so we know what to build .
So even though it looks really complete a lot of the content is just not there .
We have a long ways to go to build each of the different acts in the game and put in all the quests and all the different monsters .
We have a lot of development ahead of us before it will be something ...
It will definitely be out after StarCraft II .
Wired : [ Laughter ]
So “ sometime in the future ” is what we ’re looking at .
Pardo : Yeah .
It ’s too far out to really say for sure .
It ’s a ways out .
Wired : Speaking of these " acts , " are we going to be following the traditional Diablo II " four acts " system ?
Pardo :
We ’re definitely doing an acts system ...
Wired :
With entirely new worlds ?
Pardo : Yeah .
I do n’t think we ’ve announced how many there are because we ’re still talking about it .
Wired :
And total gameplay ?
What are you guys shooting for ?
40 hours ?
60 hours ?
Pardo :
It ’s really hard , I think , with a lot of our games to look at it like that .
With Diablo particularly , how long is it going to take you if you do it all in one sitting and do n’t replay with all the optional stuff ?
I do n’t know .
Hopefully it ’s a similar scope to Diablo II , whatever that mapped out to .
With that much content .
But the thing about Diablo is :
We really want it to be replayable .
We do n’t want it to feel like “ oh , it ’s a 25 hour experience ” we want it to feel like “ it 's 25 to 500 hours depending on how much you wanna play . ”
Wired : Yeah , I ’ve got hundreds of hours in Diablo II .
Pardo : Exactly .
That ’s really how we wanna look at it .
Wired :
The first Diablo was released on the original PlayStation .
It was ported to the original PlayStation .
Pardo :
Oh that ’s right !
It was huh ?
Wired : Yeah , it was a while ago since you guys have done any console stuff , but with these new consoles , the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 it 's theoretically possible for you to port these new games , and there ’s good money in that .
Are you guys looking at that ?
Pardo :
It ’s definitely something that we ’re evaluating .
It ’s something that ... right now we ’re really focused on making the game on PC .
It ’s something that I do think – just kinda talkin’ – Diablo , out of our different franchises that are currently in development , would be the one that probably could actually go to consoles , but we do n’t have any current plans right now to do that .
Wired :
There ’s been a big push in Hollywood lately to ...
Pardo : Really ?
[ Laughter ]
Wired : Yeah , I know .
... to take games , make them into movies .
They ’re never good movies ...
Pardo : Yeah .
Wired : ... but they make money , apparently .
There ’s been talk of a Diablo movie and a WarCraft movie , just murmurings about this , for years ...
Pardo : Murmurs ?
You have n’t heard about the World of Warcraft movie in development ?
Wired :
Well , I ’ve heard , but until I see something concrete I ’m still going to consider it sorta “ out there . ”
Pardo : Ok .
Wired :
Are you guys actively looking to go in that direction ?
Pardo : With World of Warcraft absolutely .
That ’s what I mean :
It ’s not really a murmur with that one .
With that one we ... as a matter of fact , at our last Blizzcon we even did a panel on the World of Warcraft movie that had Legendary Pictures up on stage talking about it .
So it ’s something we ’re actively developing right now :
To try to get a World of Warcraft movie .
One of the reasons , I mean we ’ve had opportunities to do movies way before now , people will pay us the money to do it , but ...
Wired : Like a Lost Vikings movie ?
Pardo : [ Laughter ] Yeah .
We do n’t want to make a “ videogame movie . ”
We want to make a great movie .
Until Legendary came to us we did n’t really feel like we had the opportunity to do that .
We felt like , before them , we had the opportunity to make a “ videogame movie , ” and that ’s not what we want to make .
But with Legendary in the picture , I mean , they ’re a really great group .
This is a group that makes some phenomenal movies that are out there , and they 're very geeky movies .
I do n’t know if ... you ’ve seen The Dark Knight , right ?
Wired : Yeah .
Totally .
Pardo :
That movie was amazing .
That ’s the group that ’s making our movie , and we ’re really excited about it .
Wired :
That ’s your benchmark for quality ?
The Dark Knight ?
You ’re setting the bar kinda high .
Pardo :
That ’s where we start .
[ Laughter ]
Wired : [ Laughter ]
Fair enough .
Pardo :
No , I mean , I would be thrilled if it was to that quality .
For sure .
That movie was probably the best movie of the last five years or so , at least .
They obviously know how to make great movies .
They also did 300 , they did Superman Returns , they did Batman Begins , so they ’ve got a great track record not only making great movies , but making movies that really sing to us .
Wired : Right .
Pardo :
We really feel like these are the guys that could make a great movie in a videogame license .
Wired :
Why not – you guys have been known as the masters of CGI cinemas in your games for years – so why not just do that ?
You ’ve obviously got the team who can do that .
Pardo : Um ... we ’ve got a fraction of a team that could do that .
[ Laughter ]
Our Blizzard film department is a fraction of , let ’s say , a Pixar .
We have some really talented guys , but if we wanted to make a movie we ’d have to make a movie studio which would be very different from making a game studio .
And on top of that , if they ’re going to do that , who ’s going to make the videos for our games ?
__Wired : __That ’s a good point .
How many people do you guys have working in your video department ?
Pardo : I think we ’re about 100 people .
Wired : Really ?
Pardo : Yeah , but I think Pixar employs up to 3 to 400 people to make one movie .
We ’re very small by comparison .

MOSCOW — A new chill is spreading among Russian bloggers following the death of the journalist - owner of an opposition website .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
While opposition viewpoints are rarely presented in Russian newspapers these days ( and even less frequently on television ) , the Internet has remained a place where Russians of all ideological stripes are able to express themselves .
But following the mysterious death of Web journalist Magomed Yevloyev and the prosecution of disaffected bloggers , there are fears that authorities are trying to squeeze shut that remaining outlet for freewheeling debate .
The issue came sharply into focus with the August 31 killing of Yevloyev , the founder of a popular site called Ingushetia.org that reports on human rights abuses in the restive southern Russian region of Ingushetia .
After he landed at the airport in the Ingushetian town of Nazran , a police convoy picked him up .
Less than an hour later , he was delivered to the hospital with a fatal bullet wound to his head .
Prosecutors have suggested the shooting was an accident , perhaps the result of Yevloyev trying to grab an officer ’s gun , though his supporters say it was punishment for his muckraking site .
“ It was a premeditated murder , ” concludes Musa Pliyev , a lawyer for Ingushetia.org .

The Wage Gap between Francophones and Anglophones : A Canadian Perspective , 1970 to 2000
NBER Working Paper No. 14203
Issued in July 2008
NBER Program(s ) : Labor Studies
The wage differential between Francophone and Anglophone men from 1970 to 2000 fell by 25 percentage points within Quebec , but only by 10 points Canada - wide , largely because the wages of Quebec Anglophones fell by 15 points relative to other Canadian Anglophones .
Accordingly , the Canadian measure of the Francophone wage gap better reflects the changing welfare of Francophones than the Quebec measure .
Over half of the reduction in the Canadian Francophone wage gap is explained by rising Francophone education levels .
In Quebec , the declining number and relative wages of Anglophone workers is best explained by a falling demand for English - speaking labour .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama leads John McCain among registered voters across the country by a 50 % to 42 % margin in Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Oct. 3 - 5 , the 10th straight day in which Obama has held a statistically significant lead .
This 10 - day stretch of a significant Obama lead is the longest since he became the presumptive nominee back in early June , and the longest for either candidate at any point in the campaign .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
Today 's result includes interviewing conducted Friday through Sunday , after the Oct. 2 vice presidential debate between Gov. Sarah Palin and Sen.
Joe Biden , and after Friday 's passage of a revised economic rescue plan to help alleviate the Wall Street financial crisis .
The results suggest that neither of these events had a significant impact on voter preferences .
Looked at broadly , Obama 's percent of the vote has been within a very narrow range of 48 % to 50 % over the last ten days , and McCain 's has been within an equally narrow range of 42 % of 44 % over the same time period .
These results suggest that aside from normal sampling error , the underlying dynamics of the race have become quite stable , and underscore the degree to which there has been little meaningful change in the race in well over a week .
The election has entered its final month , with the two remaining major campaign events being Tuesday night 's presidential debate in Nashville , and the final presidential debate on Oct. 15 at Hofstra University .
Early voting is now open in many states , meaning that for some voters , the election is already over .

Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from Oct. 3 - 5 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,744 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
When you become the man of the house you inherit a sacred responsibility to protect your family .
Former Marine Jeff Barnett gives the bottom line on the best tools for the job we hope you 'll never have to use .
Jeff is a former Marine with a lifetime of experience with firearms .
For the past ten years he has pursued strength and health in numerous ways and posts his daily workouts on his website , Cross Fit Impulse .
Defending yourself and your loved ones from home intruders that would do you harm is a serious matter and a grave responsibility .
If you have decided to take this responsibility seriously but do n’t know quite where to begin then this article is for you .
Today ’s focus is what weapon to choose for home defense .
Each option I will recommend is a firearm , because firearms are simply the best modern home defense weapons .
While a fighting knife and a backpack full of claymores may work well for John J. Rambo , there can only be one Rambo .
Similarly , non-lethal defenses such as stun guns and mace leave much more to chance than I am willing to accept .
Real aggressors do n’t slowly walk towards you in a straight line like Jason Voorhees .
When selecting a weapon for home defense you should consider the following factors :
Effectiveness
The weapon must be capable of stopping the threat , which is primarily a matter of caliber , assuming proper shot placement .
This is a very subjective topic and you will find as many opinions as you will find commentators .
Let it suffice that all of the weapons I recommend will be effective enough for anything short of a zombie horde or rabid grizzly bear .
Overpenetration
The complement to effectiveness is overpenetration .
Walls do n’t stop bullets .
If you have to discharge a firearm in your house then you must be aware of what lies behind your target .
Innocent bystanders in adjacent rooms and adjacent houses can be wounded and even killed .
Caliber and ammunition selection can mitigate this significant risk , but the bottom line for any weapon of any caliber is this :
Never discharge a firearm at a target if you are not willing to strike everything that lies behind that target .
Ammo Capacity
The weapon should also hold ample ammunition , because under stressful situations even an accomplished marksman requires more than one shot to hit his target , and some aggressors require more than one shot to neutralize .
Reliability
An effective weapon that does n’t work properly when needed or that quickly malfunctions is hardly effective at all .
Cost
Just because home defense is important does n’t mean you should squander your retirement preparing for a scenario that will likely never happen .
Effective solutions can be had for less than a $ 200 total investment , including ammunition .
Here are my top picks for home defense weapons :
1. 12 Gauge Pump - Action Shotgun
No , not because of the sound it makes when cycling the action .
Sounds do a poor job of neutralizing intruders .
Pump-action shotguns are familiar to everyone and easily accessible to the beginner .
Effectiveness : High
At ranges of less than 25 yards there is scarcely a more effective weapon than 12 - Gauge loaded with # 1 or larger buckshot .
When it comes to shotshell loads , smaller numbers mean larger projectiles .
Example : # 1 buckshot consists of ( 10 ) .30 ” diameter projectiles while # 4 buckshot consists of ( 21 ) . 24 ” diameter projectiles .
Overpenetration : Moderate With # 1 and smaller buckshot the projectiles will lose enough energy to reasonably mitigate this risk .
With larger buckshot the chances of overpenetration increase .
If you are in a densely populated home or neighborhood you can almost completely mitigate overpenetration by using small game loads of # 6 shot or smaller , but this sacrifices a great deal of effectiveness .
Versatility in available loadings is a great strength of shotguns , but you must choose your loads carefully for your environment .
Ammo Capacity : Low With extended magazine tubes seven to eight round capacities are common .
This is likely more ammo than you ’ll need in the most common defense scenarios , but it still relatively low compared to other choices .
Reliability : High Extremely reliable .
KISS design and manual cycling make weapon - related malfunctions all but impossible .
Cost : Low
You can find used examples in gun shops for $ 150 .
With quality brands , well - worn shotguns work exactly the same as their new counterparts .
I suggest going with an ugly example of a proven brand .
New models start around $ 300 .
My pick : Mossberg 500 or Remington 870 Both designs have proven themselves for decades .
I prefer the controls and price of Mossberg , but a Remington 870 is my primary home defense weapon .
2. .223 / 5.56 mm Carbine
You may know this type of rifle by the name AR - 15 .
It is the civilian ( semi- auto ) version of the M16 family of weapons .
While this may seem intimidating , it ’s just a rifle with lots of doo - dads and handy features .
If you can shoot grandpa ’s lever - action 30 - 30 then you can engage targets with an AR - 15 .
Effectiveness : High
While not packing quite the punch of multiple projectiles ( a shotgun ) a 5.56 mm frangible projectile is extremely lethal and has greater range .
Overpenetration : Moderate With frangible ammunition ( such as Hornady TAP ) bullets begin to yaw , turn , and fragment upon impacting any medium other than air .
This significantly reduces overpenetration , but is only valid for frangible ammo .
Do not use standard full metal jacket ( FMJ ) or hollow point ( HP ) ammo for home defense !
Ammo Capacity : High
Thirty rounds in a single magazine–almost certainly more than you ’ll need .
Reliability : Moderate A clean and broken - in AR - 15 will function for many hundreds ( sometimes more than 1000 ) rounds before malfunctioning .
Cost : High Quality entry models begin just short of $ 700 .
My pick : DPMS Panther Lite 16
This is a quality rifle that ’s on the low end of price .
Short , light , effective , and relatively simple .
3. Handgun
While one of the least overall effective tools for the job , small size and accessibility to the beginner have made handguns one of the most popular home defense weapons used today .
Handguns are easy to learn , cheap to practice with , and store comfortably in a nightstand .
Effectiveness : Low Despite what you may have seen in movies , pistol caliber projectiles simply do not create the type of damage that instantly incapacitates an aggressor .
The key is to place your rounds on target and have plenty of rounds available .
Overpenetration : High Know what lies beyond your target , because your rounds may end up outside your home .
Ammo Capacity : Moderate Most handguns hold between 7 - 15 rounds .
Some hold over 30 rounds .
Reliability : High A quality handgun with quality ammunition will function flawlessly for much longer than you ’ll need it in a defensive scenario .
Cost : Moderate Inexpensive handguns start around $ 300 .
Some production handguns go well into the $ 600s
My pick : Glock 17
The Glock design is as simple and reliable as any handgun made .
These polymer framed pistols have a high capacity , good accuracy , unmatched reliability , and are readily available for $ 500 new and as low as $ 300 for a well - worn example .
There are no external safeties to fumble with , making this a good weapon for high - stress scenarios where fine motor skills are lost .
I use a Glock model 26 as my backup home defense weapon and concealed carry weapon .
Concluding Thoughts
You are legally , morally , and financially responsible for everything that exits the barrel of a firearm under your control .
Any of the choices presented here will serve you well in a defensive scenario .
However , should you be thrust into the dreadful circumstance of repelling an aggressor in your home , you must decide based on federal , state , and local laws as well as your own principles what constitutes a legitimate use of deadly force .
I ’m not advising you to shoot at anything other than paper targets , and I hope that ’s all that will ever be necessary .
Washington --
As the financial meltdown and economic slump hold the national spotlight , another potential crisis is on the horizon : a persistently high dropout rate that educators and mayors across the country say increases the threat to the country 's strength and prosperity .
According to one study , only half of the high school students in the nation 's 50 largest cities are graduating in four years , with a figure as low as 25 % in Detroit .
And while concern over dropouts is n't new , the problem now has officials outside of public education worried enough to get directly involved .
The U.S. Conference of Mayors is focusing its education efforts on dropouts .
Mayors in Houston and other Texas cities go door to door to the homes of dropouts , encouraging them to return to school .
Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin meets on weekends with students and helps them with life planning .
Other cities , like Milwaukee and Kansas City , Mo. , have dropout prevention programs .
Some new studies show far fewer students completing high school with diplomas than long believed .
" Whereas the conventional wisdom had long placed the graduation rate around 85 % , a growing consensus has emerged that only about seven in 10 students are actually successfully finishing high school " in four years , said a study by the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center , a nonprofit group based in Bethesda , Md . It was released this year by America 's Promise Alliance , a nonpartisan advocacy group for youth .
In the nation 's 50 largest cities , the graduation rate was 52 % .
The longstanding American dropout problem may be especially thorny now , with a looming recession .
Cutting the number of dropouts in half would generate $ 45 billion annually in new tax revenue , according to America 's Promise -- assuming there are ultimately enough jobs to accommodate the graduates .
Al - Qaeda Leaders Root for McCain Gloating over the U.S. economic crisis , al - Qaeda strategists are telling each other that a John McCain victory is crucial if the slide of their American enemies is to continue and possibly accelerate .

Printer friendly With McCain struggling in the polls , some al - Qaeda operatives even are discussing the possibility of a new terrorist attack timed before the Nov. 4 election to rally the American people to McCain ’s candidacy .
“ Al - Qaeda will have to support McCain in the coming election , ” declared one commentary on a password - protected site , al - Hesbah , which has been linked to the terrorist organization .
The commentary argued that a last - minute terrorist strike could galvanize American voters behind McCain ’s hard - line positions and bring about a McCain administration that would follow the “ failing march ” of George W. Bush .
[ Washington Post , Oct. 22 , 2008 ]
This al - Qaeda logic is something that U.S. intelligence agencies have long understood , that Bush ’s tough - guy strategies often have played into al - Qaeda ’s bloody hands by exacerbating anti-Americanism in the Islamic world .
For instance , CIA analysts recognized that al - Qaeda ’s “ October Surprise ” for Campaign 2004 – a videotape of Osama bin Laden denouncing Bush that was released on Oct. 29 , the Friday before the election – had the predictable effect of driving American voters to Bush .
“ Bin Laden certainly did a nice favor today for the President , ” said deputy CIA director John McLaughlin in opening a meeting to review secret “ strategic analysis ” after the videotape had dominated the day ’s news , according to Ron Suskind ’s The One Percent Doctrine , which draws heavily from CIA insiders .
Suskind wrote that CIA analysts had spent years “ parsing each expressed word of the al - Qaeda leader and his deputy , Zawahiri .
What they ’d learned over nearly a decade is that bin Laden speaks only for strategic reasons .
…
Today ’s conclusion : bin Laden ’s message was clearly designed to assist the President ’s reelection . ”
Jami Miscik , CIA deputy associate director for intelligence , expressed the consensus view that bin Laden recognized how Bush ’s heavy - handed policies – such as the Guantanamo prison camp , the Abu Ghraib abuse scandal and the war in Iraq – were serving al - Qaeda ’s strategic goals for recruiting a new generation of jihadists .
“ Certainly , ” Miscik said , “ he would want Bush to keep doing what he ’s doing for a few more years . ”
As their internal assessment sank in , the CIA analysts were troubled by the implications of their own conclusions .
“ An ocean of hard truths before them – such as what did it say about U.S. policies that bin Laden would want Bush reelected – remained untouched , ” Suskind wrote .
Spinning bin Laden However , in the outside world , Bush ’s supporters accepted bin Laden ’s videotape at face value , calling it proof the terrorist leader feared Bush and favored John Kerry .
In a pro-Bush book entitled Strategery : How George W. Bush Is Defeating Terrorists , Outwitting Democrats and Confounding the Mainstream Media , right - wing journalist Bill Sammon devoted several pages to bin Laden ’s videotape , portraying it as an attempt by the terrorist leader to persuade Americans to vote for Kerry .
“ Bin Laden stopped short of overtly endorsing Kerry , ” Sammon wrote , “ but the terrorist offered a polemic against reelecting Bush . ”
Sammon and other right - wing pundits did n’t weigh the obvious possibility that the crafty bin Laden might have understood that his “ endorsement ” of Kerry would achieve the opposite effect with the American people .
Bush himself recognized that political impact .
“ I thought it was going to help , ” Bush said in a post- election interview with Sammon about bin Laden ’s videotape .
“ I thought it would help remind people that if bin Laden does n’t want Bush to be the President , something must be right with Bush . ”
In Strategery , Sammon also quotes Republican National Chairman Ken Mehlman as agreeing that bin Laden ’s videotape helped Bush .
“ It reminded people of the stakes , ” Mehlman said .
“ It reinforced an issue on which Bush had a big lead over Kerry . ”
But bin Laden , a student of American politics , surely understood that , too .
There always has been this logical flaw in Bush ’s insistence that the American people must “ listen ” to what al - Qaeda says in its public pronouncements , like taking note that al - Qaeda supposedly has called “ Iraq the central front in the war on terror . ”
While it may make sense to give some credence to internal communications between al - Qaeda operatives – if one judges that the words reflect the organization ’s real strategies – it can be a huge mistake to believe al - Qaeda ’s public declarations .
Steeped in clandestine activities , bin Laden and his followers understand the value of disinformation , something that CIA analysts also appreciate .
That ’s why in 2004 , the CIA analysts concluded that bin Laden ’s denunciation of Bush was something of a Brer Rabbit ploy , telling your adversary to do the opposite of what you really want done .
“ Do n’t throw me in the briar patch , ” Brer Rabbit said , when that was exactly where he wanted to go .
So , just days before Election 2004 , bin Laden acted as if he feared a Bush second term when that appears to have been what he privately desired .
‘ Prolonging the War’ Similarly , Bush ’s insistence that the United States must stay in Iraq – because al - Qaeda says it wants to drive American troops out – falls victim to the same Brer Rabbit question :
What if bin Laden really wants to keep the United States bogged down in Iraq , so al - Qaeda can rebuild its operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan ?
Indeed , the possibility of such deception is why U.S. intelligence analysts give greater weight to al - Qaeda ’s internal communications , such as a December 2005 captured letter from one of bin Laden ’s deputies , “ Atiyah , ” to Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , then the leader of al - Qaeda in Iraq .
In the letter , Atiyah counseled Zarqawi to tamp down his indiscriminate violence so as to avoid alienating Sunni tribal chieftains .
Atiyah also said a drawn - out war in Iraq that keeps U.S. forces tied down would advance al - Qaeda ’s strategic goals .
“ Prolonging the war is in our interest , ” Atiyah wrote .
[ To view this excerpt in a translation published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point , click here .
To read the entire letter , click here . ]
The logic of Atiyah ’s advice is now apparent .
Not only did Sunni chieftains – offended by Zarqawi ’s brutality – agree to take U.S. payments in turning against al - Qaeda in 2006 , but the continued concentration of U.S. military resources in Iraq has bought time for al - Qaeda and its Taliban allies to rebuild operations inside Pakistan .
( Zarqawi , however , largely ignored Atiyah 's advice and was killed by U.S. forces in June 2006 after an Iraqi informant tipped them off on his whereabouts . )
Meanwhile , with two open - ended wars and other draining costs from the “ war on terror , ” the Bush administration has driven the federal budget deep into the red , weakening the nation ’s ability to invest in domestic needs , from repairing the infrastructure to investing in a modern , energy - efficient economy .
In messages to each other on radical Islamic Web sites , al - Qaeda and other extremists boast about their success in luring the United States into this strategic trap that has “ exhausted its resources and bankrupted its economy , ” according to the Washington Post ’s review of these communications .
The commentaries argue that McCain – as a stalwart supporter of Bush ’s war policies – is al - Qaeda ’s preferred candidate who deserves a boost that could come from a last - minute terrorist strike inside the United States .
“ It will push the Americans deliberately to vote for McCain so that he takes revenge for them against al - Qaeda , ” according to a posting attributed to longtime contributor Muhammad Haafid .
“ Al - Qaeda then will succeed in exhausting America . ”
Though these Web postings appear intended for internal discussions – and thus may reflect al - Qaeda ’s true opinions – the publicly expressed views of these extremists must always be taken with a grain of salt .
However , in this case , the logic of al - Qaeda wanting a new U.S. President who will continue the occupation of Iraq indefinitely makes sense .
It fits with other private al - Qaeda communications , like the Atiyah letter , and with the judgment of CIA analysts who recognize the counterproductive nature of Bush ’s “ war on terror . ”
The more immediate question , however , may be whether al - Qaeda has the capacity to mount some terrorist attack that would transform the U.S. presidential race in its waning days – and give John McCain enough fresh momentum to win .

Source : Associated Press . ST . PAUL  Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin faces a getting - to - know - you process as the Republican vice presidential candidate , a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll finds : Most Americans say they 've never heard of her .
There is also wide uncertainty about whether she 's qualified to be president .
In the poll , taken Friday , 39 % say she is ready to serve as president if needed , 33 % say she is n't , and 29 % have no opinion .
YOU VOTE : Is Palin a good choice ?
That 's the lowest vote of confidence in a running mate since the elder George Bush chose then - Indiana senator Dan Quayle to join his ticket in 1988 .
In comparison , Delaware Sen .
Joe Biden was seen as qualified by 57 % - 18 % after Democrat Barack Obama chose him as a running mate last week .
" Americans are just beginning to discover that Gov. Palin is an experienced executive who has held office since 1992 and demonstrated time and again her willingness to roll up her sleeves and taken action , " says Maria Comella , Palin 's spokeswoman for the campaign .
" As governor , she has proven to be a real reformer , bucking the establishment to enact sweeping ethics reform , utilize her veto power to cut spending and stand up to big oil to enact legislation to develop Alaska 's energy resources . "
The campaign will use Palin 's speech Wednesday before the Republican National Convention here to introduce her to voters as a fresh face who reinforces John McCain 's image as an independent - minded reformer .
The Arizona senator announced at a campaign rally in Dayton on Friday that he had chosen Palin , 44 , a first - term governor and former mayor of Wasilla , Alaska .
REACTIONS : USA TODAY readers respond ANALYSIS : McCain gambles on surprise pick
Whatever their views on their qualifications , voters say neither Palin nor Biden will have much impact on their vote .
Two of three registered voters , 67 % , say putting Palin on the ticket wo n't affect their vote ; 72 % say that of Biden .
Of those who say the running mates will make a difference , 18 % say Palin makes them more likely to vote for McCain , 11 % less likely .
That net - positive impact of 7 points is similar to Biden's : 14 % said his pick made them more likely to vote for Obama , 7 % less likely .
The telephone survey of 898 registered voters , taken Friday , has a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points .
The full sample of 1,016 adults has an error margin of +/- 3 points .
Among the findings : • Twenty - two percent of registered voters have a favorable view of Palin and 7 % an unfavorable one , while 51 % say they have never heard of her and 20 % have no opinion .
•
Forty - six percent rate McCain 's choice of Palin as excellent or " pretty good , " while 37 % say it is " only fair " or poor .
Over the past two decades , only Quayle received lower ratings after being picked for a ticket .
•
Women overall have a slightly less favorable view of Palin than men , but they also are a bit more likely more likely to say her choice would prompt them to vote for McCain .
Among women , 20 % say her pick makes them more likely to vote for McCain , 11 % less likely .
That compares with 16 % - 12 % among men .
Among Democratic women — including those who may be disappointed that New York Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton did not win the Democratic nomination — 9 % say Palin makes them more likely to support McCain , 15 % less likely .
The sample of 274 Democratic women has an error margin of +/- 6 percentage points .
The USA TODAY survey also finds that Americans give Obama 's dramatic acceptance speech high marks but say the Democratic National Convention has no more impact on their vote than past conventions .
Among all those surveyed , 35 % call Obama 's speech at Invesco Field on Thursday night excellent , 23 % good , 15 % " just OK , " 3 % poor and 4 % " terrible . "
Sixteen percent say they did n't see it , and 14 % have no opinion .
That 's higher than the ratings for acceptance speeches by President Bush and Democrat John Kerry in 2004 , by Bush and Democrat Al Gore in 2000 and by Republican Bob Dole in 1996 .
Asked about the Democratic convention 's impact , 43 % say it makes them more likely to vote for Obama , 29 % less likely .
Nineteen percent say it wo n't make a difference .
That 's similar to the impact of conventions since 1984 , with the exception of 1992 .
In that year , the decision of independent Ross Perot to pull out of the race during the Democratic convention contributed to a big boost for Bill Clinton .

In this study , not only did women make more demands than their husbands , they also got their way more often .
Men might strut their stuff on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill , but across America women wield the power on the home front .
A survey by the Pew Research Center , announced today , finds that among 43 percent of couples the woman makes more of the decisions in the domestic realm than men do .
By contrast , men make more of the decisions in only about a quarter of all couples .
And about three - in - ten couples split decision - making responsibilities equally .
The results support research published last year that found women have more power at home than their husbands .
The past research was based on videos of the couples rather than self - reports about decisions , as is the case for the new study .
The results come from a survey of 1,260 individuals who were married or living as a couple .
Respondents indicated if they or their partners had the final say in certain areas of decision - making .
These areas included choosing shared weekend activities , buying major things for the home , deciding what to watch on television and managing household finances .
Though participants were n't given the option to say they shared decision - making with partners , many said they jointly called the shots at home , in the following ways :
About half of the respondents said they jointly decide or had no fixed pattern for decisions about shared weekend activities and buying big things for the home .
About four - in - ten said the same about television choices , and about one - in - three said the same about managing the household finances .
For the 43 percent of men who do n't have a final say in any of the four areas of domestic life , they either shared decision - making or deferred to their female partners .
Both genders tended to agree on who calls most of the shots at home in at least three household areas .
The exception was household finances .
Forty - five percent of women said they are in charge of home finances , and 23 percent give that honor to men .
Unbeknownst to men : Nearly 40 percent of the guys said they handled the expenses , with just 30 percent saying women did .
When it comes to power over the TV remote , in 27 percent of all couples , the woman decides what to watch on TV .
The man decides in 26 percent of couples , and in about a quarter of all homes , what to watch is decided together .
Patterns of decision - making within couples varied little across most demographic variables ( these usually include such categories as race , ethnicity and religious affiliation ) .
For instance , two - thirds of all husbands in dual - income families reported making more money than their wives , with wives concurring with that statement .
Even still , the woman has more say at home , regardless of her earnings , the survey found .
There was one exception and it has to do with age : Men and women 65 or older are twice as likely as those under the age of 30 to say they and their partner share equally in making family decisions .
There 's mounting talk on Capitol
Hill that a Wall Street bailout will include some limits on executive
compensation , as well as contradictory reports about whether a deal on
controlling executive pay has already been reached .
Four days ago , such a move seemed very unlikely .
But the pushback from
Congress -- from both Democrats and Republicans -- has been
surprisingly robust , thanks in considerable part to a surge of outrage
from the public .
Will restrictions on CEO pay just be a symbolic retribution , as some have charged ?
The answer is , it depends .
Meaningful limits not just on CEO pay , but also on the Wall Street
bonus culture , could significantly affect the way the financial sector
does business .
Some CEO pay proposals , by contrast , would extract a
pound of flesh from some executives but have little impact on incentive
structures .
There are at least five reasons why it is important to address executive compensation as part of the bailout legislation .
First , there should be some penalty for executives who led their
companies -- and the global financial system -- to the brink of ruin .
You should n't be rewarded for failure .
And while reducing pay packages
to seven digits may feel really nasty given Wall Street 's culture of
preposterous excess , in the real world , a couple million bucks is still
a lot of money to make in a year .
Second , if the public is going to subsidize Wall Street to the tune of
hundreds of billions of dollars , the point is to keep the financial
system going -- not to keep Wall Street going the way it was .
Funneling
public funds for exorbitant executive compensation would be a criminal
appropriation of public funds .
Third , the Wall Street salary structure has helped set the standard for
CEO pay across the economy , and helped establish a culture where
executives consider outlandish pay packages the norm .
This culture , in
turn , has contributed to staggering wealth and income inequality , at
great cost to the nation .
We need , it might be said , an end to the
culture of hyper - wealth .
Fourth , as Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research
says , the bailout package must be , to some extent , " punitive . "
If the
financial firms and their executives do not have to give something up
for the bailout , then there 's no disincentive to engage in unreasonably
risky behavior in the future .
This is what is meant by " moral hazard . "
If Wall Street says the financial system is on the brink of collapse ,
and the government must step in with what may be the biggest taxpayer
bailout in history , says Baker , then Wall Street leaders have to show
they mean it .
If they are not willing to cut their pay for a few years
to a couple of million dollars an annum , how serious do they really
think the problem is ?
Finally , and most importantly , financial sector compensation systems
need to be changed so they do n't incentivize risky , short - term behavior .
There are two ways to think about how the financial sector let itself
develop such a huge exposure to a transparently bubble housing market .
One is that the financial wizards actually believed all the hype they
were spreading .
They believed new financial instruments eliminated
risk , or spread it so effectively that downside risks were minimal ; and
they believed the idea that something had fundamentally changed in the
housing market , and skyrocketing home prices would never return to
earth .
Another way to think about it is : Wall Street players knew they were
speculating in a bubble economy .
But the riches to be made while the
bubble was growing were extraordinary .
No one could know for sure when
the bubble would pop .
And Wall Street bonuses are paid on a yearly
basis .
If your firm does well , and you did well for the firm , you get
an extravagant bonus .
This is not an extra few thousand dollars to buy
fancy Christmas gifts .
Wall Street bonuses
can be 10 or 20 times base salary , and commonly represent as much as
four fifths of employees ' pay .
In this context , it makes sense to take huge risks .
The payoffs from benefiting from a bubble are dramatic , and there 's no reward for staying out .
Both of these explanations may be true to some degree , but the
compensation incentives explanation is almost certainly a significant
part of the story .
Different ideas about how to limit executive pay would address the
multiple rationales for compensation reforms to varying degrees .
A two - year cap on executive salaries would help achieve the first four
objectives , but by itself would n't get to the crucial issue of
incentives .
One idea in particular to be wary of is " say on pay " proposals ,
which would afford shareholders the right to a non-binding vote on CEO
pay compensation packages .
These proposals would go some way to address
the disconnect between executive and shareholder interests , reducing
the ability of top executives to rely on crony boards of directors and
conflicted compensation consultants to implement outrageous pay
packages .
But while they might increase executive accountability to
shareholders , they would n't direct executives away from market - driven
short - term decision making .
Shareholders tend to be forgiving of
outlandish salaries so long as they are making money , too , and -- worse
-- they actually tend to have more of a short - term mentality than the
executives .
So " say on pay " is not a good way to address the multiple
executive compensation - related goals that should be met in the bailout
legislation .
The ideal provisions on executive compensation would set tough limits
on top pay , but would also insist on long - term changes in the bonus
culture for executives and traders .
Not only should bonuses be more
modest , they should be linked to long - term , not year - long , performance .
That would completely change the incentive to knowingly participate in
a financial bubble ( or , more generously , take on excessive risk ) ,
because you would know that the eventual popping of the bubble would
wipe out your bonus .
Four days ago , forcing Wall Street to change its incentive structure
seemed pie in the sky .
Today , thanks to the public uproar , it seems
eminently achievable -- if Members of Congress seize the opportunity .

During his interview on ABC’s This Week program this morning , Obama laughed off the idea that Sarah Palin has more national security experience than he does .
He also took the Republicans to task for mocking his time as a community organizer .
They play a segment from McCain ’s interview with Charlie Gibson , “ Alaska is right next to Russia .
She understands that .
She ’s the commander of the Alaska National Guard .
He has no experience on these issues .
She has been in charge , and she has had national security as one of her primary responsibilities . ”
“ I actually knew that Russia was next to Alaska as well .
I saw it on a map , ” Obama laughed and said .
George Stephanopoulos asked Obama if he thought this was a qualification , and he said , “ I do n’t think it is . ”
On the topic of her national security experience Obama said , “ I know that John McCain was offended or at least his campaign was when she was asked , or somebody from his campaign , what decisions did she make when she headed up the National Guard , and they did n’t have a response . ”

“ I think that as somebody who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and passed legislation on critical issues like nuclear proliferation , as somebody who has been working on these issues for long time , and some who selected Joe Biden as vice president who is the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , I am going to be happy to have a substantive debate with John McCain about foreign policy .
This whole resume contest that has been going back and forth is not what the American people are looking for , ” Obama said .
He also said he was puzzled by the Republicans mocking of his time as a community organizer , “ It ’s a real puzzling thing .
Understand what I did as a community organizer .
When I got out of college as a young person 24 , 25 years old , I moved to Chicago and worked with churches who were dealing with steel plants that had closed in their neighborhoods to set up job training programs for the unemployed , and after school programs for youth , and to try deal with asbestos in homes of poor people , community service work , which John McCain has been talking about putting country first and extolling the virtues of national service that ’s what I did between the ages of 24 and 27 before I went to law school .
I would think that is what we want all young people to do .
I would that is an area where Democrats and Republicans agree , so it ’s curious to me that they would mock that , when I at least think that ’s what young people should be doing . ”
Obama said that for folks that are trying to grab the change banner , they have a very traditional view of public service .
To them public service is either politics , or serving in the military .
This was a very relaxed and happy Barack Obama .
Let me interject a little fact here , governors do n’t make foreign policy or national security decisions .
Obama has more experience with national security , because he works at the federal level .
This is high school civics stuff .
The fact that he laughed off the argument that Palin has more experience with national security than he does , proves how ineffective and ridiculous that argument is , which is why the McCain camp has backed off of it .
To me , the Republicans ’ mocking of Obama ’s public service during the convention , was more evidence that they do n’t care or understand the problems of everyday people .
Palin was a nice publicity stunt , but she is n’t going to save the Republican Party .
The fact that many Republicans are counting on her to do exactly this demonstrates their desperation .

So far theories have been at a loss to explain how itacquired its extremely unusual backwards orbit , but the recent discovery ofanother odd comet orbiting farther out in the solar system may shed light on Halley 's origins .
The newly - discovered comet 2008 KV42 circles the sun at atilt of 104 degrees compared to the main plane in which most of the planets andasteroids travel .
The newfound oddball also orbits in reverse compared toalmost everything else .
Scientists think it might represent an intermediatepoint between comets like Halley 's and their progenitors in the far and totallyuncharted reaches of the solar system .
" The big mystery 's been , how do you get comets like Halley 's comet ? " said astronomer JJ Kavelaars of the National Research Council of Canada , whoworked on the team that discovered KV42 .
" It 's one of the most famouscomets known and we have no dynamic explanation for how it got into its orbit , and how it got to be there .
Now we 've found an object that could provide asource for a Halley - type comet . "
KV42 was discovered at about 32 times the distance from the Earth to the sun , and the closest it swings to the sun is about where Uranusis .
Researchers suggest the comet may have originated out in the distant Oortcloud of objects theorized to swarm in a sphere around the solar systemalmost 1 light - year out from the sun , or roughly a quarter of the way to thenext nearest star .
At some point , they think , gravitational interactions ( suchas with Uranus or Neptune , or even a nudge from another star in the galaxypassing nearby the sun long ago ) could have kicked the comet from its perch inthe lower level of the Oort cloud , about a tenth of a light - year away , down towhere it is now , orbiting beyond Neptune in a region known as the Kuiper Belt , where several other normally - orbiting rocky objects have been found .
This would explain how it got such a bizarre backward , orretrograde , and tilted orbit .
If it originated in the spherical Oort cloud , thecomet could develop an orbit with any tilt at all , as opposed to most comets , which originate in the plane of the solar system , so must have an orbit in linewith the planets .
Eventually , researchers predict KV42 could get kicked down evencloser to the sun by interactions with the outer planets and the solar system ' sheavyweight , Jupiter .
Ultimately , both Halley 's and KV42 are likely to end upslingshot out of the solar system altogether from gravitational interactionswith the planets .
Until now , physical models have n't been able to come up withan explanation for a comet like Halley's , but the researchers hope thediscovery of KV42 will allow physicists to plug a new half - way point into theirmodels to derive a reasonable evolutionary path for these objects .
" An orbit like this provides the road sign that saysthere must be a source of objects which could very plausibly be somethingrelated to the Oort cloud , which is feeding in slowly over the age of the solarsystem , " research team member Brett Gladman of the University of BritishColumbia told SPACE.com .
" It ? s a pointer hopefully to a coherent model . "
The researchers presented their discovery at the 10th " Asteroids , Comets and Meteors " meeting in Baltimore in July 2008 .
They first observed KV42 with the Canada - France - Hawaii Telescope in Hawaii , andmade follow - up observations on the MMT telescope in Arizona , Cerro TololoInter - American Observatory ( CTIO ) 4 - metre telescope in Chile , and Gemini Southtelescope of Canada ?s Gemini Observatory , also in Chile .
The former US national security adviser , Zbigniew Brzezinski , has called on the world community to isolate Russia in protest over its campaign in the Caucasus , likening its tactics to those of " Hitler or Stalin " .
Brzezinski , who was the national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981 , and is now an occasional adviser to the Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , said the Russian prime minister , Vladimir Putin , was " following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by Stalin and Hitler in the 1930s " .
He said that Putin's " justification " for splitting up Georgia - because of the Russian citizens living in South Ossetia - could be compared to when Hitler used the alleged suffering of ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland as a pretext for annexing Czechoslovakia in 1938 .
In an interview with the conservative German daily Die Welt , he said even more striking were the parallels between Putin 's strategy against Georgia and Stalin 's invasion of Finland in 1939 , describing both as " the undermining of the sovereignty of a small , democratic neighbouring state through the use of violence " .
He added : " Georgia is to an extent the Finland of today , both morally and strategically . "
Polish - born Brezinski , 80 , who earned a reputation as a hardliner due to his anti-Soviet politics , said the world was now being confronted with the question as to how it should react to Russia and what he saw as its efforts to " reincorporate old Soviet areas into the Kremlin 's sphere of control " .
He said at the heart of the issue was access to oil and specifically who controlled the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline which runs through Georgia .
" If Georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the Caspian Sea and Central Asia , but we can also assume that Putin will exercise a similar strategy against Ukraine if he faces resistance .
He 's already publicly voiced threats against Ukraine . "
" If Russia continues on this path it has to be isolated by the international community , " he said , including economic sanctions on which all alliances from the European Union to Nato would have to take a joint stand .
He added that Russia 's invasion of Georgia was proof of the failure of the White House during George Bush 's eight year tenure , to recognise the " Putin regime " for what it really was .
" Two episodes illustrate this better than any others , " he said .
" First , when Bush met Putin for the first time and said he had looked into his soul and could trust him .
Secondly , when Condi Rice , not so long ago , said that the American - Russian relations had never been better than they are today . "
He said the White House had deceived itself .
Asked why it was that he only spoke of Putin and not of the Russian president , Dmitri Medvedev , Brzezinski said : " He [ Medvedev ] has about as much influence over the current situation as the official head of state in the Soviet Union of the 1950s had over the Soviet Union .
Nobody can even remember his name . "
The nation ’s economy failed to pick up speed in August and the final days of July , as rising prices and a weak job market prompted consumers to reduce spending and shop at discount stores to try to conserve cash .
Economic activity stayed “ weak , soft or subdued ” across the country , according to the Federal Reserve Bank ’s beige book , a regular snapshot of the economy .
The latest edition of the survey , released on Wednesday , signaled that the economy spent the summer in a rut , with consumers feeling little relief from the government ’s tax rebates .
Although gasoline and oil prices began to subside in August , many businesses reported that they felt squeezed by relatively expensive raw materials .
In at least half of the 12 Fed districts  including Atlanta , Boston , Dallas and New York  businesses said they had been forced to raise prices , potentially stoking inflation faster .
“ The Fed found a whole bunch of different adjectives to describe weakness in growth , and a whole bunch of adjectives to describe price pressures , ” said Ethan Harris , chief economist of the investment bank Lehman Brothers .
“ What it ’s describing is basically stagflation . ”
Welcome to : Townhall Debate : Muslin versus Mavrick – Beyond Thunderdome !
Before Barack Obama and John McCain are even introduced , I am struck with wonderment at the staging for the event , which is being held in what appears to be an airtight , windowless bomb shelter gussied up with an ocean of cheap red carpet , a vivid blue wall , one jarringly incongruent purple podium , and risers bought from a Bozo Show firesale .
When the senators walk out , I half expect them to chuck the debate and instead play the Grand Prize Game .
Which would actually pretty fun for us all .
But , instead , we 're treated to watching Barack Obama advocate change , John McCain invoke his record , and Tom Brokaw get snippy because the candidates did n't adhere to the rules and blocked his teleprompter .
By the time Obama gives what was a surprisingly stirring response , even to the ears of this jaded cynic , to a question about what each candidate would ask the American people to sacrifice , he is really hitting his stride .
He sounds confident .
He sounds inspiring .
He sounds presidential .
McCain , on the other hand , sounds condescending – perpetually chanting " My friends , my friends , " like a manic tic , and answering every question with the breathless voice of a desperate , imploring parent .
" Yes , you 've got to go to the dentist , " says my friend Devo , doing his impression of McCain 's beseeching whine , " but I 'll take you to McDonald 's afterwards . "
Content - wise , there are n't many revelations for those who have been paying attention to the race .
If you 've heard their stump speeches , if you 've seen or read interviews with them , there is n't much new meat to chew on here .
Obama stated flatly that healthcare is a right , which is a beautifully refreshing position to hear from an American presidential candidate .
Conversely , McCain defines healthcare as a responsibility .
McCain is certainly the more pugilistic of the two , referring snidely to Obama at one point as " that one , " which is just cringingly ugly and truly the nadir of McCain 's various attempts to treat his opponent with disdain .
He attempts a joke about hairplugs , an oblique jab at Joe Biden , which falls flat and looks pointlessly mean ( which it is ) .
He belligerently defends his " Bomb Iran " performance as a joke .
The Republican nominee is suddenly a very long way from the man who , in April , " pledged to run a respectful campaign . "
When the debate is over , the two candidates meet onstage .
Barack and Michelle Obama stay behind to chat and take pictures with the attendees at the debate , while the McCains beat a rapid retreat .
CNN reports that their campaign watchers give the debate to Obama , 54% - 30 % .
McCain needed to win ; he did not .
He got owned .
Say goodnight , Johnny .
It 's President That One to you .
GIMP 2.6 is an important release from a development point of view .
It features changes to the user interface addressing some often received complaints , and a tentative integration of GEGL , the graph based image processing library that will eventually bring high bit - depth and non-destructive editing to GIMP .
User Interface ¶
Toolbox Menubar Removed ¶
The toolbox menubar has been removed and merged with the image window menubar .
To be able to do this a window called the empty image window has been introduced .
It hosts the menubar and keeps the application instance alive when no images are opened .
It also acts as a drag and drop target .
When opening the first image the empty image window is transformed into a normal image window , and when closing the last image , that window becomes the empty image window .
Toolbox and Docks are Utility windows ¶
With the empty image window acting as a natural main window , the default window hints for the Toolbox and Docks have been changed to Utility window .
This enables window managers to do a much better job of managing the GIMP windows , including omitting the Toolbox and Docks from the taskbar and ensuring that the Toolbox and Docks always are above image windows .
Ability to Pan Beyond Image Border¶
It is now possible to pan beyond the image border , making image window navigation much less constrained .
It is no longer a problem to use the edge of a brush on the edge of an image while being zoomed in , and one can adapt the canvas to any utility windows covering parts of the image window .
Minor Changes ¶
Renamed Dialogs menu to Windows .
Keep a list of recently closed Docks and allow reopening them .
Make opening images in already running GIMP instances work better on Windows .
instances work better on Windows .
You can now enter the image zoom ratio directly in the status bar .
Added support for using online help instead of a locally installed GIMP Help package .
Help package .
Make it possible to lock tabs in docks to prevent accidental moving .
Improved Free Select Tool¶
The freehand select tool has been enhanced to support polygonal selections .
It also allows mixing free hand segments with polygonal segments , editing of existing segments , applying angle - constraints to segments , and of course the normal selection tool operations like add and subtract .
Altoghether this ends up making the Free Select Tool a very versatile , powerful and easy - to - use selection tool .
Brush Dynamics ¶
Brush dynamics let you map different brush parameters , commonly at least size and opacity , to one or more of three input dynamics : pressure , velocity and random .
Velocity and random are usable with a mouse .
The Ink tool , that supported velocity before , has been overhauled and now handles velocity - dependent painting much better .
Brush dynamics have enabled a new feature in stroking paths .
There is now a check box under the “ paint tool ” option , for emulating brush dynamics if you stroke using a paint tool .
What this means is that when your stroke is being painted by GIMP , it tells the brush that its pressure and velocity are varying along the length of the stroke .
Pressure starts with zero , ramps up to full pressure and then ramps down again to no pressure .
Velocity starts from zero and ramps up to full speed by the end of the stroke .
Minor Changes ¶
Added a bounding box for the Text Tool that supports automatic wrapping of text within that bounding box .
Move handles for rectangle based tools like Crop and Rectangle Select to the outside of the rectangle when the rectangle is narrow .
Added motion constraints to the Move Tool .
Improved event smoothing for paint tools .
Mark the center of rectangles while they are moved , and snap the center to grid and rulers .
Enable brush scaling for the Smudge tool .
Added ability to save presets in all color tools for color adjustments you use frequently .
Allow to transfer settings from Brightness - Contrast to Levels , and from Levels to Curves .
Allow changing opacity on transform tool previews .
The Screenshot plug - in has been given the ability to capture the mouse cursor ( using Xfixes ) .
Display aspect ratio of the Crop and Rectangle Select Tool rectangles in the status bar .
Desaturate has been given an on - canvas preview .
The Flame plug - in has been extended with 22 new variations .
Data file folders like brush folders are searched recursively for files .
Replaced the PSD import plug - in with a rewritten version that does what the old version did plus some other things , for example reading of ICC color profiles .
Under the Hood ¶
Important progress towards high bit - depth and non-destructive editing in GIMP has been made .
Most color operations in GIMP are now ported to the powerful graph based image processing framework GEGL , meaning that the internal processing is being done in 32 bit floating point linear light RGBA .
By default the legacy 8 bit code paths are still used , but a curious user can turn on the use of GEGL for the color operations with Colors / Use GEGL .
In addition to porting color operations to GEGL , an experimental GEGL Operation tool has been added , found in the Tools menu .
It enables applying GEGL operations to an image and it gives on - canvas previews of the results .
The screenshot to the right shows this for a Gaussian Blur .
Minor Changes ¶
Ported many widgets to use the 2D graphics library cairo for drawing .
See this comparison for an example of how much better this looks .
There are new things for a plug - in developer to enjoy as well .
For example , procedures can now give a detailed error description in case of an error , and the error can be propagated to the user .
GIMP 2.6 also further enhances its scripting abilities .
In particular there is now a much richer API for the creation and manipulation of text layers .
Here is a list of new symbols in GIMP 2.6 .
Backwards Compatibility ¶
Script - Fu has undergone some clean up and includes several bug fixes .
One important bug fix , for bug # 508020 , prevents a possible crash of Script - Fu .
A side effect of the fix will break any script which does not provide an initial value for a variable in the binding portion of a let , let* , or letrec block .
An initial value for a variable is required as stated in the R5RS Scheme standard document .
The initial value can be provided as a simple constant , or as the result of a function call .
The following examples will illustrate the problem and show a simple change that will fix a broken script .
This example shows a let * block with incorrect syntax that will no longer work in Script - Fu .
( let * ( ( four ( + 2 2 ) ) ( this - is - wrong ) )
This example shows a let * block with the correct syntax .
( let * ( ( four ( + 2 2 ) ) ( this - is - correct 0 ) )
Known Problems ¶
The Utility window hint is currently only known to work well in the Linux GNOME desktop environment and on Windows starting with GIMP 2.6.1 .
desktop environment and on Windows starting with 2.6.1 .
Using the Text Tool is currently not an optimal experience .
Making it work better is a goal for GIMP 2.8 .
2.8 . If you build GIMP yourself and do n’t have GVfs support on your platform you need to explicitly pass -- without - gvfs to configure , otherwise opening remote files will not work properly .
For the interested , here is roughly what is planned for GIMP 2.8 , the next stable release :
Merging Google Summer of Code 2008 projects to trunk , namely on - canvas text editing , tagging of GIMP resources and Python scripting enhancements .

Google has been instructed to reveal the identity of an anonymous blogger in a defamation lawsuit filed by an Indian construction company against them , reports the Wall Street Journal .
The blogger known only as " Toxic Writer , " is accused of attacking the Mumbai - based Gremach Infrastructure Equipments & Projects Ltd. in what they are calling a “ hate campaign . ”
The blog was taken down , and Google ’s Indian subsidiary is claiming they are not responsible for the Blogger.com service .
An angry blogger expressing his opinion anonymously online ?
Sounds like pretty standard fare for the Web .
But the case may force Google to re-examine their business in India , and the issue raises questions about the future of free speech and anonymity online .
John Watson , associate professor at American University specializing in communication law , says this case is not unusual , considering the location .
“ One of the most common places for people to sue , because they will generally win , are nations that are or have formerly been part of the British Commonwealth , where there is no First Amendment , and the law looks more toward protecting the reputation of people than protecting the free speech of speakers , ” Watson told Wired.com .
“ Google which is an American corporation enjoys a great deal of protection here in the United States , but in the rest of the world , it 's subject to the laws of wherever these articles or communications are published , ” he added .
This could potentially become an issue for bloggers bashing folks overseas , and set an example for cases regarding anonymity .
On the positive side , maybe it will encourage citizen journalists to back up their posts with more researched and trustworthy information .
And the other obvious question :
What did this construction company do to get this guy / girl so irked ?

F is for Failure
The Bush Doctrine in Ruins
By Tom Engelhardt
On the brief occasions when the President now appears in the Rose Garden to " comfort " or " reassure " a shock - and - awed nation , you can almost hear those legions of ducks quacking lamely in the background .
Once upon a time , George W. Bush , along with his top officials and advisors , hoped to preside over a global Pax Americana and a domestic Pax Republicana -- a legacy for the generations .
More recently , their highest hope seems to have been to slip out of town in January before the you - know - what hits the fan .
No such luck .
Of course , what they feared most was that the you - know - what would hit in Iraq , and so put their efforts into sweeping that disaster out of sight .
Once again , however , as in September 2001 and August 2005 , they were caught predictably flatfooted by a domestic disaster .
In this case , they were ambushed by an insurgent stock market heading into chaos , killer squads of credit default swaps , and a hurricane of financial collapse .
At the moment , only 7 % of Americans believe the country is " going in the right direction , " Bush 's job - approval ratings have dropped into the low 20s with no bottom in sight , and North Dakota is " in play " in the presidential election .
Think of that as the equivalent of a report card on Bush 's economic policies .
In other words , the Yale legacy student with the C average has been branded for life with a resounding domestic " F " for failure .
( His singular domestic triumph may prove to be paving the way for the first African American president . )
But there 's another report card that 's not in .
Despite a media focus on Bush 's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the record of his Global War on Terror ( and the Bush Doctrine that once went with it ) has yet to be fully assessed .
This is surprising , since administration actions in waging that war in what neoconservatives used to call " the arc of instability " -- a swath of territory running from North Africa to the Chinese border -- add up to a record of failure unprecedented in American history .
On June 1 , 2002 , George W. Bush gave the commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point .
The Afghan War was then being hailed as a triumph and the invasion of Iraq just beginning to loom on the horizon .
That day , after insisting the U.S. had " no empire to extend or utopia to establish , " the President laid out a vision of how the U.S. was to operate globally , facing " a threat with no precedent " -- al - Qaeda - style terrorism in a world of weapons of mass destruction .
After indicating that " terror cells " were to be targeted in up to 60 countries , he offered a breathtakingly radical basis for the pursuit of American interests :
" We can not put our faith in the word of tyrants , who solemnly sign non-proliferation treaties , and then systemically break them .
If we wait for threats to fully materialize , we will have waited too long [ T ] he war on terror will not be won on the defensive .
We must take the battle to the enemy , disrupt his plans , and confront the worst threats before they emerge .
In the world we have entered , the only path to safety is the path of action .
And this nation will act Our security will require transforming the military you will lead -- a military that must be ready to strike at a moment 's notice in any dark corner of the world . "
This would later be known as Vice President Dick Cheney 's " one percent doctrine " -- even a 1 % chance of an attack on the U.S. , especially involving weapons of mass destruction , must be dealt with militarily as if it were a certainty .
It may have been the rashest formula for " preventive " or " aggressive " war offered in the modern era .
The President and his neocon backers were then riding high .
Some were even talking up the United States as a " new Rome , " greater even than imperial Britain .
For them , global control had a single prerequisite : the possession of overwhelming military force .
With American military power unimpeachably # 1 , global domination followed logically .
As Bush put it that day , in a statement unique in the annals of our history : " America has , and intends to keep , military strengths beyond challenge -- thereby making the destabilizing arms races of other eras pointless , and limiting rivalries to trade and other pursuits of peace . "
In other words , a planet of Great Powers was all over and it was time for the rest of the world to get used to it .
Like the wimps they were , other nations could " trade " and pursue " peace . "
For its pure folly , not to say its misunderstanding of the nature of power on our planet , it remains a statement that should still take anyone 's breath away .
The Bush Doctrine , of course , no longer exists .
Within a year , it had run aground on the shoals of reality on its very first whistle stop in Iraq .
More than six years later , looking back on the foreign policy that emerged from Bush 's self - declared Global War on Terror , it 's clear that no President has ever failed on his own terms on such a scale or quite so comprehensively .
Here , then , is a brief report card on Bush 's Global War on Terror :
High - Value Targets
1. Osama bin Laden and al - Qaeda : The Global War on Terror started here .
Osama bin Laden was to be brought in " dead or alive " -- until , in December 2001 , he escaped from a partial U.S. encirclement in the mountainous Tora Bora region of Afghanistan ( and many of the U.S. troops chasing him were soon enough dispatched Iraqwards ) .
Seven years later , bin Laden remains free , as does his second - in - command Ayman al - Zawahiri , probably in the mountainous Pakistani tribal areas near the Afghan border .
Al - Qaeda has been reconstituted there and is believed to be stronger than ever .
An allied organization that did n't exist in 2001 , al - Qaeda in Mesopotamia , was later declared by President Bush to be the " central front in the war on terror , " while al - Qaeda branches and wannabe groups have proliferated elsewhere .
Result : Terror promoted .
Grade : F
2. The Taliban and Afghanistan : The Taliban was officially defeated in November 2001 with an " invasion " that combined native troops , U.S. special operations forces , CIA agents , and U.S. air power .
The Afghan capital , Kabul , was " liberated " and , not long after , a " democratic " government installed ( filled , in part , with a familiar cast of warlords , human rights violators , drug lords , and the like ) .
Seven years later , according to an upcoming National Intelligence Estimate , Afghanistan is on a " downward spiral " ; the drug trade flourishes as never before ; the government of President Hamid Karzai is notoriously corrupt , deeply despised , and incapable of exercising control much beyond the capital ; American and NATO troops , thanks largely to a reliance upon air power and soaring civilian deaths , are increasingly unpopular ; the Taliban is resurgent and has established a shadow government across much of the south , while its guerrillas are embedded at the gates of Kabul .
American and NATO forces promoted a " surge " strategy in 2007 that failed and are now calling for more of the same .
Reconstruction never happened .
Result : Losing war .
Grade : F
3. Pakistan :
At the time of the invasion of Afghanistan , the Bush administration threw its support behind General Pervez Musharraf , the military dictator of relatively stable , nuclear - armed Pakistan .
In the ensuing years , the U.S. transferred at least $ 10 billion , mainly to the general 's military associates , to fight the Global War on Terror .
( Most of the money went elsewhere ) .
Seven years later , Musharraf has fallen ingloriously , while the country has reportedly turned strongly anti-American -- only 19 % of Pakistanis in a recent BBC poll had a negative view of al - Qaeda -- is on the verge of a financial meltdown , and has been strikingly destabilized , with its tribal regions at least partially in the hands of a Pakistani version of the Taliban as well as al - Qaeda and foreign jihadis .
That region is also now a relatively safe haven for the Afghan Taliban .
American planes and drones attack in these areas ever more regularly , causing civilian casualties and more anti-Americanism , as the U.S. edges toward its third real war in the region .
Result : Extremism promoted , destabilization in progress .
Grade : F
4. Iraq :
In March 2003 , with a shock - and - awe air campaign and 130,000 troops , the Bush administration launched its long - desired invasion of Saddam Hussein 's Iraq , officially in search of ( nonexistent ) weapons of mass destruction .
Baghdad fell to American troops in April and Bush declared " major combat operationsended " from the deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier against a " Mission Accomplished " banner on May 1st .
Within four months , according to administration projections , there were to be only 30,000 to 40,000 American troops left in the country , stationed at bases outside Iraq 's cities , in a peaceful ( occupied ) land with a " democratic , " non-sectarian , pro-American government in formation .
In the intervening five - plus years , perhaps one million Iraqis died , up to five million went into internal or external exile , a fierce insurgency blew up , an even fiercer sectarian war took place , more than 4,000 Americans died , hundreds of billions of American taxpayer dollars were spent on a war that led to chaos and on " reconstruction " that reconstructed nothing .
There are still close to 150,000 American troops in the country and American military leaders are cautioning against withdrawing many more of them any time soon .
Filled with killing fields and barely hanging together , Iraq is -- despite recently lowered levels of violence -- still among the more dangerous environments on the planet , while a largely Shiite government in Baghdad has grown ever closer to Shiite Iran .
Thanks to the President 's " surge strategy " of 2007 , this state of affairs is often described here as a " success . "
Result : Mission unaccomplished .
Grade : F
5. Iran :
In his January 2002 State of the Union address , Bush dubbed Iran part of an " axis of evil " ( along with Iraq and North Korea ) , attaching a shock - and - awe bull 's - eye to that nation ruled by Islamic fundamentalists .
( A neocon quip of that time was : " Everyone wants to go to Baghdad .
Real men want to go to Tehran . " )
In later years , Bush warned repeatedly that the U.S. would not allow Iran to move toward the possession of a nuclear weapons program and his administration would indeed take numerous steps , ranging from sanctions to the funding of covert actions , to destabilize the country 's ruling regime .
More than six years after his " axis of evil " speech , and endless administration threats and bluster later , Iran is regionally resurgent , the most powerful foreign influence in Shiite Iraq , and continuing on a path toward that nuclear power program which , it claims , is purely peaceful , but could , of course , prove otherwise .
Result : Strengthened Iran .
Grade : F
Unlawful Enemy Combatants
6. Lebanon : Vowing to encourage a " democratic , " pro-western Lebanon and crush the Shiite Hezbollah movement , which it categorized not only as a tool of Iran but as a terrorist organization , the administration green - lighted Israel 's disastrous air assault and invasion in the summer of 2006 .
From that destructive war , Hezbollah emerged triumphant in its southern domain and strengthened in Lebanese national politics .
Today , Lebanon is once again close to a low - level civil war and the influence of Syria , essentially the unmentioned fourth member of the President 's " axis of evil , " is again on the rise .
Result : Hezbollah ascendant .
Grade : F
7. Gaza :
As part of the President 's " freedom agenda , " the administration promoted Palestinian elections on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip meant to fend off the rising strength of the Hamas movement , which it considered a terrorist organization , and promote the power of Fatah 's president Mahmoud Abbas .
Hamas , however , won the election .
The U.S. promptly refused to accept the results and , with Israel , tried to strangle Hamas in its Gaza stronghold .
Hamas today remains entrenched in Gaza , while Abbas is a weakened figure .
Result : Hamas ascendant .
Grade : F
8. Somalia :
In 2006 , using U.S. trained and funded Ethiopian troops , the Bush administration intervened by proxy in a Somali civil war to oust a relatively moderate Islamist militia on the verge of unifying that desperate country for the first time in a long while .
Two years later , the situation has only deteriorated further : the capital Mogadishu is in chaos , militant Islamists have retaken much of the south , those Ethiopian troops are preparing to withdraw , and the Bush - backed government to fall .
At least , ten thousand Somalis have died and more than a third of the population , a jump of 77 % , needs aid just to survive .
Result : Catastrophe .
Grade : F
9. Georgia : Promoting Georgian democracy -- and an oil pipeline running through its territory that brought Central Asian energy to Europe while avoiding Russia -- the administration armed , trained , and advised the Georgian military , backed the country for NATO membership , and looked the other way as its leader launched an invasion of a breakaway region ( where Russian troops were stationed ) .
Support for Georgia was part of a long - term Bush administration campaign to rollback Russian influence in its " near abroad , " especially in Central Asia ( where results would , in the end , prove hardly more promising ) .
The Russian military promptly crushed and then demolished the Georgian military , brought the future usefulness of the oil pipeline into question , and sidelined NATO membership for the foreseeable future .
In response , the Bush administration could do nothing at all .
Result : Humiliating defeat .
Grade : F
Axis of Evil Extra Credit Target
10 . North Korea : Calling North Korean dictator Kim Jong - il variously a " dwarf , " a " pygmy , " and simply " evil , " and his regime " the world 's most dangerous , " Bush targeted it in his " axis of evil " speech .
As an invasion of Iraq loomed , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld made clear that the U.S. was willing to fight and win wars " on two fronts . "
The administration turned its back on modestly successful , Clinton - era two - party negotiations that froze North Korea 's plutonium - processing program , began overt -- and possibly covert -- campaigns to undermine the regime , and regularly threatened it over its nuclear weapons program .
The invasion of Iraq evidently led North Korean dictator Kim Jong - il to the obvious shock - and - aweable conclusion and he promptly upped the pace of that program .
In 2006 , the country tested its first nuclear weapon and became a nuclear power .
Result : Nuclear proliferation encouraged .

Collateral Damage
11 . Global Public Opinion :
In the 2003 National Security Strategy of the United States was this infamous line : " Our strength as a nation - state will continue to be challenged by those who employ a strategy of the weak using international fora , judicial processes and terrorism . "
In other words , the U.N. , the International Criminal Court , and al - Qaeda were all thrown into the same despised category , along with , implicitly , international public opinion .
Who needed any of them ?
The result ?
With the help of its torture policies and its prison camp at Guantanamo for public relations , the Bush administration achieved wonders .
Never has global opinion of the U.S. been lower ( or anti-Americanism more rampant ) than in these years -- and when the administration needed allies , they were hard to find ( or expensive to buy ) .
Result : Public diplomacy in the tank .
Grade : F
12 . The American Taxpayer : The Bush administration estimated that the war in Iraq might cost the U.S. $ 50 - 60 billion , the war in Afghanistan far less .
By now , those wars have officially cost more than $ 800 billion , close to $ 200 billion in the last year ( at an estimated $ 3.5 billion a week ) .
Their real long - term costs are almost incalculable , though they will certainly reach into the trillions .
The full price tag of the Global War on Terror , including the costs of extraordinary renditions , as well as the building and maintaining of offshore prisons in Iraq , Afghanistan , Cuba , and elsewhere , is unknown , but historians looking back will undoubtedly conclude that the squandering of such sums helped push the U.S. toward financial meltdown .
Result : Priceless .
Grade : F
Evaluation
If you want a final taste of pathos -- to deal with the disasters it created , the Bush administration has finally turned to the most un - Global - War - on - Terror - like diplomatic maneuvers .
It rushed an envoy to North Korea to save a disintegrating nuclear deal ( while agreeing to remove that country from the State Department 's list of state sponsors of terror ) , is preparing the way for possible negotiations with parts of both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban ( call it " reconciliation " ) , and is evidently considering setting up a " U.S. Interest Section " in Teheran soon after the election .
In these last years , the Bush administration 's deepest fundamentalist faith -- its cultish belief in the efficacy of military force above all else -- has proven an empty vessel .
With its " military strengths beyond challenge " all - too - effectively challenged , Bush 's second - term officials are finally returning to some of the most boringly traditional methods of diplomacy and negotiation -- under far more extreme circumstances and from a far weaker position -- while their former neocon supporters scream bloody murder from right - wing think tanks in Washington and the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal .
" Having bent the knee to North Korea , " former U.N. ambassador John Bolton wrote recently in that paper , " Secretary [ of State ]
Rice appears primed to do the same with Iran , despite that regime 's egregious and extensive involvement in terrorism and the acceleration of its nuclear program . "
And they do have a point .
This administration does now seem to be on bended knee to the world .
As with Pandora 's Box , however , what the Bush administration unleashed cannot simply be taken back .
A new administration will not only inherit an arc of instability that is truly aflame , but the paradigm , still remarkably unexamined , of a Global War on Terror .
Now , there is a disaster - in - the - making for you .

We did n't stop anything for Florida , and New Orleans has certainly been through it .
President Bush in his wisdom has put qualified FEMA people in place .
They 're ready for it . "
Ellison continued , " I do n't think we should have interfered with our convention because we already do a lot for the people of New Orleans . "

But the McCain campaign 's debate over nomenclature — unethical , illegal , and unlawful — seems like a bizarrely punctilious exercise in missing the point .
Those categories will matter when the Alaska legislature decides , weeks from now , what to do with the Troopergate report .
But for the next two weeks the only adjective the McCain campaign needs to worry about is " unelectable , " and we can determine whether that adjective applies without worrying about whether Palin 's activities were illegal , or unlawful , or illicit , or whatever .
No one is claiming they qualify her for the vice presidency .
In support of its contention that Palin acted unethically , the report cites 18 separate events in which Palin , her husband Todd , or one of her employees put pressure on Public Safety Commissioner Walter Monegan to fire Trooper Michael Wooten , the ex-husband of Palin 's sister .
Of these my favorite is an occasion in fall of 2007 in which Wooten " was seen [ by Todd Palin ] dropping off one of his children at school " in his patrol car .
Palin called Wooten 's supervisor and complained in the hopes of getting him fired .
Months later a top Palin aide saw Wooten " driving around the Good Shepherd Church early in the morning dropping off one of his kids in a marked patrol vehicle . "
The aide also called and complained .
Both calls were made in the fervent hope that dropping children at school or church in one 's work vehicle was a sackable offense .
And on both occasions it was found that Trooper Wooten had obtained permission to drop off his kids .
The McCain campaign tries gamely to put the law - and - order spin on this sort of thing by noting that the Palin family was " Understandably concerned about a pattern of behavior demonstrated by someone entrusted with the responsibilities of law enforcement , " and thus " reported the behavior to the appropriate authorities . "
Nice try .
Perhaps the Palins really thought Trooper Wooten was a threat to Alaska 's first family and an embarrassment to the state , but if you 're afraid of someone it 's probably not a great idea to hang around outside the school to understand the manner in which he drops off the offspring .
The obvious upshot of the report is that Sarah and Todd Palin wanted Wooten fired not out of fear but because of the messy divorce .
This matters to me in part because she violated an ethics statute , but mostly because I do n't want a vice president who is petty and vindictive .
Perhaps I 'm wrong about the facts of the case .
The McCain campaign 's own analysis of the firing says that " Emails show a pattern of Mr. Monegan refusing to take administration direction and ignoring attempts by members of Governor Palin ’s staff to reach a working consensus on budgetary issues . "
Maybe that 's true , but Palin seems to have little interest in proving it .
She did not provide a sworn statement to the Troopergate investigation , and the report makes clear that Palin 's attorney general , citing executive privilege , did not hand over 209 emails related to the Monegan firing , a hold - up for which " No satisfactory reason or explanation has been given . "
Maybe mavericks do n't need to give explanations , but I ’d like to think that vice presidents do .

In the Georgian Black Sea port of Batumi , the first American naval vessel arrived Sunday to distribute American humanitarian aid .
A train carrying oil cars exploded while traveling near Gori , the city in central Georgia that Russia had occupied for about 10 days .
Georgian officials said the train had struck a mine left behind by Russian troops .
No one was reported killed in the blast or the raging fire that followed , which sent thick plumes of black smoke across the countryside .
With the bulk of Russian troops now withdrawn to the enclaves or to Russian soil , Mr. Saakashvili described the war against South Ossetia and Russia  a military defeat that imperiled his government and threatens Georgia ’s fragile economy  as a seminal moment that offered the seeds of political and national success .
In an interview in his office that stretched until nearly 2 a.m. , Mr. Saakashvili said that Georgia had gained allies in the world and would embark upon a campaign of rebuilding .
He predicted continued American support and said that he spoke by phone with the presumptive Republican nominee for president , Senator John McCain , as often as twice a day , and that he was in regular contact with Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , who has been picked to run for vice president on the Democratic ticket .
He also said that the Bush administration had not communicated disappointment or signaled a decline in its support for him since he gave the order on Aug. 7 to attack Tskhinvali , the South Ossetian capital .
He said that while he might face pressures in the months ahead , as the effects of the war ripple through the economy , he said he expected to weather any troubles .
“ There has been tremendous solidarity , ” he said .
After the critical drubbing George Lucas has received as a writer and storyteller , the news that he ’s conceiving the plot for a fifth Indiana Jones movie must be met with skepticism .
Still , Harrison Ford told The Los Angeles Times that Lucas has a plan .
" It ’s crazy but great , " Ford said .
" George is in think mode right now . "
While Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull may have grossed $ 318 million domestically and $ 770 million worldwide , it was also poorly reviewed noting it lacked the spark and originality that fueled the franchise earlier .
" It ’s automatic , really , we did well with the last one and with that having done well and been a positive experience , it ’s not surprising that some people want to do it again , " the 66 - year old actor told Geoff Boucher .
He spoke further about franchising the character in other media and said outright he would never consent to voicing an animated incarnation .
" I ’m not philosophically against doing animation roles but not for Indiana Jones , " Ford noted .
" I ’d hate to see it reduced in any way from the movies that we have done and the way we have done them . "
While the DVD will be released on October 14 , it may be the last time to watch Indy for a long while .
Despite talk for years , the fourth film was a stop and start process for over a decade as they ran through numerous writers then had to wait for the stars to align to allow Lucas , Ford and Steven Spielberg to be free at the same time .

Pelosi Clashes With Protesters Over Impeachment
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi 's appearance Monday at a West Los Angeles college to discuss her recently published book was marred by dozens of protestors and several angry outbursts by audience members who demanded Pelosi immediately authorize a House committee to hold impeachment hearings against President George W. Bush .
The Speaker made it clear she would not support any effort to hold impeachment hearings against President Bush saying that the president " will be gone in a hundred days . "
Halfway through her discussion at The American University of Judaism , where more than 300 people paid $ 30 each to hear Pelosi speak about her upbringing and her family 's impact on her political career as detailed in her book Know Your Power : A Message to America ’s Daughters , the topic shifted to Congress 's historically low approval rating and how it reflected on Pelosi ’s tenure as Speaker .
American University of Judaism's Rabbi Robert Wexler , who moderated the 75 minute interview , asked Pelosi to analyze a recent Rasmussen poll that found nine percent of individuals polled believed Congress was doing a good job , far lower than President Bush 's overall approval rating .
Pelosi responded by defending her performance and the performance of her Democratic colleagues in Congress .
" I preside over the greatest collection of integrity and idealism , " Pelosi said .
Prior to her appearance in West Los Angeles Monday evening , CNN ’s Larry King interviewed Pelosi .
She told King she was willing to drop her staunch opposition to offshore drilling and would likely allow the House to vote on the issue .
She said , in her opinion , the reason behind Congress ’s low approval rating was largely due to the fact that Democrats could not muster up the votes to end the Iraq war , which the Democratic Speaker from San Francisco said she could not do much about because of the Democrats ’ razor - thin majority in both Houses .
Wexler , however , continued to press Pelosi to elaborate on her response given that the Rasmussen poll suggested that a wide - range of issues beyond the Iraq war was responsible for Congress ’s single - digit approval .
Pelosi , visibly flustered , said she was well aware that “ much more work needs to be done . ”
In November 2006 , Pelosi explained the significance behind the record voter turnout that helped shift the balance of power in Washington for the first time in 12 years .
“ People voted for change and they voted for Democrats who will take our country in a new direction , ” Pelosi said during a victory speech in San Francisco on Nov. 8 , 2006 .
But Pelosi , who became House Speaker , never managed to exact the change she promised .
She explained that she and her colleagues tried vigorously to pass legislation to end the war in Iraq .
" The public does n’t want to know about process and 60 votes , they want outcomes , they want results , " Pelosi said , explaining why Democrats could not end the war as promised prior to the midterm 2006 elections .
But Pelosi ’s comments appeared disingenuous to many , since she was largely responsible for crafting an appropriations bill in backroom discussions with House Democratic leaders , passed in June , and then worked secretly with the White House budget director offering up concessions on Iraq war benchmarks if Bush would agree to the domestic spending attached to the final bill with little debate preceding a vote on the measure .
In fact , since the electoral victories in November 2006 , the Democratic - controlled Congress has approved more than $ 300 billion in emergency spending bills for Iraq and Afghanistan without the benchmarks or withdrawal timetables that Pelosi and other leaders said they would demand .
When Pelosi launched into the reasons an administration led by presumptive Republican nominee Sen .
John McCain would be dangerous for the country , identifying the candidate 's support for an endless war in Iraq and his intention to uphold many of the questionable constitutional interpretations relating to torture and civil liberties during the Bush administration , Pelosi said the only way to " dig our way out " is by electing Sen.
Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee .
“ Whether it ’s the deficit or the challenges to the constitution we have to dig our way out , ” Pelosi said , adding “ this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today . "
Her response led Peter Thottam , founder of the LA Impeachment Center , to demand Pelosi " do her job " and pursue impeachment hearings against President Bush for launching a war on false pretenses .
" Who gave you the right to take the constitution and shove it down the toilet ?
Who gave you the right to take impeachment off the table ?
Nobody told them to do this , ” Thottam shouted at Pelosi moments before Secret Service agents removed him from the packed auditorium and turned him over to officers with the Los Angeles Police Department .
“ One million Iraqis are dead .
Five thousand Americans are dead .
You have destroyed the First , Second , Fourth , Fifth and Eighth Amendments . "
Pelosi seemed stunned by the outburst , but the way she addressed Thottam ’s charges further fanned the flames and led to additional verbal protests over her decision not to hold the administration accountable for what many individuals in the audience believe are High Crimes and Misdemeanors by President Bush .
When a member of the activist group Code Pink stood up and insisted Pelosi brush up on her reading regarding evidence of the Bush administration 's long list of alleged constitutional violations , Pelosi reacted angrily .
" I take an oath of office to uphold the constitution of the United States and do n't tell me that I do n't do that , ” Pelosi said , using hand gestures to emphasize her disdain over the impeachment demands .
" Why do n't you go picket the Republicans in Congress that will not allow us to have a vote on the war .
This is not very effective .
Not very effective . "
" As Speaker of the house , the third highest office , first is the president , then vice president , and then Speaker , I take my responsibilities deadly seriously , ” Pelosi said .
“ I try to promote bipartisanship but that 's not what the other side wants . "
Before Election 2006 , Pelosi declared impeachment “ off the table , ” in part , to avoid alarming centrist voters .
Now , with Democrats hoping to gain additional seats in Election 2008 , a similar political calculation applies , fearing a backlash against a last - minute drive to impeach Bush and Cheney .
Bush knows that Pelosi long ago rejected impeachment proceedings , the one instrument included in the Constitution for Congress to wield against a President who has abused his powers .
At the conclusion of Monday evening ’s presentation , Pelosi signed books but refused to answer questions about her policy decisions .
The Public Record asked Pelosi whether she would authorize the full House to vote on contempt charges against former White House political adviser Karl Rove , who has refused to comply with a congressional subpoena to testify about his role in the alleged political prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , a Democrat .
Immediately following his query to Pelosi , The Public Record 's Alan Breslauer was grabbed by Secret Service and dragged away from the table where Pelosi was signing copies of her book .
The Speaker did respond to Breslauer 's question , however , saying a vote on contempt charges against Rove is " up to [ House Judiciary Committee Chairman ] Conyers . "

U.S. intelligence analysts eavesdropped on personal calls between Americans overseas and their families back home and monitored the communications of workers with the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations , according to two military linguists involved in U.S. surveillance programs .
The accounts are the most detailed to date to challenge the assertions of President Bush , CIA Director Michael V. Hayden and other administration officials that the government ’s controversial overseas wiretapping activities have been carefully monitored to prevent abuse and invasion of U.S. citizens ’ privacy .
Describing the allegations as “ extremely disturbing , ” Sen . John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va. ) , chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , said the panel had launched an inquiry and requested records from the Bush administration .
The linguists said that recordings of intimate conversations between citizens and their loved ones were sometimes passed around , out of prurient interest , among analysts at an electronic surveillance facility at Ft. Gordon , Ga .
Advertisement
They also said they were encouraged to continue monitoring calls of aid workers and other personnel stationed in the Middle East even when it was clear the callers had no ties to terrorists or posed no threat to U.S. interests .
“ There were people who called the States to talk to their families , ” said Adrienne Kinne , 31 , a former Arab linguist in the Army Reserve who worked at a National Security Agency facility at Ft. Gordon from 2001 to 2003 .
“ We identified phone numbers belonging to nonthreatening groups , including the Red Cross , ” she said in an interview with The Times .
“ We could have blocked their numbers , but we did n’t , and we were told to listen to them just in case . ”
Kinne ’s accounts were echoed by a former Arab linguist for the Navy , David Murfee Faulk , 39 , who worked at the same facility from 2003 to 2007 and said in an interview that the government routinely monitored conversations between U.S. troops in Iraq and their spouses or loved ones .
Advertisement
“ I observed people writing down , word for word , very embarrassing conversations , ” Faulk told The Times .
“ People would say , ‘ Hey , check this out , you ’re not going to believe what I heard . ’ ”
Their claims were reported Thursday by ABC News .
The overseas wiretapping activities have been a source of controversy since it was disclosed in December 2005 that Bush had secretly authorized the NSA to override existing laws and begin monitoring the international phone calls and e-mails of U.S. residents .
Critics , including some members of Congress , have described the eavesdropping as a violation of laws passed in the 1970s that required court warrants before communications of U.S. residents could be monitored .
Bush and Hayden , who headed the NSA from 1999 to 2005 , have repeatedly defended the legality of the program , characterizing it as a carefully targeted operation .

“ We ’re going after very specific communications that our professional judgment tells us we have reason to believe are those associated with people who want to kill Americans , ” Hayden said in a speech defending the program in 2006 .
It is not clear whether the abuses alleged by Kinne and Faulk occurred as part of the sweeping Terrorist Surveillance Program authorized by Bush in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks or were tied to more narrow military intelligence operations focused on protecting U.S. forces .
An NSA spokesman said the agency “ takes its legal responsibility seriously ” and operates “ in strict accordance with U.S. laws and regulations and with the highest standards of integrity and lawful action . ”
“ Some of these allegations have been investigated and found to be unsubstantiated , ” the NSA spokesman said .
“ Others are in the investigation process . ”

Congress overhauled the foreign intelligence surveillance laws this year to give the government greater latitude to track targets overseas .
But the law still imposes strict protections for U.S. citizens abroad and requires the government to delete or block information that is n’t for valid intelligence purposes .
“ At NSA , the law was followed assiduously , ” said Mark Mansfield , a spokesman for Hayden , who became CIA director in 2006 .
“ The notion that Gen .
Hayden sanctioned or tolerated illegalities of any sort is ridiculous on its face . ”
An intelligence official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity said the inspectors general at the Army and the NSA had investigated Kinne ’s allegations and “ were not able to substantiate them . ”
Civil liberties groups said the linguists ’ accounts raise questions about safeguards for citizens .
“ The NSA used its surveillance powers to intentionally collect the personal communications of innocent Americans , ” said Jameel Jaffer , director of the American Civil Liberties Union ’s National Security Project .

Kinne and Faulk described working in massive facilities at Ft. Gordon where rows of linguists and analysts wearing headphones comb through intercepts collected from all over the world , transcribing the recordings in English .
Ft. Gordon is one of three military facilities in the United States -- the others are in Texas and Hawaii -- dedicated to so - called signals intelligence analysis .
Kinne said the recordings she transcribed were mainly intercepted transmissions from satellite phones in the Middle East .
The recordings would initially be sorted by computer and given rankings from 1 to 9 , with the lowest numbers associated with terrorists and other immediate threats and given greatest priority .
“ Humanitarian aid organizations were priorities around 5 or 7 , ” said Kinne , who now works at a veterans hospital in Vermont and has joined an antiwar veterans group .
She said she reported her concerns to superiors as well as members of Congress , including Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , but “ nobody ever bothered to call me back . ”

Faulk , who worked until recently as a reporter for a community newspaper in Augusta , Ga. , said he was one of as many as 3,000 linguists at Ft. Gordon , many of them in their early 20s .
His group spent much of its time monitoring calls into and out of Baghdad ’s Green Zone , the fortified enclave that houses the U.S. Embassy and military and intelligence commands .
“ I think it was a small number of people abusing the program , ” Faulk said .
“ But I also think that the majority of translators , because of their age -- very young , very often recruited right out of high school -- are susceptible to falling into this trap . ”

US counterterrorism policies and support for the Ethiopian - backed Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) in Somalia have helped create an increasingly desperate humanitarian and security situation in the East African nation , whose population has become increasingly radicalized and anti-US , according to a new report by a major US human rights group .
The report , authored by Ken Menkhaus , a Davidson College professor who is regarded as one of the foremost US experts on the Horn of Africa , calls for a thorough reassessment of US policy , including its support for the TFG and the primacy it has given to its " war on terrorism " in Somalia .
" US counterterrorism policies have not only compromised other international agendas in Somalia , they have generated a high level of anti-Americanism and are contributing to radicalization of the population , " concluded the report , entitled " Somalia : A Country in Peril , a Foreign Policy Nightmare . "
" In what could become a dangerous instance of blowback , defense and intelligence operations intended to make the United States more secure from the threat of terrorism may be increasing the threat of jihadist attacks on American interests , " the report stressed .
The 17 - page report , released by ENOUGH , a group launched last year by the Brussels - based International Crisis Group ( ICG ) and the Washington - based Center for American Progress ( CAP ) , was released amid continuing violence in Somalia that has forced some one million people to flee their homes since December 2006 , when US - backed Ethiopian and TFG forces swept the Islamic Courts Union ( ICU ) out of the capital , Mogadishu , and other major cities and towns .
The UN recently estimated that , barring substantial improvement in the security situation , some 3.5 million Somalis will be dependent on humanitarian aid by the end of this year .
" The ( current ) crisis is fundamentally different and fundamentally worse than the situation of the last decade and a half , " said Chris Albin - Lackey , a Horn of Africa specialist at Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , who appeared with Menkhaus at the report ’s release at a conference sponsored by at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars here Wednesday .
Albin-Lackey , who has conducted some 80 interviews of Somali refugees in East Africa in the past month , said ongoing violence , including almost daily artillery bombardments by Ethiopian army and TFG forces on the one hand and opposition militias , including the Islamist Shabaab on the other , as well as assassinations carried out by both sides , have added to the insecurity .
" People have nowhere to turn for security , " he said , adding that search operations by TFG forces , while nominally for the purpose of arresting suspected insurgents , had become " an excuse for murder , rape and looting on an incredibly large scale . "
As a result , he said , Mogadishu has become " largely depopulated " with about two - thirds of the population  or about 800,000 people  having left their homes there over the past 18 months .
Menkhaus described last month ’s signing by the TCG and the opposition Alliance for the Reliberation of Somalia ( ARS ) of the " Djibouti Agreement " negotiated between moderate leaders of both sides with the help of UN Special Representative Ahmadou Ould - Abdulla last June as an " important step " toward reconciliation but warned that hard - liners in both camps could derail it .
The agreement , which has been rejected by the Shabaab and was only agreed to by the hawkish TFG president , Adullahi Yusuf , under heavy pressure from Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi , calls for a cessation of hostilities , deployment of a UN peacekeeping force , and the subsequent withdrawal of Ethiopian forces .
" The hope is that any agreement that facilitates the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces will open the door for an end to the insurgency , " according to the report .
But the implementation of the agreement faces " steep challenges , " warned Menkhaus , not least because " the moderates [ who negotiated the accord ] do n’t control any of the armed groups . "
While the Shabaab have already denounced the ARS leaders as " apostates , " he noted , hard - liners in the TFG know that they can stay in power " if and only if the Ethiopians stay . "
Only by reinforcing the moderates can the international community , including the US , enhance the chances for the agreement ’s successful implementation and , with it , the chances for reconciliation , according to Menkhaus .
But that will require major changes in US and western policies , which have " actually worked to strengthen and embolden hardliners " over the past two years .
In that respect , the US emphasis on counterterrorism has been particularly destructive , not only in supporting the Ethiopian offensive in December , 2006 , but , more recently , in placing the Shabaab on its list of designated terrorist groups last March .
That step not only isolated opposition moderates from their own coalition but also gave the Shabaab " even more reason to sabotage " ongoing peace talks .
At the same time , Washington has provided " robust financial and logistical support to armed paramilitaries resisting the command and control of the TGF , even though they technically wear a TFG hat " to both fight the Shabaab and track down suspected terrorists .
" To the extent that these security forces also deeply oppose … reconciliation efforts with the opposition , the US counterterrorism partnerships have also undermined peace - building efforts by emboldening spoilers in the government camp , " according to the report .
Washington has not been alone in supporting the hard - liners , however .
As part of their state - building agenda , other western donors have also provided direct support to TGF security forces under the control of the hawks .
Despite the UN ’s role as a supposedly neutral broker between the TFG and the opposition , the UN Development Program , has also provided security assistance to the TFG .
The Tomahawk missile attack that killed Shabaab leader Aden Hashi Ayro in May  the latest in a series of similar strikes against armed Islamists in Somalia , allegedly tied to al - Qaeda  resulted in a sharp radicalization in the group , which announced at the time that it would strike against US and western targets , including aid workers , as well as Ethiopian and TFG forces , compounding an already dramatic humanitarian crisis .
" Somalia today is the most dangerous place in the world for humanitarian aid workers , " according to Menkhaus .
More than 20 humanitarian workers have been killed since January , while some 30 more have been kidnapped .
" The situation in Somalia today exceeds the worst - case scenarios conjured up by regional analysts when they first contemplated the possible impact of an Ethiopian military occupation , " according to the report .
" Over the past 18 months , Somalia has descended into terrible levels of displacement and humanitarian need , armed conflict and assassinations , political meltdown , radicalization and virulent anti-Americanism . "
" We ’ve gotten the exact opposite of what we set out to achieve , " Menkhaus noted , including a " population radically angry at us and very fertile ground for al - Qaeda . "

It 's almost difficult to comprehend the deluge of Palin expenses we 've been made aware of in the past few days : the $ 150,000 wardrobe , the $ 21,000 state dollars spent transporting her kidlets to events , and the use of the Alaska public safety department 's plane ... good thing we have Jon Stewart to break down the narrative of the Palin family fortune for us !
You see , they 're Grifters !

Hmm , what have we here ?
A recent Microsoft survey sent out to select users has us wondering what on Earth the mega - corp is planning to do next , and judging by the looks of things , it has everything to do with Instant On .
We 've seen a number of these lightning - fast boot applications , with the most recent being ASUS ' Splashtop OS and the iteration loaded onto Dell 's freshest Latitudes .
The survey makes mention that the " Instant On experience is different from ' Full Windows ' because it limits what activities you can do and what applications you have access to . "
The survey also asks about which applications would be most important to have quick access to , and it very plainly states that in this " scenario , " your PC would " be usable in eight seconds . "
So , is Instant On coming to Windows ?
Who knows -- but it 's clear someone at Redmond is giving it some thought .

Web design galleries started out as a novel idea several years ago when the first few launched to showcase excellent work of designers from all around the world , specifically those with exemplary use of CSS .
There are now hundreds of design galleries out there .
Throughout the design community there are mixed reactions to design galleries .
Many designers visit a few specific galleries on a daily or weekly basis to see what ’s being added .
Others get more annoyed each time a new gallery is launched .
With a number of design galleries drawing significant traffic and advertising revenue , others who are wanting to run their own profitable websites are often drawn to the idea of a gallery .
With so many established galleries out there already , the opportunities for new ones are rather limited in most cases .
Still , some new galleries are finding ways to interest visitors through specialization in a specific niche .
While niche galleries are unlikely to ever generate the traffic statistics of leading galleries like CSS Mania , they do offer something unique to visitors that can allow them to stand out from the hundreds of other galleries .
The Facts About Design Galleries
Over the past few years , several galleries have been successful at attracting visitors and producing ad revenue .
Galleries that do n’t post several new additions each day do not take as much time to maintain as some other types of websites , such as an active blog .
This , combined with the income potential , seems to encourage the existence of even more galleries .
Even though there are hundreds of galleries in existence , a relatively small percentage draw considerable traffic because of the saturation .
Most of those that do draw a lot of traffic were launched several years ago .
Despite the fact that the market is saturated with design galleries , they continue to interest designers who are looking for inspiration due to the convenience of finding great designs in one place .
Why Were Design Galleries Successful in the First Place ?
In order to look at the future of design galleries and what may be in store , it ’s important to look back and determine what made them successful in the first place .
The biggest reason , in my opinion , that designers have loved galleries for years is the time that can be saved .
All designers love inspiration of some type , and most enjoy looking at the best websites designed by others .
However , without galleries , finding the best websites for inspiration would be extremely time consuming .
Galleries make it possible for designers to get that inspiration in a matter of minutes .
Design galleries can be a lot of fun , maybe more so when they were a new idea , but they still can be fun today .
The ease of design galleries made it an enjoyable experience to get inspiration , rather than a frustrating process of browsing through portfolios of individual designers or firms .
Another reason for the success of design galleries is do to the exposure that a designer or website owner can get by being featured in a popular gallery .
Many of the visitors to galleries are designers and many of those designers are also trying to get their own work included in the gallery .
That keeps people coming back and gives designers motivation to get their work in the gallery .
The originality of the first few galleries was also a significant reason for their success .
People liked the idea and responded by helping to grow the popularity of the galleries .
Advancements in internet technologies and the availability of high - speed connections increasing have given designers more opportunities to experiment and take liberties in their design that might not have been possible earlier .
The increased creativity of the work gives design galleries a wider selection of websites to feature that will attract the interest of visitors .
Current Problems with Design Galleries
The biggest problem with design galleries is that there are too many similar choices .
Many of the sites featured in galleries are showcased in several different galleries , making the difference from one gallery to the next pretty minimal .
Visitors often have little motivation to visit more than just a few galleries because they wo n’t see much that ’s new to them .
A number of design galleries become abandoned or very really are updated with new designs .
In some cases , even those that were leading galleries in the past have slowed down considerably or completely stopped posting updates .
A surprising number of galleries do n’t include images in their RSS feeds , although this is mostly the smaller galleries .
With inspiration being the goal of a gallery , it ’s easy to see why those that are the most successful are also the ones that are showing images in their feeds .
The popular galleries that were established several years ago make it difficult for new galleries to get noticed and gain an audience of their own .
Most visitors prefer to keep going back to their favorite galleries .
The Niche Solution
The desire to find excellent examples of new web designs has not faded from most designers .
But these people already have their own favorite places to go to look for general design inspiration .
Some examples of niches galleries that were featured in this post include Design by Grid ( focusing on grid - based design ) , eduStyle ( higher education websites ) , Full Single ( single - page websites ) , and We Love WP ( WordPress - powered sites ) .
All of these galleries have effectively chosen a specific niche that makes it a go - to resource for it ’s own type of design .
No general gallery can provide as much ease of use if you ’re looking for that specific type of inspiration .
In my opinion , starting a niche design gallery is a better decision that starting a general gallery considering the amount of competition and the number of general galleries that are already established , not to mention that at this point niche galleries are more useful for visitors .
There are a number of opportunities to start a gallery in a niche that has n’t yet been touched , or maybe has n’t been effectively served by other niche galleries .
The problem of abandonment or infrequent postings has also effected niche galleries , but those that have worked to establish themselves in their niche have seen decent traffic , produced some revenue , and effectively served designers in their niche ( We Love WP is one of the best examples ) .
The Future of Design Galleries and Niche Galleries
Design galleries in general do n’t seem to be going away any time in the near future .
Niche galleries seem to have more use for visitors and more opportunities for success for those who are looking to launch a new gallery .
My guess is that niche galleries that are run well with a strong plan and commitment will have a much better chance of making an impact in the design community than general galleries that have n’t yet been launched .
What ’s Your Opinion ?
Do you currently visit design galleries ?
If so , which ones do you prefer ?
Do you have an interest in niche galleries and do you see a future for them ?
In a new study of a fossil fish that lived 375 million years ago , scientists are finding striking evidence of the intermediate steps by which some marine vertebrates evolved into animals that walked on land .
There was much more to the complex transition than fins evolving into sturdy limbs .
The head and braincase were changing , a mobile neck was emerging and a bone associated with underwater feeding and gill respiration was diminishing in size , a beginning of the bone ’s adaptation for an eventual role in hearing for land animals .
The anatomy of this early transformation in life from water to land had never before been observed with such clarity , paleontologists and biologists said Wednesday in announcing the research .
The scientists said in a report being published Thursday in the journal Nature that the research exposed delicate details of the creature ’s head and neck , confirming and elaborating on its evolutionary position as “ an important stage in the origin of terrestrial vertebrates . ”
With party strategists fearing a bloodbath at the polls , GOP officials are shifting to triage mode , determining who can be saved and where to best spend their money .
RNC eyes $ 5 M bailout for GOP senators
The Republican National Committee , growing nervous over the prospect of Democrats ’ winning a filibuster - proof majority in the Senate , is considering tapping into a $ 5 million line of credit this week to aid an increasing number of vulnerable incumbents , top Republicans say .
With party strategists fearing a bloodbath at the polls , GOP officials are shifting to triage mode , determining who can be saved and where to best spend their money .

And with the House and Senate Republican campaign committees being drastically outspent by their Democratic counterparts , and outside groups such as Freedom ’s Watch offering far less help than was once anticipated , Republicans are turning to the national party committee as a lender of last resort .
A decision is imminent because television time must be reserved and paid for upfront , and available slots are dwindling .
A representative for the RNC would neither confirm nor deny that it was considering the move .
The RNC and National Republican Senatorial Committee are legally prohibited from discussing an “ independent expenditure ” campaign by the RNC for Senate races , including the content of the ads or where they run .
Independent expenditure campaigns are run by a separate unit within the national committee , one “ walled off ” from the rest of the organization .
But RNC strategists can deduce from the NRSC buys , as well as public polling , where their help is needed .
NRSC officials did not directly address the issue of an RNC - funded ad campaign for Senate races , but they said they had worked closely with their RNC counterparts throughout the cycle .
Both the NRSC and DSCC are allowed to spend limited funds directly on Senate races , but spend the bulk of their money on their own TV ad efforts in targeted states .
During this cycle , the NRSC has spent heavily in Minnesota , North Carolina , New Hampshire and Mississippi , among other states .
GOP sources emphasized they would not be diverting money from John McCain , who they promised would continue to enjoy a steady stream of ads from the party ’s independent expenditure arm .
The party raised a record $ 66 million last month , and McCain is increasingly relying on RNC funds .
“ We ’re not giving up on McCain , ” said a top GOP source .
“ We ’re still going to do everything we can there because his margin and what he does affects these races . ”
A senior Republican said : “ We ’re much better off having a competitive presidential ticket . ”
But that the party would use new money to block a Democratic triumph in the Senate rather than boost the odds of its presidential nominee speaks volumes about what many Republicans think is still salvageable .
And some in the GOP , especially those working on House and Senate races in which their candidates ’ poll numbers swoon during the financial crisis , are increasingly agitated about money being spent on what all observers , including McCain , acknowledge is an uphill fight on top of the ticket .
“ They should pull the money from ­McCain like [ former RNC Chairman ]
Haley Barbour did in ’ 96 , when Dole slid away , and funnel it to save some Senate and House seats as best they can , ” said one longtime GOP strategist who is working on congressional races .
The RNC tried a similar “ firewall ” strategy late in the 2005 - 2006 election cycle , hoping to save GOP Senate seats in Ohio , Missouri and Tennessee .
The RNC dumped millions of dollars into that effort only to see Democrats take two out of the three seats on their way to winning control of the Senate .
The RNC has also been running TV ads in several House districts , according to GOP and Democratic sources .
Incumbents in both chambers who were previously seen as safe are now perceived as slipping away .
But to ensure at least one bulwark against total Democratic control , GOP officials are more inclined to focus their resources on the Senate .
“ There are seven or eight [ seats in danger ] , ” a top Republican said of the upper chamber .
“ What ’s it going to be a week from now ? ”
Party officials see GOP Senate seats at risk in North Carolina , Kentucky , New Hampshire , Colorado , Minnesota , Mississippi , Alaska , Oregon and Georgia .
The financial situation for Sen. Elizabeth Dole ( R - N.C. ) has gotten so precarious that she has announced she will be spending her own money on the campaign .
Democratic third - party groups have spent millions attacking her as an ineffective senator , and her poll numbers have cratered .
According a source familiar with this week ’s ad buys , the DSCC is outspending the NRSC by just under $ 30 million in targeted states .
The committee has been using an e-mail appeal for a 60 - seat , filibuster - proof majority to raise money , relying on such Democratic Party figures as former President Bill Clinton and Sens.
Barack Obama , Joe Biden and Barbara Boxer .
But the Obama - Biden campaign has refused to provide millions of dollars in help to the DSCC , turning down a direct appeal by Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) and arguing that it needs the money itself to beat McCain .

FINANCIAL TURMOIL FINANCIAL TURMOIL
More coverage : Recession is official , economists say NEW YORK 
The U.S. has not endured a deep and prolonged recession in more than a quarter century — enough time for many Americans to forget what one feels like .
But unlike the last two relatively short recessions , this one could be much longer and more severe , potentially bringing with it anxiety and job losses not seen in many years .
" In thinking about recessions , people will naturally think back to the last couple " in the early 1990s and in 2001 , said Paul Ashworth , senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto .
" What they should be looking back at is further . "
That requires dredging up memories of the economic slides in the 1970s , when an Arab oil embargo starved the nation of energy , and the early 1980s , when unemployment and inflation soared .
The last recession — coinciding with the collapse of the tech stock bubble and the terrorist attacks of 2001 — lasted just eight months .
It was known more for the slow " jobless " recovery that followed than for the depth of the downturn .
Many economists agree that the nation wo n't be so fortunate this time .
" I do n't think we can escape damage to the real economy , " former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said this week in Singapore .
" I think we almost inevitably face a considerable recession . "
The Fed 's current chairman , Ben Bernanke , delivered a more measured , but similarly grave assessment to economists , saying the recent financial turmoil " may well lengthen the period of weak economic performance and further increase the risks to growth . "
The signs of stress are starting to show : The U.S. has lost 760,000 jobs since late last year , and retail sales in September plunged 1.2 % , the largest drop in three years .
Every recession is driven by its own dynamic and psychology .
The current slump started with the collapse in the housing market and got worse with sharp restrictions on credit that pressured consumer spending and businesses .
That is a different environment from 1973 , when an oil crisis was the culprit , squeezing U.S. businesses and consumers .
In the early 1980s , raging inflation and high interest rates took their toll .
Both periods saw millions of Americans out of work .
In 1975 , the unemployment rate peaked at 9 % .
In 1982 , it jumped to 10.8 % .
Most economists forecast a sharp increase in the number of people who lose their jobs .
But they do not see it leading to unemployment on the scale of either the 1970s or 1980s .
The jobless rate is currently at 6.1 % , and many economists expect it to rise to about 7 % early next year — a level the country has not seen since 1993 .
Some analysts believe the unemployment rate could eventually climb close to 8 % , which has n't happened since 1984 .
But this recession could begin to feel like those of the past not just because of lost jobs , but because of fear about the future .
In the 1980s , as the nation struggled with inflation and a transition from a manufacturing economy to one based on services , Americans had " a huge amount of uncertainty and anxiety that lingered on for a long period of time , " said Bart Van Ark , chief economist for The Conference Board .
" That element I find comparable to what we 're seeing today , but some of the underlying dynamics are very , very different . "
In 1973 , the U.S. economy had been growing for three years and unemployment had dropped to well below 5 % .
Then , on Oct. 6 , Egyptian and Syrian forces launched surprise attacks on Israeli - held territory while Jews were observing Yom Kippur .
Arab members of OPEC soon cut off shipments of oil to the U.S. and other countries that supported Israel .
Oil prices rose sharply and forced rationing of tight supplies .
Drivers lined up at filling stations on odd or even days depending on the number on their license plates .
Some stations ran out of gas .
A recession is typically defined as a period in which the economy shrinks for two quarters in a row .
In the 2001 recession , the quarters were n't even consecutive .
But in the 1970s , the recession stretched on for a year and a half .
Nearly 2.2 million people lost their jobs .
By the end of 1974 , the Dow Jones industrial average had lost more than 40 % of its value .
At the same time , the nation was focused on the Watergate scandal and the vacuum left by President Nixon 's resignation in August 1974 .
The economy began to recover in spring of the next year .
But inflation , which had eased as the oil embargo was lifted , spiked again .
By 1980 , prices were rising at an annual rate of 13.5 % .
Anxious about a hostage crisis in Iran and the Carter 's administration inability to tame inflation , Americans elected Ronald Reagan president .
But it was n't at all clear how his plan to increase defense spending would cure the economy 's ills .
Volcker , appointed by Carter to lead the Fed in 1979 , took on inflation by sharply raising interest rates .
It worked , but made life even more difficult for consumers at a time when the nation was doubtful about its economic future .
" That was the feeling at that time : hopelessness , in terms of how do we get out of this situation , " said Anthony Campagna , author of The Economy in the Reagan Years .
The next recession did not come until 1990 , as preparations for the Gulf War drove up the price of oil .
But the 1.6 million jobs lost was much less severe than in the previous downturn , and this one lasted for just eight months .
When it recovered , the economy staged its longest expansion on record — 10 years of growth .
The next recession , in early 2001 , was similarly short - lived .
The number of people out of work rose sharply , but compared with some past recessions , unemployment rate was relatively mild .
The fact that the last two recessions were so short , the damage relatively limited and the preceding good times so long has helped many people forget the pain of a more severe economic slump .
" We 've become a little spoiled , actually , " said Todd Knoop , a professor at Iowa 's Cornell College and author of " Modern Financial Macroeconomics : Panics , Crashes and Crises . "
That could make this recession feel particularly intense .
Said Jay Bryson , global economist at Wachovia : " I think no matter how you measure it , this coming recession will be worse than the last one . "

Bloomberg :
The Federal Reserve will pump an additional $ 630 billion into the global financial system , flooding banks with cash to alleviate the worst banking crisis since the Great Depression .
The Fed increased its existing currency swaps with foreign central banks by $ 330 billion to $ 620 billion to make more dollars available worldwide .
The Term Auction Facility , the Fed 's emergency loan program , will expand by $ 300 billion to $ 450 billion .
The European Central Bank , the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan are among the participating authorities .
The Fed 's expansion of liquidity , the biggest since credit markets seized up last year , came hours before the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a $ 700 billion bailout for the financial industry .
The crisis is reverberating through the global economy , causing stocks to plunge and forcing European governments to rescue four banks over the past two days alone .

NEXT ENTRY » Poll :
Young people who use landlines are more conservative than those who use mobile phones
At Amherst college , 1 % of first - year students have landlines , 99 % have Facebook accounts
Peter Schilling — the director of information technology at Amherst College — crunched the numbers on the technological habits of this year ’s incoming class , and discovered some fascinating stuff .
He ’s published it online as the “ IT Index ” , crafted in the style of a Harper ’s Index , and it ’s an intriguing snapshot of some of the technologically - driven behavioral changes that will mark the next generation .
Below are a few of my favorite stats , culled from the list .
As you read , keep in mind that this incoming class has 438 students in it :
Percentage of first - year applicants who applied online in 2003 : 33 % .
Percentage of applicants who did last year : 89 % .
By the end of August 2008 the total number of members and posts at the Amherst College Class of 2012 Facebook group : 432 members and 3,225 posts .
Students in the class of 2012 who registered computers , IPhones , game consoles , etc. on the campus network by the end of the day on August 24th , the day they moved into their dorm rooms : 370 students registered 443 devices .
Number of students in the class of 2012 who brought desktop computers to campus : 14 .
Likelihood that a student with an iPhone / iTouch is in the class of 2012 : approximately 1 in 2 .
Total number of students on campus this year that have landline phone service : 5 . Mac or PC ?
Of the four classes currently on campus the classes of 2009 and 2010 are more likely to own Windows , while the classes of 2011 and 2012 are more likely to own Macs .
Okay , so , landlines are now officially a dead - man - walking technology : Only 1.1 % of kids today have one .
Meanwhile , Facebook has achieved precisely the opposite : A completely insane level of market penetration , at 98.63 % .
And Steve Jobs ?
Your work here is done .
Granted , the landline result is no doubt skewed by the fact that students who are only spending eight months a year on campus are less likely to get a personal landline in the first place , even absent the existence of mobile phones .
But still , it ’s a pretty remarkable death knell for a technology .

DIGG THIS
The market turns out to be a more efficient mechanism for digesting dispersed information than any that man has deliberately designed .
~ F.A. Hayek
It is now 2008 , and Ron Paul himself has admitted that he thought he'd be back in Texas at this stage of the election campaign , cooling his heels .
But timing is everything , and America seems a bit more receptive to Dr. Paul 's message than she has been in recent times .
The most obvious manifestation of his new - found staying power is his record - breaking ability to raise gobs of cash .
Back in early October , when I read that his campaign 's brain trust had set $ 12,000,000 as their fourth quarter fundraising goal , the first thought that popped into my head was " oh my god , they are potheads ! "
Yet , here I am three months later and I 'll be disappointed if he does n't rake twenty million , minimum .
And it's all because Ron Paul , at the beginning of October 2007 , had been cured of his skepticism .
At the beginning of the fourth quarter Ron Paul ( unlike every other candidate ) decided to openly show the world how much he has raised in actual cash , and update the total every minute or so on his web site .
That , ladies and gentlemen , takes absolute nerves of steel .
And what made his decision even more out there is that it was decided upon before the Ron Paul people had ever heard of Trevor Lyman and James Sugra ( the brains behind the money bombs ) , before they had any idea that they were up the road ahead .
While Ron Paul had been cured of his skepticism , his decision to go transparent was helped along by his reading habits .
In his famous essay The Pretence of Knowledge , Austrian economist Frederic Von Hayek spoke to his belief that no matter how intelligent they might be , a small group of men , even a few thousand of them ( even if they all had Ivy League Ph.D.s ) , could not come close to the aggregated knowledge of all their fellow citizens in their millions .
Von Hayek 's warning to would - be planners can be summed up in a saying my mother used to drill into our young Irish heads — " Let Go and Let God . "
In other words , some things it 's better to let alone — like your fellow man .
As Bloomberg 's Caroline Baum said , it 's best to leave people be because " you never know where the next big idea or product will come from . "
It is a practical argument for freedom ; its capacity to release superhuman , really cool events upon humanity — like Victor Pelevin , the iPod , and ( in this instance ) the money bomb .
In the boardroom discussions at the Ron Paul camp , that was the argument bandied about , that was his brain trust 's thought process , that 's why they decided to take a leap of faith and post their supporters ' numbers and generosity in real time  democratic , open , and trusting .
No other candidate can hold a candle to this , and it all happened because Ron Paul read an essay penned by a now dead man and preached it to his followers .
Jon Bydlak ( all quotations in this column are from him ) spoke about Hayek 's essay during our call , stating that its underlying argument " allowed us to get over our fear of going transparent . "
The entire concept of trusting that someone , somewhere , somehow would come along and think of how to raise that cash " fit with the model of our campaign , " it fit with Ron Paul 's governing principles .
The decision makes sense coming as it does from Ron Paul 's classic liberal philosophy because it is based on trust in his fellow man to ( usually ) do the right thing .
It stands in direct conflict with all political schools which call for man 's freedom to be curtailed , else we 'll smoke too much or drink too much or play dirty videos or , god forbid , save " too much " money or will choose not to go to Iraq .
The philosophy of liberation views men as rational adults , capable of being trusted , of having an inalienable right to be trusted — socialism starts with no such premise .
Ron Paul trusted his supporters were large enough in number to raise $ 12 million , trusted enough that he was going to show the world its unfolding in real time .
It was Babe Ruth pointing to the outfield bleachers  before homering to the very spot .
It was Davey Johnson stating pre-season that he expected his ' 86 Mets to dominate — before they did .
It is Ron Paul declaring I can raise $ 12 million this last quarter  before raising $ 19 million ( so far ) .
Ron Paul let go and let God , secure in his belief that somewhere out there , he knew not where , there was somebody or some bodies that would show what a people left the hell alone can do .
Quite a bit , incidentally .
Somewhere in the netherworld , von Hayek is chuckling .
How To Detonate A Money Bomb
No one person made this possible .
~ Jon Bydlak , fundraising director , Ron Paul presidential campaign , 2008
My favorite thing about Ron Paul 's campaign and libertarianism in general is that its underlying moral can be summed up as " the plan is there is no plan . "
The money bombs , and classic liberal society in general , are a spontaneous action by , for , and from the working masses , perfect as any the communists always pined for yet never experienced .
As the first money bomb gained strength , the internet rode Revere - like , from computer to computer , Ron Paul headquarters blissfully unaware .
Yet , I 'd be remiss if I did n't give some opinion as to how it was pulled off .
I just want to stress that it was n't planned as modern day America understands the term .
But there are certain characteristics that a candidate , and his campaign , must have in order to pull one off .
Like any news organization will tell you , Ron Paul 's campaign is not exactly stuffed full of big-named , heavy - hitting establishment players .
Hotel suites at two grand nightly are not on the menu for the Paul campaign staffers ; I 'm afraid they even at times endure the horror of a Motel 6 .
But they are not exactly wet - nosed amateurs , either .
After three decades in power Dr. Paul can make his way around our nation 's capital without a map ; he 's an experienced campaigner .
The decision to go completely transparent funds - wise ( a decision that by happy coincidence would add fuel to the money bombs ' fire ) was not rashly made in a factual vacuum .
During the last half of September , two events were staged  and unlike the soon - to - come money bombs they were actually planned by the campaign .
Fill the Quill came first , and a request for $ 500,000 to fill an on - line thermometer graphic then followed on the last week .
What happened ?
These test runs allowed the Ron Paul people to “ learn the power of empowering people . ”
For Fill the Quill he asked 1,787 ( get it ? ) of his supporters to sign up to donate , yet the campaign ’s focus was more on the number of donors rather than the cash generated .
Ron Paul ’s people , basically , were putting their toe in the water to gauge the depth of the market , before diving in .
Over twice the target number of people signed up .
The following week , Ron Paul ’s people decided to set a fund - raising goal for the last week of the third quarter  $ 500,000 .
The following week , Ron Paul 's people decided to set a fund - raising goal for the last week of the third quarter  $ 500,000 .
The MeetUp group which raised the most funds would get a personal visit from Dr. Paul .
They raised $ 1,000,000 , ending the quarter at $ 5,000,000 , shocking the pundits ' laughter and Ron Paul 's skepticism right out of them .
So they had a very strong inkling that the support was out there , " by the beginning of the fourth quarter we knew our ability to raise cash on - line was a big strength . "
They took a deep breath , looked the possibility of public failure right in the eye , and leapt into transparency .
Ron Paul 's decision to go completely transparent and live prior to even knowing about the money bombs , before even knowing about their possibility , dovetailed nicely with the entire concept and turned it into a sporting event .
By happy coincidence , scoreboard watching entailed donating .
If you are a supporter of the candidate it is being staged for , watching a money bomb detonate is much like watching a sporting event .
Instead of my brothers calling each other back and forth all day with " did you see that catch ?!?! , " instead it had us asking " did you see what he 's raised so far ?!?! "
Jon Bydlak put it more professionally stating that , " by providing real - time numbers , it provides people with instant feedback , " and even cooler , after donating you can zip back to Ron Paul 's front page and see your name displayed for a few seconds of almost fame — a brilliant idea thought up by … Ron Paul 's director of security .
Someone posted on blogforfredthompson.com
" I anticipate 89 million since that other guy ( Ron Paul ) is half what Fred is in the polling .
Should easily get double .
Fred is polling high .
Lots of supporters to draw from . "
Apparently not .
Bottom line , you need the support of the people ; there just are n't enough actual people in the special interest groups and corporations to pull this off .
You do n't need high - priced consultants to figure it out for you — a money bomb comes from your individual supporters — the masses .
The Federation of Conservative Republicans blasted Fred Thompson 's failed money bomb as " amateurish " — but this is clearly not the reason for its failure .
A successful money bomb is in and of itself an amateur event , an event unplanned from the center .
As Mr. Bydlak said , it is " people working together in a decentralized manner . "
Trevor Lyman and James Sugra , the two gentlemen who lit the fuses for Ron Paul 's money bomb success , are a California dude and a Miami Beach resident , respectively .
They are both very young , and they are both as amateur as amateur can get .
And your supporters must not only be numerous , but excited enough by your message to act on it , to donate their time and money willingly .
Ron Paul 's pledge of equality before the law , his promise to stop the looting and killing , have struck a groundswell of supporters willing to act on their own .
In the run-up to Fred Thompson 's money dud , one poster on blogforfredthompson.com excitedly wrote " finally the grassroots will help Fred with much needed cash .
I was wondering when we would be activated . "
Nobody activated Ron Paul 's supporters to set off a money bomb , nobody had to .
Ron Paul did n't think he had to because von Hayek told him he did n't have to .
Ron Paul had that trust in his supporters , and proved his skepticism cured by going transparent .
Trusting in the " free market " is , when you think about it , a trust in the people .
And therein lies the ideological chasm between Ron Paul and Fred Thompson , and far too many of his Congressional colleagues .
They trust the aggregated money of special interests and corporations will roll in , and it does .
But what do they have to sell the working masses but our own money and freedom ?
We have that already .
If you do not have that groundswell of widespread , excited supporters embarrassing things can happen .
Much discussion took place at Ron Paul 's brain trust , like " where do we set the goal , what happens if you do n't meet it ? "
Like I said above , Ron Paul 's decision took a large dose of courage , because failure would have looked , at minimum , like this :
Barack Obama
Barack Obama became the front - runner for the White House .
~ Telegraph.co.uk
Barack Obama 's supporters launched an attempt to raise money to crush the Ron Paul campaign 's mother lode .
After all , with front - runner status and double - digits in the polls , surely Mr. Obama would see an inflow of more than $ 4,700 from 73 people on his November the 16th money bomb .
No he would n't , and stop calling me Shirley .
Michael Huckabee
( Mike Huckabee ) appears to be on the rise in national polls .
~ CNN.com
Traditionally , religion has been the last refuge of the scoundrel , but in modern day America that torch has been passed to " the children . "
Since , according to the run-up to his November 20th money bomb , Mr. Huckabee 's the " one candidate who can truly better our children 's future " ( and who 's not for the children ? ) , one would guess that the Republican front - runner would bring in more than $ 223,589 .
I freely admit that is not a bad number at all if you keep your brain closed real tight and block out $ 4,300,000 and $ 6,000,000 .
On December 27th , Mike Huckabee 's legions of supporters , whose backing has thrown him into number one in the polls , held another money bomb for him and raised … $ 89,965 .
Usually invoking religion is a no - brainer way to rake in the dough .
Floating crosses and all , Mike Huckabee is proving the opposite .
Mitt Romney
The GOP front - runner is n't Fred Thompson or Mitt Romney …it 's " none of the above . "
~ Salon.com
Mitt Romney and his perfectly perfected otherworldly coif chose December 7th for his money bomb , to mark that black day when Japan , without a declaration of war , launched a pre-emptive attack on our nation .
Asking his poll - bots to stop giving him double - digit assurance and instead send money for a change , I can find nothing on his website as to its success .
Interestingly , his websites " news " section on December 8th carried nary a mention of his money bomb .
Silence is always golden , and sometimes telling , too .
Concerning its success , we 'll safely plagiarize National Review 's on - line comment concerning Fred Thompson 's money bomb and apply it to Mr. Romney 's as well — " if ( it ) went well , we 'd have a number by now . "
I 've always wanted to use we 'll and well in the same sentence , and thanks to Mitt Romney now I have .
Sometimes , people , dreams do come true .
Fred Thompson
“ My question to ya'll is : If Ron Paul can raise the money he raised in 24 hours …. why can't we do the same for Fred ? "
~ From www.blogsforfredthompson.com
Speaking of Fred Thompson , due to lack of funds as of the time of this writing he has been reduced to taking a tour bus from town to town in Iowa — no more flying for Freddie .
Campaign spokesmen have been non-committal on rumors that Mr. Thompson , to help save cash , has been crashing nightly in various supporters ' homes .
OK , I made that last bit up , but the thought of it makes me smile .
On November 21st Fred Thompson  assured by the polls that his supporters were double to Ron Paul 's in number — asked them to participant in a joint mass fundraising called , strangely , " Fred 's Giving Day . "
( Fred 's not giving , you are . )
No mention of any historic reference date , nor of the amount of cash raised .
As National Review on - line commented , ( sing along now ) " if u2018 Fredsgiving Day ' went well , we'd have a number by now . "
The people of the Middle East can rest a bit easier ; Fred Thompson is running out of gas .
Welcome to the Cheap Seats
There is nothing quite as wonderful as money .
There is nothing quite as beautiful as cash .
Some people say it ’s folly , But I ’d rather have the lolly .
With money you can make a splash .
~ Monty Python
In American politics circa 2008 , where the air is buried by the sounds of frenzied bi-partisan pigs feeding at the trough , there is nothing a man needs more to run a top - tier political campaign than gobs of cash .
With so much of Other People 's Money up for grabs , the special interests ' bidding for a slice of the loot is fierce and fast .
A modern - day candidate must spend upwards of $ 80 million or so to claw their way into America 's heart , because the rent seekers are willing to pay millions for , and Congress is willing to sell trillions of , what is not theirs .
At the end of every quarter all candidates must announce to the American people how much tribute they 've collected .
America , being in the habit of measuring fitness for office in dollar terms , has decreed this a necessary part of the democratic process .
It is a fact of life .
What makes Ron Paul 's money raising juggernaut so fun to watch is that he 's raising this money from individuals , not special interest groups or corporations looking for handouts of Other Peoples '
Money , but from individuals who want nothing more than to stop the looting .
Ron Paul strolled into our political gladiator 's pit to the howls and laughter of the luxury boxes .
But he raised his eyes and voice to the upper boxes , raised them to all the forgotten ones sitting in the cheap seats .
Judging by the $ 19 million of fourth quarter money they have showered upon him as of the time of this writing , the cheap seats were n't laughing .
Not at all .
This column is written with grateful thanks to Ron Paul 's fundraising director , Jonathon Bydlak , who was kind enough to give his time and help fill in the blanks .

The Best of C.J. Maloney
Swiss researchers have demonstrated a variety of ways to eavesdrop on the sensitive messages computer users type by monitoring their wired keyboards .
At least 11 models using a wide range of connection types are vulnerable .
The researchers from the Security and Cryptography Laboratory at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne are able to capture keystrokes by monitoring the electromagnetic radiation of PS / 2 , universal serial bus , or laptop keyboards .
They 've outline four separate attack methods , some that work at a distance of as much as 65 feet from the target .
In one video demonstration , researchers Martin Vuagnoux and Sylvain Pasini sniff out the the keystrokes typed into a standard keyboard using a large antenna that 's about 20 to 30 feet away in an adjacent room .
" We conclude that wired computer keyboards sold in the stores generate compromising emanations ( mainly because of the cost pressures in the design ) , " they write here .
" Hence they are not safe to transmit sensitive information . "
No doubt , electromagnetic eavesdropping dates back to the mid 1980s , if not earlier .
But Vuagnoux says many of today 's keyboards have been adapted to prevent those attacks from working .
The research shows that even these keyboards are vulnerable to electromagnetic sniffing .
The video demonstrations show a computer that reads input from antennas that monitor a specified frequency .
In both cases , the computer was able to determine the keystrokes typed on keyboards connected to a laptop and power supply and LCD monitors were disconnected to prevent potential power transmissions or wireless communications .
Vuagnous said in an email that the attacks would still work even if the power supplies and monitors were plugged in .
The demonstration has already gotten the attention of other security researchers .
" It 's definitely believable that this is possible , " Charlie Miller , principal security analyst for Independent Security Evaluators .
" It is very James Bond . "
The idea would be for an attacker to sniff passwords and other sensitive data using equipment located in an adjacent hotel room , office , or home .
Even still , it 's easy to see the limitations of such attacks .
Interference from other televisions , lights , or other devices seems likely , although the video demonstrations suggest that the attacks work even when there are nearby computer monitors .
The other thing that makes the attack unfeasible is the amount of sophisticated equipment required .
Given all the fuss and expense , why not just sneak a keylogger onto the target 's machine ?
The findings will be fleshed out in an upcoming research paper . ®
If a man doth close both eyes , and raise both guns , so does his aim grow more true .-- Galat 25:3
If this looks like the kind of movie you 'd like , then you 're in luck , it delivers .
If it does n't look like anything you 'd ever like , then you probably want to buy a copy of , a movie so dangerously vacuous it carries a Black Box Warning for Suicidality in Children and Adolescents .
It 's the movie Mick Jagger would produce if he he simultaneously hit male menopause and a truckload of opaku dung and then got down to producing , which , believe it or not , is almost exactly what happened , except that it was n't male menopause .
The best thing that can happen to you while watchingis cataracts .
No .
Well , no , not really .
There 's a brief shot of her from the back getting out of a bathtub , but she is so heavily tattooed that she looks like Venom got her .
Hey , if you do n't like the reference go back toI did n't say it was good , I said it was GREAT .
It contains all the elements a pathologically narcissistic and emasculated generation of men need to make themselves feel good again , without marijuana OR facebook .
Let 's review :
By " subtext , " I of course mean " subtitle . "
While to the great unwashed itthat you are a lowly account manager in a cubicle with a cheating girlfriend and no self - respect , you are much , much more than that , like , for example , a mystical assassin with the ability to shoot curveball bullets .
Importantly , your specialness comes not from effort , work , emotion , intellect , perseverance , or concentration , but from just being you -- in this case , being from the lineage of a 1000 years of special people .
All you had to do is get born !
Thanks feudalism !
You know how your Dad sucks ?
Well , he 's not really your Dad .
Your real Dad was a great hero , not an HVAC repairman , did n't your mother tell you ?
His sword is out back under a rock .
In this movie , he was a child when his Dad left ( to be a mystical assassin ) but , keeping to the mythology , was closely but secretly monitoring his son's development ( in this case by moving in across the street and buying a telescope . )
You know how you suck ?
Turns out it 's genetic , but do n't Mapquest cyanide plants just yet .
Once you unlock your genes , you 'll be able to do almost anything , including but not limited to shooting curveball bullets and slowing down time .
I know , it 's far in the future .
But until then you can keep yourself from a suicide / pregnancy pact by remaining optimistic : the best scientists in the secret labs of Asia are working on it .
In the meantime , why not test out your awesomeness by wrestling pumas ?
Awesome .-- all these movies represent the demasculinization of a decade of twenty - somethings , but lacked the most important element : you .
This was fixed withAngelina Jolie has all the necessary special powers and abilities , yet she chose you .
Back in the day -- e.g. the six thousand years preceding 1992 -- the man had to earn the girl 's interest / love / vagina by doing something extraordinary , or at least trying to be extraordinary , or at least being a good person , or at least paying her .
Now , thanks to a lifetime of Captain Crunch , Coldplay , and institutionalized narcissism , a man can hope that a woman with special powers will want him precisely because these special powers allow her to see how awesome he really is .
Not what he is , of course , but , you know , what heis .
You know .
Lookthe XBox , you damn bitch .
Key point : even if he does n't ultimately live up to his potential , he still got to make out with her .
Nice !
Awesome , again .
You know , back in the day ( see above ) all special abilities were to be used for saving people , and killing was always the last resort , and only to be done under the specific direction of John Woo or one of the remaining Wachowski Brothers .
As the Bible teaches us , it 's not murder if you 're doing a back flip .
But in this movie , killing is the .
Never mind that there 's no evidence that the targets are actually bad people -- that 's a decision that Fate makes .
Not metaphorically , I mean literally Fate makes it , and it lets you know by sending you a message in binary code written by a ... magic loom .
Look , if Angelina Jolie is going to like you , some people are going to need to die to balance out the universe .
Madonna , whore and death instinct , all in high def !
Thanks Freud !
If your iPhone suddenly sends you a message in a binary code that says you need to kill John Smith , you 're going to think back if you took your Zyprexa .
Why ?
Because no one tells an iPhone owner what to do except Steve Jobs , got it ?
But if something with no technology in it at all -- say , a loom -- tells you you need to kill John Smith , you have no choice but to pull up your pants and get your Sig Sauer .
It 's totally logical that God can influence a loom -- been doing that since Arachne -- but clearly He 's too old to understand all that new fangled technology .
The last time
He did was in Stephen King 's , which , if I 'm not mistaken , was an IBM PC .
Look , he 's writing out the Book Of Names What does it say about our time when we are more in awe of mechanical objects then we are of technology that uses quantum mechanics to operate ?
I did have one question .
If Wesley is such a loser before he learns of his specialness , how did he manage to get this girl as a girlfriend in the first place ?
I 'd like to see that movie , please .
That aside -- and maybe I 'm different -- but if I was able to bend space and time at will , and I learned I was the first lieutenant of Fate itself , and it was my responsibility to emotionlessly execute specific human beings in order to restore balance to the universe , then obviously I 'm definitely going to want to find my ex-girlfriend and show her what she missed out on , right ?
Why else even have those powers ?
Does that make me a bad person ?
Nothing in a movie speaks to a viewer more than actually speaking to a viewer , and that 's what this movie does .
As it ends , Wesley looks up from his rifle scope , turns to the camera and asks , " This is me taking back control of my life .
What the fuck have you done lately ? "
Well ?
" Not killing people " is , of course , a loser 's answer , so do n't pick it .
Correct answers include , " waiting for my powers to kick in " and " not learning jujitsu because I 'll be handed those skills all at once when they are necessary " and " waiting for Angelina to swing buy with a pizza " and " masturbating . "
When , as a medical student , I emerged from the cinema having watched Stanley Kubrick ’s controversial film of A Clockwork Orange , I was astonished and horrified to see a group of young men outside dressed up as droogs , the story ’s adolescent thugs who delighted in what they called “ ultra- violence . ”
The film had been controversial in Britain ; its detractors , who wanted it banned , charged that it glamorized and thereby promoted violence .
The young men dressed as droogs seemed to confirm the charge , though of course it is one thing to imitate a form of dress and quite another to imitate behavior .
Still , even a merely sartorial identification with psychopathic violence shocked me , for it implied an imaginative sympathy with such violence ; and seeing those young men outside the theater was my first intimation that art , literature , and ideas might have profound — and not necessarily favorable — social consequences .
A year later , a group of young men raped a 17 - year - old girl in Britain as they sang “ Singing in the Rain , ” a real - life replay of one of the film ’s most notorious scenes .
The author of the book , Anthony Burgess , a polymath who once wrote five novels in a year , came to dislike this particular work intensely , not because of any practical harm to society that the film version of it might have caused but because he did not want to go down in literary history as the author of a book made famous , or notorious , by a movie .
Irrespective of the value of his other work , however , A Clockwork Orange remains a novel of immense power .
Linguistically inventive , socially prophetic , and philosophically profound , it comes very close to being a work of genius .
The story , set in the England of the near future ( the book was published in 1962 ) , is simple .
The narrator , Alex , a precocious 15 - year - old psychopath who has no feeling for others , leads a small gang in many acts of gratuitous , and much enjoyed , violence .
Eventually , caught after a murder , he goes to prison , where — after another murder — the authorities offer to release him if he submits to a form of aversive conditioning against violence called the Ludovico Method .
On his release , however , he attempts suicide by jumping out of a window , receiving a head injury that undoes his conditioning against violence .
Once more he becomes the leader of a gang .
In the final chapter of the book ’s British version , Alex again rejects violence , this time because he discovers within himself , spontaneously , a source of human tenderness that makes him want to settle down and have a baby .
In the American edition — which Stanley Kubrick used — this last chapter is missing : Alex is not redeemed a second time , but returns , apparently once and for all , to the enjoyment of arbitrary and antisocial violence .
In this instance , it is the British who were the optimists and the Americans the pessimists : Burgess ’s American publisher , wanting the book to end unhappily , omitted the last chapter .
Burgess had been a schoolteacher ( like William Golding , author of Lord of the Flies ) and evidently sensed a stirring of revolt among the youth of his country and elsewhere in the West , a revolt with which — as a deeply unconventional man who felt himself to be an outsider however wealthy or famous he became , and who drank deep at the well of resentment as well as of spirituous liquors — he felt some sympathy and might even have helped in a small way to foment .
And yet , as a man who was also deeply steeped in literary culture and tradition , he understood the importance of the shift of cultural authority from the old to the young and was very far from sanguine about its effects .
He thought that the shift would lead to a hell on earth and the destruction of all that he valued .
He marks the separateness of his novel ’s young protagonists from their elders by their adoption of a new argot , as well as a new form of dress .
Vital for groups antagonistic toward the dominant society around them , such argots allow them to identify and communicate with insiders and exclude outsiders .
Although I worked in a prison for 14 years , for example , I never came to understand the language that prisoners used as they shouted to one another across landings and between buildings .
It was their means of resisting domination .
In the French banlieues , les jeunes use an argot derived from words spelled and pronounced backward — and completely incomprehensible to educated speakers of French .
People of Jamaican descent in Britain use a patois when they want not to be understood by anyone else .
The connection between argot and criminal purposes has long been close , of course ; and the importance that Burgess ascribes to the new argot in A Clockwork Orange suggests that he saw youthful revolt as an expression more of self - indulgence and criminality than of idealism — the latter , shallower view becoming orthodoxy among intellectuals not long after A Clockwork Orange appeared .
Burgess ’s creation of a completely convincing new argot more or less ex nihilo is an extraordinary achievement .
Nadsat ( Russian for “ teen ” ) , as its speakers call it , is a mixture of anglicized Russian words — particularly provocative at the height of the cold war — and Cockney rhyming slang .
As a linguistic invention , it is the equal of Orwell ’s Newspeak .
Alex , the narrator , though cold - blooded and self - centered , is intelligent and expresses himself with great force .
A vocabulary that is entirely new and incomprehensible at the beginning of the book becomes so thoroughly familiar to the reader at the end that he forgets that he has ever had to learn its meaning : it seems completely natural after only a hundred pages .
On the very first page , when Alex describes his gang ’s intention to do a robbery , he says :
[ T ] here was no real need . . . of crasting [ robbing ] any more pretty polly [ money ] to tolchock [ hit ] some old veck [ man ] in an alley and viddy [ see ] him swim in his blood while we counted the takings and divided by four , nor to do the ultra- violent on some shivering starry [ old ] grey - haired ptitsa [ woman ] in a shop and go smecking [ laughing ] off with the till ’s guts .
Of course , the lack of real “ need ” does not prevent Alex and his gang from robbing in a cruel and violent way , for their cruelty and violence is an end in itself , joyfully engaged in .
Not for Burgess was the orthodox liberal view that economic deprivation and lack of opportunity cause crime .
The gang ’s solipsistic and dehumanizing argot reflects this cold - bloodedness .
Sexual intercourse , for example , becomes “ the old in - out - in - out , ” a term without reference to the other participant , who is merely an object .
The gang attacks a schoolteacher carrying books home from the library , for no reason other than a free - floating malevolence and joy in cruelty :
Pete held his rookers [ hands ] and Georgie sort of hooked his rot [ mouth ] wide open for him and Dim yanked out his false zoobies [ teeth ] , upper and lower .
He threw these down on the pavement and then I treated them to the old boot - crush , though they were hard bastards like .
. . .
The old veck [ man ] began to make sort of chumbling shooms [ sounds ] — “ wuf waf wof ” — so Georgie let go of holding his goobers [ jaws ] apart and just let him have one in the toothless rot with his ringy fist , and that made the old veck start moaning a lot then , then out comes the blood , my brothers , real beautiful .
I doubt that a lack of feeling for others has ever been expressed more powerfully .
Burgess intuited with almost prophetic acuity both the nature and characteristics of youth culture when left to its own devices , and the kind of society that might result when that culture became predominant .
For example , adults grow afraid of the young and defer to them , something that has certainly come to pass in Britain , where adults now routinely look away as youngsters commit antisocial acts in public , for fear of being knifed if they do otherwise , and mothers anxiously and deferentially ask their petulant five - year - old children what they would like to eat , in the hope of averting tantrums .
The result is that adolescents and young men take any refusal of a request as lèse - majesté , a challenge to the integrity of their ego .
When I refused to prescribe medicine that young men wanted but that I thought they did not need , they would sometimes answer in aggrieved disbelief , “ No ?
What do you mean , no ? ”
It was not a familiar concept .
And in a sense , my refusal was pointless , insofar as any such young man would soon enough find a doctor whom he could intimidate into prescribing what he wanted .
Burgess would not have been surprised by this state of affairs : he saw it coming .
When Alex and his gang enter a pub — they are underage , but no one dares challenge them — they spread fear by their mere presence .
Now we were the very good malchicks [ boys ] , smiling good evensong to one and all , though these wrinkled old lighters [ people ] started to get all shook , their veiny old rookers all trembling round their glasses , and making the suds [ drink ] spill on the table .
“ Leave us be , lads , ” said one of them , her face all mappy with being a thousand years old , “ we ’re only poor old women . ”
Intimidation of the aged and contempt for age itself are an essential part of the youth culture : no wonder aging rock stars are eternal adolescents , wrinkled and arthritic but trapped in the poses of youth .
Age for them means nothing but indignity .
Alex ’s parents ( one of the things Burgess did n’t foresee is the rise of the single - parent family ) are afraid of him .
He comes home late and plays his music very loud , but “ Pee and em [ Father and Mother ] . . . had learnt now not to knock on the wall with complaints of what they called noise .
I had taught them .
Now they would take sleep - pills . ”
When Alex ’s father wants to know what he does at night —
Alex is only 15 — he is apologetic and deferential : “ ‘ Not that I want to pry , son , but where exactly is it you go to work of evenings ? ’ . . .
My dad was like humble mumble chumble .
‘ Sorry , son , ’ he said .
‘ But I get worried sometimes . ’ ”
When in a symbolic reversal of the direction of authority Alex offers his father some money ( robbed , of course ) so that he can buy himself a drink in the pub , his father says : “ Thanks , son . . . .
But we do n’t go out much now .
We dare n’t go out much , the streets being what they are .
Young hooligans and so on .
Still , thanks . ”
In 1962 , the idea that the young would someday impose upon old people in Britain a de facto after - dark curfew was still unimaginable , but Burgess , seeing the cloud no bigger than a man ’s hand on the horizon , imagined that outcome very vividly .
With a prophet ’s imagination , he saw what would happen when the cloud grew until it covered the sky .
With like prescience , Burgess foresaw many other aspects of the youth culture to come : the importance that mind - altering drugs and an industrialized pop music would play in it , for example .
( Burgess did not , however , suggest that high culture was necessarily ennobling in itself .
Alex , much superior in intelligence to his followers , is a devotee of classical music , listening to which , however , increases his urge to commit violence .
No doubt Burgess had in mind those Nazis who could listen with emotion to Schubert lieder after a hard day ’s genocide . )
Burgess foresaw the importance that the youth culture would attach to sexual precocity and a kind of disabused knowingness .
In a remarkable rape scene , Alex meets two ten - year - old girls who , like him , are skipping school , in a record shop , where they are listening to pop music with suggestive titles such as “ Night after Day after Night . ”
They saw themselves , you could see , as real grown - up devotchkas [ girls ] already , what with the old hipswing when they saw your Faithful Narrator , brothers , and padded groodies [ breasts ] and red all ploshed on their goobers [ lips ] .
. . .
[ T ] hey viddied [ saw ] themselves as real sophistoes .
. . .
They had the same ideas or lack of , and the same colour hair — a like dyed strawy .
Well , they would grow up real today .
. . .
No school this afterlunch , but education certain , Alex as teacher .
Their education that afternoon consists of repeated rape by an already experienced 15 - year - old .
It would not have surprised Burgess that magazines for ten - or 11 - year - old girls are now full of advice about how to make themselves sexually attractive , that girls of six or seven are dressed by their single mothers in costumes redolent of prostitution , or that there has been a compression of generations , so that friendships are possible between 14 - and 26 - year - olds .
The precocity necessary to avoid humiliation by peers prevents young people from maturing further and leaves them in a state of petrified adolescence .
Persuaded that they already know all that is necessary , they are disabused about everything , for fear of appearing naive .
With no deeper interests , they are prey to gusts of hysterical and childish enthusiasm ; only increasingly extreme sensation can arouse them from their mental torpor .
Hence the epidemic of self - destructiveness that has followed in the wake of the youth culture .
The world in which youth culture predominates and precocity is the highest achievement is one in which all tenderness is absent .
When Alex and his gang attack the teacher , they find a letter in his pocket , which one of them reads out derisively : “ My darling one . . .
I shall be thinking of you while you are away and hope you will remember to wrap up warm when you go out at night . ”
Such simple and heartfelt affection and concern for another person are extinct in the world of Alex and his droogs .
Alex is incapable of putting himself in the place of anyone else , of “ changing places in fancy with the sufferer , ” as Adam Smith puts it .
Self - absorbed , he is self - pitying but has no pity for others .
When he is arrested after the brutal murder of an old woman , he calls the policemen who have arrested him “ bullies ” and accuses them when they laugh at him of “ the heighth of . . . callousness . ”
Alex is quite incapable of connecting his own savage behavior with the words that he applies to the police .
I was reminded of a case of murder in which I gave testimony recently : the young murderer kicked his girlfriend ’s head so hard that he broke her jaw in many places and forced her tongue through the back of her throat , and her stomach filled with blood — and a neighbor heard him laugh as he kicked .
A policeman , after listening to his lies and evasions for two days , accused him of having no remorse for his deed .
“ You ’ave no feelings , ” the murderer rejoined .
“ I pity your poor wife ” — just like Alex in A Clockwork Orange , but without the intelligence and the taste for classical music .
In the world of Alex and his droogs , all relations with other human beings are instrumental means to a selfish , brutal , hedonistic end .
And this is the world that so many of my patients now inhabit , a world in which perhaps a third of the British population lives .
It is also the world in which having a baby is the fulfillment of a personal human right , and nothing else .
But Burgess was not merely a social and cultural prophet .
A Clockwork Orange grapples as well with the question of the origin and nature of good and evil .
The Ludovico Method that Alex undergoes in prison as a means of turning him into a model citizen in exchange for his release is in essence a form of conditioning .
Injected with a drug that induces nausea , Alex must then watch films of the kind of violence that he himself committed , his head and eyelids held so that he cannot escape the images by looking away from them — all this to the piped - in accompaniment of the classical music that he loves .
Before long , such violence , either in imagery or in reality , as well as the sound of classical music , causes him nausea and vomiting even without the injection , as a conditioned response .
Alex learns to turn the other cheek , as a Christian should : when he is insulted , threatened , or even struck , he does not retaliate .
After the treatment — at least , until he suffers his head injury — he can do no other .
Two scientists , Drs. Branom and Brodsky , are in charge of the “ treatment . ”
The minister of the interior , responsible for cutting crime in a society now besieged by the youth culture , says : “ The Government can not be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories . . . .
Common criminals . . . can best be dealt with on a purely curative basis .
Kill the criminal reflex , that ’s all . ”
In other words , a criminal or violent act is , in essence , no different from the act of a rat in a cage , who presses a lever in order to obtain a pellet of food .
If you shock the rat with electricity when it presses the lever instead of rewarding it with food , it will soon cease to press the lever .
Criminality can be dealt with , or “ cured , ” in the same way .
At the time that Burgess wrote A Clockwork Orange , doctors were trying to “ cure ” homosexuals by injecting them with apomorphine , a nausea - inducing drug , while showing them pictures of male nudes .
And overwhelmingly , the dominant school of psychology worldwide at the time was the behaviorism of Harvard prof B. F. Skinner .
His was what one might call a “ black box ” psychology : scientists measured the stimulus and the response but exhibited no interest whatsoever in what happened between the two , as being intrinsically immeasurable and therefore unknowable .
While Skinner might have quibbled about the details of the Ludovico Method ( for example , that Alex got the injection at the wrong time in relation to the violent films that he had to watch ) , he would not have rejected its scientific — or rather scientistic — philosophy .
In 1971 , the very year in which the Kubrick film of A Clockwork Orange was released , Skinner published a book entitled Beyond Freedom and Dignity .
He sneered at the possibility that reflection upon our own personal experience and on history might be a valuable source of guidance to us in our attempts to govern our lives .
“ What we need , ” he wrote , “ is a technology of behavior . ”
Fortunately , one was at hand .
“ A technology of operant behavior is . . . already well advanced , and it may prove commensurate with our problems . ”
As he put it , “ [ a ] scientific analysis shifts the credit as well as the blame [ for a man ’s behavior ] to the environment . ”
What goes on in a man ’s mind is quite irrelevant ; indeed , “ mind , ” says Skinner , is “ an explanatory fiction . ”
For Skinner , being good is behaving well ; and whether a man behaves well or badly depends solely upon the schedule of reinforcement that he has experienced in the past , not upon anything that goes on in his mind .
It follows that there is no new situation in a man ’s life that requires conscious reflection if he is to resolve the dilemma or make the choices that the new situation poses : for everything is merely a replay of the past , generalized to meet the new situation .
The Ludovico Method , then , was not a far - fetched invention of Burgess ’s but a simplified version — perhaps a reductio ad absurdum , or ad nauseam — of the technique for solving all human problems that the dominant school of psychology at the time suggested .
Burgess was a lapsed Catholic , but he remained deeply influenced by Catholic thought throughout his life .
The Skinnerian view of man appalled him .
He thought that a human being whose behavior was simply the expression of conditioned responses was not fully human but an automaton .
If he did the right thing merely in the way that Pavlov ’s dog salivated at the sound of a bell , he could not be a good man : indeed , if all his behavior was determined in the same way , he was hardly a man at all .
A good man , in Burgess ’s view , had to have the ability to do evil as well as good , an ability that he would voluntarily restrain , at whatever disadvantage to himself .
Being a novelist rather than an essayist , however , and a man of many equivocations , Burgess put these thoughts in A Clockwork Orange into the mouth of a ridiculous figure , the prison chaplain , who objects to the Ludovico Method — but not enough to resign his position , for he is eager to advance in what Alex calls “ Prison religion . ”
Burgess puts the defense of the traditional view of morality as requiring the exercise of free will — the view that there is no good act without the possibility of a bad one — into the mouth of a careerist .
The two endings of A Clockwork Orange — the one that Burgess himself wrote and the truncated one that his American publisher wanted and that Kubrick used for his film — have very different meanings .
According to the American - Kubrick version , Alex resumes his life as violent gang leader after his head injury undoes the influence of the Ludovico Method .
He returns to what he was before , once more able to listen to classical music ( Beethoven ’s Ninth ) and fantasize violence without any conditioned nausea :
Oh , it was gorgeosity and yumyumyum .
When it came to the Scherzo I could viddy myself very clear running and running on like very light and mysterious nogas [ feet ] , carving the whole litso [ face ] of the creeching [ screaming ] world with my cut - throat britva [ razor ] .
And there was the slow movement and the lovely last singing movement still to come .
I was cured all right .
Kubrick even suggests that this is a happy outcome : better an authentic psychopath than a conditioned , and therefore inauthentic , goody - goody .
Authenticity and self - direction are thus made to be the highest goods , regardless of how they are expressed .
And this , at least in Britain , has become a prevailing orthodoxy among the young .
If , as I have done , you ask the aggressive young drunks who congregate by the thousand in every British town or city on a Saturday night why they do so , or British soccer fans why they conduct themselves so menacingly , they will reply that they are expressing themselves , as if there were nothing further to be said on the matter .
The full , British version of A Clockwork Orange ends very differently .
Alex begins to lose his taste for violence spontaneously , when he sees a happy , normal couple in a café , one of whom is a former associate of his .
Thereafter , Alex begins to imagine a different life for himself and to fantasize a life that includes tenderness :
There was Your Humble Narrator Alex coming home from work to a good hot plate of dinner , and there was this ptitsa [ girl ] all welcoming and greeting like loving .
. . .
I had this sudden very strong idea that if I walked into the room next to this room where the fire was burning away and my hot dinner laid on the table , there I should find what I really wanted .
. . .
For in that other room in a cot was laying gurgling goo goo goo my son .
. . .
I knew what was happening , O my brothers .
I was like growing up .
Burgess obviously prefers a reformation that comes spontaneously from within , as it does in the last chapter , to one that comes from without , by application of the Ludovico Method .
Here he would agree with Kubrick — an internal reformation is more authentic , and thus better in itself because a true expression of the individual .
Perhaps Burgess also believes that such an internal reformation is likely to go deeper and be less susceptible to sudden reversal than reformation brought from outside .
Burgess also suggests the somewhat comforting message , at odds with all that has gone before , that Alex ’s violence is nothing new in the world and that the transformation of immature , violent , and solipsistic young men into mature , peaceful , and considerate older men will continue forever , as it has done in the past , because deep inside there is a well of goodness , man having been born with original virtue rather than original sin ( this is the Pelagian heresy , to which Burgess admitted that he was attracted ) .
There is a never - ending cycle :
[ Y] outh is only being in a way like it might be an animal .
No , it is not just like being an animal so much as being like one of these malenky [ small ] toys you viddy being sold in the streets , like little chellovecks [ men ] made out of tin and with a spring inside and then a winding handle on the outside and you wind it up grrr grrr grrr and off it itties [ goes ] , like walking , O my brothers .
But it itties in a straight line and bangs straight into things bang bang and it cannot help what it is doing .
Being young is like being like one of these malenky machines .
My son , my son .
When I had my son I would explain all that to him when he was starry [ old ] enough to like understand .
But then I knew he would not understand or would not want to understand at all and would do all the veshches [ things ]
I had done . . . and I would not be able to really stop him .
And nor would he be able to stop his own son , brothers .
And so it would itty on to like the end of the world .
And this , surely , is partly right .
Four centuries ago , Shakespeare wrote :
I would there were no age between sixteen and three - and - twenty , or that youth would sleep out the rest ; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child , wronging the ancientry , stealing , fighting .
And certainly it is true that criminality , statistically speaking , is an activity of the young and that there are few prisoners in the prison in which I worked who had been incarcerated for a crime committed after age 35 .
There seems to be a biological dimension to common - or - garden wrongdoing .
But a quietistic message — cheerful insofar as it implies that violence among young men is but a passing phase of their life and that the current era is no worse in this respect than any past age , and pessimistic in the sense that a reduction of the overall level of violence is impossible — is greatly at odds with the socially prophetic aspect of the book , which repeatedly warns that the coming new youth culture , shallow and worthless , will be unprecedentedly violent and antisocial .
And of Britain , at least , Burgess was certainly right .
He extrapolated from what he saw in the prime manifestation of the emerging youth culture , pop music , to a future in which self - control had shrunk to vanishing , and he realized that the result could only be a Hobbesian world , in which personal and childish whim was the only authority to guide action .
Like all prophets , he extrapolated to the nth degree ; but a brief residence in a British slum should persuade anyone that he was not altogether wide of the mark .
A Clockwork Orange is not completely coherent .
If youth is violent because the young are like “ malenky machines ” who cannot help themselves , what becomes of the free will that Burgess otherwise saw as the precondition of morality ?
Do people grow into free will from a state of automatism , and , if so , how and when ?
And if violence is only a passing phase , why should the youth of one age be much more violent than the youth of another ?
How do we achieve goodness , both on an individual and social level , without resort to the crude behaviorism of the Ludovico Method or any other form of cruelty ?
Can we bypass consciousness and reflection in our struggle to behave well ?
There are no schematic answers in the book .
One cannot condemn a novel of 150 pages for failing to answer some of the most difficult and puzzling questions of human existence , but one can praise it for raising them in a peculiarly profound manner and forcing us to think about them .
To have combined this with acute social prophecy ( to say nothing of entertainment ) is genius .
Stanford University researchers peering at history 's footprints on human DNA have found new evidence for how prehistoric people shared knowledge that advanced civilization .
Using a genetic technique pioneered at Stanford , the team found that animal - herding methods arrived in southern Africa 2,000 years ago on a wave of human migration , rather than by movement of ideas between neighbors .
The findings shed light on how early cultures interacted with each other and how societies learned to adopt advances .
" There 's a tradition in archaeology of saying people do n't move very much ; they just transfer ideas through space , " said Joanna Mountain , PhD , consulting assistant professor of anthropology .
Mountain and Peter Underhill , PhD , senior research scientist in genetics at Stanford 's School of Medicine , were the study 's senior authors .
Their findings will appear in the Aug. 5 advance online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Science .
" We know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history , but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace , " Underhill said .
Instead of using archaeological evidence alone to guess whether people migrated , " all of a sudden , with genetics , you can actually address that question , " Mountain said .
The researchers tracked genetic variation on the Y chromosome , the sex chromosome passed from father to son that encodes maleness , using a technique now widely used that was developed in the early 1990s by Underhill and colleagues in the lab of Luigi Cavalli - Sforza , professor emeritus of genetics .
The method has given scientists a powerful window into ancient human migrations and prehistoric cultural shifts .
The technique has also been adopted by some commercial genealogy services that offer Y - chromosome testing to the public .

Previous research suggested that prehistoric people in eastern and southern Africa had little contact , with only two known migrations between the regions about 30,000 and 1,500 years ago .
After Bantu - language speakers migrated from eastern to southern Africa 1,500 years ago , agriculture took off in southern Africa .
But the timing of the Bantu migration did n't quite match the 2,000 - year - old anthropological evidence for the first sheep and cattle herds in southern Africa , so anthropologists were unsure whether the region 's agricultural knowledge came from a bow - wave of ideas that spread in front of the migrating Bantu , or whether a separate migration brought the first herders .
" Africa has the most genetic diversity in the world , but it is one of the least - studied places , " said Brenna Henn , a doctoral student in anthropology who was the study 's lead author .
" I 've always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobody 's had the time or interest to look into . "
The Stanford scientists picked the Y sex chromosome to examine for clues to migration because it changes very little from one generation to the next .
Autosomes - the non-sex chromosomes - come in pairs , and the members of a pair can exchange bits of DNA during reproduction , making each autosome a mishmash of DNA from all of an individual 's ancestors .
But the Y chromosome is a singleton ; males inherit one Y chromosome and one X chromosome , while women have two X chromosomes .
In men , only a tiny region of the Y chromosome can swap DNA with the X chromosome .
This means almost all of the Y chromosome moves intact from father to son , changing only infrequently when a new mutation arises .
That allows researchers to examine several generations of ancestry by looking at the Y chromosomes of living men .
" The family tree of the Y chromosome is very , very clear , " Mountain said .
The team analyzed Y chromosomes from men in 13 populations in Tanzania in eastern Africa and in the Namibia - Botswana - Angola border region of southern Africa .
They discovered a novel mutation shared by some men in both locations , which implied those men had a common ancestor .
Further analysis showed the novel mutation arose in eastern Africa about 10,000 years ago and was carried by migration to southern Africa about 2,000 years ago .
The mutation was not found in Bantu - speakers , suggesting that a different group - Nilotic - language speakers - first brought herds of animals to southern Africa before the Bantu migration .

This new genetic evidence correlates well with pottery , rock art and animal remains that suggest pastoralists - herders who migrated to new pasture with their flocks - first tended sheep and cattle in southern Africa around 2,000 years ago .
The genetic finding also helps explain linguistic similarities between peoples in the two regions .
" I like the fact that the linguistic , genetic and archaeological evidence all line up , " Henn said .
" When you see lines of evidence converge on a single model , it means that 's probably something that actually happened . "
Underhill and Roy King , MD , PhD , associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences , published a similar paper in the June issue of the journal Antiquity .
That study used Y chromosome evidence to examine how climate change drove prehistoric migration in the Middle East .
They found that a shift in rainfall 10,000 years ago propelled a cultural split among genetically related people .
Some stayed in rainy areas and grew crops , while others moved to arid regions and lived the nomadic life of pastoralist herders .
The groups did n't intermingle much after the split , perhaps explaining the origins of modern Middle Eastern cultures .
Genetic evidence gives a degree of clarity to the study of prehistoric migration that 's hard to achieve in other ways .
" So rarely do we get to pin down the questions raised by archaeology , " Mountain said .
Henn , Mountain and Underhill collaborated with scientists at the Stanford Genome Technology Center ; the University of Regensburg , in Germany ; Sapienza Università di Roma , in Italy , and the University of Maryland .
The research was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation , the National Institutes of Health , the Wenner - Gren Foundation , the Leakey Foundation and BayGene ( the Bavarian Genome Network ) .
Scientists took the data and applied an algorithm involving 234 measurements between facial features , including the distances between lips and chin , the forehead and the eyes , or between the eyes .
Essentially , they trained a computer to determine , for each individual face , the most attractive set of distances and then choose the ideal closest to the original face .
Unlike other research with formulas for facial attractiveness , this program does not produce one ideal for a feature , say a certain eye width or chin length .
They ran the photographs of 92 women and 33 men through the engine , creating before and after shots - essentially , a computer - generated version of hot or not .
Changes were made only to the geometry of the faces ; unlike the digital retouching done for fashion magazines , wrinkles were not smoothed and hair colour was not changed .
The research was revealed at Siggraph , an annual conference on computer graphics , held in August .
Studies have shown that there is surprising agreement about what makes a face attractive .
Symmetry is at the core , along with youthfulness ; the beauty merits of clarity or smoothness of skin and vivid colour , say , in the eyes and hair .
There is little dissent among people of different cultures , ethnicities , races , ages and gender .
Yet this software program raises what psychologists , philosophers and feminists say are disturbing questions .
To what extent is beauty quantifiable ?
Does a supposedly scientific definition merely reflect the ideal of the moment , built from pop culture ?
Lois Banner , a historian who has studied changing beauty standards , says scientific efforts to define attractiveness are fraught with difficulty .
" They are never going to locate it on a gene .
They are never going to get away from the cultural influence . "
Tommer Leyvand , who helped develop the " beautification " software at Tel Aviv University and who works for Microsoft , said the goal was to alter a face according to agreed standards of attractiveness , while producing a result that left the face recognisable , rather than the product of surgery or digital retouching .
" This tool shows in the most simple fashion how easy it is to manipulate photographs and make people more attractive , " Leyvand said .
" But the difference is so subtle that it just shows how insignificant it is .
We 're talking about a few inches maybe and a slightly changed perception . "
For most faces , the software made subtle changes , with the person 's essence and character largely intact .
However the changes appear more striking among people from non-Caucasian groups because researchers have yet to create a program designed with " a beauty estimator " for non-white racial and ethnic groups .
While psychological studies over the past few decades suggest that perceptions of beauty and attractiveness tend to be universal , critics of that work say it is debatable whether a person 's beauty is enhanced by such changes .
Character can be lost .
Blandness can set in .
The quirky may become plain .
When Leyvand put a photograph of Brigitte Bardot through his program , her full and puckered lips were deflated , and the famed beauty seemed less striking - less like herself .
( By contrast , the before and after shots of the actor James Franco were almost indistinguishable , suggesting his handsome face is perfect . )
After viewing the before and after photographs in Leyvand 's research paper , Banner , a professor of history at the University of Southern California , said the original faces were more attractive .
" Irregular beauty is the real beauty , " he said , adding that such attempts to measure beauty are driven by sameness , making everyone look alike .

Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader lambasted the Democrats and Republicans on Friday as a “ two - party dictatorship ” that has squandered decades of power and allowed corporate greed to dictate American policy .
As he kicked off a five - day California swing at USC , Nader noted that Barack Obama and John McCain , the parties ’ presidential nominees , have similar views on increasing military spending , offshore drilling , the proposed $ 700 - billion bailout of financial firms and Israeli - Palestinian relations .
Nader , who is on the ballot in 45 states , said dissenting voices must grow louder .
“ How many more decades are we going to give them before we get rid of this least - worst , this lesser - of - two - evils mind set and start breaking this corporate grip . . . and have alternative candidates from alternative parties that stand as if people mattered first and foremost ? ” he asked more than 100 people who gathered in an airy college auditorium .
Every four years , Nader said , politicians trot out the “ same tricks ” with a different motto .

“ This year , it ’s hope , change .
Hope , change .
Hope , change , ” he slowly chanted .
“ Am I starting to hypnotize you ? ”
Nader was in California as part of an effort to visit all 50 states before election day .
He said that because of Obama ’s double - digit lead in California , neither of the major party candidates planned to visit the state except to raise funds .
“ That ’s disrespectful ” to voters , said Nader , who will make stops at UC San Diego and in Encinitas today , UC Santa Barbara and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on Sunday , Monterey Peninsula College on Monday and San Francisco State on Tuesday .
He and running mate Matt Gonzalez spoke at USC hours before the first presidential debate , which he derided as “ a parallel interview . ”
Nader also criticized the media for ignoring him despite national polls that show him receiving 5 % to 6 % support and slightly higher percentages in some battleground states .

Nader warned the crowd against political apathy , asserting that Americans need to know as much about politics as they do about sports .
“ If I was speaking today on the future demise of the USC football team , it would be a full room , ” he said .
He told students in the crowd that their generation lacked “ fire in the belly ” and urged them to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors , who became passionately involved in the civil rights struggle , the Vietnam War and environmentalism .
“ Why is it that you see horrific evidence . . . of gross systemic injustice , you do n’t get angry ? ” he asked .

Ryan Alcantra , a junior majoring in business who attended the event , said that Nader ’s speech was better than he expected but that he still was not excited about the election .
“ I really do n’t like any of my options , ” the Lake Forest native said .
Alcantra , 21 , said Obama was evasive during the candidates ’ forum last month at Saddleback Church , which his family attends .
McCain , he said , was “ a crazy guy who ’s too old . ”
After listening to Nader , Alcantra said he may consider voting for him .
“ Maybe , ” he said .
“ It ’s better than nothing . ”

Eventually , particularly when trying to download old torrents , most BitTorrent users find themselves with a transfer which stops due to the swarm having no seeds , not enough peers to cover the full release , or the tracker going down .
btReAnnouncer is a handy site which could prove vital in reaching that magic 100 % .
“ I ’m stuck at 49.1 % , seed please ! ! ” or similar comments are fairly commonplace on BitTorrent sites .
Normally the case on older torrents , essentially all the full 100 % seeds have gone , leaving people all stuck at the same amount completed .
Without a seed reappearing , or many other users that between them have the remaining 50.9 % , the download will not complete , which is pretty frustrating .
Of equal annoyance , is a new torrent which the user knows is well seeded , yet for one reason or another it is impossible to connect to the tracker in order to complete the download .
Maybe the tracker has gone down or is simply too busy to accept the connection – either way , the download is n’t getting very far without it .
The good news is that with a little perseverance it ’s possible to resurrect a seemingly moribund torrent .
The key to bringing the torrent back to life is the hope that an identical release is available on another tracker , and in that swarm there are people that have enough data to complete the download .
But how is it possible to find the same release on other trackers ?
There are manual solutions involving Google , but quick and easy is my preferred method and btReAnnouncer offers just that .
The site is really easy to use , so , although it is well seeded , here is a walk - through to find more trackers tracking Michael Moore ’s ‘ Official ’ ‘ Slacker Uprising ’ torrent – the same technique can be used for any release , especially ones with tracker or seeding issues .
First of all I downloaded the .torrent file from The Pirate Bay onto my PC and uploaded it to btReAnnouncer .
Within a few seconds the site displayed the current primary tracker – http://tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce.
However , it also displayed a list of 17 other tracker URLs identified as tracking the same torrent – any one or combination of which could help you to complete a stubborn download .
Note that it does n’t make sense to add more than one tracker from the same url ( e.g. thepiratebay.org ) because they often track the same peers .
At this stage it is possible to select a new primary tracker for the torrent by ticking the checkbox and pushing the ‘ ReAnnounce ’ button .
Then check any of the other trackers in the list to be used as an alternative and click ‘ ReAnnounce ’ again .
To finish up and start downloading the .torrent , download it by clicking on the hyperlinked text underneath ‘ Download ReAnnounced Torrent … ’ and import it into your favorite client , not forgetting to point it at your previously incomplete download .
btReAnnouncer can also be used to find public sources for otherwise private torrents , just do n’t forget to remove any passkeys etc from the announce URL in the torrent .
If your BitTorrent client does n’t allow you to edit or add trackers manually , this can be achieved by using another online service , TorrentEditor .
I snapped this photo of a passive millimeter wave scan machine set up in the main entrance hall at Denver International Airport on Friday evening .
The machine was swiveling back and forth , searching people who did n't even know they were being scanned .
I 'm sure some of the people scanned were n't passengers ; they were simply coming to pick up or drop off friends and relatives .
I wanted to see if they would scan my 11 - year - old daughter as she walked by so I walked over to the desk with the computer monitor on it .
I got a peek at the monitor for a second or two before one of the bald guys to the left of the TSA agent jumped in front of me and said I was n't allowed to look .
I could n't tell which person was undressed on the monitor .
If federal agents set up this system at a shopping mall , would people care ?
The TSA 's blog states that the scanner 's monitor be placed in a " remote location " :
Over at LRC , Michael Rozeff has a surprising analysis where he lays out a few convincing arguments that gold prices are too high right now , relative to other prices .
He concludes that gold is “ overvalued ” and that its downward trend may very well continue .
I wo n’t quibble with his numerical arguments , but I think they are at best irrelevant .
Investors care about forward - looking analysis , and I think forces are in place for serious price inflation over the next several years .
First , Bernanke truly believes price deflation was the ultimate cause of the Great Depression , and so he will do whatever it takes to prevent it again .
Second , Barney Frank and Paul Krugman are openly calling for Keynesian pump - priming to save the economy from disaster .
Third , the growth in the monetary base has been absolutely jaw - dropping in recent weeks .
( I provide links and a chart for these points in this blog post . )
It ’s true , all of these factors could still be reversed .
If Ron Paul were elected president , and Lew Rockwell were put in charge of the Federal Reserve , it would be possible that the train could be stopped , and massive price inflation could be avoided .
But with the actual people who will be in power during the next few years ?
I think high prices are just around the corner …
I ’m not saying this is the perfect answer .
If I were dictator , which I always aspire to be , I would write it a little bit differently .
I would increase the FDIC insured deposits and done some other things ..
WTF did McTurd just say about 35 seconds into this interview Well , lest there be any doubt about who McCain intends to follow , at least in the dictator wet dream department .
The problem is that if he really wants to be dictator of this country , he 's going about it all wrong .
As an aspiring dictator , there 's even less of a reason to keep Palin around at this point .
She can serve him best by going back home and keeping an eye on Russia from her porch .
And this whole election and debate thing ?
Seriously , John , cut the shit and board the straight coup express .
Why are you trying to win people over ?
Dictators do n't care about that kind of thing .
Just make a surge right to Washington , kick everyone out of there , and send a goon squad out to confiscate the internet so that everyone 's on a level playing field again .
Come on , John , I know you can do it .
Just get it done .

DETROIT  The Police Department here shut down its crime laboratory on Thursday after an audit uncovered serious errors in numerous cases .
The audit said sloppy work had probably resulted in wrongful convictions , and officials expect a wave of appeals in cases that the laboratory processed .
The interim mayor , Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr. , and the new police chief , James Barren , ordered the laboratory closed ; Mr. Cockrel called the audit ’s conclusions “ shocking and appalling . ”
Pending and future cases will be sent to the Michigan State Police , which operates seven laboratories .
Officials from the Detroit Police Department , the Wayne County prosecutor ’s office and the State Police will try to determine whether the errors resulted in guilty verdicts against innocent people .
“ We do not want any of our activities to result in someone being imprisoned that does n’t belong there , ” the Wayne County prosecutor , Kym L. Worthy , said at a news conference with Mr. Cockrel and Mr. Barren .
Ms. Worthy said the mistakes also might have let violent criminals remain at large .
Judgment of character can be influenced by something as simple as the temperature of a drink held in our hands , according to a US study published today .
Researchers from Yale University conducted experiments that showed that people perceive others as more generous and more attentive if they have just been holding a hot cup of coffee , and that the inverse is true for cold drinks .
A second study found that people are more likely to give something to others if they held something warm , and more likely take something for themselves if they held something cold .
Vote Flipping in Davidson County , Tennessee
Vote Flipping in Davidson County , Tennessee
By David Earnhardt
This political season , more than any other in recent memory , is irony - filled .
So why this incident involving my friend and the wife of UNCOUNTED filmmaker , David Earnhardt , ( as reported by David ) surprises me , I ca n’t tell you .
My wife , Patricia Earnhardt , had an early voting experience here in Nashville , Tennessee , where she saw her vote momentarily flip from Barack Obama to Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney .
She voted on a touch - screen paperless machine .
Here is her story :
“ A poll worker directed me to a touch screen voting machine & instructed me how to use it .
I touched “ Obama ” for president & nothing lit up .
I touched 2 or 3 more times & still nothing lit up .
I called the poll worker back over to tell him I was having a problem .
He said I just needed to touch it more lightly .
I tried it 2 or 3 more times more lightly with the poll worker watching & still nothing lit up .
The poll worker then touched it for me twice — nothing lit up .
The third time he touched the Obama button , the Cynthia McKinney space lit up !
The McKinney button was located five rows below the Obama button .
The poll worker just kind of laughed and cancelled the vote .
He hit the Obama button again & it finally lit up .
I continued on to cast the rest of my votes .
After completing the process & reviewing my votes , I went to the VOTE page , hit the VOTE button & nothing happened .
Again after several tries , I called the poll worker over & he finally got the machine to register my votes .
Hurray — I voted ! — or did I ?
I left the polling place feeling uncertain . ”
Patricia Earnhardt - Friday , Oct. 17 - Howard School Building - Nashville , Tennessee
I also had similar problems with the machine I was voting on that same day , although no vote flipping .
I would touch the screen numerous times before I could get my various candidate choices to light up .
It was strange and very frustrating .
When I finally got through my slate of candidate choices , I could not get the VOTE button to light up when I touched it .
I finally called over a poll worker and he told me that I needed to touch lightly .
I touched the VOTE button more lightly , but was only able to get it to work after several more failed attempts .

Need more sad irony ?
The machines David and Patricia voted on in Davidson County , TN - ES&S iVotronic - are the same machines used in the West Virginia counties ( Putnam & Jackson ) where vote flipping is also being reported .
( Go to the election info page on the state of Tennessee and click on Davidson County .
Or download this PDF . )
WHAT YOU CAN DO :
Please , if you experience anything unusual , stay at your polling place , ask to speak with the supervisor , call the election commission ( they will have the number ) , and insist that the machine be quarantined until it can be examined .
UNCOUNTED Clip of the Week : It Ain't Heavy , It 's My Election
In response to the 2004 electronic voting machine debacle , hundreds of locally - based Election Integrity groups were formed in cities across the country by brave patriots who knew they could no longer trust our electoral system .
The formation of these groups – and accompanying journalists , bloggers , activists , filmmakers , and writers - was grass roots citizen vigilance at its finest .

Election Reform Needs Media Reform .
Thank you , Mark Crispin Miller , for succinctly writing what I have been fuming about all day .
In an introduction to an incredible piece in OpEdNews called , " The False Narrative of ' Voter Fraud , ' " by Kenneth Anderson , Mark writes : “ Amen , amen .
And what it makes entirely clear is that we need not just election reform ( and campaign finance reform ) , but also sweeping media reform . ” .
This whole thing about McCain grabbing the moral high - ground on the Election Integrity issue by hopping on the “ voter fraud ” bandwagon is really getting my goat .
… Election Integrity activists and independent journalists have been trying to get the media and the punditocracy to talk about this issue for FOUR YEARS and yet it only takes 3.5 seconds for " ACORN " and " voter fraud " to be on everyone ’s lips ?
Really ?!?
At this point you have to ask yourself , " Why IS that ? " and " HOW is that ? "
WHAT YOU CAN DO : Spread the truth about ACORN far and wide .
Refute " voter fraud " with real stories of " voter suppression " to everyone you know .

Congress hopes to pass the $ 700 Billion bailout bill by Friday , according to an article in Bloomberg .
In case you have n't heard , the bill would not only stick up American taxpayers for an additional $ 700 billion , but would literally give Paulson and the government fascist powers .
Do n't believe me ?
Well , as the Bloomberg article notes : " The bill would bar courts from reviewing actions taken under its authority . "
Bloomberg includes the following quotes by people who understand the significance of the bill :
It sounds like Paulson is asking to be a financial dictator , for a limited period of time , '' said historian John Steele Gordon . . . . ***
The Bush administration seeks " dictatorial power unreviewable by the third branch of government , the courts , to try to resolve the crisis , '' said Frank Razzano , a former assistant chief trial attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission now at Pepper Hamilton LLP in Washington .
'' We are taking a huge leap of faith . ''
This power grab is so serious that investigative reporter Larisa Alexandrovna calls it " the final stages of the coup " .
We have days to stop this bill .
March on Congress .
Educate and motivate everyone around you .
Do everything you can to prevent this disaster before it is too late .
India 's nuclear authorities have admitted radioactive scrap was exported from the country to make lift buttons in France .
French firm Mafelec sent thousands of lift buttons to the elevator maker Otis , which put them in hundreds of lifts in the country over the summer .
Otis said it removed the buttons after France 's nuclear safety authority ( ASN ) announced this week that 20 workers who handled them were exposed to doses of radioactivity ranging from 1 to 3 millisievert ( mSv ) .
The French legal limit for people who do not work in the nuclear industry is 1 mSv per year .
The ASN said it had classified the incident at Mafelec as level two on the international nuclear event scale .
The scale goes from zero , which means no safety risk , to seven , which means a major accident .
The safety agency said the buttons contained traces of radioactive cobalt - 60 .
Four Indian firms made the components , an Indian official said .
It was unclear where the contaminated scrap originated – although metal was traced to a foundry in the western state of Maharashtra .
Malafec bought the buttons from two Indian companies that got their raw materials from another company , SKM Steels .
In turn , it was supplied by the Vipris foundry near Khopoli on the way to Pune from Mumbai .
" We are tracking back the whole chain , " said Satya Pal Agarwal , the head of the radiological safety division of India 's atomic energy regulator .
Indian foundries are not required to install radiation detectors to check scrap , but the government has a programme to put radiation monitors at ports to check cargo .
After Bailout , AIG Execs Head to California Resort Rescued by Taxpayers , $ 440,000 for Retreat Including " Pedicures , Manicures "
October 7 , 2008  --
Less than a week after the federal government committed $ 85 billion to bail out AIG , executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week - long retreat at a luxury resort and spa , the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach , California , Congressional investigators revealed today .
" Rooms at this resort can cost over $ 1,000 a night , " Congressman Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs .
AIG documents obtained by Waxman 's investigators show the company paid more than $ 440,000 for the retreat , including nearly $ 200,000 for rooms , $ 150,000 for meals and $ 23,000 in spa charges .
" They 're getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that , " said Cong. Elijah Cummings ( D - MD ) .
" This unbridled greed , " said Cong. Mark Souder ( R - IN ) , " it 's an insensitivity to how people are spending our dollars . "
Appearing before the committee , Martin Sullivan , the AIG CEO until June , said the company was overwhelmed by a " financial global tsunami , " and that " no simple or single cause " was to blame .
" I am heartbroken at what has happened , " Sullivan said .
Robert Willumstad , the CEO from June to September , 2008 , maintained AIG was a victim of a " crisis in confidence " and an " unprecedented global catastrophe . "
" Through the first week of September we were confident AIG could weather the crisis , " Willumstad testified .
He said the federal government offered its $ 85 million bail out on the afternoon it prepared for bankruptcy .
Willumstad said the Federal Reserve demanded he resign , and will turn down his AIG retirement package of several million dollars .
But Congressional investigators raised question of " mismanagement " and whether AIG executives sought to " cook the books " and hide negative information from outside auditors .
On Dec. 5 , 2007 , Waxman said , CEO Sullivan told investors , " We are confident in our marks and the reasonableness of our valuation methods . "
Documents obtained by the committee show that one week earlier , auditors Pricewaterhouse Cooper had " raise their concerns with Mr. Sullivan … informing him that PWC believed that AIG could have a material weakness relating to the risk management of these areas . "
In March , 2008 , the Office of Thrift Supervision wrote AIG , " We are concerned that the corporate oversight of AIG Financial Products … lacks critical elements of independence , transparency , and granularity . "
Asked about the letter by the committee , the SEC 's former chief accountant , Lynn Turner , said the letter reflects " a serious problem from the top down of management , that can bring an organization down . "
Former AIG CEO Sullivan said accounting rules required AIG to mark down the value of its holdings , even though it had no plans to sell them , the " mark to market " provision .
AIG had to sell at " fire sale prices , " he told skeptical members of Congress .
" Suddenly a company with a trillion dollars in assets " was in trouble , said Sullivan .
Waxman questioned both former CEOs about a former AIG auditor who claimed he had been blocked from reviewing the books of a London - based division that has since been blamed for a large share of the company 's downfall .
Former CEO
Willumstad , chairman of the AIG board at the time , said " I honestly do n't remember " the concerns raised by the former auditor .
" I find that very disturbing , " said Congressman Waxman .
Waxman also said there is evidence the two men changed the bonus schedule once the company began to post losses , so that executives under the " Senior Partners Plan " would continue to make multi-million dollar salaries .
" Mr. Sullivan and the other top executives should have had their bonuses slashed due to poor performance , " said Waxman .
Sullivan said it was " substantially reduced " by the board in 2007 due to poor performance .
Sullivan was given a $ 15 million " golden parachute " payment after being replaced as CEO in June .

Looking fatigued but jubilant , Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens returned home Wednesday , vowing to fight his conviction on federal corruption charges , win reelection and save the state from the national economic crisis .
The Republican faces the last great fight of his life to hold onto his seat .
Even his party ’s presidential and vice presidential nominees have called on him to resign .
But Stevens remained defiant .
“ I ’m here to tell you that I am innocent of the charges that have been brought against me , and I will be vindicated , ” the Senate ’s longest - serving Republican told hundreds of cheering supporters at the airport .
“ And there is one thing you can count on : I will never stop fighting for the people of Alaska . ”
The crowd chanted , “ We trust you , Ted ! ” and , “ We need Ted ! ”
Advertisement
Stevens ’ wife , Catherine , fought back tears as loudspeakers played Journey ’s “ Do n’t Stop Believing . ”
The senator , 84 , locked arms with Alaska ’s other U.S. senator , Lisa Murkowski , who urged the crowd to give him the “ hero ’s welcome that he deserves . ”
“ I have literally loved this state , ” Stevens said , showing an uncharacteristic trace of sentimentality .
“ Alaska is America ’s last link to the frontier sprit that makes our nation great . ”
Among those who have called on Stevens to resign are Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican vice presidential nominee ; her running mate , Sen. John McCain of Arizona ; and Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Senate ’s Republican leader .
A federal jury in Washington convicted Stevens on Monday of seven felony corruption charges stemming from his failure to report gifts and home remodeling work from a powerful oil services industry company .
He is only the fifth sitting senator in U.S. history to be convicted of a felony .

State Republican leaders are hoping the veteran politician can win reelection despite his conviction .
Then , if he were to resign or be expelled by fellow senators , the party could nominate a new candidate in a special election and almost certainly hold onto the seat .
GOP candidates generally have a substantial edge in the state .
But Stevens has slipped badly in the polls this week against the Democratic challenger , Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich .
A new Rasmussen Reports poll conducted Tuesday showed Stevens trailing by 8 percentage points , 52 % - 44 % .
In early October , Stevens held a 1 - point edge .
The state ’s leading newspaper , the Anchorage Daily News , cited Stevens ’ “ astonishingly bad judgment ” and in an editorial advised voters to “ not reward his arrogance ” on election day .
Advertisement
Alaska ’s airwaves have been full of Stevens .
Democratic ads endlessly replay excerpts from the senator ’s secretly taped telephone calls in which he worries about doing jail time .
The ads also quote people who call themselves former Stevens supporters , urging parents to teach their children “ the difference between right and wrong . ”
A Republican ad calls the charges against Stevens “ hogwash . ”
“ Ted Stevens may have made a few mistakes , but he did n’t break any laws , ” the GOP ad says .
“ Give Ted Stevens the verdict he deserves : reelection . ”
Gerald McBeath , political science professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks , said many Alaskans have only become aware of the seriousness of the charges since Stevens ’ conviction .
Advertisement
“ It ’s a surprise to a lot of people that he was convicted because they think the charges were trivial ones , ” he said .
Voters “ did n’t realize that they were felonies . ”
“ Given the widespread Republicanism . . . about 30 % of the state have said they would vote for him knowing he had been convicted , ” McBeath said .
“ I talk to people who support Stevens .
One said he would vote for him if he were convicted of murder . ”
At Wednesday evening ’s welcome - home rally , Stevens emphasized his ability to get things done in Washington when , he said , the economic slowdown could threaten thousands of jobs in the state .
“ I am not asking for your vote because of what we have achieved in the past , ” he said .
“ I ’m running for election seeking your support because of what we can achieve in the future . ”
Advertisement
Rick Rydell , a local radio talk show host who introduced the senator at the airport rally , warned that Alaskans were in danger of losing their senator to a campaign from outside the state .
“ It ’s a sad thing for Alaskans that people are saying , ‘ Maybe Ted should just step down , ” he said .
“ I do n’t particularly trust it when outsiders tell me what to do .
You know what ?
You can kiss my Alaskan moose - hunting behind , because I know Ted , and I stand with him ! ”
Alaskans credit Stevens with helping the territory win statehood , settling Alaska Native land claims , expanding oil development and bringing home millions of federal dollars for highways , schools , hospitals and rural development .
But some have begun to question whether they are willing to vote for a felon .

“ I ca n’t make no bones about it :
He ’s done some good things for the state , and to wipe it all out like this is just terrible , ” said Dorsey Roland , 46 , an Eagle River resident who had been registered as a Republican but switched to independent about a year ago .
“ He kind of lost sight of who he was representing , ” said Roland , who did not attend the airport rally .
“ It ’s very unfortunate , because the rest of the country ’s sitting there right now looking and waiting to see what we do .
If we turn around now and elect a felon as our senator , were going to be the laughingstock of the country . ”

McCain Abandons Promise to Run Respectful Campaign
On July 25 , the question was :
If this is McCain 's notion of a respectful campaign , what will we see if he decides to get nasty ?
Now we have the answer .
The McCain campaign has now shifted virtually 100 percent of his national ad spending into negative ads attacking Obama , a detailed breakdown of his ad buys reveals .
By contrast , the Obama campaign is devoting less than half of his spending on ads attacking McCain .
More than half of its spending is going to a spot that does n't once mention his foe .
John McCain has consistently breached his promise to run a respectful campaign .
Now the promise has been abandoned .
Going negative is all he has left .

My day - job has me working at a document - to - data conversion company .
That means we take physical paper documents , run them through various types of scanners connected to computers , and crunch the images to make files that can be indexed for searches and / or burned to optical media .
Such operations are important to save possibly historical documents that could be lost over time as paper rots away .
Because you never know when you might come across gems like this …
An scanned image of the MIT “ The Tech ” newspaper where “ hacker ” is reportedly first used .
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology newspaper , and Professor Calton Tucker specifically , has the claim of first using the term “ hacker ” in recorded media .
This information was found via Yale University ’s Dictionary of Quotations .
Colored Connotations .
As you can see from the article , “ hacker ” has had black - hat connotations from the start , so the mainstream media really ca n’t be blamed for that , though white - hats have been working hard at correcting that .
What ’s not mentioned is how Professor Tucker came up with the term , especially since what ’s being described is considered “ phreaking ” ( though the use of the PDP - 11 is definitely war dialing ) .
Too soon ?
Or not soon enough ?
There ’s nothing that says this is officialy the first use of “ hacker ; ” This is the earliest recording of the term so far .
There ’s still old documents out there waiting to be scanned , maybe something with an earlier use of “ hacker ” not yet discovered .
Though with a couple of the the comments suggesting that “ hacker ” need not be limited to computers and technology , such a discovery could complicate matters .
A few bytes for interested cyberpunk historians to “ nybble ” on .
Apple will be holding a special media event on Tuesday , October 14th at 10 AM Pacific in Cupertino , California .
Apple has made it clear that the event will focus on notebook computers .
In addition , a leaked Apple support document confirms that " late 2008 " MacBooks and MacBook Pros will be amongst the products announced .
While there 's been no definite word about MacBook Air updates , it seems reasonable to expect that MacBook Airs could also be updated to latest Intel processors .
The October 14th date was first reported by Daring Fireball 's John Gruber .
MacBooks and MacBook Pros
Apple last updated both the MacBooks and MacBook Pros in February of this year .
The MacBook update was a bit of a surprise as the product line had just been refreshed 5 months prior .
Rumors suggested that this represented an interim update to keep the MacBook in line with the current Intel processors and that more substantial updates would come later in the year .
AppleInsider first reported in April that the new notebooks would see " major design changes " to bring it closer to the MacBook Air and iMac designs .
Case Leaks
There have been a surprising number of case photo leaks from Taiwanese and Chinese sites over the past few months .
The first leak from Apple.pro in July claimed to show a tapered MacBook Pro bottom and top .
Though we were initially skeptical of the leak , AppleInsider has confirmed that it is legitimate .
Apple.pro later posted photos of the top and bottom of the MacBook cases as well as a a video , though the authenticity of these images are still in doubt .
The most convincing leak came just days ago from .
Case images of both MacBook and MacBook Pro were detailed from many different angles and are believed to be real .
The images suggest that the MacBook will not include a Firewire port .
Brick , Glass , Two Tone
9to5 Mac seems to be standing alone with these rumors , which have not been corroborated by any other sources .
After weeks of speculation about the " brick " codename , 9to5 Mac believes that this refers to the manufacturing process for the new notebooks .
Other claims have included the use of a glass trackpad and the use of both plastic and aluminum to produce a two - tone appearance in the MacBook .
While 9to5 Mac has had accuracy with iPod rumors in the past , they were somewhat misguided in their Rainbow iPod rumor .
NVIDIA
Perhaps one of the most welcome changes to the Apple MacBook will be the rumored inclusion of NVIDIA chipsets and GPUs .
The NVIDIA chipsets are said to provide a smaller footprint and significantly better graphics performance when compared to Intel 's offerings .
Other Possibilities
- $ 800 Apple Laptop ?
- Networked HDTV from Apple
- Blu Ray support from Kevin Rose , though we heard that Rose described his source as a " bad " one during the taping , so did n't offer much confidence in the possiblity
- One image later posted to the MacX.cn photo set depicts what the MacBook Pro would look like with a trackpad and keyboard in place .
This is a confirmed Photoshop mockup and does not represent the actual product .
- While there have been reports of Best Buy part lists showing the same price points , we 've been told that Best Buy has no knowledge of upcoming Apple products and insert these placeholders based on circulating rumors .
- PCPer.com : MacBook
Air shown but not available until January 2009
Apparently , a new MacBook Air will be announced and shown at the event but it wo n't be available until January 2009 .
The MacBook and MacBook Pro will be available almost immediately .
Coverage
We 'll be providing SMS / Twitter coverage for the event at http://twitter.com/macrumors.
To follow MacRumors news stories on Twitter , follow http://twitter.com/macrumorsrss.
We will provide links to live text and photo coverage of the event as it approaches .
There is no live video stream available , but Apple will likely post a video online after the event .

It is inherent in the American character to aspire to greatness , so it can be disorienting when the nation stumbles or loses confidence in bedrock principles or institutions .
That ’s where the United States is as it prepares to select a new president :
We have seen the government take a stake in venerable private financial houses ; we have witnessed eight years of executive branch power grabs and erosion of civil liberties ; we are still recovering from a murderous attack by terrorists on our own soil and still struggling with how best to prevent a recurrence .
We need a leader who demonstrates thoughtful calm and grace under pressure , one not prone to volatile gesture or capricious pronouncement .
We need a leader well - grounded in the intellectual and legal foundations of American freedom .
Yet we ask that the same person also possess the spark and passion to inspire the best within us : creativity , generosity and a fierce defense of justice and liberty .
The Times without hesitation endorses Barack Obama for president .
Our nation has never before had a candidate like Obama , a man born in the 1960s , of black African and white heritage , raised and educated abroad as well as in the United States , and bringing with him a personal narrative that encompasses much of the American story but that , until now , has been reflected in little of its elected leadership .
The excitement of Obama ’s early campaign was amplified by that newness .
But as the presidential race draws to its conclusion , it is Obama ’s character and temperament that come to the fore .
It is his steadiness .
His maturity .
These are qualities American leadership has sorely lacked for close to a decade .
The Constitution , more than two centuries old , now offers the world one of its more mature and certainly most stable governments , but our political culture is still struggling to shake off a brash and unseemly adolescence .
In George W. Bush , the executive branch turned its back on an adult role in the nation and the world and retreated into self - absorbed unilateralism .
John McCain distinguished himself through much of the Bush presidency by speaking out against reckless and self - defeating policies .
He earned The Times ’ respect , and our endorsement in the California Republican primary , for his denunciation of torture , his readiness to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and his willingness to buck his party on issues such as immigration reform .
But the man known for his sense of honor and consistency has since announced that he would n’t vote for his own immigration bill , and he redefined “ torture ” in such a disingenuous way as to nearly embrace what he once abhorred .
Indeed , the presidential campaign has rendered McCain nearly unrecognizable .
His selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate was , as a short - term political tactic , brilliant .
It was also irresponsible , as Palin is the most unqualified vice presidential nominee of a major party in living memory .
The decision calls into question just what kind of thinking -- if that ’s the appropriate word -- would drive the White House in a McCain presidency .
Fortunately , the public has shown more discernment , and the early enthusiasm for Palin has given way to national ridicule of her candidacy and McCain ’s judgment .
Obama ’s selection also was telling .
He might have scored a steeper bump in the polls by making a more dramatic choice than the capable and experienced Joe Biden .
But for all the excitement of his own candidacy , Obama has offered more competence than drama .
He is no lone rider .
He is a consensus - builder , a leader .
As a constitutional scholar , he has articulated a respect for the rule of law and the limited power of the executive that make him the best hope of restoring balance and process to the Justice Department .
He is a Democrat , leaning further left than right , and that should be reflected in his nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court .
This is a good thing ; the court operates best when it is ideologically balanced .
With its present alignment at seven justices named by Republicans and two by Democrats , it is due for a tug from the left .
We are not sanguine about Obama ’s economic policies .
He speaks with populist sweep about taxing oil companies to give middle - class families rebates that of course they would welcome , but would be far too small to stimulate the economy .
His ideas on taxation do not stray far from those put forward by Democrats over the last several decades .
His response to the most recent , and drastic , fallout of the sub - prime mortgage meltdown has been appropriately cautious ; this is uncharted territory , and Obama is not a master of economic theory or practice .
And that ’s fine .
Obama inspires confidence not so much in his grasp of Wall Street finance but in his acknowledgment of and comfort with his lack of expertise .
He will not be one to forge far - reaching economic policy without sounding out the best thinkers and practitioners , and he has many at his disposal .
He has won the backing of some on Wall Street not because he ’s one of them but because they recognize his talent for extracting from a broad range of proposals a coherent and workable program .
On paper , McCain presents the type of economic program The Times has repeatedly backed :
One that would ease the tax burden on business and other high earners most likely to invest in the economy and hire new workers .
But he has been disturbingly unfocused in his response to the current financial situation , rushing to “ suspend ” his campaign and take action ( although just what action never became clear ) .
Having little to contribute , he instead chose to exploit the crisis .
We may one day look back on this presidential campaign in wonder .
We may marvel that Obama ’s critics called him an elitist , as if an Ivy League education were a source of embarrassment , and belittled his eloquence , as if a gift with words were suddenly a defect .
In fact , Obama is educated and eloquent , sober and exciting , steady and mature .
He represents the nation as it is , and as it aspires to be .

Recentemente ho comprato un hard disk esterno 2.5 ” USB 2.0′ da 320 GB della Verbatim .
La scelta è ricaduta su questo marca ( che molti forse snobberano in favore de più blasonati Lacie o WD ) per due semplici ragioni .
Il prezzo di 79 € era molto allentante e , inoltre , avendo avuto modo di provare lo stesso modello , ero rimasto piacevolmente colpito dalla sua estrema leggerezza , silenziosità , reattività e , per finire , dal fatto che funzionava senza alcun problema su una delle porte USB 2.0 del mio Macbook Pro che , notoriamente , è sottoalimentata .
Infatti , come ho avuto modo di scrivere tempo fa in questo mio articolo , quando collego direttamente alla porta USB posta sulla sinistra del mio portatile ( porta A ) , hard disk con capacità superiori ai 160GB , questi non funzionano , mentre partono normalmente se li collego alla porta USB 2.0 posta sulla destra ( porta B ) .
Il problema era che per tutti i più recenti Macbook Pro , Apple ha creato una porta USB 2 “ diretta ” ed una USB 2 “ condivisa ” .
Il risultato è che , finché i dispositivi USB collegati non hanno bisogno di una tensione troppo elevata , le porte sono perfettamente uguali e funzionanti .
Ma nel momento in cui avrete bisogno di una tensione un po ’ più superiore alla norma ( e probabilmente gli hard disk portatili da 250 Gb e 320 GB rientrano in questa categoria ) , allora potrete usare una sola porta USB !
Ora , una volta constatato il problema e siccome sulla porta USB 2.0 posta sulla destra del laptop di solito vi collego il mouse ( per una semplice ragione di comodità in quanto non sono mancino e far girare il cavo intorno al mio portatile non mi sembra esteticamente apprezzabile oltre che scomodo ) , potete capire che trovare un hard disk di quelle capacità che funzionasse anche sulla porta USB 2.0 sottoalimentata del mio Macbook Pro , è stata una vera novità .
I primi problemi
Quando però ho scartato la confezione del mio hard disk portatile e l’ho collegato al mio laptop , ho scoperto che anche questo , come tutti gli altri , funzionava correttamente solo sulla porta destra mentre su quella sinistra non riusciva a partire .
Non dandomi per vinto , ho provato a circoscrivere il problema , provando a cambiare il cavo USB in dotazione nella confezione con altri che avevo a disposizione .
Alla fine , dopo alcuni tentativi , ho scoperto un fatto curioso : l’hard disk funziona perfettamente sulla porta sottoalimentata se si sostituisce il cavo USB dato in dotazione ( da 3,5 mm circa ) , con uno con diametro più grande ( di circa 5 mm ) !
Addirittura , l’hard disk a cui avevo preso in prestito il cavo “ cicciottone ” ( un 160 GB della WD ) non funzionava se gli collegavo un qualsiasi cavo USB più fino !
Pensando ad un difetto del drive ( dato che il primo hard disk Verbatim che provai non aveva di questi problemi ) , ho provveduto anche a farmelo cambiare ma i risultati sono stati sempre gli stessi .
A questo punto , mi viene da pensare che , il primo hard disk Verbatim che provai , nonostante avesse un cavo fino , probabilmente faceva parte di una partita riuscita sin troppo bene , rispetto al prodotto che veniva proposto con quel prezzo .
La teoria della sezione dei cavi USB
Su internet non ho trovato alcuna informazioni su una eventuale correlazione tra le tensioni in ingresso e i diametri dei cavi USB .
Probabilmente sarà una combinazione tra le dimensioni del cavo e dal tipo di hard disk montato ( che può richiedere più o meno alimentazione ) .
Quel che è certo è che forse devo anche rivedere una delle ipotesi che feci tempo fa in un altro mio articolo : probabilmente , il fattore che determina il non funzionamento di un hard disk su una porta sottoalimentata , non è la dimensione in GByte del drive che richiedeva una tensione maggiore per il funzionamento ( supposi che superando i 160 GB non funzionassero più ) bensì , semplicemente , il diametro o sezione del cavo USB ( infatti lo stesso 160 GB che sembrava funzionare senza problema , avevo un cavo USB grosso , che sostituito con uno più fino , non funzionava più ) .
Sembra , quindi , che taluni hard disk , per funzionare su porte USB con una tensione minore di quelle standard , debbano avere un cavo USB più largo rispetto alla media : in particolare , dalle mie misurazioni ( purtroppo effettuate non con un calibro ma un semplice righello , per cui possono essere affette di un margine di errore ) , devono avere un cavo USB da 5 mm invece che da 3.5 mm .
La spiegazione applicando la Legge di Ohm
Per spiegare questo fenomeno , forse , ci può essere di aiuto la seconda legge di Ohm ( R = r l / S ) che , in poche parole , ci insegna che , a parità di ogni altra condizione , la resistenza R di un conduttore ( ovvero la tendenza di un conduttore a ostacolare il passaggio della corrente elettrica ) è direttamente proporzionale alla sua lunghezza e inversamente proporzionale alla sua sezione .
Per cui , all ’aumentare del diametro del cavo USB , la resistenza del conduttore diminuisce .
Questo presupposto ci porta inevitabilmente ad applicare la prima legge di Ohm che afferma che la differenza di potenziale ( tensione ) applicata ai capi di un conduttore è direttamente proporzionale all ’intensità di corrente che in esso circola e alla resistenza .
In forma matematica :
ΔV = i R
in cui ΔV indica la differenza di potenziale , i l’intensità di corrente ed R la resistenza .
Tale legge permette di determinare , ad esempio , che è necessaria una differenza di potenziale di 10 V ( volt ) per far circolare una corrente di 2 A ( ampere ) in un conduttore che ha la resistenza di 5 Ω .
Se , invece , il conduttore ha una sezione più larga , la resistenza scende , e , di conseguenza , anche la differenza di potenziale necessaria per alimentare un eventuale drive esterno , scenderà .
Al momento in cui scrivo non ho sottomano un tester per verificare questa tesi , ma credo che si possa avvicinare molto alla realtà .
Voi che ne pensate ?
Le mie ipotesi possono essere corrette ?
Vi è mai capitato di notare un simile comportamento anomalo negli hard disk esterni ?

Just one week after a projected $ 42 million deficit prompted Oakland officials to announce the possible layoff of 200 city workers and the closing down of city services on Fridays , Mayor Ron Dellums jetted off to Palm Beach , Fla. , for a U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting on arts and tourism .
The conference was held Thursday through Sunday at the Breakers Hotel which , according to its Web site , " is set amidst 140 acres of breathtaking ocean front property " and offers an " extensive range of services and amenities for the vacationing or business traveler . "
Some 2,300 staffers cater to one 's every whim .
The cost to Oakland 's taxpayers : $ 3,500 .
The reason the mayor went :
Even though the conference was for arts and tourism , spokesman Paul Rose said Dellums also worked with other mayors to develop questions for presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain on their urban agendas .
And what better place than the great urban center of Palm Beach ?
Dellums ' weekend trip came less than two weeks after a city report showed that Oakland officials and employees had spent $ 1.2 million on travel the previous year .
Dellums himself took eight trips ringing up more than $ 44,000 in expenses - including a tab of more than $ 9,000 for a weeklong trip to the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington in January .

That anti-same - sex marriage ad featuring San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsomhaving a " Howard Dean " moment appears to be working .
A poll sponsored by CBS 5 - TV indicates that California voters now favor passage of Proposition 8 , the constitutional amendment to ban same sex " I do's , " by 47 to 42 percent .
The poll of 670 registered voters taken by Survey USA is a big shift from one taken just last month by the Public Policy Institute of California .
That one showed Prop. 8 losing , 55 to 41 percent .
Advocates of same - sex marriage over at the No on 8 campaign say their tracking polls show the same trend , with the ban now leading , 47 to 43 percent .
The Yes on 8 campaign happily reports that it 's seeing a shift as well .
One explanation ?
Well , the latest poll was taken a few days after Prop. 8 proponents put commercials on the air featuring Newsom celebrating the state Supreme Court 's ruling legalizing same - sex marriage by half - yelling , half - growling to a City Hall crowd , " This door 's wide open now !
It 's gonna happen - whether you like it or not ! "
The same ads show a law professor warning that if the measure passes , it could jeopardize the tax - exempt status of churches and lead to " gay marriage taught in public schools . "
Same - sex marriage proponents dispute both arguments - but the ad does seem to be working .
Box scores :
With all the talk about who got what from the banking industry , we asked the political watchdogs at Maplight.org to crunch the numbers on campaign contributions from banks and securities firms to the Bay Area congressional delegation .
Topping the list is Sen. Barbara Boxer , who has received $ 1,064,914 since 2001 from financial interests .
Sen .
Dianne Feinstein came in with less than half that amount - $ 460,236 - during the same period .
As for Bay Area House members , the top five since 2003 were :
House Speaker Nancy Pelosiof San Francisco - $ 544,800 .
Rep. Anna Eshoo of Palo Alto - $ 206,583 .
Rep. Mike Thompson of St. Helena - $ 178,279 .
Rep. Ellen Tauscher of Walnut Creek - $ 172,745 .
Rep. George Miller of Martinez - $ 147,405 .
Lowest on the list is Rep. Pete Stark of Fremont - the only local " no " vote on the final bailout package - who got $ 11,250 .
Sarah smiles :
While the press was kept at bay , the $ 100,000 - plus donors at GOP veep nominee Sarah Palin 's Burlingame breakfast Sunday were whisked into the Hyatt Regency through a private entrance , guarded by a security force that had each of the VIPs ' names and photos .
Inside , the collection of CEOs and their spouses and dates were shown to a sofa - filled sitting room with its own breakfast buffet , where they mingled until their 10 minutes with Palin .
The next level down - the 250 or so people who had paid $ 2,300 to attend - were kept in a separate room with coffee , tea and pastries until Palin arrived for a five - minute pep talk .
Everyone got a photo taken with Palin as well .
Three seconds - flash - next !
Twenty - five state GOP volunteers being honored for their work were also brought in on a bus for a separate , five - minute pep talk from Palin .
Then , just as quickly , the volunteers were shuffled back out to the bus , and off they went .
No pictures , no sticking around for the big speech in the hotel 's main hall to the rest of the group , including a mass of donors who had paid $ 1,000 apiece for the honor .
Not even a glass of water .
Not that they missed much .
Palin's message was the same to the people who had paid $ 1,000 and those who had paid $ 100,000 : California is still Ronald Reagan country , and we can win in November .
Reaction to Palin among the GOPers was consistent as well : red , white and tingly all over .
And finally : First , the big new Federal Building in San Francisco was late and over budget .
Then workers complained about needing sunglasses and umbrellas indoors to shield them from the glaring sun .
Now comes word about another bit of embarrassment at the $ 144 million " green " behemoth at Seventh and Mission streets .
Officials recently installed four giant , stainless - steel plaques near the entryway in recognition of the many planners , architects and others who helped make the eco-friendly building possible .
Only it was n't long before office workers were making pilgrimages to the wall - and snickering at the engraved name of one " Hugh G. Rection . "
That plaque is now gone .
Of course , so are all the others , temporarily - seems they were installed crooked .

GitHub recently started its own RubyGems server , which makes publishing gems a breeze .
All you need to do is to provide a gemspec in your repository 's root and check a box in the GitHub configuration .
The gem will be built and is available for others to install .
To avoid collisions with other users ' gems , it is prefixed with your username , in the form username - project .
But now , RubyGems users do n't have a single source for gems — RubyForge — anymore , but need to configure the additional GitHub source .
This does n't seem like a big hurdle , but there are some problematic aspects , as Magnus Holm points out in his blog .
The biggest problem seems to be the automatic dependency management , which does n't work so well because RubyGems expects the dependecies to be on the same server .
Additionally , you need to know the name of the user who provides the specific gem on GitHub .
To get some more insight , InfoQ talked to RubyGems maintainer Eric Hodel , PJ Hyett from GitHub , and Tom Copeland from RubyForge .
Eric Hodel explains the details of the problem :
The biggest potential problem is gems with dashes in them .
A malicious user could go to GitHub and create a net account and release a package ssh with a higher version than the net - ssh on RubyForge .
RubyGems would install the GitHub one which would be wrong .
Unfortunately this is more commonly used as a feature .
gems.rubyonrails.org ( and other developers ) contains development versions of gems with the same names as gems.rubyforge.org .
People expect the names to match so RubyGems will pick the development version .
Adding sources is an at - your - own - risk as is installing any software over the internet .
Currently the best solution to problems like this is for gem authors to sign gems they release .
This way gem users can trace back a gem to a trusted source .
I 'm not sure how easy it will be to build up the web of trust , but I 've added code to hoe that will automatically sign released gems after you run `rake generate_key` ( see `ri Hoe` for details ) .
There is extensive documentation on signing and verifying gems in `ri Gem : : Security` .
Since gems are now being released on RubyForge and GitHub , there 's been talk about alternate dependencies .
This would allow a gem author to say " I depend on brixen - mspec or rubyspec - mspec or mspec " .
John Barnette and Yehuda Katz [ expressed ] some interest in implementing this , but there has n't been any progress on it to my knowledge .
Right now , it is still necessary for users to manually add gems.github.com to the RubyGems sources to get GitHub gems .
Eric says that he 's " not completely opposed to [ adding GitHub to the default sources ] , but I do n't know how useful it will be without alternative dependencies " .
Pj Hyett from GitHub confirmed Eric's comment :
The concerns Eric brought up regarding naming collision are definitely a worry for us , considering the scenario where a user named net built a gem named ssh has already happened .
Fortunately , it was someone showing us the vulnerability so that we were aware of it .
Of course , not all of our users will be as kind , so we need to come up with a solution .
The last thing we want is for our service to break a system we use every day .
Originally , we wanted to build gems on GitHub with the convention username / repo - name so conflicts like this would n't have been an issue .
It also has the added benefit of mimicking our URL structure .
Unfortunately , slashes do n't work out of the box with RubyGems and we wanted to allow people to use GitHub gems without patching the code .
Tom Copeland from RubyForge thinks about auto- publishing gems for RubyForge projects :
Perhaps we 'd add some stuff the to admin tab of a project so that a person could either point to a gemspec in their svn / git repo and we could build it , or they could point to the root of their repo and we could look for a lib directory and use the project name as the gem name and the svn repo revision as the gem number .
[..] would that feature be in demand ?
Another possibility would be to add the " create RubyForge project " and " publish to RubyForge " features to GitHub .
But as Tom points out , " there 's currently a manual project approval step on RubyForge .
We 'd need to sort out how to autoaccept and provision project creation requests coming from GitHub . "
Pj Hyett 's comment on this idea :
I 'm not completely against the idea of a ' Publish to RubyForge ' button , but if I 'm being perfectly honest , I 'd prefer just making our system work in tandem with their site .
Building a gem on GitHub is as simple as pushing code to their repository , something our users are doing anyway , so you do n't even have to think about it anymore .
That said , there are always going to be people that have custom requirements for building gems , requirements we may never support support due to security concerns or various other reasons , so we still recommend people use RubyForge if they 're doing something that 's outside of what we currently offer .
To sum up , we can see that the people involved are interested in finding a solution , even though it might take some time to implement and agree on one .
While publishing Gems to GitHub can be automatic , publishing Gems to RubyForge can be automated too with Ryan Davis '
Hoe , a helper for Rake and RubyGems that , among other things , includes a task that allows to release Gems on RubyForge .
Once
Hoe it is set up correctly , a simple rake release VERSION=x.y.z takes care of your release .
For more information on Hoe , take a look at this tutorial about Hoe on Nuby on Rails .
Do you host projects on GitHub ?
If yes — do you push to RubyForge too — and how do you use it ( tools , scripts , tasks ) ?
Yesterday , Adobe announced the latest version of its Creative Suite , the software package which includes Photoshop .
Yes , it 's software , but we know a lot of our readers are photographers , both amateur and pro , and the update also takes advantage of some Mac specific hardware , which is definitely Gadget Lab territory .
I have been using the Photoshop CS4 beta for a few months now , and it flies .
It even runs well on my little Hackintosh ( although some of the filters render slowly ) .
The big Mac - specific feature is support for the multi touch pads found on the MacBooks Air and Pro .
You can pinch to zoom in and out , twist the image and also " throw " the picture across the screen : if you hold the space bar down , click and drag the image when it is zoomed in and then let go , the picture will continue to move before slowing and coming to rest .
It 's very similar to the scrolling on the iPhone .
Another hardware features is not just for the Mac.
Photoshop now uses GPU acceleration , moving processor intensive operations off to the graphics card .
Because these cards are made to process lots of data in parallel ( all at the same time ) , the performance boost is quite surprising .
One more thing which will keep Mac - heads happy : Command - tilde finally switches between open windows , just like all other Mac applications .
It 's a small change , but it takes care of a big frustration .
For more in depth look at the new software , take a look at the coverage from our sister blog , Monkey Bites .

As has been noted in several diaries here at dKos ( yes , I still read as much as I can here , despite my lack of posting ) , the circumstances around the birth of Sarah Palin 's fifth child are particularly suspicious .
This link from Reddit gives the basic rundown on the rumors .
Given the photographic showing what seems to be a very not - pregnant Palin earlier this year , combined with the somewhat dangerous - sounding report that she flew back to Alaska after her water broke , it would seem that there is some strong circumstantial evidence that she was covering for her now - 17 year old daughter Bristol - who was reportedly out of school a long time due to mononucleosis .
So I decided to email Gregg Erickson , the reporter from the Anchorage Daily News who hosted a chat at the Washington Post 's website earlier today .
I asked about the rumors , including the circumstantial evidence that seems to support a cover-up .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
An international team of scientists has discovered microscopic , magnetic fossils resembling spears and spindles , unlike anything previously seen , among sediment layers deposited during an ancient global - warming event along the Atlantic coastal plain of the United States .
The researchers , led by geobiologists from the California Institute of Technology and McGill University , describe the findings in a paper published online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
Fifty - five million years ago , Earth warmed by more than 9 degrees Fahrenheit after huge amounts of carbon entered the atmosphere over a period of just a few thousand years .
Although this ancient global - warming episode , known as the Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) , remains incompletely explained , it might offer analogies for possible global warming in the future .
Perhaps in response to the environmental stress of the PETM , many land mammals in North America became dwarfed .
Almost half of the common sea bottom - dwelling microorganisms known as foraminifera became extinct in newly warmer waters that were incapable of carrying the levels of dissolved oxygen for which they were adapted .
" Imagine our surprise to discover not only a fossil bloom of bacteria that make iron - oxide magnets within their cells , but also an entirely unknown set of organisms that grew magnetic crystals to giant sizes , " said Caltech postdoctoral scholar Timothy Raub , who collected the samples from an International Ocean Drilling Program drill - core storehouse at Rutgers University in New Jersey .
A typical " giant " spearhead - shaped crystal is only about four microns long , which means that hundreds would fit on the period at the end of this sentence .
However , the crystals found recently are eight times larger than the previous world record for the largest bacterial iron - oxide crystal .
According to Dirk Schumann , a geologist and electron microscopist at McGill University and lead author of the study , " It was easy to focus on the thousands of other bacterial fossils , but these single , unusual crystals kept appearing in the background .
It soon became evident that they were everywhere . "
In addition to their unusually large sizes , the magnetic crystals occur in a surprising array of shapes .
For example , the spearhead - like crystals have a six - sided " stalk " at one end , a bulbous middle , and a sharp , tapered tip at the other end .
Once reaching a certain size , spearhead crystals grow longer but not wider , a directed growth pattern that is characteristic of most higher biological organisms .
The spearhead magnetic crystals compose a minor fraction of all of the iron - oxide crystals in the PETM clay layer .
Most of the crystals have smaller sizes and special shapes , which indicate that they are fossils of magnetotactic bacteria .
This group of microorganisms , long studied at Caltech by study coauthor Joseph Kirschvink , the Nico and Marilyn Van Wingen Professor of Geobiology , use magnets to orient themselves within Earth 's magnetic field , and proliferate in oxygen - poor water .
Spearheads are not , however , the rarest fossil type in the deposit .
That honor belongs to a spherical cluster of spearheads informally dubbed the " Magnetic Death Star " by the researchers .
The Magnetic Death Star may have preserved the crystals as they occurred in their original biological structure .
The researchers could not find a similar - shaped organism anywhere in the paleontological annals .
They hypothesize that it may have been a single - celled eukaryote that evolved for the first time during the PETM and was outcompeted once the strange climate conditions of that time diminished .
Alternatively , it may still exist today in a currently undiscovered location .
" The continental shelf of the mid-Atlantic states during the PETM must have been very iron - rich , much like the Amazon shelf today , " notes study coauthor Robert Kopp of Princeton University , who first started working on the project while a graduate student at Caltech .
" These fossils may be telling a story of radical environmental transformation : imagine a river like the Amazon flowing at least occasionally where the Potomac is today . "
The paper , " Gigantism in unique biogenic magnetite at the Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum , " will appear in the early online issue of PNAS the week of October 20 .
The Caltech work was supported by the NASA Exobiology program .

It is a sorry fact of American political life that campaigns get ugly , often in their final weeks .
But Senator John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin have been running one of the most appalling campaigns we can remember .
They have gone far beyond the usual fare of quotes taken out of context and distortions of an opponent ’s record  into the dark territory of race - baiting and xenophobia .
Senator Barack Obama has taken some cheap shots at Mr. McCain , but there is no comparison .
Despite the occasional slip ( referring to Mr. Obama ’s “ cronies ” and calling him “ that one ” ) , Mr. McCain tried to take a higher road in Tuesday night ’s presidential debate .
It was hard to keep track of the number of times he referred to his audience as “ my friends . ”
But apart from promising to buy up troubled mortgages as president , he offered no real answers for how he plans to solve the country ’s deep economic crisis .
He is unable or unwilling to admit that the Republican assault on regulation was to blame .
Ninety minutes of forced cordiality did not erase the dismal ugliness of his campaign in recent weeks , nor did it leave us with much hope that he would not just return to the same dismal ugliness on Wednesday .
Dropsy is an old word for an older problem .
Afflicted , you begin to swell — first your ankles , then your legs .
Walking gets difficult , even sitting becomes painful .
Then the swelling gets so bad your skin splits open .
The commonest cause is heart failure .
Think of the revolving door of an office building .
As the door gets older it turns more slowly .
Eventually people have to queue , spilling out onto the street .
As your heart gets feebler , your blood queues up in the same way .
Under that pressure , your veins leak fluid , which builds up between cells , pooling wherever gravity directs .
Because we have a double circulation system , there 's a double problem .
Unable to get into a weakly pumping right ventricle , ready to go to the lungs , deoxygenated blood backs up in your extremities , and fluid collects in your tissues .
You swell from the feet upwards .
And instead of being pumped out to the body from your left ventricle , oxygenated blood backs up , and fluid gets squeezed into your lungs , filling the spaces where air should be .
You get breathless .
Doctors used to try to relieve dropsy , which today we call edema , by making holes in people ’s bloated legs to let the fluid out .
That could help , a little .
Anything that reduced the amount of fluid in your body , even leeches and bloodletting , could make you feel better .
Welcome to the world of medicine that Dr. William Withering knew in the late eighteenth century , a scintillatingly brilliant time that crackled with new discoveries , political revolutions , and the excitement generated by the birth of the Enlightenment .
Yet Withering lacked the charisma of his era .
He was raised in a medical family in Shropshire , England , in 1741 , and after four years ' apprenticeship to a local physician , he went to Edinburgh to get his degree .
There were the typical diversions : he golfed , published bad poetry , and learned to play the bagpipes .
He loathed , in particular , the botany he was forced to study .
Nevertheless , he completed his degree , then set off on a professional pilgrimage to hospitals around Europe .
Unfortunately , Withering 's trip ended early .
His traveling companion , a healthy young man of his own age , developed a skin infection in Paris .
" An abscess grew upon his shoulder , a fever came on , the wound gangren'd and yesterday he died , " wrote Withering , who lived in a time when death came suddenly and doctors were impotent .
. . .
In 1767 Withering began to practice .
One of his first patients was seventeen - year - old Helena Cooke .
She liked drawing flowers .
While she lay sick in bed , Withering scoured the countryside to find her fresh subjects , apparently moved by her charms to overcome his antipathy toward botany .
It turned out to be the start of two lifelong relationships : Withering married his patient and acquired a lasting fondness for plants .
In 1775 worldly opportunity called on the young couple , arriving in the overwhelming shape of Erasmus Darwin , pockmarked , rotten - toothed , and enormous .
He had as great an appetite for food and free love as for science and verse .
( Famous in his time for his fertile mind and his poetry about the sex lives of plants , he is best known these days for his grandson Charles . )
Darwin recognized the young Withering ’s intellect and helped him secure the position of town physician for Birmingham .
Combined with Darwin 's friendship , the post brought membership in a remarkable club : the Lunar Society , named for its habit of meeting at full moons to make traveling home safer .
The Lunaticks , as they called themselves , men like Matthew Boulton , Joseph Priestley , and Josiah Wedgwood , were the leading British scientists and entrepreneurs of the day .
While his friends manufactured Britain 's industrial revolution , Withering lived conservatively .
His son described him as methodical , known more for " steady sense and correct judgment than for the flights of fancy or the eccentricities of genius . "
His letters are fabulously dreary .
But for all his lack of glitter , Withering was sharply observant .
When his opportunity for major discovery came , he jumped :
" In the year 1775 , my opinion was asked concerning a family receipt for the cure of the dropsy .
I was told that it had long been kept a secret by an old woman in Shropshire , who had sometimes made cures after the more regular practitioners had failed .
. . .
This medicine was composed of twenty or more different herbs ; but it was not very difficult for one conversant in these subjects to perceive that the active herb could be no other than the Foxglove . "
Any of some twenty plants in the genus Digitalis , foxglove had been used as a medicine by hosts of people , from ancient Greeks to medieval Welsh .
During the Middle Ages in Western Europe , it was believed to cure a whole range of diseases for which it is actually useless .
In the mid-1600s , for example , the herbalist Nicholas Culpeper recommended foxglove for treating epilepsy .
It does n’t .
Foxglove also had obvious problems .
In the sixteenth century , a botanically misguided Dutch chef fed his guests a foxglove omelet .
Their consequent diarrhea and vomiting were a good demonstration of the plant ’s milder side effects ; too much of it , and you die .
In the seventeenth century , forty years before Withering , a Frenchman investigated foxglove ’s effects on a turkey .
" He did not attempt to perch , " ran his poignant report on the poultry , " he uttered plaintive cries . "
The bird stumbled drunkenly for a few days , refused to eat , and died .
At medical school I was taught the blunt truth that only inactive drugs are without side effects .
Taking a pill is like thumping the side of a misbehaving television : you might bang the right piece into place , but you might make things worse .
Withering knew this ( minus the television analogy ) , worrying that " the lives of men " could be " hazarded " by his new drug .
His understanding of medical science evoked the modernity of the Lunar Society .
It was not enough , he realized , to compile only encouraging stories .
" It would have been an easy task to have given select cases , whose successful treatment would have spoken strongly in favour of the medicine , and perhaps been flattering to my own reputation .
But Truth and Science would condemn the procedure .
I have therefore mentioned every case in which I have prescribed the Foxglove , proper or improper , successful or otherwise . "
Altogether Withering wrote up 163 cases of dropsy in which he used the plant , and the majority of those patients ( no doubt the ones whose dropsy was caused by heart failure ) got better .
Swollen legs reduced in size , breathing was eased .
Noting that patients produced copious amounts of urine as they began to improve , Withering suspected that digitalis extract worked as a diuretic , causing excess fluid to be lost as urine and so reducing the amount of work the heart needed to do .
" It charms the shapeless monster into man , " Erasmus Darwin wrote in his poem about it .
Praise even came from the other side of the world : a physician from New Hampshire wrote congratulating Withering and asking for help in seeding the flower in America .
In 1790 , with the Revolution raging in France , Withering diagnosed himself with tuberculosis .
Over the next several years , consumption sucked his life away .
A friend was struck by how weak he became : " The flower of English physicians is indeed withering . "
( Medicine has progressed over the centuries , but puns are as bad as ever . )
In October 1799 he died .
His memorial tablet was carved with a plant of the genus Witheringia on one side and , separated by a terrifically bad poem , a foxglove on the other .
. . .
Hearts are well evolved , but not miraculous .
That means compromise and ultimate failure .
Let 's say that you hope to manufacture something with a lifetime guarantee , a watch , for example ; you would engineer it to last a hundred - odd years , not a thousand .
Evolution is equally careful about not wasting resources .
Therefore no body part outlasts the rest , or not by much .
Even our solid skeleton weakens and fails as we reach old age .
Modern medicine follows a similar aim , hoping to keep any organ from failing too far ahead of the rest , thus extending our healthy lives and compressing our decay into the fewest possible days .
The heart , however , often proves difficult to save , as muscle cells do n’t divide — at least , not abundantly enough to regenerate healthy tissue .
If you exercise them , heart muscle cells might get bigger , but few or no new ones will be made .
So as you age , they can die off gradually — particularly under the stress of high blood pressure , diabetes , or coronary artery disease — or , in the case of a heart attack , die off suddenly and potentially catastrophically .
Either way , the heart never grows back .
Foxglove — or digitalis , as the pharmaceutical compounds derived from it are commonly called — works not by directly causing increased urination , as Withering thought , but by making the heart beat more strongly and efficiently .
The trouble is , drugs that increase the strength of the heart 's beats do n’t make it grow new muscle ; they only drive what ’s left a little harder .
And any coach will tell you that if you push any athlete too far , you risk collapse .
When an aging heart fails and begins to pump less blood , our bodies make a mistake .
They notice the reduced flow , but presume we 're bleeding or dehydrated .
Evolutionarily , surviving blood loss and dehydration is more critical than extending old age .
So , when the body detects a lack of blood flow , it assumes that a lack of blood is to blame .
In response we get thirsty and our kidneys reduce urine output .
By drinking more and peeing less , our bodies compensate for a loss of fluid that has not occurred — as a result , we end up with too much .
Having to pump more fluid is exactly what a failing heart needs least .
Withering correctly observed that digitalis made people feel better , yet could it have been killing them just the same ?
Neither Withering nor anyone long after him took a systematic look .
In 1997 , nearly two centuries after Withering 's death , a medical trial came back with the answer .
Almost 7,000 people were randomly allocated to digitalis or a placebo for more than three years .
The results : for every thirty - nine people taking digitalis for a year , one avoided a hospital admission .
The effect on mortality ?
Zero. Digitalis is neither the lifesaver people had imagined nor the killer some suspected .
It has taken two centuries to go from hailing digitalis as a miracle cure to wondering if using it makes any sense at all .
Some doctors feel that the harms are hardly worth the benefits .
Others continue to prescribe it liberally , as though it really is a lifesaver .
Yet for certain patients , digitalis remains modestly effective , making them feel and function better than any razzle - dazzle new synthetic drug .
And that , even if they do n't live longer , is no small thing .
Top 10 Poisonous Plants
Druin Burch is a medical resident and a tutor at the University of Oxford .
His first book , Digging Up the Dead ( 2007 ) , profiles the pioneering surgeon , body snatcher , and revolutionary democrat Astley Cooper , who incidentally trained John Keats as a surgeon .
Burch lives in a village in the Cotswalds with eight ducks and 500 of his countrymen .
Advantage Obama :
McCain accepted $ 84.1 million from Washington , and that is all he can spend .
But the Illinois senator rejected the taxpayer money , betting he could raise a lot more .
And he has .
The Democrat had more than $ 77 million in the bank on Aug. 31 , records show , and is on pace to raise at least $ 100 million more by election day .
After decades of Creating bold retail spaces such as Nordic style brands , a set of designers has assembled a deceptively straightforward house for themselves .
AMONG THE MANY style stores which Christian and Ruxandra Halleroed have made is a string of nine shops for its Swedish clothes manufacturer Acne Studios , a few of which feel as industrial - size beef lockers , together with towering monolithic brushed stainless walls and flooring of mottled poured concrete , terrazzo or concrete - print carpeting .
The result is n’t unfeeling but bracing , in the form of the conservative Hindu spa :
The more acute gray background makes the garments , which frequently arrive in murky colours , seem more vibrant when compared .
This rigorously contemporary approach to style — frequently characterized by the expanses of solitary materials ( a wall of burled elm at 1 shop , diamond - embossed aluminum in a different ) along with encouraging planes of colour ( a peony - pink wall - to - wall carpeting , as an instance , or a status shelving system in aluminum sulfate gloomy ) — has generated Halleroed , the style studio which Christian , 46 , based in Stockholm in 1998 , along with Ruxandra , 39 , combined in 2015 , hunted after by trend brands , especially young Native labels whose gameness for experimentation complies with the company ’s own .
Even though the couple ’s Shops frequently have an aliens sense , they ’re both informed by a love of raw materials and conventional Swedish craft :
To the odor and leather products manufacturer Byredo ’s shop in New Yorkthey set up glass walls and angular alder shelves ; to your women ’s lineup Totêmethey exude a Stockholm townhouse with light lime - wood walls .
Christian initially researched cabinetmaking and furniture layout in Carl Malmstensskolan ( currently a part of Linkoping University ) , the college based at the Swedish capital from 1930 from the powerful designer Carl Malmsten , that helped define what is known now as style .
After graduating in 1998 , he began producing his own furnituremainly for Swedish office décor businesses , which finally resulted in architectural and interior commissions .
Contemplating
The meticulously controlled and clearly urban appearance of these jobs , ” some folks may be amazed by this home , ” states Ruxandra of their snug 1,100 - square - foot nation home the few built for their 5 - year - old daughter , Iolanda , in the island of Blido at 2017 .
The couple chose this place because it ’s near to their own ’60s - era flat in central Stockholm they might push in just under 2 hours but far enough away to let them unwind .
Even though it ’s just 35 km north of the funding , Blido is one of the most distant populated islands of the Stockholm archipelago , the swirl of all 30,000 so specks that marble that the neighboring Baltic Sea .
Its location makes it a perfect payoff for sailors , who ’ve lived here since the 16th century .
And if vacationers arrive at the summertime , the island feels like an intimate neighborhood .
There is a grocery shop and a farm which sells sheepskin rugs ; the homes are for the most part conventional Swedish cottages .
However , the Halleroeds ’ house , about the less Really , the construction is n’t , technically , of the place : Considering that the couple work program would not permit them to carefully oversee the structure they had the home personalized for their specifications with a mill in Slovenia and sent to the island at giant numbered balls .
Using its honey - color cedar - plank exterior along with a standing - seam aluminum cool roof , it feels much more natural than their business ’s work — and it has the exact same emphasis on natural and craft substances , most prominently timber .
The comfy inside , clad in uncooked amalgamated spruce , is combined by a shiny oxblood - red - painted spruce - board flooring ( a nod to Falu crimson , the hematite - rich pigment that has been utilized to paint Swedish homes because the 18th century ) that runs across the construction , which is split down the center by a 30 - foot - long wall .
On the other side are just two streamlined bedrooms , a bath and a roughly 215 - square - foot sleeping attic with beds for guests ; into the west is a double - height open - plan living area where various zones leak into one another round a mild split degree :
A little step leads up out of a reading area based round a wood - burning cast - iron fireplace into a dining room , kitchen and 2 seats nooks with built - in sheepskin- plus linen - topped Swedish pine seats .
As Ruxandra rolls out bread to get a blueberry pie at the kitchen comprising a lender of walnut cabinets and appliances assembled to the fundamental partition — she nods toward a six - foot - wide bean - shaped cutout from the wall over her to exemplify the improvisational way the few took to designing an area for themselves .
Midway during the plan procedure , ” she sketched a kidneylike contour on the design for a placeholder , and among these revised it .
“ Ordinarily , ” she states , ” we ’re a bit more strict . ”
Returns into the surrounding woods .
Every side of the construction will be punctuated with varying designs and dimensions of plate - glass dividers — two in complete — so that in the gloom of midwinter , the spruces outside are framed such as images around the walls .
Crossing the whole southern side of the principal area is really a 10 - foot - wide pane that gives glimpses of the ocean ; flanked with a 15 - foot - wide sliding glass door into the west along with a mirrored glass door into the east ( both of which direct out ) , it generates the impression that this component of the cottage — in which the household regularly likes a midafternoon fika — is still a pergola , receptive into the forests .
From the restroom , where glistening maroon wall tiles along with a burgundy red jasper marble flooring mimic the painted hardwood flooring throughout the remainder of the home , a glass doorway enables visitors to walk directly into the shower in the exterior whenever they go from swimming at the sea at summer or foraging for mushrooms in the autumn .
To Further blur the distinction between outside and inside , square balls are trimmed out of three of their house ’s four corners to make modest porches sheltered under the back part of the roof .
The southeast corner has been organized with hardy square - sided Swedish pine armchairs ( to be draped with neighborhood reindeer pelts in the winter ) and also a little round pine dining table — all of pieces the couple initially made for a sofa in the Nordic Museum in Stockholm at 2018 .
About the southwest porch has been a very long pine table built from the couple as per a layout in the Modernist artist Enzo Mari ’s 1974 publication ” Autoprogettazione ? ” — in which the family regularly eats foods at the summer months .
What furniture that the Halleroeds did not create themselves came out of local antique retailers , yet another manner in which the home pays tribute to Scandinavian midcentury layout .
The house ’s irregular notched floor program , specifically , was affected by among those forefathers of Modernism , the Austrian - born designer and architect Josef Frank , that left a lot of his important work in Sweden beginning in the 1930s — and that conceived of a succession of homes in 1947 , a few of which featured climatic volumes under rectangular roofs .
“ It is important that you understand your background , ” states Ruxandra .
“ It may not be directly represented in your job , but it affects your mind - set . ”
Despite
The few experimental strategy , however , the home is above a homage to the conventional dwellings of all Christian ’s childhood : his parents owned a tiny pine - walled cottage — the sort that Swedes have constructed for centuries — at Salen , roughly six hours northwest of Stockholm , in which the family could vacation each winter .
The angles of this Halleroeds ’ house on Blido could be slippery , the decor and palette austere , however its substances and intent would be the same ; it ’s an ode to Sweden ’s woodworking heritage and also a sanctuary in where they may enjoy the crackling landscapes where legacy derives .
“ The walls might appear raw today , ” Ruxandra states , because she serves her completed pie , deep with wild berries , ” but in a couple of decades , once the wood ages , then it ’s going to have precisely the exact same appearance . ”
The same as the trees which surround themolder and grander every calendar year , but consistently recognizably themselves .
Please try back again later .
Contrary to the somewhat feverish claims laid out in an recent lawsuit , when our favorite particle - smashing , Force - finding Large Hadron Collider is switched on soon it will not result in the destruction of life as we know it .
Such claims are " complete nonsense " say the scientists at CERN ( and everywhere else , ) in response to the suit .
They should know : it 's their machine , they designed it and they 've been telling everyone for a while that their research shows it 's safe .

The lawsuit filed by a group of Hawaii residents is alleging that not enough safety checks have been made by CERN to prevent disaster when the LHC goes live in the coming weeks .
It may " create unsafe conditions of physics " which may have disastrous effects .
How ?
Well , you may imagine a micro black hole gobbling up everything unstoppably , while a strangelet ( a hypothetical clump of particles including strange quarks ) may run amok converting all nearby matter into strange matter , also wrecking the Earth .

James Gillies , a CERN spokesman , suggests this is rubbish in this response to the New Scientist : " The LHC will start up this year , and it will produce all sorts of exciting new physics and knowledge about the universe . "
It 's no threat at all , he says : " A year from now , the world will still be here . "
The LHC is actually designed to probe the boundaries of physics , and while a 2003 safety study did conceed that micro black holes or magnetic monopoles may be formed , they would be short - lived and offer no threat .
CERN physicists will be talking about safety in an open house discussion on April 6 . [ New Scientist ]
GIMP 2.6 リリースノー ト
紹介
GIMP 2.6 の公式リリースノートの翻訳です。一日でぱぱっと翻訳をやってしまったのでレビューは無し。
GIMP 2.6 Release Notes ( www.gimp.org)
GIMP 2.6 は開発の観点から見て一つの重要なリリースです。たびたび不満点として指摘されていたユーザーインターフェイスに変更を加えています。そしていずれ
GIMP に高レベル色深度と非破壊編集を可能にするグラフベースの画像処理ライブラリである、GEGL を仮統合しました。
ユーザーインターフェイス
道具箱メニューバーを削除
道具箱メニューバーを削除していまい、画像ウィンドウのメニューバーと統合しました。いわゆるひとつの空っぽの画像ウィンドウと呼ばれるものを導入したのです。このウィンドウはメニューバーを持ち、何も画像が開かれていなくても存在します。さらにこれはドラッグ＆ドロップの対象ともなります。最初の画像を開くと、空っぽの画像ウィンドウは通常の画像ウィンドウへと変化します。最後の画像を閉じると、ウィンドウは空っぽの画像ウィンドウになります。
道具箱とドックとユーティリティウィンドウ
空っぽの画像ウィンドウが通常のメインウィンドウとなったとともに、道具箱やドックといったデフォルトのウィンドウヒントもユーティリティウィンドウに変化しました。これによりウィンドウマネージャーの
GIMP ウィンドウ管理法が向上し、タスクバーから道具箱やドックを省略し、道具箱やドックを常に画像ウィンドウの上に置くことができるようになりました。
画像の外枠境界を超えて移動する機能
ついに画像の外枠境界を越えて移動することが可能になりました。画像ウィンドウナビゲーションの制約がなくなったのです。拡大表示中に画像の端に対してブラシの端を使用しても問題がありません。画像ウィンドウの一部を覆う任意のユーティリティウィンドウに対してキャンバスを接続することも可能です。
マイナーな変 更
ダイアログメニューをウィンドウメニューに名称変更しました。
最近閉じたドックのリストを記憶するようになり、それを再び開くことができます。
Windowsにおいて、すでに実行中の GIMP インスタンスで画像を開くようにしました。
直接ステータスバーから画像表示の拡大縮小率を入力することができます。
ローカルディスクに GIMP ヘルプパッケージがインストールされていなければ、オンラインヘルプを参照するようにしました。
ドックのタブを誤って移動させてしまわないよう、ロックをすることができるようにしました。
ツール、フィルタ、プラグイン
自由選択ツールの改 良
自由選択ツールがポリゴン選択に対応するよう拡張しました。フリーハンドセグメントとポリゴンセグメントを混在させることもできます。既存のセグメントを編集したり、セグメントに対して角度を決めたり、他の選択ツールのように選択の加算や差分をとったりすることもできます。これにより自由選択ツールはとても多彩で、パワフルで、使いやすい選択ツールになりました。
動的ブラ シ( ブラシ感度 )
動的ブラシはいくつかの動的変化する入力によって、主に大きさや不透明度といった違うブラシパラメータを反映します。それは筆圧と筆速と散乱(不規則変化)です。筆速と散乱はマウスでも使用できます。以前から筆圧をサポートしているインクツールを追い越してしまっており、筆速依存のペイントに対してより適応しています。
パスをストローク描画するとき、新機能の動的ブラシを有効にすることができます。描画ツールのオプションの下にはチェックボックスがあります。これは描画ツールを使ってストローク描画するときにブラシの動的な動きをエミュレートするものです。つまりこれは、GIMP
を使ってストロークを描くと、筆圧や筆速が筆跡に反映されるということです。筆圧はゼロからスタートし、徐々に100まで上がっていきます。そして再び筆圧ゼロに戻ります。筆速はゼロからスタートし、ストロークの最後には最速まで上がっていきます。
マイナーな変 更
境界ボックスの中へとテキストを自動的に回り込ませる(改行する)、境界ボックスをテキストツールに追加しました。
切り抜きツールのような矩形の移動ハンドルがあり、矩形選択領域が小さいときには外側にハンドルが出ます。
移動ツールに動作制限のオプションを追加しました。
描画ツールのイベントをスムーズに改善しました。
移動させている途中には矩形の中央ラインを表示します。そしてグリッドやガイドへセンターラインが吸着します。
にじみツールでもブラシの拡大縮小が可能になりました。
繰り返して色調整を行うときに役に立つよう、すべてのカラーツールでプリセットが保存できるようになりました。
明るさ -コントラスト から レベル へ、 レベル から カーブ へと設定を残して移ることができるようになりました 。
から へ、 から へと設定を残して移ることができるようになりました 。
変換ツールのプレビューにおいて、不透明度を変えることができます。
スクリーンショットプラグインはマウスカーソルもキャプチャすることができます。( Xfixes を使う )
切抜きツールと矩形選択ツールのアスペクト比をステータスバーに表示します。
脱色機能はキャンバス上でプレビューができます。
炎プラグインには新しく22のバリエーションが追加されました。
ブラシフォルダといったデータファイルフォルダは再帰的にファイルを検索するようになりました。
PSD 読み込みプラグインを新しく書き起こしたものと入れ替えました。古いバージョンの機能に加えて、例えば
ICC カラープロファイルの読み込みといった機能が追加されています。
水面下
GEGL
高深度画像および非破壊編集へと向かう重要な進捗が
GIMP になされました 。GIMP におけるほとんどのカラーオペレーションは、よりパワフルなグラフベースの画像処理フレームワークである
GEGL に移植されました。これは内部処理が32ビット浮動小数点RGBAで行われているという意味です。デフォルトでは旧来の8ビットコードを使用していますが、好奇心の強いユーザーは色/
Use GEGL でカラーオペレーションが GEGL を使うようになります 。
カラーオペレーションを GEGL へと移植したことに加えて、試しに GEGL Operation ツールを追加してみました。これはツールメニューの中にあります。画像に対して
GEGL オペレーションを適用することができ、キャンバス上で結果をプレビューできます。右のスクリーンショットはガウシアンぼかしの様子です。

プラグイン開 発
プラグイン開発者にはお楽しみがいくつかあります。例えば、プロシージャーはエラーに対して詳細なエラー報告をします。エラーはユーザーに伝えることもできます。
GIMP 2.6 においてもそのスクリプト機能をさらに拡張しました。特にテキストレイヤーを作成して合成するための
API が豊富になりました。こちらが GIMP 2.6 での新しいシンボルです。
後方互換 性
Script - Fu は整理され、複数のバグフィックスがなされました。重要なバグフィックスの一つに、bug # 508020 、Script - Fu のクラッシュを防ぐことがあります。let や let* や letrec ブロックでバインディングされた変数に初期値が与えられていないスクリプトがクラッシュすることを修正しています。
変数に初期値が必要だということは R5RS
Scheme standard document で述べられています。単なる定数や関数呼び出しの結果を初期値として与えます。次の例はこの問題を示したもので、壊れたスクリプトを修正する簡単な変更を見せています。
この例は、もはや今の Script - Fu では動かない不正な構文を伴った let* ブロックを表示しています 。
( let * (
( four (+ 2 2 ) )

Sometimes we forget that doctors are just like everyday people .
They have families , they are members of parent / teacher organizations ( PTOs ) , they help their children with school projects and homework , and they , in many cases , are still repaying school loans .
You name it , and yes , the doctor has probably experienced it .
So too is the case with sickness .
Doctors do get ill , and are seen in the local office , emergency room , and hospitals .
One of the first decisions the doctor - patient must make is whether to reveal that he or she is a physician to the healthcare personnel .
This decision is not taken lightly , because the doctor , by admitting he / she is a physician , might inadvertently alter the potential physician - patient relationship .
The doctor may end up over - assisting in their own health care .
The nurses , assistants , and even the attending physician will sometimes assume that the doctor - patient has revealed the entire history concerning the illness ( or the most pertinent facts ) and might not be as thorough in gathering information for treatment purposes .
Or , the hospital workers will assume the doctor - patient knows the protocols and think they will be boring the doctor by giving detailed preventive lectures .
If the doctor - patient does not reveal that he or she is a doctor , will this affect their treatment ?
Yes , it possibly can .
First professional courtesy may not be employed .
There is a subtle understanding or bonding between doctors , nurses and other healthcare providers that we are all in this together and an extraordinary effort is taken to make sure their colleague is comfortable or getting the best care .
This is also true with other professions .
Police officers have a spoken and unspoken respect for other officers .
Teachers often identify with other educators .
The same is true with doctors and their equally hardworking colleagues at the hospital .
A doctor not revealing his or her profession might forfeit some perks ( e.g. , faster service , more attentive staff ) that makes the visit a little more pleasant .
They would be just like any other patient and perhaps would not receive extras .
Being a doctor - patient is uncomfortable for many reasons :
First , no one , including doctors , wants to visualize themselves ill , and to add to this , people assume that doctors should be able to heal themselves .
Second , doctors may feel guilty that their patients do not have the option of playing the “ doctor card ” in situations where the treatment process is moving too slowly .
Doctor - patients believe that they should be able to receive adequate care without revealing their profession , but they know that the healthcare system is imperfect , and it bothers them .
Thirdly , doctors usually are the ones who call the shots and so it leaves them with a sense of diminished autonomy .
Lastly , how will their colleagues respond , and how will the doctor respond to them ?
Sometimes , it seems awkward to see the doctor as a patient but if we all remember that physicians have the same joys , want the same rewards , and have the same responsibilities , then it makes what seems like an irony a little more ordinary .
I want others to chime in , especially if you are a healthcare professional .
If you have been a patient did you reveal that you were a physician , nurse , or another healthcare professional ?

Marijuana plants seized Monday in Browns Valley and Live Oak " are the largest I 've seen , " a drug enforcement official said .
…
Some of the plants were 7 feet tall or higher .
Most averaged only 5 feet in height but had a circumference of about 12 feet and could have produced about 10 pounds each of marijuana , said Hudson , who called it " some of the highest quality marijuana currently available . "
It would take about 2,000 normal - size plants to produce an equivalent amount , he said .
[ Appeal Democrat ]
Probably they would end up getting about 3 - 4 pounds of actual bud from a plant that size , depending on how well it is manicured , plus more than that as leaf that could be converted into hash or edibles .
Remember that the police use the " bud - leaf - seed " version of cannabis , whereas the actual market is for bud , not leaf or seeds .
So cops almost always think there is twice as much ' marijuana ' there as does the grower .
I was just looking at some big plants in Oregon for a collective , and they claimed 5 pounds per plant , but I think that included the shake , which they said they give away to indigent patients .
Visually they looked like 3 pound plants to me , so the implication is that they toss out the fan leaf but keep the bud leaf and trim for patients .
That would explain how they could come to 5 pounds .
I 've never had anyone claim to have gotten 10 pounds from a plant , but quite a few people have boasted about getting between 2 and 5 pounds of bud from one .
I have n't had the pleasure of sitting in on the manicure and weighing to see it for myself , yet .
Cops often inflate the weight of their yield by using the fresh weight instead of the dry weight of the plants , BTW , so the most typical inflation is 400 % ; in other words , their alleged 10 pounds is most likely to weigh about 2.5 pounds , based on the typical cop exaggeration .
Drug enforcement officers never tire of their overpowering compulsion to exaggerate marijuana seizures to the point of absurdity .
Again and again , we ’ve caught police making ludicrous claims that contradict basic math and science .
The latest example comes from California , where local narcotics officers found some large marijuana plants and tried to frame it as some sort of unbelievable shocker :
That all sounds very exciting and newsworthy , except for one thing : marijuana plants do n’t yield 10 pounds .
They just do n’t .
That ’s crazy and wrong .
To illustrate how absurd this is , I contacted Chris Conrad , a court - qualified cannabis expert and author of Cannabis Yields and Dosage .
Here ’s what Chris had to say :
It is almost amusing to picture officers standing around a bunch of big plants issuing arbitrary clueless declarations about the garden ’s quality and yield .
They have absolutely no idea what they ’re talking about .
It ’s like asking a mugger to appraise jewelry .
It might be funny if it were n’t for the fact that these spontaneous , incompetent assessments are used at trial to influence how long non-violent offenders will spend behind bars .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Throughout her career , singer - songwriter Cyndi Lauper has promoted gay and lesbian rights .
She has a personal connection to this cause -- her sister is a lesbian -- but she also believes it 's a matter of fairness .
Cyndi Lauper worked with Cathy Nelson of the Human Rights Campaign to raise awareness of LGBT issues .
" It 's always wrong to discriminate , " the Grammy Award winner said .
" I grew up in the civil rights movement .
It was wrong then , and it is wrong now . "
With her 2007 and 2008 " True Colors " tours , Lauper has helped raise awareness about lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights around the country .
She said fellow LGBT activist Cathy Nelson especially motivates her .
Nelson worked at the Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) , a national LGBT civil rights organization , and her dedication to those issues runs deep .
Fighting for fairness and equality , she said , drives her .
" I'm a lesbian , and I see the issues very personally , " Nelson said .
" When it deep - down resonates that you do n't have the same rights and responsibilities , or people do n't view you the same , it can be demoralizing and empowering at the same time . "
Nelson 's passion for the cause has enabled her to inspire thousands of people across the country to get involved .
When she was growing up in rural Illinois , Nelson said , she had n't imagined following this path .
She trained to be a teacher , but on a whim , became a flight attendant with Eastern Airlines to fulfill her " intense desire to travel . "
In the 1980s , she became involved with labor issues through her flight attendant union .
That led to working on women 's issues with the National Organization of Women in Washington .
In 1989 , she started working for the HRC .
Since then , she has helped bring LGBT rights out of the closet and onto the national stage .
Hired to increase the group 's membership , Nelson built a strong volunteer network in communities across the nation .
HRC had just 12,000 members when Nelson started .
Today it has more than 725,000 , making it the largest gay and lesbian rights organization in the country .

" Part of my job is getting people to be vocal , " Nelson said .
" It 's important that everyone has an understanding that discrimination is happening every single day against a certain segment of society .
And that 's just wrong . "
In 2007 , when Lauper worked with HRC for the " True Colors " tour , she and Nelson teamed up to bring gay and straight audiences together on fairness and equality issues .
Nelson realized it was also an opportunity to shine the spotlight on an issue she 'd worked on for almost a decade -- the passage of a hate crimes bill that would make attacks based on sexual orientation , disability , or gender a federal crime .
For Nelson , crimes against LGBT people -- such as the murder of Matthew Shepard -- represent the darkest side of ignorance on these issues .
In 2006 , more than one in six hate crimes were committed against LGBT individuals , an 18 percent rise over the previous year , according to the FBI .
" I learned from Cathy that hate crimes send fear through a community , " Lauper said .
" You could die just because of who you are . "
Watch Lauper and Nelson talk about the " True Colors " tour to raise awareness »
At every concert , Lauper spoke passionately about the need to pass the bill , and her song , " True Colors , " was used in a public service announcement about the legislation .
HRC volunteers distributed information at each venue and had postcards on hand for people to send to their legislators .
In the end , more than 15,000 people signed postcards , and both houses of Congress passed the bill by wide margins .
Although President Bush never signed the bill , Nelson and Lauper have high hopes for it to soon become law .
For Nelson , getting so many people engaged was a key achievement .
" The biggest reward for me is when I 've played some part in empowering someone to get involved , " she said .
Lauper knows first - hand how convincing Nelson can be .
" The fact that you can actually succeed and help people -- you really get that from her , " she said .
" People like Cathy get all of us motivated . "

Danny Wallace investigates for Horizon
She 's been rearing a small group of apes as if they are people , to see what happens .
Her results appear to be spectacular , at least to writer Danny Wallace : " Kanzi asked me for a present .
I gave him the free toothbrush kit from my flight over .
He brushed his teeth .
We bonded . "
Danny is a seasoned television campaigner : he showed us How To Start Your Own Country on BBC

You could say that an adult chimp has more of the characteristics of a person than a new born baby
Julian Baggini , philosopher
Many primatologists are devising experiments that show chimps are ever more people - like than was thought just a few years ago ; and yet , as scientists , they will not countenance that chimps could ever be people .
Yes and no
At the Yerkes Primate Centre in Atlanta , Danny finds out from researcher Victoria Horner that chimps have culture ...
Victoria : " This experiment is the first definite evidence that chimpanzees can pass on ideas to each other .
That is the basis of culture . "
Danny : " So , are they people then ? "
In Budongo National Park , Uganda .
Katie Slocombe from St Andrews University is studying vocalisations with wild chimps ...
Katie : " Chimps produce an incredibly wide range of sounds .
It appears that they may have a rudimentary language . "
Danny : " So , are they people then ?
Katie : " No "
Alicia Melis of the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig conducts experiments to see if chimps have a quintessential human character , one that was thought to be absent till now : co-operation ...
Alicia : " Chimps can co-operate , they can even chose the best co-operator to help them when presented with a range of their mates . "
Danny : " ... they co-operate , they 're people ?
Alicia : " Sort of ! "
Researchers continue to find more and more human - like behaviours
According to philosopher Julian Baggini , it is possible that non-human animals like chimps could be people .
" You could say that an adult chimp has more of the characteristics of a person than a new born baby , " he says .
After all , though humans and chimps are different species , they share up to 99.4 % of their most crucial DNA ( the figure is difficult to calculate exactly and depends on the scientist you speak to ) .
And to prove how similar we are to chimps , Danny takes part in a potentially humiliating experiment .
The scent of male sweat is controlled by their genes , in both chimps and men .
In a blind test , three women were asked to sniff the sweat of Danny and Cody the chimp , to see which one they fancied most .
When they found out afterwards that one of the odours was from a chimp , there was laughter .
When they realised that two out of three had preferred the chimp , there was nervous laughter .
' Learning key '
When Danny finally reaches Des Moines , the issue comes into focus .
The chimp and human genomes are very , very close
Having brushed his teeth Kanzi , a 26 - year - old bonobo , built like a heavyweight boxer and who is five times stronger than an average man , looks into Danny 's eyes and asks him to play " Chase " .
So they hang out together for a while , because that 's what Kanzi has learned to do .
And for Sue Savage Rumbaugh , learning is the key .
" Take a human child .
If you lock him into a cage , never take him to the mall , never give him ice - cream , never teach him to communicate - how could he become a person ? " asks Sue .
Chimps are human ?
Never .
Chimps are people ?
You decide .

CHINA'S contaminated baby milk powder , which has killed two babies and affected almost 600 others , is the result of sabotage , the New Zealand partner of the Chinese company involved says .
Andrew Ferrier , the head of New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra , said yesterday that unknown parties were behind the industrial sabotage .
Fonterra owns 43 % of the Chinese Sanlu Group , whose tainted infant formula was publicly recalled only last Thursday , more than a month after the company found out about the problem .
Mr Ferrier said Sanlu had bought raw milk from third parties " who were putting what appears to be melamine in the milk " .
" In this case we frankly have sabotage of a product , " he said , defending Fonterra 's failure to do more to ensure a public recall by claiming it was following the Chinese processes .
Microsoft's .NET framework on Linux is getting a big boost today with the official release of Novell 's Mono 2.0 .
The Mono 2.0 release is Novell 's open source implementation of Microsoft 's .NET platform .
With the latest version , the gap between the two is getting smaller .
We would n't be able to hear ourselves think over the media clamor , the racist stereotypes parading as analysis , and the calls from even Democrats to find away to replace Obama on the ticket .
I 'd like to ask another question as a thought - exercise : imagine the current , black Democratic candidate for president and his black wife announced that their black , 17 - year - old daughter was unmarried , still in high school , and pregnant .
( We 'll adjust the age of the daughters for this exercise . )
When it comes to judging someone 's sexual morality , the judgment is never about the sexual act itself .
Rather it 's about the person who committed it .
Sara Whitman yesterday asked us to imagine what the media reaction would be like if Bristol were in the same position but male , or if Sarah Palin were in the same position but male .
The American Family Association , Focus on the Family , the Traditional Values Coalition , the Concerned Women for America , and the Family Research Council have this to say about Sarah Palin 's unwed , teenage , pregnant daughter and what they think of Palin 's parenting skills as a result :
Indeed , if McCain does n't change the ticket ( which he still can do ) , the silence will be deafening .
The only statement I can find from a leader of the Religious Right on Bristol 's pregnancy so far is this :
We were n't in the Excel Center at the RNC for more than five minutes when I ran into Senator Orrin Hatch .
We talked about various issues and then wound up getting into it over Sarah Palin 's daughter 's pregnancy , which he said was " terrible " to bring up .
And it is , in certain respects .
Bristol is someone who did n't choose to be in the national spotlight .
In fact , her mother lied to her about why the whole family was going off to Ohio and she did n't find out that her mother was going to run for VP until the last minute .
Considering how obsessed our culture is with " fault " and " blame , " Bristol here should be forgiven and forgotten .
Of course , Dr. James Dobson would n't agree that the parents had nothing to do with this :
When that regular contact is combined with other shared activities between parents and kids , the most positive outcome is achieved .
The researchers also observed that adolescents who felt a sense of connection with their parents ( feelings of warmth , love and caring ) were least likely to engage in harmful behavior .
You might be asking : " How can I be with my teenagers morning , noon and night ?
I have too much work to do . "
You simply have to decide what is most important to you at this time .
It wo n't matter as much a few years down the road , but your availability right now could make the difference for your child between surviving or plunging off the cliff .
My father and mother were faced with the same difficult choice when I was 16 years old .
Dad was an evangelist who was gone most of the time , while my mother was home with me .
During the adolescent years , I began to get testy with my mother .
I never went into total rebellion , but I was definitely flirting with the possibility .
I 'll never forget the night my mom called my dad on the phone .
I was listening as she said , " I need you . "
To my surprise , my dad immediately cancelled a four - year slate of meetings , sold our home and moved 700 miles south to take a pastorate so he could be with me until I finished high school .
It was an enormous sacrifice for him to make .
He never fully recovered professionally from it .
But he and Mom felt my welfare was more important than their immediate responsibilities .
Dad was home with me during those two volatile years when I could have gotten into serious trouble .
When I speak with reverence about my parents today , as I often do , one of the reasons is because they gave priority to me when I was sliding close to the brink .
You may not be called upon to make such a radical change in your lifestyle .
But if you are , the investment in your teen 's life is worth it .
We can't put a price tag on our child 's life .
According to Dobson , any parent should give up his or her glamorous job and stay nearer the kids because teen pregnancy , drug use , poor grades , even homosexuality are moral failures and signs that the parents did n't try hard enough .
He even holds his own parents to that standard .
So discussing Sarah Palin 's parenting , according to the Dobson , is fair game .
But here 's what James Dobson thinks of Sarah Palin :
Minnery added that his boss , Dobson , has yearned for a conservative female leader like Margaret Thatcher to emerge on the American scene .
And while Palin is no Thatcher , " she has not rejected the feminine side of who she is , so for that reason , she will be attractive to conservative voters . "
The members of the Council for National Policy are the hidden hand behind McCain 's Palin pick .
With her selection , the Republican nominee is suddenly -- and unexpectedly -- assured of the support of a movement that once opposed his candidacy with all its might .
Case in point : while Dobson once said he could " never " vote for McCain , he issued a statement last week hailing Palin as an " outstanding " choice .
If Dobson 's enthusiasm for Palin is any indication , he may soon emerge from his bunker in Colorado Springs to endorse McCain , providing the Republican nominee with the grassroots support of the Christian right 's single most influential figure .
But , of course , the only way that Dobson 's actually contradicting himself is if we read his parenting advice as at the very least sincere , which would be a failure on our part as critical readers .
The first , second , third , second - to - last , and last reason the Religious Right exists is to get money into the hands of the rich and powerful by pushing for tax cuts , getting Republican votes so that the rich can loot the Federal Treasury , and cutting funding for social programming by making every social problem - crime , violence , value changes that make some people uncomfortable - seem like the result of regular people not trying hard enough .
( It 's much harder to mount a movement to real solutions to real problems if people think that those problems are around mainly because they , and their fellow citizens , failed the Republic , not the other way around . )
I 'm not saying here that the Religious Right wo n't have anything to say about Palin .
They will .
But they 'll react more slowly than they did with Bill Clinton or John Edwards .
They 'll be more sensitive to Palin 's privacy and family .
And we 'll hear lots of " It must be very hard for her "s , " She 's a wonderful parent and they 're doing the right thing "s , and " It 's a difficult situation that Sarah 's handling beautifully "s .
Most likely , quite a few will react like Orrin Hatch did above and completely avoid the subject .
Judging sexual morality has little to do with actually maintaining standards for proper behavior and a lot more to do with pushing through a specific political agenda .
It 's a subjective political tool used to demonize people who conservatives just plain do n't like ( racial minorities , women who believe they should have rights , LGBT people ) .
And when not wielding it , as in the case of Bristol Palin , achieves its real goals better than wielding it would , then the Religious Right restrains itself .
Barack has to present his family as the Huxtables or the Winslows of the 21st century , while a conservative , and white , politician has no such burden and gets far more latitude .
We should remember that the Religious Right 's moral standards are empty and cynically - used , and that there 's nothing wrong with pointing that out .
On another note , Sarah Palin used to be a member of the Alaska Independence Party , a group that is working to get Alaska to secede from the union ( seriously ) .
Will she be tarred and feathered as a traitor ?
Update :
Thanks to Keith for sending me this link to Dobson 's reaction :
We have always encouraged the parents to love and support their children and always advised the girls to see their pregnancies through , even though there will of course be challenges along the way .
That is what the Palins are doing , and they should be commended once again for not just talking about their pro-life and pro-family values , but living them out even in the midst of trying circumstances .
Being a Christian does not mean you 're perfect .
Nor does it mean your children are perfect .
But it does mean there is forgiveness and restoration when we confess our imperfections to the Lord .
I 've been the beneficiary of that forgiveness and restoration in my own life countless times , as I 'm sure the Palins have .
The media are already trying to spin this as evidence Gov. Palin is a ' hypocrite , ' but all it really means is that she and her family are human .
They are in my prayers and those of millions of Americans .
They 're only human .
Please do n't judge .
Everyone else is n't human , so it 's OK to judge them .
Update II : This is the last I 'll put up in this post , but here 's the Family Research Council .
When I wrote it they had n't made a statement yet , but they 're coming out slowly , and they 're all so supportive .
Unfortunately , teenage pregnancy has become all too common in today 's society regardless of a family 's economic or social status .
It is a problem that we remain committed to reducing through encouraging young people to practice abstinence .
Fortunately , Bristol is following her mother and father 's example of choosing life in the midst of a difficult situation .
We are committed to praying for Bristol and her husband - to - be and the entire Palin family as they walk through a very private matter in the eyes of the public .
Yes , yes , very private matter .
FRC is a serious organization that respects the privacy of public figures and would never judge .
Unless it 's a Democrat , of course .
Apparently quoting Jesus , New York Governor Elliot Spitzer resigned yesterday .
He resigned over allegations of sexual immorality and other illegal activities , pointing to the absolute truthfulness of Jesus ' words in Luke 12:48 .
Jesus Himself declares , " the Scripture can not be broken , " ( John 10:35 ) .
Our culture can deny God , the Bible , moral truth and personal consequences , but we can not escape them .
The Scriptures teach us " the godly learn from watching ruin overtake the wicked , " ( Proverbs 21:12 , LB ) .
What can we learn from watching yet another sad spectacle of failed public leadership ?
First , " a man without self - control is like a city broken into and left without walls , " ( Prov. 25:28 , ESV ) .
Without self - control , we are defenseless against temptation .
John Maxwell writes regarding self - discipline , " the first person you lead is you . "
If we cannot control and lead ourselves , we surely cannot lead others .
Maxwell goes on , " remember , only in the moment of discipline do you have the power to achieve your dream . "
The Apostle Paul admitted that he disciplined his body ( literally " beat it black and blue , " making it his conquered slave ) lest after preaching to others he should be disqualified , ( 1 Corinthians 9:27 ) .
Sexual immorality disqualifies from leadership .
Second , " do not be deceived : God is not mocked , for whatever one sows , that will he also reap , " ( Gal. 6:7 ) .
It is not possible to live in moral compromise without consequences .
There are those in leadership who have fallen into the deception that says , " God has forgotten ; He hides His face ;
He will never see , " ( Psalm 10:11 ) .
Maggie Gallagher , writing in defense of Silda Spitzer , reminds us that " adultery has been redefined as a ' private matter , ' and that we no longer have any public punishments for adultery .
God , however , simply pays no attention whatsoever to man 's redefinition schemes .
The governor 's tragic fall is yet another example .
More than ever , we need the voices of America 's pastors serving without restriction as the conscience of the nation .
So are they for privacy after they were against it ?
At last , it ’s all done and dusted and the game is ON SALE !
This is the first game I ’ve released since doing the whole ‘ talking to pirates ‘ thing .
It ’s also the best game I ’ve ever made , and the one that ’s taken the longest , cost the most and involved the most effort to get it the way I want .
I ’m really extremely proud of the way it has turned out .
All I need now is for people to like it , and buy it , so I can pay the bills !
There is ( of course ) a free demo if you are n’t sure if it ’s your kind of game .
here is the demo link :
http://www.positech.co.uk/kudos2/demo.html
Here is the website with screenshots etc :
http://www.positech.co.uk/kudos2
The game is set at $ 19.95 which is a price that ’s just low enough that it makes me panicky and Fidgety .
I ’m hoping that all the feedback I got about the price of games actually makes sense and that more people buy a $ 19.95 game than would buy a $ 29.99 one .
( and a big enough difference as to end up making more overall ) .
If not , I ’m kind of screwed :D I also made the demo more than twice the length of the original games demo , because that was another , possibly fair criticism aimed at modern games .
Obviously there is no DRM on the game , you just download it , install it , run it and have fun .
Any feedback on the games purchase process is much needed , as are any bug report because this is day one , and let ’s be honest , there is bound to be something that I ’ve forgotten due to extreme tiredness , stress and tunnel vision .
Now go try the demo !
Edit :
If you could digg this ( http://digg.com/pc_games/Kudos_2_On_Sale_NOW)
It would really help get the word out , as I ’m just an invisible indie game developer unless people get to hear about it .
Much appreciated .

Half of all American doctors responding to a nationwide survey say they regularly prescribe placebos to patients .
The results trouble medical ethicists , who say more research is needed to determine whether doctors must deceive patients in order for placebos to work .
The study involved 679 internists and rheumatologists chosen randomly from a national list of such doctors .
In response to three questions included as part of the larger survey , about half reported recommending placebos regularly .
Surveys in Denmark , Israel , Britain , Sweden and New Zealand have found similar results .
The most common placebos the American doctors reported using were headache pills and vitamins , but a significant number also reported prescribing antibiotics and sedatives .
Although these drugs , contrary to the usual definition of placebos , are not inert , doctors reported using them for their effect on patients ’ psyches , not their bodies .
In most cases , doctors who recommended placebos described them to patients as “ a medicine not typically used for your condition but might benefit you , ” the survey found .
Only 5 percent described the treatment to patients as “ a placebo . ”
Half of All Food Produced Worldwide is Wasted
The brief authored by the Stockholm International Water Institute , the UN Food and Agriculture Organization , and the International Water Management Institute shows that the current food crisis is less a crisis of production than a crisis of waste .
Tossing food away is like leaving the tap running , the authors say .
" More than enough food is produced to feed a healthy global population .
Distribution and access to food is a problem - many are hungry , while at the same time many overeat , " the brief states .
But , it says , " we are providing food to take care of not only our necessary consumption but also our wasteful habits . "

" As much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted , " says Dr. Charlotte de Fraiture , a researcher at IWMI .
" Curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win-win opportunities for farmers , business , ecosystems , and the global hungry . "
" An effective water - saving strategy requires that minimizing food wastage is firmly placed on the political agenda , " she said .
In the United States , for instance , as much as 30 percent of food , worth some US $ 48.3 billion , is thrown away .
" That 's like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion liters of water into the garbage can - enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people , " says the report .
The policy brief , " Saving Water : From Field to Fork - Curbing Losses and Wastage in the Food Chain , " calls on governments to reduce by half , by 2025 , the amount of food that is wasted after it is grown and outlines attainable steps for this be achieved .
Through international trade , for instance , savings in one country might benefit communities in other parts of the world .
" Unless we change our practices , water will be a key constraint to food production in the future , " said Dr. Pasquale Steduto of FAO .
Water losses accumulate as food is wasted before and after it reaches the consumer .
In poorer countries , a majority of uneaten food is lost before it has a chance to be consumed .
Depending on the crop , an estimated 15 to 35 percent of food may be lost in the field .
Another 10 to15 percent is discarded during processing , transport and storage , the brief states .

As this wasted food rots in landfills it generates methane , a gas that causes climate change and is 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide .
The report stresses that the magnitude of current food losses presents both challenges and opportunities .
" Improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food that is wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations , " says Professor Jan Lundqvist of the Stockholm International Water Institute .
" Reaching the target we propose , a 50 percent reduction of losses and wastage in the production and consumption chain is a necessary and achievable goal , " said Lundqvist .
World Water
Week is hosted by the Stockholm International Water Institute , a policy institute that contributes to international efforts to combat the world 's escalating water crisis .
The annual event features the award of the 2008 Stockholm Water Prize , which this year was bestowed upon Professor John Anthony Allan from King 's College London , who introduced the " virtual water " concept .
Virtual water is a measurement of how water is embedded in the production and trade of food and consumer products and is the concept on which the policy brief , " Saving Water : From Field to Fork - Curbing Losses and Wastage in the Food Chain , " is based .
While studying water scarcity in the Middle East , Professor Allan developed the theory of using virtual water import , via food , as an alternative water " source " to reduce pressure on the scarcely available domestic water resources there and in other water - short regions .

By explaining how and why nations such as the United States , Argentina and Brazil export billions of liters of water each year , while others like Japan , Egypt and Italy import billions , the virtual water concept has opened the door to more productive water use , said the Water Prize Nominating Committee .
National , regional and global water and food security , for example , can be enhanced when water intensive commodities are traded from places where they are economically viable to produce to places where they are not .
" The improved understanding of trade and water management issues on local , regional and global scales are of the highest relevance for the successful and sustainable use of water resources , " the committee said .
The Stockholm Water Prize is a global award founded in 1990 and presented annually by the Stockholm Water Foundation to an individual , organization or institution for outstanding water - related activities .
The activities can be within fields like education and awareness - raising , human and international relations , research , water management and water - related aid .

Noam Chomsky : " If I were in a swing state , I 'd vote for Obama "
In this Der Spiegel interview with Noam Chomsky , this exchange piqued my interest :
SPIEGEL : Is there nothing about McCain that appeals to you ?
Chomsky :
In one aspect he is more honest than his opponent .
He explicitly states that this election is not about issues but about personalities .
The Democrats are not quite as honest even though they see it the same way .
SPIEGEL : So for you , Republicans and Democrats represent just slight variations of the same political platform ?
Chomsky :
Of course there are differences , but they are not fundamental .
Nobody should have any illusions .
The United States has essentially a one - party system and the ruling party is the business party .
Since Chomsky did n't come out and say that he supported either of the candidates ( something I would expect ) I thought I 'd ask him a few follow - up questions .
Here they are , with his answers :
Peter Jaworski :
Do you support a political party , or any particular individuals running for office ?
Noam Chomsky :
If I were in a swing state , I 'd vote for Obama , reluctantly and without illusions , only because I think that McCain - Palin and the constituency they represent are extremely dangerous -- in fact , there 's a proto - fascist character , a term I do n't use lightly .
PJ : What do you make of identity politics in this election ?
Barack Obama and Sarah Palin ( as well as Hilary Clinton ) have made this election much less about policies and much more about identifying with someone because of their skin colour or gender .
Is it worrying or a good thing ?
NC : It 's not in the least surprising .
For years party managers have been dedicated to keeping issues out of the campaigns -- a way of keeping public concerns out -- and focusing on " character , " " values , " " qualities , " etc .
I 've written about it .
The PR agencies that run the campaigns use the same devices to undermine democracy that they use to undermine markets in commercial advertising .
PJ : Are you following the Canadian election at all ?
If so , do you have any thoughts about it ?
NC : Do n't follow it closely enough to say anything with any confidence .
In a separate email , I asked Chomsky what he meant by calling McCain - Palin and their supporters " proto - fascist . "
Here 's what he wrote :
NC : I 'll lift some remarks from a recent letter to someone who asked about Palin .
It 's enough to look at the news reports of recent Republican rallies .
And here are the remarks he sent someone else about Palin :
If you think Sarah Palin is a frightening phenomenon , you should listen to talk radio , as I often do while driving .
It was taken over years ago by a very well - funded ultra - right .
And it reaches tens of millions of frightened people , who are true believers , judging by the phone calls .
I was listening to Rush Limbaugh today ranting with extreme confidence about how the financial crisis was created by Bill Ayers and Acorn ( Obama 's secret connection ) and the rich liberal Democrats who run Wall Street ( and of course the media , the government , industry , ... ) , and are trying to destroy the lives of us ordinary folk .
They 're cheering the meltdown they orchestrated because they want people to suffer and they want to destroy capitalism and introduce Cuban - style Communism .
Democrats are happy to raise income taxes because they are so rich they live on unearned income .
The way Ayers , Acorn , Obama , and the rest engineered the crisis was by intimidating banks so that they gave subprime mortgages to illegal immigrants , shiftless blacks and hispanics , etc. , and it 's left for us hard - working god- fearing white working folk to pick up the burden .
And on and on .
I 'm old enough to barely remember Nazi speeches .
Very similar .
The US , and the world , is lucky that no charismatic figure has arisen here .
McCarthy was too much of a thug .
Reagan a clown .
W. Bush could n't walk across the street without falling into a manhole .
Someday one will appear , and we all could be in bad trouble .
UPDATE ( Oct. 14 ) : I sent two follow - up questions to Chomsky , and he responded as follows :
PJ : Did you feel the same way about Ron Paul ?
What do you think of him ?
NC : No , Paul was very different from Palin .
I agreed with his positions on lots of things , but in general his views would be catastrophic if implemented , I think .
One reason he does n't stand a chance .
The business world would never allow it .
PJ : And Dennis Kucinich , what about him ?
NC : Kucinich is a very decent person , with generally reasonable positions , I think .
Which is why he does n't stand a chance in a business - run sociopolitical system .
( I had a chance to exchange emails with Chomsky before , just before William F. Buckley Jr. passed away .
You can read that exchange here . )

Very interesting responses you were able to elicit from Chomsky .
Well done .
It 's rear to get him to discuss presidential elections and considering he 's favored Nader openly , it was interesting to hear his " support " for Obama , albeit ' conditionally ' .
Posted by : Ryan Thomson | 2008-10-12 3:12:22 AM
Jaws ,
That 's pretty interesting stuff .
I do n't read much Chomsky - well , ever , really - but I have to say I agree with what he says here .
I think he might overstate the degree of the fascist tendencies of the radical right , but I agree they are there .
The lynch mobs McCain and Palin have had coming out at town halls ( and even the PUMA anger before that ) shows that some people are just waiting for a leader to hand out the pitchforks and torches .
As for voting , well , we all know one vote does not make a difference .
But if I lived in a swing state , I 'd put up an Obama lawn sign .
In a safe state ( whether safe R or safe D ) I think I 'd put up a Babar the elephant lawn sign ( http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/stories/2008/06/04/bob_barr_colbert.html ) .
You gotta make room for fun !
And ( in reference to your previous post ) if I lived in Stephen Harper 's riding , I 'd put up a Dennis Young lawn sign .
Or a Dennis DeYoung sign .
Why ?
Because he 's there for you whenever you get weary and you 've had enough and feel like giving up !

Lynch mobs ?!
A literal handful of people out of thousands of supporters equates to " lynch mobs " ?
Meanwhile , Obama has been a practicing fascist for decades ( he himself - - not just his nutty supporters ) and , yawn , nothing to see here .
It 's posts like this why people do n't take libertarians ( big " L " libertarians ) like you guys even remotely seriously .

There 's one question that still has n't been answered .
After the Democrats demonized ‘ greedy ' Wall Street , why is it that a higher percentage of Democrats voted for the bailout package than did Republicans ?
All we have to do is look at John McCallum to understand that Canadian bankers , as well as US bankers , understand they can profit from liberal values .
It was an admirable goal to get minorities into houses , when they were being turned down for mortgages even though payments could have been supported by income .
That 's unfair discrimination .
Politically , when home ownership became a ‘ civil right ' rather than a matter of contract law , it was inevitable that the house of cards would collapse at some point .
ACORN is now being investigated for voter registration fraud in several states .
The CO in ACORN stands for ‘ community organizers ' .
In Canada , we take for granted the integrity of our voter lists .
Such is not the case in the US , obviously .

It is not admirable to lend money to people who can't pay it back .
It 's stupid and disasterous .
This is typical lefty moral - high - ground bullshit that 's sinks countries into an economic abyss .
Lefties are good at giving hugs , not managing economies .

I can not take a person like Chomsky seriously .
He represents the most diabolical political philosophy devised and you guys put him on your blog .

Quit the rhetoric , Gord .
How about attacking his points ?
He 's concluded the same thing I have a few years ago - That there is no marked difference between the right and left .
Both attack people 's economic and personal freedoms .
They are both big government powerhouses .
That 's why I'm a Libertarian .

Chomsky is a very deranged and hate filled man , including self - hatred and hatred for his country .
Why he does not leave for a better place , such as Cuba says a lot .
Therefore it is not surprising that he would support Obama who most represents the destruction of American culture and society .
As for brown shirt mobs you find them in the Obama crowd .
Let us not forget either the threat that if Obama does not win , it will be due to white racism which will results in riots across the country .
I agree with SYFs comments with one exception concerning the mortgages , for attitude has it right on that one .

I remember Chomsky denying that the killing fields of Cambodia even existed .
He swore they were a CIA fabrication until finally even the Khmer Rouge admitted it openly .
Then he simply switched to blaming it on the US because we MADE them feel threatened , so of course they had to slaughter anyone with a university education .
Chomsky 's a nut .

This race baiting has got to stop !
A lot of people got mortgages for properties they could not afford .
It 's not that they could not afford any home , they could not afford the homes they were buying !
These people were not ' shiftless ' no matter their color .
They simply believed , or were led to believe , they could afford more real estate than they actually could .
I would be willing to bet more whites fell into this trap than any other group .
But calling out the realtors and banks for their role in this fiasco is NOT RACIST .
It has nothing to do with race .

attitude :
I think we 're in agreement that the fundamental attitude for the US financial crisis was developed by both main parties in the interest of social justice .
Where it went wrong was when the idea of home ownership became a ‘ right ' that was backed up by the state via Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , thereby absolving lending institutions the responsibility of following contract law .
Unfortunately , the hard - working taxpayer got stuck holding the bag on a politically - correct policy of creating equal outcomes .
The American Dream is about equal opportunity .
Marxism is about equal outcomes .
As screwed up as Canada is , this country has not been as stupid about the difference as a succession of US governments have .

I agree with some of the above comments .
Chomsky is beyond the pale - the moral equivalent of the KKK , the Nazis or the Communists .
Among his many sins - claiming that the Vietnamese Communists were not engaged in mass murder after the fall of Saigon .
And then denying the existence of those who tried to flee the slaughter ( the boat people ) .
No website that cares about liberty should be giving him any space at all .
The guy is really evil .

Hey Attitude , Chomsky thinks there is no difference between Republicans and Democrats because he is a Communist ( Far leftist ) .
Over the years , he has made excuses for the crimes of the Khmer Rouge and other communist states .
He excuses the actions of numerous Communist criminals ( responsible for 50 million + deaths ) .
To a Communist , almost everyone else is in the backpocket of big business .
Perhaps Factcheck you could explain to me how someone who would support Canada 's libertarian party would support Obama .
Obama has called for increased spending and will raise taxes .
Also , he has ( in the past ) voted for a handgun ban and numerous other gun restrictions .
Finally , this radical right lynch mob bit is garbage .
You want to see real hate look at the left .
This might be hard to do since the radical left in Canada has long had control of the media , education system , and government bureaucracy .
In America , the left is bitter because ( unlike Canada ) the country ( since 1980 ) has generally been pushed to the right .
Conservative Americans ( like myself ) despise Obama because he wants to raise taxes ( believe me it wo n't only be the rich ) , hike spending , close Guantanamo ( so will McCain ) , hogtie us in gathering information on terrorists , is a big gun control guy , supports affirmative action , wants no restrictions on abortion , has a friends ' list of far left nuts ( Ayers , FLagger , Wright , etc. ) and until the last debate oppose both oil drilling and nuclear power .
We think Obama 's a liar and want to defeat him at the ballot box .
The radical left is this country has mocked McCain , Palin , and Bush from day one .
The left has even tried to say that McCain lied about his time as a POW .
One far - left group said that he collaborated and was treated well .
All the other POWs disagree with this .
Some leftist commentators even joke about McCain 's permanent injuries .
Palin has also been attacked viciously from day one .
A leftist comedian ( Sandra Bernhard ) even joked about Palin being raped .
Sicko .
The far left mocked Reagan when he died .
In 1998 , Alec Baldwin called for a prominent Republican leader to be stoned to death during Clinton 's impeachment hearing .
Sadly , many members of the leftist audience clapped and applauded .
So where is the real hate ?
You should know better .
In Canada , the left plays the same games .

I would also guess that the majority of you guys calling Chomsky down have n't even read a book of his .
Instead you get quotes from some radical right website .
I certainly agree that he goes too far sometimes , but he has it right about the Rich and Corporations controlling the western world .

Posted by : peteb | 2008-10-14 3:24:09 PM
There is no left in the mainstream US political landscape .
You have a centre - right candidate , Obama , and a far - right , McCain / Palin .
I warmly recommend that people consider staying in the centre - right , as the moral and physical cost of the far right is almost unbearable , as we have seen in recent weeks .
Obama does not qualify as a socialist , let alone a Marxist ( I see someone also threw in references to a fascist which is not even funny ) .
If you want to see a left wing candidate , check out Brian Moore .
" Socialism is a new social and economic order in which workers and consumers control production and community residents control their neighborhoods , homes , and schools .
The production of society is used for the benefit of all humanity , not for the private profit of a few .
Socialism produces a constantly renewed future by not plundering the resources of the earth . "
That does not sound like the Democrats to me - nor to most Republicans from what I read of their comments .
These are radical left wing sentiments .
Obama is not left wing .

There is a lot of hysteria and misinformation here -- too much to debunk in several paragraphs .
To take a single point : Chomsky did not " deny [ ] that the killing fields of Cambodia even existed " .
If you actually read his book on the subject , you will see that he documented the fact that IN THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE KHMER ROUGE TAKEOVER , the U.S. mainstream media grossly exaggerated the killings by the Khmer Rouge .
As explained , within months after the Khmer Rouge takeover in April 1975 , the number of " 2 million " dead was quickly seized upon by the U.S. mainstream media and repeated over and over again .
In fact , as the CIA documented , the actual figure dead AT THE TIME and as a direct result of Khmer Rouge violence ( assassinations , murder ) was perhaps 10,000 -- a shocking and horrifying number by an measure , but far below anything like 2 million dead .
Meanwhile , the U.S. media virtually ignored the fact that ( again , according to the CIA , and corroborated by Cambodian specialists ) hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were killed by the U.S. bombings in the early 70s , and that the country ( about the size of Missouri ) had been virtually destroyed by years of U.S. bombings ( `3500 + bombing raids ) .
More recent figures indicate that from 1969 until 1975 , 600,000 Cambodians were killed by these aerial assaults .
The CIA also reported that in the aftermath of the collapse of the Lon Nol gov't , it was predicated that 100,000 people would die of starvation , simply due to the wreckage of the country -- again , a direct result of years of U.S. bombings .
Now , as it turns out AFTER the Khmer Rouge took over in April 1975 , the killings continued .
They reached a peak sometime in the late 70s .
Some specialists have concluded that as many as 2 million Cambodians in fact DID die under the Khmer Rouge regime .
Most of those people , died of starvation , disease and exhaustion -- no doubt aided by the Khmer Rouge 's radical agrarian policies and totalitarian labor practices .
Many others died as a result of being killed by the Khmer Rouge .
As Chomsky has repeatedly observed , the fact that as many as 2 million Cambodians were LATER discovered to have died is completely irrelevant to the point he was making regarding the ill - founded estimates circulated by the U.S. media in 1975 , in the wake of the immediate aftermath of the Khmer Rouge takeover .
Even assuming ( contrary to the evidence ) that 2 million Cambodians were killed by the Khmer Rouge in the immediate aftermath of the takeover , the fact is that no information existed at the time sufficient to support a proclamation to that effect .
Furthermore , even if the evidence supported the information being reported by the media ( which it did not ) , that does not excuse the media 's ill - founded assertions .
Accidental accuracy as a result of lying is not the same as telling the truth .
The entire point of Chomsky 's argument in this respect is to show how media coverage of the crimes of official enemies are subject to gross exaggerations , distortions , and outright lies .
Meanwhile , coverage of the crimes of the favored state ( in this case , the U.S. ) are either ignored or receive scant attention .
The fact that the U.S. has a free press makes the failures of the U.S. media all the more unforgivable .

" I heard Chomsky supported a Holocaust denier .
No wonder Ontarians and libertarians like him . "
Chomsky supported the right of a French historian to make public an argument denying the Holocaust .
Chomsky did not endorse the argument itself .
Furthermore , Chomsky only came to the support of the French historian AFTER that person was charged by the French gov't for the crime of falsifying history .
If you have any conception of free speech at all , and if you do not believe that the State should be accorded to right to determine historical truth with the right to prosecute citizens for deviating from historical truth , then you will appreciate the distinction between : ( 1 ) defending a person 's right to the freedom to express a view ; and ( 2 ) defending the view expressed .
If you are incapable of understanding that distinction , then you are either cognitively impaired or engaging in willful ignorance .

I would tend to agree with Chomsky on the Fascist threat .
It is with great hesitance that I join others in using this word that is by now devoid of any reliable lexicon .
However , these people on the right - wing are starting to get desperate .
Some think that makes them pathetic .
Maybe .
But to the other hand it makes them very , very , dangerous .
The sorts of right - wing ideas espoused by " conservative " media are rarely diffused with mantras of peace --- the right - wing does n't have many of those .
Their Gods are jealous Gods , are n't they .
Of course I accuse them of what they 're accusing Obama and company of .
The difference --- let me say there is one --- is that doctrines on the right side tend to prescribe violence far more frequently .
That 's the point I 'd like to reverberate .
I hear their bark .
I see their teeth .

The comments to this entry are closed .
The Supreme Court yesterday substantially diminished Americans ' right to privacy in their own homes .
The rule that police officers must " knock and announce " themselves before entering a private home is a venerable one , and a well - established part of Fourth Amendment law .
But President Bush 's two recent Supreme Court appointments have now provided the votes for a 5 - 4 decision eviscerating this rule .
This decision should offend anyone , liberal or conservative , who worries about the privacy rights of ordinary Americans .
The case arose out of the search of Booker T. Hudson 's home in Detroit in 1998 .
The police announced themselves but did not knock , and after waiting a few seconds , entered his home and seized drugs and a gun .
There is no dispute that the search violated the knock - and - announce rule .
The question in the case was what to do about it .
Mr. Hudson wanted the evidence excluded at his trial .
That is precisely what should have happened .
Since 1914 , the Supreme Court has held that , except in rare circumstances , evidence seized in violation of the Constitution cannot be used .
The exclusionary rule has sometimes been criticized for allowing criminals to go free just because of police error .
But as the court itself recognized in that 1914 case , if this type of evidence were admissible , the Fourth Amendment " might as well be stricken . "
