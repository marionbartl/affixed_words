Amid crumbling security , Pentagon likely to extend surge Andrew Bielak
Published : Saturday April 21 , 2007 Print This Email This Hoping to cede greater control over Iraq to its own security forces , American military and civilian leaders have begun to notify Iraqi officials that US involvement is not open - ended and could see a drawback in numbers if the situation does not improve .
Despite offering dire warnings , however , the Pentagon has given all indications that the current surge in troops levels could easily be extended to acommodate worsening violence throughout Iraq .
Examining a central dilemma facing the country 's political leadership , Associated Press military writer John Burns notes , " If political progress is not possible in the relatively short term , then the justification for sending thousands more U.S. troops to Baghdad  and accepting the rising U.S. combat death toll that has resulted  will disappear . "
With violence claiming hundreds of lives this week in Baghdad alone and a solid majority of Americans opposing the war , the question has increasingly become whether there is logic in committing more soldiers to a cause that , to many , is already lost .
So far , slightly more than half of the 21,500 troops being utilized in the escalation are in Iraq , with the remaining soldiers set to arrive by June .
In previous months , government officials had indicated that troop levels could be reduced to previous levels by September .
As Burns notes , thess predictions were made under the assumption that the operation would prove to be a clear cut success or failure within its first few months .
For many critics of the war , the unrelenting pace of violence claiming lives in Baghdad and throughout the rest of the country proves that it already has .
Two months into the surge , as violence in Iraq remains high and ethnic tensions continue to boil , American leaders have started to express impatience with the Iraq government 's inability to contain the chaos .
Speaking during a visit to Iraq this week , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said " the clock is ticking , " and today stated that the results of the surge so far have been " mixed . "
But despite expressing dissatisfaction , officials have not indicated any plans to draw down the surge in the near future .
" The U.S. should definitely keep up the pressure on the Iraqis , but we should have no illusions , " Anthony Cordesman , an Iraq watcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said on Friday .
Frederick Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute , a strong supporter of the surge and one of the chief architects of the surge strategy , sees a hint of ambivalence behind the Pentagon 's plans : " They seem to be taking the steps that would make it possible to sustain it for longer , which is good .
But they seem to be reluctant to commit to a willingness to do that , which I think is unfortunate . "

Directors of nearly 700,000 companies , including all listed , unlisted and private firms , will have to obtain a director identification number .
This is required for the ministry of company affairs ' e-governance project that will be implemented across the country in April .
" If directors do not have a DIN , they will not be recognised and their companies will not be able to file documents online , " Company Affairs Minister Prem Chand Gupta said today .
Gupta added that the " MCA 21 e- governance " project required directors to submit an application with a certified proof of identity , including their permanent account number .
The MCA 21 project will kick off from Coimbatore on February 18 and will be rolled out in Delhi by March .
" Although a PAN is not mandatory but once we receive the applications , we can easily find out those directors who have not submitted their PAN numbers , " a ministry official said .
The government can use a DIN to find out , for the first time , whether a company director is complying with the provisions of the Companies Act , 1956 .
The Act allows a person to be a director in a maximum of 15 companies and a managing director in only one ( two , if the position is in a private company or in a subsidiary of a public company ) .
The impact of this move will be visible in the next three years .
This is because manual filing will still continue for a smooth transition to the online filing system .
During this period , 53 special kiosks will be set up to facilitate e-filing .
While the Securities and Exchange Board of India 's MAPIN database only records details of 8,000 - odd listed companies , the ministry 's project will cover India Inc .
Directors will be required to have digital signatures to use e-filing facilities .
As part of the Rs 345 - crore e-governance project , executives who require to sign documents on behalf of their firms will also have to get a DIN .
" Records of listed and unlisted public companies will be available for online viewing , " the official added .
In a broader sense , the move to create what is essentially a preferred class of e-mail is a major change in the economics of the Internet .
Until now , senders and recipients of e-mail -- and , for that matter , Web pages and other information -- each covered their own costs of using the network , with no money changing hands .
That model is different from , say , the telephone system , in which the company whose customer places a call pays a fee to the company whose customer receives it .
The prospect of a multitiered Internet has received a lot of attention recently after executives of several large telecommunications companies , including BellSouth and AT& T , suggested that they should be paid not only by the subscribers to their Internet services but also by companies that send large files to those subscribers , including music and video clips .
Those files would then be given priority over other data , a change from the Internet 's basic architecture which treats all data in the same way .
This Tuesday the Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing to consider legislation for what has been called Net neutrality -- effectively banning Internet access companies from giving preferred status to certain providers of content .
The concern is that companies that do not pay could find it hard to reach customers or attract new ones , threatening the openness of the Internet .
AOL and its parent , Time Warner , which also owns a large cable system offering high - speed Internet access , have not taken a public stand on the principle of Net neutrality .
Neither has Yahoo , which has close relationships with AT& T and Verizon .
The issue of e-mail postage has not yet come up in the debate over Net neutrality .
In the next two months , AOL will start accepting e-mail processed by Goodmail Systems , a company in Mountain View , Calif. , that will collect the electronic postage and verify the identity of the sender .
Goodmail has tested the system with the participation of a few companies , including the American Red Cross and The New York Times .
Paying senders will be assured that their messages will be delivered to AOL users ' main in - boxes and marked as " AOL Certified E - Mail . "
Unpaid messages will be subject to AOL 's spam - filtering process , which diverts suspicious messages to a special spam folder .
Most of these messages will also not be displayed with their original images and links .
Yahoo will start trying out Goodmail 's system in coming months , but it has not decided how paid mail will be differentiated from unpaid , said Brad Garlinghouse , vice president of communications products at Yahoo .
Goodmail will charge 1 / 4 cent to 1 cent per message , with high - volume mailers getting the biggest discounts .
It will give more than half of that amount to the e-mail service provider .
Goodmail does not envision that individuals will need to pay to have their e-mail delivered to Yahoo or AOL accounts .
When AOL started to explain the details of its plan last month to companies that send a lot of e-mail , many quickly raised objections .

Nano paddle could , in principle , cool a pool of molecules .
Just the thing to keep your nano beers cold : an idea for the smallest refrigerator in the world .
The proposal comes from a pair of theoretical physicists , who admit that it would take some spectacularly cunning molecular engineering to make their device a reality .
But for now , Chris Van den Broeck from Hasselt University in Belgium and Ryoichi Kawai of the University of Alabama at Birmingham , say the odd trick in their idea will set thermodynamics researchers thinking .
Their proposed device relies on the random jittering of molecules known as brownian motion , named after the botanist Robert Brown , who , in 1827 spotted that bits of pollen under a microscope would not stop jigging around .
In general , the faster the molecules move , the higher their temperature .
The proposed miniature refrigerator uses a tiny paddle wheel to speed up the molecules in one pool , thereby sucking the energy out of a neighbouring one .
The idea comes close to an amusing thought experiment proposed by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in the nineteenth century : Maxwell said an imaginary demon might be able to make one pot of molecules hotter and another colder by strategically opening and closing a portal between the two , allowing only the faster , hotter molecules through .
But Van den Broeck and Kawai propose something slightly more achievable than using a demon .
Spin me round
Their idea essentially reverses a previous notion physicists have had about how to use two pools with different temperatures to make a mini motor .
Spin me round : the top paddle faces more resistance from surrounding molecules when spun counter - clockwise .
Imagine a vertical shaft that connects a bottom wheel with flat paddles , and a top one with wedge - shaped paddles ( see picture ) ; the two paddles are sitting in different pools of molecules that are separated by an insulating barrier .
If the bottom pool were very hot , with molecules whizzing around , and the top one sedately cool , then the bottom paddle would get whacked quite often by particles , sending it spinning in either direction .
When the wheel is sent spinning counter - clockwise , the top paddle thwacks into surrounding molecules with its blunt edge , which slows the wheel down .
But when it spins clockwise , the top paddle slices through the molecular soup with its sharp edge providing less resistance .
So , after lots of collisions striking the bottom paddle , the wheel would be expected to make a net movement clockwise .
Upside down
Van den Broeck and Kawai have simply turned this idea on its head .
In their model , the two pools start out at the same temperature .
Then a motor is used to drive the bottom paddle wheel around counter - clockwise .
One principle of thermodynamics says that the system will respond by trying to induce a counteractive force in a clockwise direction .
As just described , this can happen if the bottom pool gets much hotter than the top one .
The intriguing thing is that the researchers calculate , using standard equations of thermodynamics , that this can not only heat up the bottom pool , but actually cool the top one down .
Cool stuff
Although this result falls out of the maths , it is n't clear exactly how the molecules behave in a way that actually slows down their motion in the top pool .
" If it were easy to understand , people would have found this much earlier , " says Van den Broeck .
" You can't explain it by hand waving ; it 's a statistical thing . "
The concept , now available on arXiv1 , is scheduled for publication in Physical Review Letters .
" It 's not a big effect — actually , it 's minute , " notes Anders Kastberg , a physicist at Umeå University , Sweden .
" But you have to start somewhere .
It 's a cute idea and a new mechanism as far as I know . "
ADVERTISEMENT
It may be some time before your nano beers reach optimum temperature , however .
Making a device to drive a mini wheel around would be particularly tricky .
Van den Broeck suggests that lasers or magnets might be used , but he admits that 's on the borderline of what is feasible .
" I like theoreticians , " laughs Kastberg .
" They do n't have to bother about reality . "

How dumb do you have to be to mint money at a loss ?
In the latest only - in - Washington episode , we find that the government may have lost as much as $ 40 million coining pennies and nickels last year .
The metal in them — the zinc , copper and nickel — has soared in value in the last few years , making the coins more valuable as raw materials than they are as currency .
The government reaction has been to ban the melting of the coins to get the metal .
But there is a good chance that we will find ourselves in an outright coin shortage of a form we have not seen in four decades and one that harks back to the monetary problems of medieval times .
In their landmark book on monetary history , “ The Big Problem of Small Change , ” two economists , Thomas J. Sargent of New York University and François R. Velde of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago , point out that before the 20th century , the value of coins came from the material they contained : silver or gold .
In the words of economics , it was “ commodity money . ”
But as the price of silver or gold increased , people pulled the coins from circulation .
These shortages are a basic problem with commodity money and began almost as early as Charlemagne ’s minting of the first silver penny around 800 A.D .
EXPECT to be bombarded with reasons why , if you 've not done so already , you should buy a high - definition television set during the coming holiday season .
By the end of the festivities makers will hope to have turned at least one in three American home - owners ( up from one in ten in 2004 ) into the proud owner of a new super - telly displaying breath - taking pictures with pin-sharp images and pristine sound .
The set - makers and big - box retailers emphasise three reasons why couch potatoes should buy an HDTV set now .
What they are failing to mention , of course , is the one good reason to wait awhile .
The first reason to buy is that prices have fallen dramatically over the past year — down another 30 % after a similar drop the year before .
Sets may continue to get cheaper , but the really big falls have probably worked their way through , as manufacturers have ironed the last wrinkles out of their production processes .
An American shopper can expect to find a wafer - thin 37 - inch liquid - crystal display ( LCD ) set for little more than $ 1,000 .
Barely thicker 42 - inch sets with plasma display panels ( PDP ) are going for around $ 1,500 , and somewhat fatter 50 - inch digital light - processor ( DLP ) versions for less than $ 2,000 .
Another argument for taking the plunge is that big improvements have been made to all three display technologies used in modern HDTV receivers .
Today 's LCD models produce strong blacks , in place of the wishy - washy greys of a few years back , and there is much less in the way of ghost - like trails when images move rapidly across the screen .
Plasma models have overcome the “ burn - in ” problem that left the outline of stationary images etched into a PDP screen .
Better still , the life expectancy of PDP screens , once their biggest drawback , now matches that of the best of the traditional cathode - ray tube sets .
A third reason to buy now , say boosters , is the flood of high - definition content hitting the market .
The number of American television networks offering high - definition programming has increased ten - fold , to 55 , in the past four years .
Then there 's the arrival of high - definition video players such as Toshiba 's $ 500 HD - DVD machine and Sony 's $ 1,000 Blu-ray rival , both of which were launched with a stack of movies on high - definition DVDs .
Video - game consoles , such as Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony 's PlayStation 3 , have gone high - definition as well .
AP
Do you have it in a larger size ?
To see this new high - definition content at its best , you need a television set that paints its picture with no less than 720 lines ( and preferably 1080 lines ) running across the screen from top to bottom .
( Ordinary television sets in North America and Japan have 525 lines , while those in Europe and elsewhere use 625 lines . )
But picture quality depends not only on line count .
Broadcasters can beam their high - definition signals one complete frame at a time in a so - called “ progressive scan ” .
Alternatively , they can use the old cheap - skate method of sending first only the odd lines in the picture for one frame , and then the even lines for the next frame , and so on .
The aim of “ interlacing ” like this is to trick the brain into thinking that it 's seeing the whole picture all the time , though only half is available at any instant .
Unfortunately , the brain is n't conned completely .
Moving objects , in particular , tend to be seen as images with jagged edges .
Also , the interlacing produces an irritating flicker that can induce eye - strain and headaches .
That 's why computer monitors long ago swapped interlacing for progressive scanning .
Broadcasters have been pushing 720 lines progressive ( 720 p ) for high - definition sports programmes that include lots of moving objects , and 1080 interlaced ( 1080i ) for everything else .
Both , they say , are good enough for what they have to do .
But good enough is the enemy of better still .
Anyone who has seen a 1080 - line progressive - scan display knows there 's no comparison .
And what the shills are n't saying is that stunning and affordable 1080 p sets are in the works .
Those who buy HDTV models offering only today 's interim standards will be kicking themselves in six months .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Republican Rep. Bob Ney of Ohio pleaded guilty Friday to federal charges in the congressional investigation into corruption and bribery involving disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff , according to the Justice Department .
Ney pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements in a deal in which he will cooperate with the Justic Department 's influence peddling investigation .
The plea deal was filed Friday morning in U.S. District Court in Washington .
Ney is required to " to make a full , accurate and complete disclosure " to prosecutors , but Ney 's lawyer said he expects
Ney will not be asked questions outside the circumstances of the charges .
( Watch how Ney got a round of golf at St. Andrews and free meals -- 1:51 )
The maximum sentence for the two counts is 10 years , but the Justice Department and Ney 's lawyers agreed on a sentencing recommendation of 27 months in prison , provided Ney continues to provide truthful information .
The final sentence will be determined by a federal judge .
Ney could also be fined up to $ 500,000 , according to the agreement .
Rep .
Ney asks that positive actions be remembered as well
In a written statement , Ney apologized to his family , his Ohio constitutents and his House colleagues , saying he accepted the deal " to start repairing the damage I have caused and to start healing my family . "
" I know that this plea agreement will probably forever change the way people view my public service , " Ney wrote .
" I regret this very much because I hope and believe that I have helped people through my work , and I hope that someday the good I have tried to do will be measured alongside the mistakes I have made . "
Ney entered an alcohol rehabilitation facility earlier this week and did not appear in court Friday , according to one of the sources .
Ney , who had steadfastly denied any wrongdoing , has been under investigation for many months as part of the government probe into corruption , fraud and bribery by Abramoff .
" Congressman Ney and his co-conspirators engaged in a long - term pattern to defraud the public of the unbiased and honest services of an elected official , " Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher said .
First member of Congress to plead guilty in the case
Ney is the first member of Congress to plead guilty in the extensive investigation .
He has previously said he took no official actions as a result of any gifts from lobbyists .
Abramoff and his business partner , public relations executive Michael Scanlon , pleaded guilty within the last year to bribery charges and admitted they supplied gifts to a member of Congress identified publicly only as " Representative 1 . "
In court filings , they said the gifts were in exchange for help from the lawmaker on behalf of their clients , including support for specific bills ; meetings with their clients ; advancing in the House of Representatives an application of one of their clients for a license to install a wireless telephone infrastructure ; and placing statements in the Congressional Record regarding a Florida casino deal .
Government sources previously told CNN that lawmaker was Ney .
In exchange for his actions , Ney and his staff allegedly received , according to previous court filings in the case , a golf trip to Scotland , meals at restaurants , tickets to sporting events and campaign contributions .
Several aides to Ney had received subpoenas as part of the probe in the last several months , which seemed to indicate a focus on him .
Ney , who gave up his chairmanship of the House Administration Committee after the Abramoff plea deal , decided in August to abandon his campaign for re-election , which had been dogged by questions about his dealings with Abramoff .
In May , Ney 's former chief of staff , Neil Volz , also entered into a deal in which he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud .
In court papers , prosecutors alleged Ney " agreed to take favorable official action and render other assistance on behalf of clients " of Abramoff , who hired Volz as a lobbyist after he left Ney 's staff .
CNN 's Kevin Bohn and John Roberts contributed to this report .
The teenage girl who hosted a disastrous " let 's trash my house " party was arrested yesterday on suspicion of causing criminal damage .
Rachael Bell , 17 , was questioned by detectives then released on police bail , pending further inquiries , after she emerged from hiding to blame internet hackers for the £ 20,000 chaos , and to apologise profusely to her parents .
She accused schoolfriends of taking over her pages on the website MySpace to tempt revellers from all over the country with the prospect of drink and sex in an astonished cul - de-sac on a private estate in county Durham .
She said she was too scared to face her mother , Elaine , and father , Alan , who have been forced to rent temporary housing and are pressing for criminal charges against partygoers .
But although she spoke to her mother by phone , her remorse was undermined by the appearance of a message ascribed to her on a friend 's MySpace site saying : " haaa ... well i hope u liked the party ... was fuckin wild like !!!!
hmmm another lol ??? xx " ( lol standing for laugh out loud ) .
The 17 - year - old 's apology claimed she had suffered a panic attack when she realized what was happening to her secret plans for a relatively modest do .
Although her parents , who had gone for a caravan weekend with her sister and two brothers , had forbidden guests while they were away , she admitted asking round 60 friends and a couple of DJs .
" It was just supposed to be a party with a few friends and it turned into a complete nightmare .
I 'm sorry , mam , " she said .
" It was so surreal - it still seems surreal .
You just can't imagine anything like it happening .
I 'm really , really sorry , I absolutely regret everything .
I still have n't properly slept , I just keep waking up and thinking about what happened . "
The party led to pandemonium in Woodstone village , near Houghton - le - Spring , as seven police cars , including a dog unit , sealed off the street and tried to cope with drunken teenagers - and allegedly some children as young as 11 - until after 4 am .
Enraged neighbours with golf clubs chased partygoers , who had arrived from as far away as London , blocking the cul - de-sac with minibuses and cars .
Mrs Bell said yesterday that the £ 230,000 house felt " as though it had been raped " , with vomit , graffiti and urine on floors , clothes and beds .
Her other children 's things had been trashed in an apparent copycat version of an incident on Channel 4's teen soap Skins .
Fighting back tears , the 48 - year - old teacher told Sky News : " A huge tragedy has happened here and I want people prosecuted for what has been done .
That house has been torn apart .
" Rachel has got to take blame for organising the party in the first place .
I can imagine she is in an awful mental state and fear she could do something to herself .
But I do n't know the full story and whether it was 200 or 300 people . "
Mrs Bell has turned down offers of up to £ 5,000 to speak exclusively about the incident and , although distraught , she gave a tour of the wrecked rooms to the Press Association for all media outlets to share .
She said she always kept the house " immaculate " and had left it in that condition .
Her last words to Rachael were : " I do n't want any kids or drink in the house . "
Rachael , a sixth former doing A - levels at Park View school in Chester - le - Street , has a reputation for mild controversy , picturing herself on MySpace in Goth gear and with a can of lager , and scattering swear words through her entries about " hating " normal people .
But she said yesterday the situation had completely overwhelmed her and phrases on MySpace such as " Let 's trash the average family - sized house disco party " were hackers ' work , not hers .
" The party was n't supposed to start until 10 o'clock , but at half nine we saw people pulling up in cars , " she said from a friend 's house where she is staying indefinitely .
" We did n't recognise them and did n't know what was going on so we bolted the door - but they just started climbing through the window .
" There were even 11 - year - olds , year sevens from our school , trying to get in .
I just had a panic attack because of everything that was going on , just because I was so powerless to stop it . "
She claimed some of the gatecrashers had pretended to police that they lived in the house , but there some " nice people " who had tried to help .
She said : " Actually , a lot of people even came back on the morning to help me try and tidy the place up .
I thought I had a couple of days to clean the house before my parents got back .
Then an ex-neighbour came and told me my mam was on her way home and everyone had better clear out - and I left . "
" Reviews " of the party have started to appear on the internet , including one from a 19 - year - old called Emily from Newcastle who talks about boys she met at the party , saying : " I was on a field with one of these people and in a bedroom with the other haha stunners . x "
A Durham police spokesman said the trouble was difficult to contain as guests had been invited into the house .
He said : " Inquiries are under way and we plan to speak to as many of the partygoers as we can . "
MySpace Messages
A message at the MySpace site about the party , left on Wednesday at 12.10 ( all spellings as on the website )
heyyy , have you heard anything from the party or have any updates .
just apparantly we have some info that there was press there this mornin , talk of the woods is that there was helipcopters n cctv vans around the estate on the night but i was in the house then so i dunno
A reply , apparently from Rachel Bell , avatar pictured above , left on Wednesday 12.38
haaa i no was 'nt in any other photo's !!
ekkk well i hope u liked the party .. was fuckin wild like !!! hmmm another lol ??? xx
Silent Patriot : On " The O'Reilly Factor " last night , BillO accused Moyers of taking his words out of context in order to make an ideological point , then proceeded to take bits and pieces of Moyers ' documentary to make .... an ideological point .
When FOX News Contributor Jane Hall points out that while Moyers probably should have included his preceeding remarks , the clip really is contextual and he was only a small part of an overall important and wonderful documentary , O'Reilly cuts her off and goes ballistic .

It 's really funny how BillO seizes on 8 seconds of a 90 minute documentary to discredit Moyers .
Had he watched the entire thing he would know why ( a ) Moyers is more of a journalist than he will ever be and ( b ) his portrayal in the film is accurate .
I wo n't hold my breath , though .
John Amato : " O'Reilly has been really losing it more than usual lately .
( Remember Geraldo ? )
Good for Jane Hall .
She said Moyers piece was excellent and had nothing to do with O'Reilly .
Bill has added a new tactic .
Attack those who do n't criticize him enough .
Why did n't Bill bring up the point that all his other FOX cohorts refused to go on the program like Kristol and his boss Roger Ailes ? "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Chiquita Brands International entered a plea agreement with federal authorities on charges that it engaged in transactions with a terrorist organization .
The company agreed to pay a $ 25 million fine regarding the investigation of protection payments made by the company 's former banana - producing subsidiary in Colombia .
Federal authorities charged banana giant Chiquita with ties to terrorist organizations .
Shares of Chiquita ( up $ 0.25 to $ 12.75 , Charts ) fell nearly 1 percent in after - hours trading on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday .
The announcement came moments after U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeffrey Taylor accused the Cincinnati - based banana producer with paying - through its Colombia subsidiary Banadex - a right - wing paramilitary group in Urab� and Santa Marta , two areas of Colombia where Chiquita grew bananas .
" From in or about 1997 though on or about Feb. 4 , 2004 , defendant Chiquita made over 100 payments to the AUC [ United Self - Defense Forces of Colombia ] totaling over $ 1.7 million , " the 17 - page information said .
It said Chiquita had also paid money to two left - wing organizations from about 1989 until about 1997 , when those groups controlled areas where the company grew bananas .
It identified the groups as the FARC ( Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) and the ELN ( National Liberation Army ) .
The company recently pushed back its annual report to amend an agreement with lenders after taking a charge related the federal investigation .
Under the terms of the agreement , the company will pay the fine in five annual installments .
The agreement is subject to approval and acceptance by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia .
Chiquita did not file its annual report by March 1 as required and now expects to file it on March 16 .
It is seeking approval of an amendment with lenders under a June 28 credit agreement , it said .
In a Feb. 22 filing , Chiquita said it had voluntarily disclosed that its Colombian banana - producing subsidiary , which it sold in June 2004 , had made payments to certain groups there that were designated as " foreign terrorist organizations " under U.S. law .
Following the disclosure , the Justice Department initiated a criminal investigation to examine the role and conduct of the company and some of its officers in the matter , the company said in that filing .
Terrorist payments
The company began making the payments after a general manager for Banadex met with the then leader of the AUC , Carlos Casta�o , the information said .
Casta�o told the company 's general manager that the AUC was preparing to drive FARC from Urab� and asked for payments to be made to the AUC through private security companies , the information added .
" Casta�o sent an unspoken but clear message that failure to make the payments could result in physical harm to Banadex personnel and property , " it said .
Senior company executives knew about the payoffs to AUC , the information said .
Though the checks were written to security companies , the companies provided no actual services .
In 2002 , after the U.S. government designated the AUC a terrorist organization , Chiquita began paying the AUC in cash , turning over more than $ 1 million and continuing to pay even after outside counsel told the company that the payments were illegal and should stop immediately , the information said .
In a written statement , Chiquita Brands International 's CEO Fernando Aguirre said the information is part of a plea agreement , " which we view as a reasoned solution to the dilemma the company faced several years ago . "
He said Chiquita voluntarily disclosed the payments to the Justice Department in 2003 , saying they were made " to protect the lives of its employees . "
He added , " The company made this disclosure shortly after senior management became aware that these groups had been designated as foreign terrorist organizations under a U.S. statute that makes it a crime to make payments to such organizations .
Since voluntarily disclosing this information , Chiquita has continued to cooperate with the DOJ 's investigation . "

The recent revelations about illegal eavesdropping on American citizens by the U.S. National Security Agency have raised many questions about just what the agency is doing .
Although the facts are just beginning to emerge , information that has come to light about the NSA 's activities and capabilities over the years , as well as the recent reporting by the New York Times and others , allows us to discern the outlines of what they are likely doing and how they are doing it .
President Chavez was a guest of the mayor in May 2006
The mayor of London said the agreement will help provide half - price bus and tram travel to some 250,000 Londoners on income support .
The deal follows discussions between Mr Livingstone and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
Mr Livingstone signed the deal at a ceremony in City Hall .
Representatives from the Venezuelan government and the oil company Petróleos de Venezuela Europa ( PDVE ) were at the ceremony .
" Third - rate dictator "
" This agreement will benefit up to a quarter of a million of the lowest income Londoners , " Mr Livingstone said .
" Those on income support will be eligible to receive half price bus and tram travel - a benefit worth at least £ 280 - a - year . "
In return , a team of officials from the Greater London Authority will work in Venezuela advising on recycling , waste management , traffic and on reducing carbon emissions .
But Richard Barnes , deputy leader of the London Assembly Conservatives , attacked the deal .
" Why does London , one of the richest capitals in the world , need to exploit a developing nation ?
This money would be better directed at the poor of Venezuela , " he said .

A woman in Oklahoma suffered for twelve years with a growing ovarian tumor that went undiagnosed .
Everytime she went to the doctor , she was told she was just fat and needed to lose weight .
After awhile she stopped going to the doctor .
It was n’t until she ’d become so swollen that the circulation in her legs became compromised and they began to crack and ooze that a doctor finally took her seriously and admitted it was n’t just a problem with “ overeating . ”
During an exploratory surgery they discovered a 93 pound ovarian cyst .
Yet even then , it was compared to a “ big balloon , a big beach ball ” and the news reports wrote mockingly of her walking around with a tumor she did n’t know was there .
Luckily , this woman ’s tumor was benign .
But “ obese ” women have higher death rates from many cancers than “ normal ” weight women .
Several researchers have looked for reasons for this health disparity and have learned it is n’t because of their fat in the way that is popularly believed .

TMZ broke the story that the LA County District Attorney planned to file criminal charges against Haley Joel Osment .
Well , it happened Thursday afternoon .
Osment , 18 , has been charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence of alcohol .
Osment has also been charged with driving with a .08 blood alcohol level or higher , with an enhancement of driving with a .15 or higher .
Osment was also charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana while driving .
Finally , Osment was charged with the infraction of driving under the age of 21 with a blood alcohol level of .05 or higher .
Osment , who was nominated for an Oscar for his role in " The Sixth Sense " at age 11 , lost control of his 1995 Saturn on his way home and collided with a brick pillar in a suburb around 1 a.m. on July 20 .
No bystanders were injured in the wreck , but Osment was n't so lucky : the actor was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was treated for a broken rib and a shoulder injury .
The collision caused the vehicle to flip over onto its roof and come to rest a short distance from the initial impact .
The actor was reportedly alert and talkative following the accident , and was alone at the time of the crash .

As Congress begins to tackle the causes and cures of global warming , the action focuses on gas - guzzling vehicles and coal - fired power plants , not on lowly bovines .
Yet livestock are a major emitter of greenhouse gases that cause climate change .
And as meat becomes a growing mainstay of human diet around the world , changing what we eat may prove as hard as changing what we drive .
It 's not just the well - known and frequently joked - about flatulence and manure of grass - chewing cattle that 's the problem , according to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) .
Land-use changes , especially deforestation to expand pastures and to create arable land for feed crops , is a big part .
So is the use of energy to produce fertilizers , to run the slaughterhouses and meat - processing plants , and to pump water .
" Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today 's most serious environmental problems , " Henning Steinfeld , senior author of the report , said when the FAO findings were released in November .
Livestock are responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse - gas emissions as measured in carbon dioxide equivalent , reports the FAO .
This includes 9 percent of all CO2 emissions , 37 percent of methane , and 65 percent of nitrous oxide .
Altogether , that 's more than the emissions caused by transportation .
The latter two gases are particularly troubling – even though they represent far smaller concentrations in atmosphere than CO2 , which remains the main global warming culprit .
But methane has 23 times the global warming potential ( GWP ) of CO2 and nitrous oxide has 296 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide .
Methane could become a greater problem if the permafrost in northern latitudes thaws with increasing temperatures , releasing the gas now trapped below decaying vegetation .
What 's more certain is that emissions of these gases can spike as humans consume more livestock products .
As prosperity increased around the world in recent decades , the number of people eating meat ( and the amount one eats every year ) has risen steadily .
Between 1970 and 2002 , annual per capita meat consumption in developing countries rose from 11 kilograms ( 24 lbs. ) to 29 kilograms ( 64 lbs. ) , according to the FAO .
( In developed countries , the comparable figures were 65 kilos and 80 kilos . )
As population increased , total meat consumption in the developing world grew nearly five - fold over that period .
Beyond that , annual global meat production is projected to more than double from 229 million tons at the beginning of the decade to 465 million tons in 2050 .
This makes livestock the fastest growing sector of global agriculture .
Animal - rights activists and those advocating vegetarianism have been quick to pick up on the implications of the FAO report .
" Arguably the best way to reduce global warming in our lifetimes is to reduce or eliminate our consumption of animal products , " writes Noam Mohr in a report for EarthSave International .
Changing one 's diet can lower greenhouse gas emissions quicker than shifts away from fossil fuel burning technologies , Mr. Mohr writes , because the turnover rate for farm animals is shorter than that for cars and power plants .
" Even if cheap , zero-emission fuel sources were available today , they would take many years to build and slowly replace the massive infrastructure our economy depends upon today , " he writes .
" Similarly , unlike carbon dioxide which can remain in the air for more than a century , methane cycles out of the atmosphere in just eight years , so that lower methane emissions quickly translate to cooling of the earth . "
Researchers at the University of Chicago compared the global warming impact of meat eaters with that of vegetarians and found that the average American diet – including all food processing steps – results in the annual production of an extra 1.5 tons of CO2 - equivalent ( in the form of all greenhouse gases ) compared to a no -meat diet .
Researchers Gidon Eshel and Pamela Martin concluded that dietary changes could make more difference than trading in a standard sedan for a more efficient hybrid car , which reduces annual CO2 emissions by roughly one ton a year .
" It does n't have to be all the way to the extreme end of vegan , " says Dr. Eshel , whose family raised beef cattle in Israel .
" If you simply cut down from two burgers a week to one , you 've already made a substantial difference . "

If you want to know why and how the vice president ’s chief of staff came to be convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice and now faces up to 20 or so years in jail and a hefty fine , then let ’s go back to the winter of 2005 , when prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald announced Scooter Libby ’s indictment and took questions from the media .
Asked why he was n’t indicting under the terms of the Espionage Act , which makes it a crime to give classified information to persons not entitled to receive it , Fitzgerald explained by giving his famous baseball analogy :
“ Let ’s say a pitcher winds up and hurls a fastball at a batter ’s head , you have to ask , why did the pitcher do it ?
Was it an accident ?
Did he do it out of a grudge or did his fingers slip ?
Did he hit the target or did he aim for the chin and miss ?
You ’d have to look beyond the field , find out what happened in the dugout , see if it might have been retaliation ( did the batter trash - talk the pitcher ’s mama ? ) , or at the end of the day was it just a bad pitch , get over it ? ”
The problem , said Fitzgerald , is that sand had been thrown in the umpire ’s eyes .
That ’s what Scooter Libby did when he lied to a grand jury and to the FBI  he made it impossible to see what had happened and who was behind the outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame .
In the indictment , which contains some interesting language , Fitzgerald characterizes the pattern of deception displayed by Libby ’s testimony as " a corrupt endeavor , " and the uncovering of this corruption is what Fitzgerald was tasked with .
He accomplished this with admirable precision .
This trial revealed the machinations of a Washington network , centered in the vice president ’s office , intent on driving us into a disastrous war no matter what the consequences , even going so far as to endanger American national security .
They had their own agenda , having set up what journalist Bob Woodward , citing Colin Powell , called " a separate government " not answerable to Congress , and operating beneath the radar in most instances .
This was  and is  the " corrupt endeavor " Fitzgerald took on , but the outing of Plame is hardly the full extent of their crimes .
Because when you ask why Cheney and his top aide were so eager to debunk the claims and credibility of Joe Wilson , it all goes back to those infamous " 16 words " in Bush ’s 2003 State of the Union speech , in which he claimed Saddam had been seeking uranium ore in " an African nation " known to be Niger .
This " intelligence , " attributed by Bush to the British , turned out to be sourced to some very odd - looking documents , which were proved to be forgeries .
This is the only instance I know of , prior to the outbreak of the war , when the White House actually made an important retraction regarding the alleged " evidence " for Iraqi WMD .
Who forged those documents  and how did the " intelligence " they contained wind up in the president ’s vitally important State of the Union speech , uttered on the eve of war with Iraq ?
This is a question I ’ll bet many in the White House would like to know the answer to .
Well , this blogger sure has done a lot of research on the matter , and so have these guys .
The origin of the forged Niger uranium documents is a matter that ought to concern both law enforcement agencies and the Congress of the United States , as it involves what appears to be espionage engaged in by parties unknown .
The goal of the conspirators was to provide documentary " evidence " that would make it possible for the administration to play the all - powerful nuclear card and declare that Saddam was rushing to build  and use 
The Bomb .
Fitzgerald has offered to let Congress look at the full record of his investigation , and I ’m wondering how eager they are to jump on this chance to get at the real heart of the Libby case .
Provided , of course , no Democrats are implicated , and no interests they hold dear are hurt
The Niger uranium fable was just one in a whole repertoire of tall tales told by the neocons  in government and the media  to buttress the case for war .
Not just distortions of the truth to suit their war agenda , but stories made up out of whole cloth  like Scooter ’s lie about how Tim Russert told him about Plame ’s CIA job and he " heard it as if for the first time . "
Remember the Mohammed Atta meeting with an Iraqi agent at Prague airport  you know , the one that never really happened ?
This was a story particularly beloved by the vice president ’s office , one that they kept pushing until long after it had been definitively debunked .
Then there was that long line of Iraqi " defectors " and supposed inside sources who knew just where the " weapons of mass destruction " were hidden  in underground bunkers beneath Saddam ’s many palaces , in secret desert compounds , ensconced in mobile units that could unleash chemical and biological terror at a moment ’s notice  not to mention Judith Miller ‘s Iraqi " sources . "
Many if not most of those sources turned out to be either members of or shills for the Iraqi exile group known as the Iraqi National Congress , led by the wheeler - dealer - turned - Iranian - agent Ahmed Chalabi .
In answer to those who blamed him for being the source of much of our completely bogus Iraq " intelligence , " the wily Chalabi , in typical neocon style  i.e. , brazenly contemptuous of truth  characterized himself and his comrades in deception as " heroes in error . "
Kind of like how Scooter was a " hero in error " when " misremembered " an imaginary conversation with Tim Russert and " forgot " about months of plotting to strike back at Joe Wilson .
The Libby trial gave us a glimpse into the inner workings of a truly corrupt endeavor  a well - planned and skillfully executed campaign to lie us into war .
What the Libby trial has shown is that this symphony of disinformation was conducted , personally , by the vice president of the United States  the chief executive of that " separate government " Colin Powell so resented .
This rogue element of the Bush administration was n’t confined to Dick Cheney ’s office ; it had its operational wing in the top civilian echelons of the Pentagon .
It was centered in Doug Feith ’s office of policy , where the neocons essentially set up their own intelligence - gathering outfit , under several different rubrics , and " stovepiped " ( as Sy Hersh put it ) the results directly to the White House via Cheney ’s office .
Fitzgerald has done what he can , and it is up to Congress to take the ball and run with it .
There is plenty here to investigate , and failure to do so will lack any credible explanation .
The Cheney coup d’etat that made the invasion of Iraq possible is , finally , overthrown : that ’s the larger significance of this verdict , and , as such , it is a cause for celebration .
But let ’s not rest on Fitzgerald ’s laurels : it is time , now , for Congress to follow up the plentiful leads provided by the prosecution in this case and expose the neocons ’ corrupt endeavor to the light of day .
Let ’s lift up the rock under which the War Party has been hiding for so long and watch as swarms of uglies pour out  because they can’t live for long in full sunlight .
Exposure neutralizes them : they curl up and die .
Once the web of deception they have woven is swept away , we ’ll finally see the War Party ’s methods and motives  and , believe you me , it wo n’t be a pretty sight .
To get a glimpse of what we ’re in for , if investigations proceed , take a look at the details of a very similar case coming to court this summer  the long - delayed trial of Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman , two top officials of AIPAC , the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group .
In this case , the umpire did n’t get sand thrown in his eyes , because the FBI ’s counterintelligence unit had the bad guys bugged from the beginning .
They watched Larry Franklin , Doug Feith ’s top Iran expert , as he offered Rosen and Weissman access to classified information .
They listened to Rosen  the longtime spark plug behind AIPAC ’s energetic efforts to influence government circles  as he boasted to Weissman what a good catch Franklin was .
They followed the AIPAC duo as they met with Israeli officials , including the then - Israeli ambassador , and passed on classified information of a highly sensitive nature .
This is espionage , and that is precisely what the AIPAC
Two are charged with  although their defenders claim that it is n’t " really " espionage to pass on classified information , and that this is what journalists and others do in Washington all the time .
This defense resembles Scooter ’s in many respects , and for good reason : both cases involve the antics of an ideologically coherent group operating inside the Bush administration , the neocon network run out of Cheney ’s office and extending into the Pentagon .
The story of how the AIPAC defendants were caught , however , brings out a new aspect of the recklessness of the pro-war cabal : how they were and are willing to go to any lengths , including betraying American secrets to a foreign power ( in this case , Israel ) .
This could n’t be more timely  since the classfied information the AIPAC defendants are charged with stealing involves the War Party ’s current target , Iran .
The corrupt endeavor Fitzgerald revealed is a lot bigger than the charges against Scooter  just as the Alger Hiss case encompassed a whole lot more than the perjury charges lodged against the defendant .
Both trials were about the betrayal of vital state secrets , and in both cases the guilty defendant was motivated by ideology .
Naturally , the neocon spin machine is already running in high gear , portraying their boy Scooter as an innocent victim of the " criminalization " of " politics , " the same line they trotted out during the Iran - Contra scandal .
Whether or not he is pardoned , the road is cleared to finally taking out Cheney  albeit not in the way Bill Maher imagined .
Back when this case was just a minor occurrence noticed by few , I predicted that the vice president would eventually be forced to resign , or at least would be cornered into considering that option .
This is still very possible , in spite of the looming prospect of a presidential pardon  and will be made far likelier if Congress does its duty and investigates the key role of the vice president ’s office in corrupting the intelligence - gathering process during the run-up to war .
The " corrupt endeavor " Fitzgerald spoke of is ongoing  they ’re pulling a reenactment of the same song - and - dance in order to gin up a war with Iran  but not if Congress initiates a preemptive strike and takes out the War Party ’s command center .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I ‘m pleased to announce that Philip Giraldi is our newest columnist , and you can check out the first installment here .
He is a former military intelligence and CIA counter - terrorism official who is currently a partner in Cannistraro Associates , the co-publisher of Intelligence Brief , and author of " Deep Background " for The American Conservative magazine .
He has been a source of more than a few good stories , including the administration ’s plans to attack Iran , and I ’ll just say that when Giraldi speaks , I listen .
Memorizing a series of facts is one thing , understanding the big picture is quite another .
Now a new study demonstrates that relational memory — the ability to make logical “ big picture ” inferences from disparate pieces of information – is dependent on taking a break from studies and learning , and even more important , getting a good night ’s sleep .
Led by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) and Brigham and Women ’s Hospital ( BWH ) , the findings appear on - line in today ’s Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
“ Relational memory is a bit like solving a jigsaw puzzle , ” explains senior author Matthew Walker , PhD , Director of the Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory at BIDMC and Assistant Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School ( HMS ) .
“ It ’s not enough to have all the puzzle pieces – you also have to understand how they fit together . ”
Adds lead author Jeffrey Ellenbogen , MD , a postdoctoral fellow at HMS and sleep neurologist at BWH , “ People often assume that we know all of what we know because we learned it directly .
In fact , that ’s only partly true .
We actually learn individual bits of information and then apply them in novel , flexible ways . ”
For instance , if a person learns that A is greater than B and B is greater than C , then he or she knows those two facts .
But embedded within those is a third fact – A is greater than C – which can be deduced by a process called transitive inference , the type of relational memory that the researchers examined in this study .
Earlier research by Walker and colleagues had shown that sleep actively improves task - oriented “ procedural memory ” – for example , learning to talk , to coordinate limbs , musicianship , or to play sports .
Because relational memory is fundamental to knowledge and learning , Walker and Ellenbogen decided to explore how and when this “ inferential ” knowledge emerges , hypothesizing that it develops during “ off - line ” periods and that , like procedural memory , would be enhanced following a period of sleep .
So , the researchers tested 56 healthy college students , each of whom was shown five pairs of unfamiliar abstract patterns – colorful oval shapes resembling Faberge ’ eggs .
The students were then told that some of the patterns were “ correct ” while others were “ incorrect , ” for example , Shape A wins over Shape B , Shape B wins over Shape C , and so on .
All of the students learned the individual pairs but were not told that there was a hidden “ hierarchy ” linking all five of the pairs together .
After a 30 - minute study period , the students were separated into three groups to test their understanding of the larger “ big picture ” relationship between the individual patterns : Group
One was tested after a period of 20 minutes ; Group Two was tested after a 12 - hour period ; and Group Three was tested after a 24 - hour time span .
In addition , approximately half of the students in Group Two slept during the 12 - hour period , while the other half remained awake .
All of the students in Group
Three had a full night ’s sleep .
The test results showed striking differences among the three groups , especially between the students who had a period of sleep and those who remained awake .
“ Group One , the students who were tested soon after their initial learning period , performed the worst , ” says Walker .
“ While they were able to learn and recall the component pieces [ for example , Shape A is greater than Shape B , Shape B is greater than Shape C ] they could not discern the hierarchical relationships between the pieces [ Shape A is greater than Shape C ] – they could n’t yet see ‘ the big picture . ' ”
Groups Two and Three , on the other hand , demonstrated a clear understanding of the interrelationship between the pairs of shapes .
“ These individuals were able to make leaps of inferential judgment just by letting the brain have time to unconsciously mull things over , ” he says .
But , perhaps most notable , he adds , when the inferences were particularly difficult , the students who had had periods of sleep in between learning and testing significantly outperformed the other groups .
“ This strongly implies that sleep is actively engaged in the cognitive processing of our memories , ” notes Ellenbogen .
“ Knowledge appears to expand both over time and with sleep . ”
Concludes
Walker , “ These findings point to an important benefit [ of sleep ] that we had not previously considered .
Sleep not only strengthens a person ’s individual memories , it appears to actually knit them together and help realize how they are associated with one another .
And this may , in fact , turn out to be the primary goal of sleep :
You go to bed with pieces of the memory puzzle , and awaken with the jigsaw completed . ”

Little children never cease to amaze .
University of Washington researchers have found that 18 - month - old toddlers engage in what they call " emotional eavesdropping " by listening and watching emotional reactions directed by one adult to another and then using this emotional information to shape their own behavior .
Writing in the March - April issue of the journal Child Development , which is being published today , Betty Repacholi and Andrew Meltzoff of the UW Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences say the research indicates infants understand other people 's emotional states at a very young age .
" This may be a precursor to ‘ reading ' other people 's minds by understanding their emotional and psychological states , " said Repacholi , an assistant professor of psychology .
" Understanding other people 's emotions is a lifelong skill and is crucial for school readiness .
The fascinating result of this study is how sensitive toddlers are to the emotional dynamics of the interactions around them .
They do n't need to try out a behavior of their own and get rewarded or punished , they can watch what an older brother or sister does and learn from what happens to them , " said Meltzoff , who is co-director of the institute and holds the Job and Gertrud Tamaki endowed chair in psychology .
" This study helps fill in a missing piece , because it shows the children engage in ‘ emotional eavesdropping . '
Children have their emotional antenna up all the time and they learn from eavesdropping on the behaviors of others . "
To test whether infants eavesdrop on adults to pick up emotional clues , the researchers set up two experiments .
The first involved 96 toddlers , the second 72 .
In both experiments there were equal numbers of boys and girls .
The youngsters watched an adult manipulate a toy in both experiments .
Then they watched while a second adult expressed anger or a neutral reaction in response to the first adult playing with a toy .
The infants then were allowed to play with the toy and imitate the first adult 's actions .
At this point in the first experiment the second adult either left the room or quietly sat with a neutral facial expression .
In the second experiment , the second adult either turned her back on the child or silently looked toward the child with a neutral expression .
Repacholi said all of the infants were interested in what the first adult was doing , were leaning forward , making noises and wanting the toy .
But that changed when the second adult expressed anger and remained in the room looking toward the child .
When the second adult reacted neutrally or expressed anger and then either left the room or turned her back the youngsters grabbed the toy within one second .
They also imitated the first adult 's action with the toy 2.5 out of three possible times .
However , when the angry adult remained present and her neutral face was visible the infants hesitated , taking an average of five seconds to take the toy .
They were only successful in imitating the first adult 's action half the time .
The researchers found no gender differences in how the infants reacted .
" This was a real surprise , " said Repacholi .
" Parents usually socialize boys and girls differently and girls are usually more compliant .
It may be that differences in this area will emerge later . "
The experiments are the first demonstration that infants can modify their own behavior in response to an emotional communication that does not involve them .
" There are lots of studies of how the emotions parents directly communicate to their infants have an impact on their behavior .
No one before considered if infants can take in emotional information when directed toward someone else and apply it to themselves , " said Repacholi .
" By observing and analyzing other people 's emotional behavior , infants are able to quickly learn some important lessons .
It is not only an extremely efficient way of looking at the world but is also highly adaptive .
Infants can use emotional eavesdropping to avoid some of the negative consequences that might arise were they to perform an action themselves .
It is also a pretty adaptive way of interpreting what is important and what they can get away with . "

Not satisfied with creating militants abroad , the US has decided to nurture homegrown government haters .
California teenager Julia Wilson has dedicated herself to organising student protests against the Iraq war in an act of retaliation against a firm visit from the Secret Service .
US investigators last week pulled the student out of her classroom for questioning about a MySpace page that showed President Bush being stabbed in the hand with the words " Kill Bush " scribbled above the photo .
Both Wilson and her parents thought the Secret Service 's tactics inappropriate .
" I was n't dangerous , " honours student Wilson told the AP .
" I mean , look at what 's ( stenciled ) on my backpack — it 's a heart .
I 'm a very peace - loving person .
I 'm against the war in Iraq .
I 'm not going to kill the president . "
According to reports , the Secret Service agents – apparently huge MySpace fans – first stopped by the 14 - year - old 's house ( naturally , they would assume that she was a delinquent ) .
The agents contacted Wilson 's mother and then promised to return later when they could interview the lass along with her parents .
Instead , the agents stormed Wilson 's school in Northern California and grilled her for 15 minutes .
" They yelled at me a lot , " she told the newswire .
" They were unnecessarily mean . "
The agents also threatened to haul Wilson off to juvenile hall .
Class acts .
Both Wilson and her parents conceded that the Secret Service agents were right to look into the matter , as threatening the President is illegal .
They , however , thought the deception and verbal rough - up to be over the line .
Wilson now plans to create a new MySpace page to help students organise protests against the Iraq war . ®
Tobacco is linked to a range of health problems
Scientists found no evidence that heavy smokers who halve their daily cigarette intake cut their premature death risk .
The long - term Norwegian study , of more than 51,000 men and women aged between 20 and 34 , found stubbing out was the only way to cut the risk .
The study is published in the journal Tobacco Control .
There is only one safe way out :
To quit smoking entirely
Dr Kjell Bjartveit
The participants were assessed for cardiovascular risk factors at the start of the study , and then monitored for an average period of more than 20 years .
They were classified into various groups , including non-smokers , moderate smokers ( up to 14 cigarettes a day ) , and reducers , who smoked more than 15 cigarettes a day at the start of the study , but who had cut back by more than half by the second check .
Men who had cut back had slightly lower death rates from all causes than heavy smokers during the first 15 years .
However , after that death rates were comparable .
Women who cut back actually had higher death rates from all causes combined than heavy smokers - although the researchers said this could simply be a chance finding .
Light smoking impact
Researcher Dr Kjell Bjartveit said there was evidence to show smoking just one to four cigarettes a day increased the risk of dying from heart disease dramatically .
He said : " It is widespread to offer smokers a last resort : ' If you are unable to quit , cut down ' .
" In our opinion , this advice may offer people false expectations .
There is only one safe way out :
To quit smoking entirely . "
Amanda Sandford , of the anti-smoking charity Action on Smoking and Health , said : " This study reinforces the evidence that simply cutting down does not alter the risk of premature death from smoking .
" However , there is good evidence to show that cutting down while using nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) significantly increases the chances of successfully quitting smoking .
" For smokers who are not yet ready to quit but want to cut down , we recommend that they use NRT , otherwise there is a danger that their cigarette consumption will quickly return to previous levels . "
Simon Clark , director of the smokers ' lobby group Forest , said it was important to take into consideration the fact that many smokers tended to lead a generally unhealthy lifestyle , eating a poor diet , and not taking exercise .
He said : " Unfortunately , campaigners prefer to emphasise the ' quit or die ' message , which is a gross exaggeration , but if you are a heavy smoker it is surely better to reduce consumption , combining that with a healthy diet and plenty of exercise , than not cut down at all ? "
Pregnancy
A separate study in the same journal found that pregnant smokers may " programme " their children to take up the habit .
The Australian study of more than 3,000 mothers compared the smoking patterns of their children when they reached the age of 21 .
Children whose mothers had smoked while pregnant were almost three times as likely to start smoking regularly at or before the age of 14 , and around twice as likely to start smoking after this age , than those whose mothers were non-smokers .
Smoking patterns among children whose mothers stopped smoking while pregnant , but then resumed the habit , were similar to those whose mothers had never smoked .
For all the finger - pointing across the border , the attacks have forced India to confront a worrying disquiet among Muslims at home , who have overwhelmingly resisted calls to join in Islamic radicalism .
“ That is still true to a very , very large extent , ” India ’s national security adviser , M. K. Narayanan , maintained .
“ But what has happened is that a very , very manifest attempt to recruit Indian Muslims is now being done . ”
Those efforts , he said in an interview on CNN - IBN television , are increasingly directed at educated Indian Muslims and , more troubling , at elements within the military .
Senior Lashkar officials interviewed in Rawalpindi , Pakistani , said no more than 50 Indians attended military and religious training camps in Pakistan and the Pakistani - controlled part of Kashmir on average each year .
But they confirmed that an active recruitment drive was under way in India .
It is impossible to pinpoint to what extent the still apparently small number of recruits are motivated by essentially Indian grievances  especially the pogroms in 2002 against Muslims in the state of Gujarat , which left 1,100 dead  or by the ideology of global political Islam .
But increasingly , many here fear , the two are at risk of merging .
In fact , Mr. Narayanan said , a reminder of anti-Muslim violence in India is a powerful recruitment tool .
“ Quite often , ” he said , “ the motivation is ‘ You know what happened in Gujarat . ’ ”
The Business Standard , an English - language daily , urged India in an editorial last week to start looking inward at what it called a “ homegrown jihad , ” suggesting that blaming Pakistan alone for attacks on Indian soil was no longer sufficient .
Wussten Sie , dass ich bei den dänischen Karikaturen zu Mohammed die Finger im Spiel hatte ?
Nicht ?
Nun , ich auch nicht , bis ich das Anfang Februar auf einer Verschwörungs - Website herausfand .
Um alles klar zu stellen werde ich mit den Fakten anfangen und dann die Verschwörungstheorie umreißen .
Was tatsächlich passierte : Flemming Rose , Kulturredakteur der  Jyllands - Posten " , einer dänischen Zeitung , schickte mir am 29 .
September 2004 eine E - Mail , in der er sich vorstellte und anfragte , ob er seiner USA - Reise ein Interview mit mir bekommen könnte .
Ich stimmte zu und Rose kam am 25 .
Oktober in mein Büro in Philadelphia , wo er mir eine halbe Stunde Fragen stellte .
Sein Artikel über mich ,  Truslen fra islamismen " ( The Threat of Islamism / Die Bedrohung des Islamismus ) erschien am 29 .
Oktober .
Es ist journalistisches Standard - Stück , in dem Rose einige biographische Informationen über mich lieferte und mich meine Sicht zum radikalen Islam erklären ließ .
Nach dem Treffen hatte ich keinerlei weiteren Kontakt mit Rose .
Um präziser zu sein :
Wir haben uns seitdem nicht getroffen , miteinander gesprochen oder einander geschrieben .
Ich erfuhr erst aus der Presse , fast ein Jahr nach unserem Treffen , von seiner Entscheidung die Karikaturen in Auftrag zu geben und zu veröffentlichen .
Das ist die langweilige Wirklichkeit – eine Routine - Interview und nichts weiter .
Die aufregendere Verschwörungstheorie begann , als ein antisemitischer Randgruppen - Schreiber namens Christopher Bollyn am 3 .
Februar eine Analyse veröffentlichte , in der er verkündete :  Rose reiste im Oktober 2004 nach Philadelphia um Daniel Pipes zu besuchen ...
Rose verfasste dann einen positiven Artikel über Pipes . "
Zwei
Tage später modelte Bollyn diese Tatsache in eine ausgeklügelte Verschwörungstheorie um :  Der Skandal der antimuslimischen Karikaturen stellt sich klar als Schlüsselereignis des  Kampfes der Zivilisationen ' der zionistischen Neo-Cons heraus , dem künstlich hergestellten Kampf , um den so genannten christlichen Westen gegen die islamischen Staaten und Völker aufzustellen .
Wir wissen , dass Flemming Rose ein Kollege und Freund des zionistischen Neo-Cons Daniel Pipes ist .
Er hat Pipes in Philadelphia besucht und einen freundlichen biographischen Artikel über ihn geschrieben . "
Man achte auf die drei Annahmen Bollyns in diesem Bericht : dass Rose mein  Kollege und Freund " sei , dass er und ich gemeinsam absichtlich die Muslime provozierten und dass wir Teil einer größeren Verschwörung zur Verschlechterung der christlich - muslimischen Beziehungen seien .
Solch wilde Vermutungen sind Bollyns Standardkost .
Bezüglich des 11 .
September denkt er z.B. , dass Präsident George W. Bush und der Presse - Tycoon Rupert Murdoch die Pläne vorher kannten , dass der Mossad eine Schlüsselrolle in den Ereignissen dieses Tages spielte , dass United Airlines Flug 175 nicht in den südlichen Turm des World Trade Center geflogen wurde und dass die Türme entweder durch eine israelisch - amerikanische Laserwaffe oder massive Explosionen im Untergrund zerstört wurden .
Bollyns Theorie , mich mit einem Kampf der Zivilisationen in Verbindung zu bringen , gewann innerhalb von Tagen an Fahrt .
Linke und islamistische Autoren beschrieben Rose verschiedentlich als meinen engen Mitarbeiter " ,  Jünger " und  Protege " und das Internet brummte mit Gerüchten über meinen Anteil an einer  Verschwörung der NeoCons " .
Selbst Teile des Mainstream griffen dann diese Ideen auf .
 Al - Hayat " , eine führende arabische Zeitung , spekulierte am 10 .
Februar über Roses und meine  Gesellschaft der gegenseitigen Bewunderung " .
Der PLO - Repräsentant in Washington , Afif Safieh , sagte am 12 .
Februar Wolf Blitzer von CNN , Flemming Rose sei ein Fan und Bewunderer " von mir .
Das belgische Massen - Wochenblatt  Knack " nannte mich dann den Ideologen der NeoCons " ( was für William Kristol neu sein dürfte ) und beschuldigte Rose , mich und andere einen  internationale NeoCon - Provokation " angestiftet zu haben .
Ich beobachtete die Ausbreitung dieser fantastischen Geschichte amüsiert und mit Sorge .
Als Autor zweier Bücher und vieler Artikel zu Verschwörungstheorien habe ich diese fehl geleiteten Versuche die Wirklichkeit zu begreifen intensiv studiert .
Diesmal hatte ich das zweifelhafte Privileg das aus der Sicht von innen nach außen zu tun .
Als Antwort erinnerte ich mich an zwei Empfehlungen meines 1992 von der CIA in Auftrag gegebenen Berichts , die der amerikanischen Regierung Wege vorschlug mit Verschwörungstheorien umzugehen .
Verweigere die Gültigkeit der Verschwörungstheorien : Meinem eigenen
Rat folgend setzte ich eine Richtigstellung auf meine Internetseite , diskutierte das Thema im Fernsehen Al - Jazira und widme mir der Frage hier .
Antizipiere böswillige Interpretationen :
Im bösartigen und vulgären Diskurs von heute müssen Personen der Öffentlichkeit voraussehen , dass ihr Handeln , so unwichtig und unschuldig es auch sein mag , willkürlich aus der Versenkung geangelt und als Teil eines großen Ganzen zurechtgebogen wird .
Man kann das nicht verhindern , aber der Schaden kann minimiert werden , indem man sorgfältig alles dokumentiert ( E - Mails , Audio - Aufzeichnungen , Fotos ) und diese anführt , um Entstellungen zu widerlegen .
The one piece of the Google puzzle that seldom gets any attention but I believe is going to be an absolute key piece of the puzzle is Orkut .
Earlier in the week , Eric Schmidt gave a very rare insight into Google 's longer - term strategies when he said in the big Newsweek Web 2.0 article :
Everybody thinks we 're building Operating Systems , PCs And browsers .
They clearly do n't get it .
Look at MySpace .
Very Interesting .
Google has clearly outgrown it 's home page .
Pretty much the only way you can find most of the recently developed services is to Google it and then follow the link .
However , to date Google has resisted the " portal " model .
Schmidt 's comments , perhaps for the first time , confirm that Google will head down that portal route because that 's what MySpace is , at its most basic level – a personalised portal .
So how long before we see for want of a better term , GoogleSpaces ?
Google 's personalised home page meets MySpace ??
Maybe , it will look something like this :
Google keeps insisting that it has not wavered from its core mission of organising the world 's information and increasingly people are relying on personal portals to do just that so it makes absolute sense that Google will follow suit .
What is different about MyScene is it is a combination of a social networking environment amalgamated with content relevent to that social network .
So while I can go and build relationships in Linked In , I do n't hang out there because Linked In has not content .
When you start to interact and collaborate with content via your social network you build deeper connections with people because you 're relationship moves beyond surface - level similarities and your content also becomes more satisfying because its shared and enjoyed socially .
So the big piece of the puzzle that Google has yet to plug in is Orkut but it has made a few special appearances of late .
Google mentioned in its analyst briefing that Orkut when integrated with GMail has the potential to become the ultimate address book .
And then there was the initiative with Nike around the soccer / football Orkut social network .
Take a good look at that , because that could very well be the best indication yet as to the direction Google wants to go .
You see , the power of Google is that it can create a MySpace for all .
Once it establishes a framework for plugging Orkut into the rest of its content plays there 's no limit to the number of communities and networks it can create because Google is the ultimate long - tail content aggregator , remember .
And you do n't think advertisers are going to love that ?
Magazine publisher should get very scared if this is the case because right now , that 's their turf – delivering advertisers well formed , niche communities .

Ignore the competition
I 'm so tired of seeing so many products with the same features that nobody wants .
It 's bad enough to let feature requests from users get out of control , but when we start adding features just because our competitors have them , we 're all screwed .
Why do we do it ?
My guesses are :
1 ) The Feature Arms Race .
We 're afraid of falling behind our competitors .
2 ) We assume that if one of the leading competitors added something , it 's something users will want .
3 ) We assume that potential users will buy off a checklist , and we do n't want to come up short in a side - by - side feature comparison .
4 ) We have a compulsive need to add , since the idea of an upgrade that subtracts features seems counterintuitive .
5 ) New features are easier to promote than better / working versions of existing ones .
Or so we think ...
What would happen if we completely , utterly , totally ignored the competition ?
What if we stopped thinking about competition at all ?
Perhaps if we devote all of our attention to users ( and our own ability to innovate ) , we 'll stop being dragged off into areas that build our feature list , but often at the expense of users .
That development time might be better spent .
It 's The Feature Arms Race that leads to so much sameness among products !
It 's The Feature Arms Race that leads to the bloody kicking and clawing and fighting for market share .
The Feature Arms Race is a form of group think , and we all know that design - by - committee does not produce art .
We must wean ourselves off the obsession with the competition .
If we 're constantly trying to one - up them - - or even just stay up with them - - how does this really serve the users ?
How does it help the users kick ass if we 're so focused making sure our feature lists kick ass ?
But it 's hard to do .
" What if the competition comes up with something really good ?
Something users really like ? "
Then you 'll hear about it by staying in close contact with your user community .
" What if potential users do shop off a checklist ? "
Then we should be educating them .
In the absence of a deeper understanding of what 's important and what we need and want , we DO often buy off a checklist -- it feels like a better value to get more for our money .
But of course the question is ... more what ?
Certainly not usability , since the more features we add , the more danger there is of the dreaded featuritis :
If our only " competitive advantage " is by staying one step ahead of The Feature Arms Race , we 're vulnerable .
In my domain -- technical books -- if my co-authors and I had completely given in to The Features Arms Race , we would have focused on making sure OUR Table of Contents had as much ( or more ) " coverage " of topics as the competing books on that topic .
( Initially , that 's what our editor was asking for . )
But it would have come at the expense of the learner .
We knew we could n't help our learners kick ass unless we stopped trying to " cover " ( and remember , what the hell does " cover " mean anyway ? ) the topics that would look good on a feature ( ToC ) comparison .
Given the success of the books , we 're so relieved that we resisted the pull to " compete . "
I think in many cases , the more you try to compete , the less competitve you actually are .
Still , as much as I like to think I 'm all about ignoring the competition , I feel ( and often give in to ) that pull every single day .
So I 'm looking for suggestions , thoughts , ideas about breaking the addiction to The Feature Arms Race .
[ Note that I made this entire post without mentioning the web app company ( name starts with a two - digit number less than 50 ) whose mission is to avoid The Feature Arms Race .
But I was thinking about them the whole time . ]

Kathy ,
I think this also happens because of fear that we wo n't match up well in the checkbox chart in a review or that we 'll be sitting in a sales meeting with a big , prospective client and they 'll ask " Do you do X ? " and , instead of talking to them about X and why it might be valuable to them and how what their real issues are , we want to be able to say " Sure , of course we do X . "
Removing features ala those Chicago guys results in a product that some love and some hate , meaning that you 're losing some segment of the market .
That is , of course fine - " all warm bodies " is n't a market segment anyway - but a lot of people are very leery of having anyone hate your product .
Of course , that means that no one will love your product either ...
And , hey , you have to have something to drive the upgrade , right ?
( said with a smile of course ... )

It 's interesting , Microsoft has taken this advice with their next Office suite .
From what I can tell , it 's a real improvement despite the major UI changes .
A lot of users will be confused , but once they climb the user happiness curve , they 'll learn to really kick ass .
Microsoft , unlike OpenOffice.org , has really tried to innovate ( for once ? ) , ignoring much of the competition .

Many of my clients come to me and say , " I want a website like my competitors ' sites " .
It 's sometimes hard to convince them that this is the wrong approach .
If their competitors websites were exceptional ( read : were built for their users ) , there would n't be much harm in emulating them , but in most industries the average website is so poor that we could easily do better .
By focusing on the user , we could achieve a competitive advantage and maybe even make users happy .
Any suggestions for convincing them ?

Great post , Kathy .
I made a recent post in my blog on this subject , and also been thinking a lot about this lately .
http://michael.hightechproductmanagement.com/2006/05/sun_tzu_on_product_strategy_1.html
Here are some of my thoughts :
* Ignoring competition , and focusing on users is pretty much possible only in small companies .
In larger companies it is very hard .
* I have worked for one larger company in the past that was really good at this , but they had a very , very strong culture driven by the CEO that focused maniacally on users - and pretty much ignored competition .
* In most companies , there is incredible pressure to follow the competition - from up and down the company .
* At most companies , we first have to educate coworkers and bosses why this is a good thing - before being able to even attempt it .
This is far easier said than done .
In summary - this is a very good concept , but extremely hard to practice at most companies .

Kathy , excelente Blog .
Y muy generosa por usar el " We "
La innovación es expandir las posibilidades a la gente , lo que también se puede interpretar como expandir mercados o crear nuevas categorías de mercado .
Pero nosotros estamos acostumbrados a mirarnos el ombligo , creer que vemos y sentimos como los otros , que lo que creemos bueno , es bueno para todos .
Ese es el problema , creer que tenemos ojos objetivos .
Felicitaciones y gracias .

We also need more new features for our sales staff to have " something to sell " and talk about with our customers .
More features mean customers get " more for their buck " ( ROI ) .
And since very often buyers of the features are not the same people as their users , they often end up with stuff nobody needs .
Another irony is that many releases of the ( enterprise ) software not only include the features that the competition has , but also the features that the customers already have too .
When the standard packages do not provide what users need and they extend / customize them , then they have to redo it all once the same features become standard in the next release .
But until that upgrade - we , the other guy and our customers all work on creating ( and owning ) the same features .
Posted by : Marian Crkon | Jul 23 , 2006 11:12:45 PM
I agree with the spirit of your blog entry , but not the analysis .
Overwhelming users with complexity is a bad thing , however all we know right now is that features and complexity are correlated , not that features cause complexity .
I had written a paragraph here on using quantitative data to design UI .
Specifically I had mentioned Microsoft Word and what Microsoft has learned about the long tail of feature usage in Office .
As it turns out , Jensen Harris has already written about the reasoning behind the new UI in Office 2007 .
Specifically , parts 6 and 7 of Jensen 's series discuss how feature usage tracking has determined once and for all what features people actually use .
Removing features one way to simplify interfaces , but it 's not the only way .
I believe that feature rich software can have a simple UI , and that progress is being made in that direction .
Although others might disagree with me on that point , I would urge them to help try to solve the problem before dismissing it as unsolvable .

Posted by : Tom Guarriello | Jul 24 , 2006 7:18:23 AM
A focus totally on users is a good , but I think it 's important to keep in mind that users often do n't know what they want .
I have observed that as soon as a program comes out that people like , they immediately start clamoring for features that ( 1 ) they probably wo n't use and ( 2 ) already exist in other programs on the market .
I.E. , they will want you to do scope creep .
The problem with that is that adding every feature users ' want is a sure fire way of ending up with a program so feature - bloated , that users will start to think about switching to something simplier .
So it is not always a good idea to listen to your users .
I think it 's much better to focus on the SUCCESS of users in doing the task you want them to be able to do with your program .
Ask yourself these questions :
1 ) Why does my program exist ?
2 ) What will users be able to have / do / be from using my program on a daily basis ?
3 ) How can I make a design that keeps users focused so they will complete their tasks with ease and joy ?
A program should focus on the task (s ) it 's designed for .
If users suggest features that fit into the purpose for the program , then certainly think about adding them .
But do n't be drawn into features that do n't make any sense .
Create a NEW program for those ;-)
Posted by : Dan | Jul 24 , 2006 10:43:23 AM
I read some of the comments above , and I have a few more thoughts ;-)
You need to be careful about discovering the real purpose behind a client request .
If a client says : " I want a website like my competitors ' sites " , ask the client what having that sort of website will allow them to give to their customers ?
They might say something like : " an exciting , fluid experience " .
Now you have what they REALLY want , as opposed to simply copying someone else 's solution .
This also answers the " Do you do X ? " complaint .
I would ask :
What does being able to do X - DO - for the person ?
In other words , challenge that the person needs X feature to satisfy their real desire ( which usually ends up like something simple like fun , freedom , speed , etc . )
Remember that people are creatures of habit .
One thing many fail to realize is that as long as a program does a particular thing really well ( i.e. " enough " features to completely cover a particular task ) then very often users will AVOID switching to a competitor , even if that competitor has more features .
" Bank for the Buck " is only relevant when the user has n't used any program of that type yet ( for example , blogging software ) .
Once a users is " in " , as long as the program does what it 's trying to do well , then it will take a LOT of features from a competitor for them to switch .
( I do n't have numbers to back this up , but it seems correct based on what I know about how people work . )
The one example I can give is that in many ways , Mac OS X is technically more advanced then Windows .
Yet year after year people keep choosing windows because of the appearance of difficulty in changing their ways and using something else .
I think what needs to happen is that customers need to be educated as to the achievements people can make with their program , as opposed to the features it has .
In reality , the achievement is what people really want .
This is something I picked up from reading sales marketing online .
Good sales pitches have a ton of testimonials .
People with RESULTS from using the product .
I have a feeling if this was put out more , you would discover it 's FAR more powerful in convincing people to buy then touting off the features you have over the competition .
Posted by : Dan | Jul 24 , 2006 11:06:25 AM
Nice idea , but I do n't think it scales .
When there are very few layers between you and your users , this model may work great .
Its probably fine when the product costs $ 100 , $ 1000 , or maybe even $ 10,000 .
However , any more than that , and you get the problem where the buyer has no clue about the opinions of the users .
The buyer is some bean counter in a dark office , or worse yet a committee !
They could n't care less if the users like it or not , all they look at is a checklist from 20 vendors .
If you do n't have a bazillion checkmarks , you do n't make it into the top 3 , which means you never get to meet your potential customer .
Therefore , without the checklist , you never get the chance to educate your users that the checklist is irrelevant .
Once you get a user , then you can focus on them .
But if you do n't have the checklist , you 'll never get a user .

I wrote about this on my own blog , a long time ago .
Back in the late 1980s , I attended a lecture by a product manager at a major computer hardware company .
He said their most advanced computers were taking 2 or 3 years to design and ship , so the company created a new research division to predict what the competition would be shipping in 2 to 3 years and what features their products would need so they could compete with other vendors ' future products .
He called it " predictive reaction , " in that they were predicting what products and features they'd have to react to in the future .
At this point , I realized the company had totally lost their vision .
The only person you have to compete with is yourself .
You have to produce the best products you can , and hope that everyone else will struggle to compete with YOU .

I think point two could be varied as follows -- researching what the competition has is easier than actively determining how to help users achieve their goals .
If you assume that your competition is doing the user leg - work then point two follows .

My view is that analysts drive this issue .
In the enterprise software industry Gartner , Forrester and a handful of other niche ( yeah , sorry guys ) direct what 50 % of customers want .
When it is n't the analysts , its the dumb CIO that is trying to pretend that he is ahead of the curve ( either the adoption or the Featuritis ) curve .
Generally this CIO , who represents the unfortunately large component of poor leadership , believes that he can't go wrong with having all the features , " cos if its all there you just have to plug the bits together , right ? " .
I have been on the production end of the RFI / RFP response process .
You have no option but to fill in the spreadsheet with a ' yes ' in every box and an answer that is unfortunately truncated at the wrong moment by the limits of the excel app .
You have to , otherwise you do n't make it to the next round of selection .
I wrote about why I think Sales Engineers should go crazy , and this should have been included as one of the reasons !
The issue is that only the smart vendors work out the level of ' twisting the truth ' they can get away with .
Some are too honest , and are penalized ( in ) appropriately .
Play the game boys and girls , as a vendor the marketing hype makes the product .
Services fill the gap between what the customer believed they heard and what you should deliver .
Cheers

Very true about the checklist thing .
The other day I found a feller in Low Yat ( Computer / Mobile Mall in Kuala Lumpur ) , who does n't really know about micro devices like processor , graphics card and stuff like that .
He had some AMD competitive benchmark printouts in his hands and asking for some real hifi system .
What I could guess is he just needed a normal desktop for personal use .
However , he was asking for AMD Opteron , which is a workstation / server processor .
And asking some recommendations about Pentium Xeon , again a server processor .
Same goes for mobile consumers .
Most of them want GPRS , Bluetooth , WIFI supported 3G mobiles .
No matter they are just gonna make simple calls nothing more , not even a SMS , from their hand sets .
Sometimes customers are like that .

Thought provoking ( reinforcing ) post .
Prominent examples of " me too " product design are OpenOffice , which is desperately trying to outdo MS Office in bloat , and forgetting about what it is really meant for .
Or the various instant messengers , e.g .
Yahoo bloating its really good IM beyond useful stuff .
My favorite quote on design ( not exact and do n't remember the source ) is " the sign of good design is when you can take nothing more away from it "
As another commenter pointed out , focus on the user and never forget the goal of what you 're building .
Only when someone takes a fresh look at what users want , do they come up with something really disruptive .
Whatever you say about them , Google 's UI 's are simple , intuitive and do exactly waht they claim .
I 've rarely had to consult help , whereas I do that in Yahoo very often .

Some feature wars are driven by the needs of the channel , not users .
While some businesses may indeed be able to ignore competition , most cannot ignore the channel .
But , ignoring the competition assumes that you and your customers are the only ones with good ideas .
If your competition is worth their khakis , they 've probably got a few that you might find inspirational .

main = input ( " enter a number " ) => { |num| print ( num+num ) }
repeatUntilZero( op ) = op => { readInt => { |x| ( x == 0 ) ? 0 : repeatUntilZero( op ) } } main = repeatUntilZero( print ( " enter a zero : " ) )
* Surely there is a difference , as running the code must do something , after all .
But the difference is computational time , which is n't observable by the code -- when I write " x = 3 " and then " y = 2 " , there 's no mention in the code of how much time or processor is spent between steps one and two .
Without using fancy jargon or theory , here 's an attempt to explain how you can do " impure " operations ( like deleting a file , or updating an array ) in a purely functional language .
It 's actually pretty simple ; once you get it , it may be a bit of a let - down .
But I need to get this out of the way for some later posts to make sense .
The promise of a " pure " language is that a given " variable " will never change .
( The word " variable " is a little misleading in that case .
People sometimes call them " bindings " instead . )
So once you write " x = 3 " , x is fixed , and that 's it .
This also implies that functions never change : ifgives you 10 , thenwill always be 10 .
( People sometimes use the verb " mutate " to describe the process of changing variables -- it makes sense in contrast with the word " immutable " . )
There 's a few reasons you might like a language like this .
For example , some argue it makes programs easier to reason about , as there are fewer moving parts .
Others point out that part of the optimization process done by compilers for " normal " languages is to translate code that modifies variables into code where each mutation instead makes a new variable ( you can read more about this on the Static single assignment wikipedia article , which says that GCC 4 uses this " extensively " ) .
Another way to look at that is that mutation and history are two sides of the same coin : in a program where things do n't change , there is no difference * between " before " or " after " a given statement .
This means that the compiler is free to compute things in the order it thinks is best .
( C geeks , if you have n't seen it before , you 'll be interested to read the argument Threads cannot be implemented as a library , which explains how some natural - seeming compiler optimizations fail in the presence of threading . )
That comment about threading is relevant , too : in a language without mutation , any little subset of code is naturally independent from what the other code is doing , so pure languages naturally parallelize well .
But in the practical world you do still need to change stuff sometimes , so pure languages still need to support this .
So here 's what you can do .
( First , a disclaimer : this is just roughly how Haskell does it .
Other languages have other approaches .
But I 'll use a more traditional syntax just so the Haskell thing does n't get in the way . )
Imagine you 're given two objects calledandand are told that they represent outputting the characters A and B .
You can't actually call them as functions in your code -- " printA ( ) " would be an observable effect , after all .
But what your code can do is talk about printA itself ( note without the parens now ) , which refers to the the operation of printing the letter A .
So you define your language such that the binding called " main " must be at one of these operations , and you 're halfway there .
Here 's my program that prints the letter A :( The compiler can drop the myint and foo bits ' cause they 're not actually used . ) A real program will want to do more than one thing , of course .
So we could modify our language so that main is instead expected to be a list of operations .
And we might want to actually use some of our other bindings , too : This one prints " BBA " .
From here you can even build things that feel sorta like subroutines , too .
Consider this binding : This is the place where people get tripped up , so be careful : is a function .
But when you call a Or B ( 3 ) , it does n't print anything .
Instead , you get back an operation -- eitheror -- and you can then stick that operation in your to - do list that isUsing the same reasoning , we could define a more basic functionthat gives you back an operation that would print out x .
Again , be careful here : does n't print anything , it just gives you back the operation that would print " hello " .
See how it 's a pure function ?
Passing " hello " to thisdoes n't change anything and you always get back the exact same thing .
The final piece is input .
Let 's imagine were were given one final primitive operation , called readInt .
Again , you could imagine that if " readInt ( ) " were legal it'd read some input from stdin and return an integer , but again that is an effect and is not allowed .
Using the same trick as before we can instead talk about the operation , which , if it were run , would produce an integer .
Then we rejigger our language slightly again .
is still a list of operations , but we declare that if any operation in the list is the sort that produces a value ( like readInt ) , that this value is fed into the next thing in the list to get the next operation .
Here 's a new program :
This program prints the letter A , then waits for you to input an integer .
If that integer is is 0 , it prints another A , otherwise it prints a B .
And then , finally it prints a B .
But the crazy thing about it is that it is still completely pure : that is , is defined to have a single constant value .
( You 'll even note that with the same inputs , in the sense of what the operations do , it will always have the same outputs . )
And that 's it .
You 've seen conditional control flow involving I/O , but the language is still pure .
Do you feel a bit cheated ?
( I sorta did when I first learned this -- it 's like they just sidestepped the whole issue . )
You can't pleasantly write programs with the language I outlined above , but it has all the major concepts .
Let 's define it in a conceptually equivalent way that makes it a bit more useful .
First , make up a syntax for anonymous functions : uh , ruby - style , I guess .
With that syntax , here are two equivalent definitions of foo :
( The bit between the pipes are the arguments to the function . )
So here 's the sameprogram again : Then let 's define a magical operator " = > " that sequences two operations , feeding one into a function that produces the next and giving us back the whole thing as a single operation .
So an operation to print " AB " would beand an operation to print ABAB would beand that same main again would beMore usefully , to ask for input you might define a function like : which you could then use in a program like this :
What we 've actually done is turned control flow into something that can talked about in the same way we talk about data .
In the land of pure data we never needed a " sequence " operator because we never needed to say " do this first , and then this other thing second " .
But just with the addition of one operator we can reuse all of the other tools we have are still available .
To sum a list of integers , you stick a plus sign between each element in the list .
To run a list of operations in order , you stick a => between each element .
You can use the same code to define both .
And we can even define our own control flow operators .
Here 's a function that repeats an operation until the user enters zero , and an example use of it :
But through all of this we 're still consistent about the difference between pure computation and side effects : once you 're pulled in an operation in some code , there 's no way for that code to do anything useful with it without returning something that includes that operation .
Since we 've made the sequencing of dependent operations explicit , it 's clear which bits can be rearranged ( as before , all of the code ) and which can't ( you would n't move stuff around the => any more than you 'd rearrange the elements of a list ) .
This finally puts us at a place for my next post , which will build from here to monads , which extend this idea in all sorts of fascinating ways .
Was that too fast or too slow ?
I 'm never sure which parts are obvious and which are n't .
News , discussion and a behind - the - scenes look at the newsgathering process from The AP .
Story Highlights • No. 2 man says he wants U.S. troops to stay in " trap " of Iraq
• Ayman al - Zawahiri alludes to Iraqi parliament bombing
• Osama bin Laden 's deputy also scoffs at Shiite religious doctrine
• Terrorist urges Palestinian Hamas government to stick to its guns
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) -- A new video from al Qaeda No. 2 man Ayman al - Zawahiri addresses the issue of setting a timetable for withdrawal of troops from Iraq .
The video introduces an interview with al - Zawahiri , and his words are translated into English , with subtitles superimposed throughout .
It runs 1 hour , 7 minutes and 35 seconds and was posted Saturday on the Internet .
Although CNN could not independently confirm its authenticity , it was produced by the As - Sahab production company that has taken credit for other al Qaeda tapes .
In one section of the video , an interviewer asks al - Zawahiri to comment on legislation that ties the funding of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan to a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq .
" This bill reflects American failure and frustration , " says al - Zawahiri , second - in - command to Osama bin Laden .
" However , this bill will deprive us of the opportunity to destroy the American forces which we have caught in a historic trap .
" We ask Allah that they only get out of it after losing 200 to 300 hundred thousand killed , in order that we give the spillers of blood in Washington and Europe an unforgettable lesson , which will motivate them to review their entire doctrinal and moral system which produced their historic criminal Crusader - Zionist entity , " al - Zawahiri says .
Al - Zawahiri makes what appears to be a dig at the Baghdad security crackdown started in February -- Operation Enforcing the Law .
He apparently is alluding to the failure of coalition forces to stop the suicide bomber who breached security in the Green Zone last month and detonated a bomb in the parliament cafeteria .
" And lest Bush worry , I congratulate him on the success of his security plan and I invite him on the occasion for a glass of juice -- but in the cafeteria of the Iraqi parliament ! "
A plea for unity
Speaking during a period when rivalries and feuds are reported among Sunni militants , he urged the Sunni world to unite and " combine its efforts to make the purified sharia the highest authority . "
Sharia is the system of Islamic law .
He takes a shot at Iran and Shiites , making reference to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's claim to be in contact with the Mahdi , the 12th and " hidden imam " holy to Shiites , and to the Shiites ' claim to be descendants of the Prophet Mohammed .
" Those leaderships are intent on establishing certain concepts which nullify the intellects of their followers and prevent them from understanding the Quran and Sunna , except through their interpretations and explanations , and are intent to gather around themselves the biggest possible number of followers through claims of noble lineages and connections with the unseen in order to use them in political conflicts which often clash with the slogans they used to raise .
" Such as the slogan ' America , the Great Satan , ' which became the slogan ' America , the Closest Partner , ' and such as the movements which used to claim that they were carrying the message of Islam to liberate the Muslims in Iraq from Saddam the Baathist , but are now sending messages of surrender to keep the forces of Bush the Crusader in the Muslims ' lands . "
Al - Zawahiri told the Hamas leadership in the Palestinian territories to keep the faith with its staunch tenets .
Hamas is considered a terrorist movement by Israel , the United States and the European Union .
" I ask the leadership of Hamas , first , not to turn away from the true rule of sharia and to only agree to participate in elections on the basis of an Islamic constitution , " he said .
" And I ask it , second , that if it is given the choice between abandoning government and abandoning Palestine , it should abstain from government and hold on to Palestine and choose jihad and resistance . "
Earlier messages
There were other Web messages this year said to be from al - Zawahiri .
In a February message , he called on Muslims to unite under Taliban leader Mullah Omar and to drop their attempts to form secular governments and instead follow only the strict Sharia law .
That video contained a still picture of al - Zawahiri , the audio remarks and English subtitles .
Mullah Omar is the elusive , shadowy Taliban leader who slipped away in the early days of the war in Afghanistan .
The Taliban ruled Afghanistan with an iron hand and sheltered al Qaeda before it was toppled by the U.S. - led invasion after al Qaeda 's attack on the United States in 2001 .
Another al - Zawahiri message was released January 22 .
It also contained harsh words for President Bush and the United States .
Google 's YouTube and a company called Live Digital will offer no refuge to users who uploaded pirated copies of Fox Television 's " 24 " and " The Simpsons " onto their video platforms .
In an e-mail to internetnews.com , a 20th Century Fox Television spokesperson said that Google and Live Digital complied with subpoenas issued by the U.S. District Court in Northern California and disclosed to Fox the identities of two individuals who illegally uploaded entire episodes of " 24 " prior to its broadcast and DVD release .
According to copies of the subpoena applications , Fox found this season 's first four episodes of " 24 " on LiveDigital and YouTube on Jan. 8 , a full week before they were to air for the first time in the U.S .
Fox said a YouTube user who goes by the handle " ECOTtotal " uploaded 12 episodes of the popular animated show " The Simpsons . "
The LiveDigital user 's display name was " Jorge Romero . "
" We intend to use the information provided to pursue all available legal remedies against those who infringed our copyrights , " 20th Century Fox Television Vice President of Media Relations Chris Alexander told internetnews.com .
The U.S. District Court first instructed Google and Live Digital to produce identifying information in identical subpoenas , pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , issued Jan. 24 after L.A. law firm Loeb & Loeb filed them for Fox on Jan. 18 .
Since Google purchased YouTube for $ 1.56 billion last fall , the company has been besieged by similar complaints of copyright infringement .
Last week , for example , media giant Viacom demanded YouTube take down 100,000 clips , including content from MTV , Comedy Central and other networks .
Viacom said " it has become clear that YouTube is unwilling to come to a fair market agreement " on content distribution .
Some media companies have been more congenial .
According to a Google spokesperson , of the big four music labels , only EMI is yet to sign a revenue - sharing deal with Google .
And today , Digital Music Group announced it entered into an agreement with Google to make more than 4,000 hours of video content and approximately 40,000 music recordings available to the YouTube community .
DMGI currently owns or controls the digital distribution rights to classic television episodes of " Gumby , " " I Spy , " " My Favorite Martian , " " Peter Gunn " and more .
Long - time readers know that I ’m not exactly one of the privacy paranoid .
I ’ve accepted that we all live in thousands of databases .
The state of New York knows where and when I drive , thanks to my E - ZPass ( electronic toll - booth badge ) .
Stop &
Shop knows what I eat , thanks to my grocery discount card .
Blockbuster knows what kinds of movies I watch .
Verizon knows whom I call , MasterCard knows what I buy–it ’s just hopeless .
Frankly , I consider the details of my life so boring to other people that I really could n’t care less .
I ’ve got nothing to hide , so why not accept it ?
That attitude spilled over to a “ From the Desk of David Pogue ” e-column I wrote in 2004 , in which I attempted to throw water on scare - tactic computer - magazine articles that said , in effect : “ Ooooh !
If you use your Wi-Fi laptop at public Internet hot spots , the bad guys will see everything you ’re doing and rifle through your files ! ”
I ’m back again today to throw that water right back into my own face .
On this topic , my eyes have been opened .
It came about like this : I recently filmed six episodes of a new TV series ( “ It ’s All Geek to Me , ” which airs in February on The Science Channel , Discovery HD and Discovery Europe ) .
In one of them , I wanted to get to the bottom of this Wi -Fi snooping business .
I wanted to see exactly what is , and is not , possible for the bad guys to intercept when you ’re sitting there in Starbucks or the hotel lobby .
I put a note up on my blog , seeking a guest who could appear on the show and show me the hacky ropes .
I found Jon Baer , a technical consultant who seemed just right for the part .
We met ( Jon , the camera crew and I ) in a Manhattan Wi-Fi coffee shop .
Turns out there was absolutely nothing to it .
Jon sat a few feet away with his PowerBook ; I fired up my Fujitsu laptop and began doing some e-mail and Web surfing .
That ’s all it took .
He turned his laptop around to reveal all of this :
* Every copy of every e-mail message I sent * and* received .
* A list of the Web sites I visited .
* Even , incredibly , the graphics that had appeared on the Web sites I had visited .
None of this took any particular effort , hacker skill or fancy software .
Anyone could do it .
You could do it .
All Jon needed was a “ packet sniffing ” program ; such software is free and widely available .
( He used a Mac program called Eavesdrop . )
It sniffs the airwaves and displays whatever data it finds being transmitted in the public hot spot .
Now , the fact that it ’s so easy to intercept your Internet signals in a public hot spot does n’t mean that somebody is * doing * it .
In fact , of course , most of the time , nobody is .
Nonetheless , Jon ’s little demonstration made clear that somebody * could * intercept your transmissions extremely easily .
So are you supposed to crawl into a hole , turn off your Wi-Fi , and go back to dial - up ?
Not exactly .
You can take steps to protect yourself :
* If you see the little padlock in the corner of your Web - browser window ( or if the Web address begins with “ https : // ” instead of “ // ” ) , you ’re connected to a secure Web site .
Your transmissions are encrypted in both directions , so you have little to fear from casual packet sniffers .
Banking and brokerage sites , for example , are protected in this way .
* You can sign up for encrypted e-mail services or programs , too , if avoiding e-mail eavesdropping is that important to you .
* You can connect to your company over a VPN ( virtual private networking ) connection , which encrypts * all * data to and from your laptop .
This is something a network geek would have to set up for you .
* Otherwise , you can just conduct your online transactions with the awareness that a stranger could be “ overhearing ” them .
Wait to visit Web sites , or to send e-mail messages , of a delicate nature until you ’re on a wired connection or a private wireless one .
Truth be known , since my eyes were opened , my Wi-Fi habits have n’t actually changed much .
I still open the laptop in the hotel lobby , exchange e-mail with readers , editors and friends , and check a few news sites or blogs .
None of it would really mean anything to an evil eavesdropper nearby .
But at least I ’m aware that I * could * be observed .
And is n’t it always better to know than not to ?

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday April 6 2006
We stated on this article that " it was announced that Prof Walt would step down from his job as academic dean at the end of June " and that " the move had long been planned " .
A spokesperson for the Kennedy School has asked us to make it clear that the school has made no such announcement linked with the present controversy and that Prof Walt remains there as professor of international affairs .
After the screenwriter Walter Bernstein was placed on the blacklist during the McCarthyite era he said his life " seemed to move in ever - decreasing circles " .
" Few of my friends dropped away but the list of acquaintances diminished , " he wrote in Inside Out , a memoir of the blacklist .
" I appeared contaminated and they did not want to risk infection .
They avoided me , not calling as they had in the past , not responding to my calls , being nervously distant if we met in public places . "
As chair of African American studies in Yale , Paul Gilroy had a similar experience recently after he spoke at a university - sponsored teach - in on the Iraq war .
" I think the morality of cluster bombs , of uranium - tipped bombs , [ of ] daisy cutters are shaped by an imperial double standard that values American lives more , " he said .
" [ The war seems motivated by ] a desire to enact revenge for the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon ... [ It 's important ] to speculate about the relation between this war and the geopolitical interests of Israel . "
" I thought I was being extremely mealy - mouthed , but I was accused of advocating conspiracy theories , " says Gilroy , who is now the Anthony Giddens professor of Social Theory at the London School of Economics .
Scot Silverstein , who was once on the faculty at Yale , saw a piece in the student paper about Gilroy 's contribution .
He wrote to the Wall Street Journal comparing Gilroy to Hitler and claiming his words illustrated the " moral psychosis and perhaps psychological sadism that appears to have infected leftist academia " .
The Journal published the letter .
Gilroy found himself posted on Discoverthenetworks.org , a website dedicated to exposing radical professors .
The principle accusation was that he " believes the US fabricated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein " .
Then the emails started coming to him and his colleagues , denouncing him .
" Only one person said anything , " says Gilroy .
" Otherwise , nobody looked me in the eye .
There was something about the way it never came up that made me realise how nervous and apprehensive they were . "
Few would argue there are direct parallels between the current assaults on liberals in academe and McCarthyism .
Unlike the McCarthy era , most threats to academic freedom - real or perceived - do not , yet , involve the state .
Nor are they buttressed by widespread popular support , as anticommunism was during the 50s .
But in other ways , argues Ellen Schrecker , author of Many Are the Crimes - McCarthyism in America , comparisons are apt .
" In some respects it 's more dangerous , " she says .
" McCarthyism dealt mainly with off - campus political activities .
Now they focus on what is going on in the classroom .
It 's very dangerous because it 's reaching into the core academic functions of the university , particularly in Middle - Eastern studies . "
Either way , a growing number of apparently isolated incidents suggests a mood which is , if nothing else , determined , relentless and aimed openly at progressives in academe .
Earlier this year , Fox news commentator Sean Hannity urged students to record " leftwing propaganda " by professors so he could broadcast it on his show .
On the web there is Campus Watch , " monitoring Middle East studies on campus " ; Edwatch , " Education for a free nation " ; and Parents Against Bad Books in School .
In mid January , the Bruin Alumni association offered students $ 100 to tape leftwing professors at the University of California Los Angeles .
The association effectively had one dedicated member , 24 - year - old Republican Andrew Jones .
It also had one dedicated aim : " Exposing UCLA 's most radical professors " who " [ proselytise ] their extreme views in the classroom " .
Shortly after the $ 100 offer was made , Jones mounted a website , uclaprofs.com , which compiled the Dirty 30 - a hit list of those he considered the most egregious , leftwing offenders .
Top of the list was Peter McLaren , a professor at the UCLA 's graduate school of education .
Jones branded McLaren a " monster " .
" Everything that flows from Peter McLaren 's mouth and pen is deeply , inextricably radical , " wrote Jones .
" In keeping with the left 's identity politics he has been a friend to the gay community . "
McLaren was shocked .
" I was away when the story broke and when I came back there were 87 messages waiting for me .
I was surprised a list like that could be created in these times .
I thought , ' Wow , somebody 's out there reading my work fairly carefully . ' "
The main impact , he says , was to try to insulate those close to him from the fallout .
" I had to take down lots of things from my website - family pictures and contacts with other people .
I did n't want other people to pay the price . "
Also among the Dirty 30 was history professor Ellen DuBois .
She was described as , " in every way the modern female academic : militant , impatient , accusatory and radical - very radical " .
DuBois told the Los Angeles Times , " This is a totally abhorrent invitation to students to participate in a witch hunt against their professors . "
McLaren , who describes himself as a marxist - humanist , agrees .
He believes the list was a McCarthyite attack on academe , with the aim of softening up public hostility for a more propitious moment : " This is a low - intensity campaign that can be ratcheted up at a time of crisis .
When there is another crisis in this country and this country is in an ontological hysteria , an administration could use that to up the ante .
I think it represents a tendency towards fascism . "
Six weeks after Jones released his list , two Los Angeles county sheriffs arrived unannounced at Professor Miguel Tinker - Salas 's office at Pomona College and started asking questions .
Tinker - Salas , a Latin American history professor , was born in Venezuela and is a vocal critic of US policy in the region .
The sheriffs , part of a federal anti-terrorism task force , told him that he was not the subject of an investigation .
Then , for the next 25 minutes they quizzed him on whether he had been influenced in any way by or had contact with the Venezuelan government , on the leadership within the local Venezuelan community , the consulate and the embassy .
Then they questioned his students about the content of his classes , examined the cartoons on his door .
" They cast the Venezuelan community as a threat , " says Tinker - Salas .
" I think they were fishing to see if I had any information they could use . "
Pomona 's president , David Oxtoby , says he was " extremely concerned about the chilling effect this kind of intrusive government interest could have on free scholarly and political discourse . "
Last year , some students at the Department of Middle Eastern and Asian Languages and Cultures at Columbia University ran a campaign against alleged anti-Israeli bias among professors , criticising the university as a place where pro-Israeli students were intimidated and faculty members were prejudiced .
A faculty committee appointed by Columbia concluded that there had been no serious misconduct .
These issues are not confined to university campuses : it is also happening in schools .
Since February , the normally sleepy , wealthy district of Upper St Clair in Pennsylvania has been riven with arguments over its curriculum after the local school board banned the International Baccalaureate ( IB ) , the global educational programme , for being an " un-American " marxist and anti-Christian .
During their election campaign , the Republicans of Upper St Clair referred to the IB , which is offered in 122 countries and whose student intake has risen by 73 % worldwide in the past five years , as though it was part of an international communist conspiracy , suspicious of a curriculum that had been " developed in a foreign country " ( Switzerland ) .
" Our country was founded on Judeo - Christian values and we have to be careful about what values our children are taught , " said one Republican board member .
Similar campaigns have also sprung up recently at school boards in Minnesota and Virginia .
Meanwhile , in January in Aurora , Colorado , social studies teacher Jay Bennish answered questions in his world geography class about President George Bush 's speech from his students at Overland High School .
Caricaturing Bush 's speech , Bennish said , " ' It 's our duty as Americans to use the military to go out into the world and make the world like us . ' "
He then continued : " Sounds a lot like the things Adolf Hitler used to say : ' We 're the only ones who are right , everyone else is backwards and it's our job to conquer the world and make sure they all live just like we want them to . '
Now I 'm not saying that Bush and Hitler are exactly the same .
Obviously they 're not , OK ?
But there are some eerie similarities to the tones they use . "
Unbeknown to him , one 16 - year - old student , Sean Allen , recorded part of the class on his MP3 player .
When his Republican father heard it he was so incensed that he shopped it around to local conservative radio stations , where it finally found a home with radio talk - show host Mike Rosen .
Later in Bennish 's class , the teacher had told his students , " I am not in any way implying that you should agree with me .
I do n't even know if I 'm necessarily taking a position .
But what I 'm trying to get you to do is to think , all right , about these issues more in depth , and not just take things from the surface .
And I 'm glad you asked all your questions because they 're all very good , legitimate questions . "
Rosen only played the first part of the tape on his programme .
He also put it on the internet .
The next day , the Cherry Creek school district suspended Bennish , arguing that he had at least breached a policy requiring teachers to be " as objective as possible and to present fairly the several sides of an issue " when dealing with religious , political , economic or social issues .
The suspension sparked rival demonstrations at school .
Hundreds of students staged a walkout , a few wearing duct tape over their mouths while some chanted , " Freedom of speech , let him teach . "
A smaller demonstration was staged against Bennish , with students writing " Teach do n't preach " on their shirts .
But it has primarily been universities that have been on the frontline .
And on the other side of the trenches has been the rightwing firebrand David Horowitz .
Horowitz , who had Jones on his payroll but fired him after the taping controversy , was raised by communist parents and was himself a marxist as a teenager .
He is involved with Campus Watch , Jihad Watch , Professors Watch and Media Watch ; he was also connected to discoverthenetworks.org , which targeted Gilroy .
A few years ago he founded a group , Students for Academic Freedom , which boasts chapters promoting his agenda on more than 150 campuses .
The movement monitors slights or insults that students say they have suffered and provides an online complaint form .
Students are advised to write down " the date , class and name of the professor " , get witnesses , " accumulate a list of incidents or quotes " , and lodge a complaint .
Over the past three years Horowitz has led the call for an academic bill of rights in several states .
The bills would allow students to opt out of any part of a course they felt was " personally offensive " and force American universities to adopt quotas for conservative professors as well as monitor the political inclinations of their staff .
The bill has been debated in 23 states , including six this year .
In July , Pennsylvania approved legislation calling on 14 state - affiliated colleges to free their campuses from the " imposition of ideological orthodoxy " .
Meanwhile , House Republicans have included a provision in the Higher Education
Act which calls on publicly funded colleges to ensure a diversity of ideas in class - code for countering the alleged liberal bias in classrooms .
" The aim of the movement is n't really to achieve legislation , " says Horowitz .
" It 's supposed to act as a cattle prod , to make legislators and universities aware .
The ratio of leftwing professors in Berkeley and Stanford is seven to one and nine to one .
You ca n't get hired if you 're a conservative in American universities . "
Reliable empirical , as opposed to anecdotal , evidence to back up Horowitz 's claim of political imbalance is patchy but rarely contested .
The most detailed study , conducted by California economist Daniel Klein and Swedish scientist Charlotta Stern , did reveal a significant Democratic bias which varied depending on the course they taught .
It showed that 30 times as many anthropologists and sociologists voted Democrat as Republican , while for those teaching economics the ration plummeted to three to one .
But these results gave only a partial account of campus life .
Limiting their research to the social sciences and the humanities excluded a substantial portion of the university experience .
According to the Princeton Review , four of the top 10 most popular subjects - business administration and management , biology , nursing and computer science - are not in the social sciences or humanities .
Republicans are probably more inclined to find a home in some of these disciplines .
In any case , most academics do not deny that there is a progressive , liberal bias in academe .
" Of course , " says Todd Gitlin , a professor of journalism and sociology at the Columbia School of Journalism .
" There 's a lot of conservatives in oil .
But there are n't a lot of conservatives planning on studying sociology . "
And while liberals may be more numerous , argues Schrecker , a professor of history at Yeshiva University in New York , that does not necessarily mean they are more powerful .
" Progressive academe is like the ninth ward of New Orleans before the levees break - neither secure nor particularly safe .
It 's one of the few areas left with some kind of progressive culture . "
That , rather than protection of free expression on campus , is precisely why it remains a target for the right , they say .
In February , Horowitz published a book , The Professors : the 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America , in which he lists , in alphabetical order , the radical academics whom he believes are polluting academe with leftwing propaganda .
" Coming to a campus near you : terrorists , racists , and communists - you know them as The Professors , " reads the blurb on the jacket .
" Today 's radical academics are n't the exception - they 're legion .
And far from being harmless , they spew violent anti-Americanism , preach anti-semitism and cheer on the killing of American soldiers and civilians - all the while collecting tax dollars and tuition fees to indoctrinate our children . "
The book is a sloppy series of character assassinations , relying more heavily on insinuation , inference , suggestion and association than it does on fact .
Take Todd Gitlin , a journalism and sociology professor at Columbia University .
Gitlin was the leader of Students for Democratic Society , a radical anti-war movement in the 60s .
Today , his politics could be described as mainstream liberal .
He supported the war in Afghanistan but not in Iraq and hung out the Stars and Stripes after the terrorist attacks on September 11 .
He has recently written a book , The Intellectuals and the Flag , calling for progressives to embrace a patriotic culture that distinguishes between allegiance to one 's country , which he supports , and loyalty to one 's government , which he does not .
None the less , Horowitz slams him for participating in an anti-war teach - in in March 2003 at which his colleague Nicholas de Genova called for " a million Mogadishus " to be visited on American soldiers in Iraq - referring to the murder of US military in Somalia .
But Gitlin has never met or spoken to Genova and was not participating in the teach - in when Genova spoke .
Horowitz also slates Gitlin for " immersing students in the obscurantist texts of leftists icons like Jürgen Habermas " , but omits to mention that Gitlin also teaches from the works of Plato , Aristotle , Aquinas , Hobbes , Locke , Burke , Adam Smith and the gospels .
" Horowitz 's idea of research is cherry - picking , " says Gitlin .
" And he can't even be trusted to find cherries .
He comes up with bitter prunes . "
Victor Navasky , the Delacorte professor of journalism at Columbia University , is also on Horowitz 's hit list .
Navasky , publisher emeritus of the leftwing magazine The Nation and chairman of the Columbia Journalism Review , is accused of " bankrolling " the review and denounced for organising lectures by " prominent leftists " such as Michael Tomasky of American Prospect and Hendrik Hertzberg of the New Yorker .
Navasky points out that he has also hosted a lecture by Fox news anchor Bill O'Reilly and the editor of the rightwing Weekly Standard at Columbia , and that the only cheque he ever sent the Review was one he returned after the magazine paid him for an article .
" Were it not for all the inaccuracies I would say that I would be flattered to be on the list , but I do n't think I earned it , " says Navasky .
" I do n't think anyone seriously considers me a clear and present danger to the republic . "
Horowitz accuses those who accuse him of McCarthyism of being McCarthyites themselves .
" All they do is tar and feather me with slanders , " he says .
" It 's the politics of Stalinism . "
Evidence to back up his central argument - that these political leanings are at all related to a teacher 's ability to be fair , balanced or competent in class - are non-existent .
Most of the criticisms of lecturers on both the Dirty 30 list and in Horowitz 's book are levelled at comments professors have made outside the classroom and rarely do they provide any evidence of the accused actually criticising or ridiculing students with rightwing ideas .
Nobody denies that bad leftwing lecturers exist .
As Russell Jacoby argued in The Nation , " Higher education in America is a vast enterprise boasting roughly a million professors .
A certain portion of these teachers are incompetents and frauds ; some are rabid patriots and fundamentalists - and some are ham - fisted leftists .
All should be upbraided if they violate scholarly or teaching norms .
At the same time , a certain portion of the 15 million students they teach are fanatics and crusaders . "
It is not their work as professors Horowitz does not like ; it is the ideologies they espouse , whether in or outside the classroom .
Political assaults on intellectuals are not new .
Nor are they specific to the US .
At the dawn of western civilisation , Socrates was executed for filling " young people 's heads with the wrong ideas " .
Mao targeted professors for particular humiliation during the cultural revolution .
Mark Smith , the director of government relations for the professor 's union , the American Association of University Professors , says that these broadsides vary according to the political climate .
Shortly after world war one , the litmus test was those who opposed America 's participation in the war or backed the fledgling Russian revolution ; during the 50s , it was communists ; during the 80s , it was leftwing professors in Latin American studies departments .
During the early 90s , Lynne Cheney , the wife of the current vice - president , was chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities , when she lead the bureaucratic charge against " political correctness " .
In many humanities faculties , she claimed , the common thinking is that " there is no truth .
Everything we think is true is shaped by political interests ...
Since there is no truth ... faculty members are perfectly justified in using the classroom to advance political agendas . "
" These things go in cycles , " says Smith .
" Horowitz did not invent this .
He 's capitalising on an ongoing anti-intellectualism and fear of the other . "
Many believe that this current cycle has intensified as a result of the official response to 9/11 .
Two months after the terrorist attacks , the conservative American Council of Trustees and Alumni ( ACTA ) , founded by Lynne Cheney in 1995 , branded colleges and universities the " weak link in America 's response " to the terrorist attacks and called on lecturers and professors to defend western civilisation .
In a report entitled Defending Civilization : how our universities are failing America and what can be done about it , ACTA president Jerry Martin and vice - president Anne D Neal , wrote : " While faculty should be passionately defended in their right to academic freedom , that does not exempt them from criticism .
The fact is : academe is the only section of American society that is distinctly divided in its response to the attacks on America . "
Regardless of their accuracy , integrity and provenance , some believe that these assaults do have an effect .
" There is a cunning behind the battyness , " says Gitlin .
" It 's not just the self - aggrandisement .
It 's an assault on one of the few social enclaves that the right does n't control .
There is a scattershot bellicosity whether the fortunes of the political right are up or down .
They find it useful for fundraising if nothing else . "
Others argue that while the individual accounts are troubling , their ultimate effect on academe can be exaggerated .
The response to the recent article in the London Review of Books by two prominent American professors arguing that the pro-Israel lobby exerts a dominant and damaging influence on US foreign policy may be a case in point .
Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer have been accused of being anti-semites and bigots , prompting accusations of a McCarthyite witch - hunt .
Shortly after publication , it was announced that one of the authors , Walt , was stepping down from his job as academic dean at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government and the school removed the piece from the front page of its website .
But the Kennedy School and Walt 's colleagues said that the move had long been planned .
Meanwhile , the school explained the website change thus : " The only purpose of that removal was to end public confusion ; it was not intended , contrary to some interpretations , to send any signal that the school was also ' distancing ' itself from one of its senior professors . "
" The University of Chicago and Harvard University have behaved admirably in difficult circumstances .
We have had the full support of our respective institutions , " Mearsheimer said .
So all that is left are the accusations which , given the nature of the original article , not even the authors say surprised them .
People have a right to be offended .
It is when that offence is either based on flawed information or mobilised into an institutional or legislative clampdown that accusations of a witch - hunt truly come into play .
" Clearly these things are disturbing , " says Jon Wiener , professor of history at UCLA .
" But I do n't think they are happening because students are demanding it .
The Bruin Alumni Association [ turned out ] to be one ambitious , well - funded guy .
There are some frightening moments , but then things seem to return to normal . "
" It 's not even clear this is much other than the ill - considered action of a handful , if that , of individuals , " says DuBois .
But however many people are involved , the attacks do make a difference , claims Gilroy .
" Of course it has an effect , " he says .
" There 's a pre-written script you have to follow and if you chose not to follow it , then there are consequences , so you become very self - conscious about what you say .
To call it self - censorship is much too crude .
But everybody is looking over their shoulder " .

That is why some airplane companies decided to put some cheerful advertisements on their planes and make planes more enjoyable ( plus they made some money ) .

Why You Must Eat Chocolate
Two UK - based academics have devised a way to invent new medicines and get them to market at a fraction of the cost charged by big drug companies , enabling millions in poor countries to be cured of infectious diseases and potentially slashing the NHS drugs bill .
Sunil Shaunak , professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College , based at Hammersmith hospital , calls their revolutionary new model " ethical pharmaceuticals " .
Improvements they devise to the molecular structure of an existing , expensive drug turn it technically into a new medicine which is no longer under a 20 - year patent to a multinational drug company and can be made and sold cheaply .
The process has the potential to undermine the monopoly of the big drug companies and bring cheaper drugs not only to poor countries but back to the UK .
Professor Shaunak and his colleague from the London School of Pharmacy , Steve Brocchini , have linked up with an Indian biotech company which will manufacture the first drug - for hepatitis C - if clinical trials in India , sponsored by the Indian government , are successful .
Hepatitis C affects 170 million people worldwide and at least 200,000 in the UK .
Multinational drug companies put the cost of the research and development of a new drug at $ 800 m ( £ 408 m ) .
Professors Shaunak and Brocchini say the cost of theirs will be only a few million pounds .
Imperial College will hold the patent on the hepatitis C drug to prevent anybody attempting to block its development .
The college employs top patent lawyers who also work for some of the big pharmaceutical companies .
Once the drugs have passed through clinical trials and have been licensed in India , the same data could be used to obtain a European licence so that they could be sold to the NHS as well .
Professor Shaunak says it is time that the monopoly on drug invention and production by multinational corporations - which charge high prices because they need to make big profits for their shareholders - was broken .
" The pharmaceutical industry has convinced us that we have to spend billions of pounds to invent each drug , " he said .
" We have spent a few millions .
Yes , it will be a threat to the monopoly that there is .
" I 'm not only an inventor of medicines - I 'm an end user .
We have become so completely dependent on the big pharmaceutical industry to provide all the medicines we use .
" Why should we be completely dependent on them when we do all the creative stuff in the universities ?
Maybe the time has come to say why can't somebody else do it ?
What we have been struck by is that once we have started to do it , it is not so difficult . "
The team 's work on the hepatitis C drug has impeccable establishment credentials , supported by a grant from the Wellcome Trust and help and advice from the Department for Trade and Industry and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office .
But the professors ' ethical pharmaceutical model is unlikely to find much favour with the multinational pharmaceutical companies , which already employ large teams of lawyers to defend the patents which they describe as the lifeblood of the industry .
One industry insider envisaged legal challenges if the new drugs were not genuinely innovative .
It could become " a huge intellectual property issue " , he said .
Even as Viacom sues YouTube for what it describes as " brazen " copyright infringement , some of Viacom 's own dirty copyright laundry is being aired .
Ars searched one Viacom property — iFilm , which was acquired by Viacom in 2005 — and found several instances of infringing video hosted by iFilm — content for which Viacom does not own the copyright .
In its complaint against YouTube , Viacom bemoans the fact that it is required to file DMCA takedown notices for each copyrighted clip it spots on YouTube .
With over 150,000 infringing clips of Viacom properties identified so far , the company believes that YouTube should be working harder to proactively identify and remove infringing videos .
Does Viacom hold its own properties to the same standard ?
We contacted both Viacom corporate and iFilm to ask them if they took steps to proactively identify and remove infringing videos or if they relied on copyright holders to notify them of infringing content .
Some time after publication , Viacom responded with the following statement : " Contributions to iFilm are all screened by iFilm employees prior to posting , to ensure that copyrighted , pornographic or other restricted content is not posted to the site . "
A search using the term " NBA Brawl , " however , returns a number of clips of televised footage of both NBA and college football fights and it is not clear that Viacom owns the copyrights on those clips .
In fact , it looks a lot like what one would find on YouTube .
I talked to Greg Gabriel , a copyright attorney at Kinsella Wietzman Iser Kump & Aldisert , about the issue .
He told me that if Viacom is n't willing to take the same steps with iFilm that it wants YouTube to take with copyrighted content , Viacom may have a harder time making its case before the judge presiding over the case .
" It would have some persuasive value with a judge if YouTube says 'look , they 're ranting and raving about all this infringement occurring on my site and they 're not doing anything about it themselves , ' " said Gabriel .
" YouTube is testing the limits of the DMCA and Viacom is asking them to do something that the letter of the law does not require .
Viacom is really asking the judge to do something extraordinary here . "
As written , the DMCA does not require any type of active monitoring on the part of site owners .
What Viacom wants is for the judge to " make a new interpretation of the law , " as Gabriel describes it .
The problem that Viacom will have in making its argument is that there 's no precedent for the judge to draw upon .
As a result , " Viacom 's own conduct with iFilm will likely be a factor that the judge looks at , " said Gabriel .
Following in the RIAA 's footsteps ?
Some analysts have raised the prospect of a widespread legal attack on the part of Viacom against those who upload copyrighted materials .
Under the DMCA , YouTube must produce all identifying information about a user if they are presented with a subpoena .
It has happened before : in January , YouTube was forced to give Fox all the information it had on users who had uploaded entire episodes of The Simpsons and 24 .
Last year , the video - sharing site turned over data to Paramount in another infringement case .
Viacom could hit YouTube with a blizzard of subpoenas and then use the information received ( e.g. , e- mail address , IP address ) to in turn go after ISPs to discover the identities of those who have uploaded copyrighted content and file infringement suits against them .
It 's not outside the realm of possibility , but it 's extremely unlikely .
No matter where one 's own opinions lie about the legality and morality of file - sharing , almost all observers agree that the RIAA 's jihad against individual file - sharers has been nothing short of a public relations nightmare .
Although Viacom has demonstrated that it is willing to go beyond saber - rattling and take on another huge company in court , it 's very doubtful that it will have the stomach for a large - scale battle against its fans — even if it would provide lots of fodder for The Colbert Report .
There is a clear generational divide on the issue of evolution ; nearly two - thirds ( 63 % ) of Gen Nexters believe humans and other living things evolved over time , while only 33 % say all living creatures have existed in their present form since the beginning of time .
Gen Xers share a similar perspective , though they are slightly more open to the idea of creationism .
Here the generational divide is among those under age 40 and those over age 40 , with Baby Boomers and Seniors closely divided over how the world came to be .

Hopefully this will be crossposted in several places .
My current plan to change the world involves writing a manifesto for a proposed mailing list to work out crypto standards that actually work and stand a chance of getting widely adopted in the open source world .
This is essentially version 0.1.5 of that rant , and may contain some inaccuracies or overstatements ; I look forward to your comments and corrections .
Currently there are four crypto standards that see any real use in open source land ; in order of deployment , they are :
SSL / TLS
SSH
OpenPGP / GnuPG
IPSec
These are the best examples of good practice that we cite when we ’re trying to encourage people to use standards rather than make it up , and all of them fail to be any good as a practical , convenient basis by which people writing open source software can make their software more secure through cryptography .
All of them suffer from three problems ; in order of increasing severity
They are all designed long ago , in three cases initially by people who were not cryptographers , and are difficult to adapt to new knowledge in the crypto world about how to build good secure software .
As a result , deprecated constructions for which there are no good security reductions are common .
They are also generally far less efficient than they need to be , which would be a very minor problem if it did n’t put people off using them .
In every case protocols and file formats introduce far more complexity than is needed to get the job done , and often this shows up as complexity for the users and administrators trying to make them work , as well as unnecessary opportunities to make them insecure through misconfiguration .
But by far the worst of all is the parlous state of PKI .
This of course is something I ’ve ranted about before : SSL ’s dependence on the disaster that is X.509 makes it insecure , painful for clients , and imposes the ridiculous Verisign Tax on servers , as well as making it very unattractive as a platform for new software development .
SSH occasionally shows you a dialog saying “ you have n’t connected to this server before , are you sure ? ”
I ’m sure someone ’s going to tell me they actually check the fingerprints before connecting , but let me assure you , you are practically alone in this .
I ca n’t even share this information across all the machines I log in from , even if I use ssh-agent .
The situation for authenticating clients to servers is slightly better , but still involves copying private keys about by hand if you want the most convenience out of it .
It makes you copy whole public keys rather than something shorter and more convenient like OpenPGP fingerprints .
It certainly does n’t make use of the basic fact that keys can sign assertions about other keys to make life more convenient .
OpenPGP ’s authentication is based on the PGP Web of Trust , which is all about binding keys to real names using things like passports .
As I ’ve argued before , this is a poor match for what people actually want keys to do ; it ’s a very poor match for authenticating anything other than a person .
IPSec is also tied to the X.509 disaster .
It is also so complex and hard to set up that AFAICT most IPSec installations do n’t use public key cryptography at all .
Perhaps the key management problems in all these applications can be pinned down to one thing : they were all designed and deployed before Zooko ’s triangle was articulated with sufficient clarity to understand the options available .
It ’s worth noting one other infuriating consequence of the PKI problems these applications display : none of them really talk to each other .
You can buy an X.509 certificate that will do for both your SSL and IPSec applications , if you ’re really rich ; these certificates will cost you far more than a normal SSL certificate , and for no better reason than that they are more useful and so Verisign and their friends are going to ream you harder for them .
Apart from that , each application is an island that will not help you get the others set up at all .
I ’ve left out WEP / WPA basically because it ’s barely even trying .
It should never have existed , and would n’t have if IPSec had been any good .
I ’m now in the position of wanting to make crypto recommendations for the next generation of the Monotone revision control system .
I wish I had a better idea what to tell them .
They need transport - level crypto for server - to - server connections , but I hesitate to recommend SSL because the poison that is X.509 is hard to remove and it makes all the libraries for using SSL ugly and hard to use .
They need to sign things , but I do n’t want to recommend OpenPGP : it ’s hard to talk to and the Web of Trust is a truly terrible fit for their problem ; on top of which , OpenPGP has no systematic way to assert the type of what you ’re signing .
They need a way for one key to make assertions about another , and we ’re going to invent all that from scratch because nothing out there is even remotely suitable .
Monotone has re-invented all the crypto for everything it does , and may be about to again .
And in doing so , it ’s repeating what many , many open source applications have done before , in incompatible and ( always ) broken ways , because the existing standards demand too much of them and give back too little in return .
As a result , crypto goes unused in practically all the circumstances where it would be useful , and in the rare case that it is used it is at best inconvenient and unnecessarily insecure .
I do n’t believe that things are better in the closed source world either ; in fact they are probably worse .
I just care more about what happens in the open source world .
We can do better than this .
Let ’s use what we ’ve learned in the thirty - odd years there ’s been a public crypto community to do something better .
Let ’s leave the vendors out , with their gratuitous complexity and incompatibility as commercial interests screw up the standards process , and write our own standards that we ’ll actually feel like working with .
We can make useful software without their support , and it seems in this instance that their support is worse than useless .
A good starting point is SPKI .
SPKI has a very nice , clean syntax that ’s easy to work with in any programming language , very straightforward semantics , and supports constructions that anticipate the central ideas behind petnames and Zooko ’s Triangle .
Unfortunately SPKI seems to be abandoned today ; the feeling when I last looked at it was that despite their inadequacies , the victory of PKIX and X.509 was now inevitable and resistance was futile .
Well , it turns out that X.509 was so bad that no amount of industry support could turn it into the universal standard for key management applications .
There are places that it will simply never be able to go , and in fact these are the vast majority of real crypto applications .
On top of which , there is a limit to how far a standard that hardly anyone will ever understand the application of can go .
It ’s time we brought back SPKI .
But more than that , it ’s time we adapted it for the times it finds itself in ; take out the parts that complicate it unnecessarily or slow its adoption , extend it to do more than just PKI , and specify how it can talk to the existing broken cryptographic applications in as useful a way as possible .
Once we ’ve built a working petnames system to serve as a workable PKI , my current feeling is that we should start with no lesser a goal than replacing all of the standards listed above .
Does anyone else think this sounds like a good idea ?
What other way forward is there ?
by
The central authority that runs AACS ( the anticopying / DRM system used on commercial HD - DVD and Blu-ray discs ) announced [ April 6 , 2007 item ] last week the reissue of some software players that can play the discs , “ [ i ] n response to attacks against certain PC - based applications ” .
The affected applications include WinDVD and probably others .
Recall that analysts had previously extracted from software players a set of decryption keys sufficient to decrypt any disc sold thus far .
The authority could have responded to these attacks by blacklisting the affected applications or their decryption keys , which would have limited the effect of the past attacks but would have rendered the affected applications unable to play discs , even for law - abiding customers – that ’s too much collateral damage .
To reduce the harm to law - abiding customers , the authority apparently required the affected programs to issue free online updates , where the updates contain new software along with new decryptions keys .
This way , customers who download the update will be able to keep playing discs , even though the the software ’s old keys wo n’t work any more .
The attackers ’ response is obvious : they ’ll try to analyze the new software and extract the new keys .
If the software updates changed only the decryption keys , the attackers could just repeat their previous analysis exactly , to get the new keys .
To prevent this , the updates will have to restructure the software significantly , in the hope that the attackers will have to start their analysis from scratch .
The need to restructure the software explains why several months expired between the attacks and this response .
New keys can be issued quickly , but restructuring software takes time .
The studios reportedly postponed some planned disc releases to wait for the software reissue .
It seems inevitable that the attackers will succeed , within a month or so , in extracting keys from the new software .
Even if the guts of the new software are totally unlike the old , this time the attackers will be better organized and will know more about how AACS works and how implementations tend to store and manage keys .
In short , the attackers ’ advantage will be greater than it was last time .
When the attackers manage to extract the new keys , a new round of the game will start .
The player software will have to be restructured again so that a new version with new keys can replace the old .
Then it will be the attackers ’ turn , and the game will continue .
It ’s a game that inherently favors the attackers .
In my experience , software analysts always beat the obfuscators , if the analysts are willing to work hard , as they are here .
Every round of the game , the software authors will have to come up with new and unexpected tricks for restructuring their software – tricks that will have to resist the attackers ’ ever - growing suite of analysis tools .
And each time the attackers succeed , they ’ll be able to decrypt all existing discs .
We can model the economic effect of this game .
The key parameter is the attackers ’ reaction time , that is , how long it takes the attackers to extract keys from each newly issued version of the player software .
If this time is short – say , a few weeks – then the AACS authority wo n’t benefit much from playing this game , and the authority would be nearly as well off if it simply gave up and let the extracted keys remain valid and the exploited software stay in the field .
My guess is that the attackers will extract keys from the new software within about three weeks of its availability .
Website Launch Flowchart
With our roots in the entrepreneurial world , we frequently get involved with clients at the very beginning of both their business and website .
To be as helpful as possible , we thought ‘ would n’t it be nice to have something visual that shows everything we intend to do ” .
Off we went to our trusty search engines , searching for things like website design , website development and our new favorite ‘ website launch ’ .
While there were some fairly straightforward charts for website design , nothing really captured the essence of what we do – take people from nothing to fully functional websites that are capable of generating income .
So we put together the website launch flowchart – what we refer to internally as our optimized design methodology .
So more people have a visual guide to see how optimized web design , development and marketing come together , we wanted to make our flowchart available .
Web design does n’t exist in a vacuum nor does marketing .
The most optimized , easiest functioning and best performing sites are those that find a balance between design , content , business tool complexity and marketing integration .
Basically the flowchart can be broken down into a few sections ( which may or may not be specifically applicable to any given project ) .
We start by understanding the purpose of the site and create some initial ideas around it ( since we ’re a business we generally create a proposal from the specification ) .
Once the project is underway , we revisit the initial ideas and start to develop them more thoroughly – we utilize wireframes , work on a basic information architecture and begin to develop an integrated online marketing strategy ( launch and ongoing ) .
We may also have to create logos or other business identity pieces , but let ’s assume that ’s been done .
After approval , we begin work on 2 parallel paths , content assembly and business tool integration .
Basically , we pull all the text , images and other media together and connect it to whatever is driving the site features – database , CMS , shopping cart , etc .
We also plug in some type of analytics .
All the while , we ’re keeping an eye on what marketing channels we ’re going to use and making sure there are n’t any conflicting requirements .
Once all this is put together , the site is pretty close to launch capable , but it ’s usually still hidden away on one of our test servers .
When it ’s been tested and given the green light by our client , we go live and it ’s off to the marketing races .
Often , we ’ll even begin some of the marketing before launch .
Since pictures are easier to understand than jumbles of words , we hope this provides you with a single visual reference that captures the full website launch process .

US : Circle of corruption widens in student loan investigation
By Naomi Spencer
7 May 2007
As investigations continue into improper financial dealings between the student loan industry and universities , more schools , companies , and federal officials have been implicated .
Most recently , evidence demonstrates that the US Department of Education has increasingly helped promote the interests of lenders by rejecting any federal regulation of the relationship between the banks and schools .
In 2001 , the Bush administration quashed a Department of Education proposal to curb loan industry gifts to schools and financial aid officials , the Washington Post reported in a front - page article May 1 .
The proposed policy had been drafted near the end of the Clinton administration in response to the growing number of loan companies seeking to ply schools with financial “ inducements ” in exchange for access to students .
The proposal addressed one aspect of the entangled relationship between banks and universities .
It would have made it a violation for a lender to offer “ something of value ” to a university at which at least 20 percent of the school ’s loan volume flowed to that lender .
Notwithstanding this revelation , on May 3 the department moved to reopen the federal student loan database to private lenders .
The loan industry was shut out two weeks ago after it was discovered that lenders had been mining the database , which contains borrowing history and other confidential information of 60 million students .
Loan companies used information to solicit students with predatory offers , often with misleading , official - sounding names and conditions .
University tuition has continued to increase in recent years , even as governmental need - based grant aid has declined .
As a result , millions of students and their families have been forced to finance much of their tuition and fees with private , for - profit loans .
Over the past decade , loan volume has doubled , mainly though a 730 percent increase in private loan volume .
US college graduates now carry debt burdens averaging $ 18,000 .
After exhausting federal aid , many families have turned to campus aid officials for what they thought was impartial loan advice , or relied on their university ’s “ preferred lenders ” list , a list of lenders that many students assume offer the lowest rates .
According to New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ’s office , approximately 90 percent of student borrowers choose their lenders from their school ’s preferred lender lists .
Exploiting this arrangement , loan companies have cultivated relations with school administrators by providing financial incentives and rewards , allegedly in exchange for preferred lender status and higher loan volume .
Many university loan officers were lavished with all - expenses - paid vacations , gifts , bonuses , and stock in loan companies .
Education Department documents obtained by the Post indicated that loan industry executives had approached the federal agency asking what the limits on financial inducements to aid directors were .
“ We have been asked to provide guidance on whether certain practices of [ private ] lenders and guaranty agencies are considered to be prohibited inducements , ” John Reeves , a Clinton - appointed Office of Federal Student Aid manager wrote in 2001 .
“ We are particularly concerned with allegations that some lenders and guaranty agencies have attempted to hide or disguise an impermissible offer . ”
In response , Reeves and the Student Aid office ’s chief operating officer , Greg Woods , drafted the proposal , called “ subregulatory guidance . ”
However , the proposal was rejected by Bush appointees , many of whom either came to the Education Department directly from executive positions in the loan industry or accepted high - paying loan industry positions after leaving agency posts .
One such official at the time , Jeffrey Andrade , who came from Sallie Mae and is now executive vice president of private student loan company US Education Finance Group , called the measures “ very draconian . ”
“ We were like , ‘ No , we ’re not going to drop a bomb on the lending community with these wacko ideas , ’ “ he told the Post .
Instead , department officials suggested that lenders draft their own voluntary guidelines for financial inducements , which predictably came to nothing .
Revealingly , Andrade , who in his capacity as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Education pushed for the liquidation of the federal direct loan program , said that , if implemented , half of the nation ’s schools would have been in violation of the subregulatory guidance .
In recent weeks , investigations led by Cuomo ’s office have singled out 22 institutions , 18 lending and banking firms , 90 alumni groups , and numerous school and government officials in revenue - sharing arrangements .
The investigation has expanded to include nearly 100 schools .
None of the subjects under investigation have been criminally charged .
On May 3 , Cuomo ’s office announced it was sending subpoenas to dozens of alumni associations for information on their paid sponsorships of loan companies .
Lenders trying to sell consolidation loans to graduates have established payment and award schemes with campus alumni groups in order to access the names and contact information of former students holding multiple loans .
Marketing materials sent to these graduates typically carry university and alumni association logos , falsely implying an endorsement made on the basis of quality .
Cuomo ’s office also sent a subpoena to the loan corporation Nelnet , which has marketing arrangements with more than 100 alumni associations .
The 22 schools found in conflict of interest have agreed to adopt a code of conduct prohibiting them from receiving “ anything of value from any lending institution in exchange for any advantage sought by the lending institution , ” with their employees barred from accepting “ anything of more than nominal value .
” Eight schools have agreed to reimburse students a total of $ 3 million for the estimated amount their revenue - sharing agreements cost borrowers .
Rampant conflicts of interest have been uncovered within school aid offices .
For example , financial aid call centers at several universities have been found to be covertly run by for - profit loan companies including Nelnet and Sallie Mae under school names and numbers .
When students thought they were getting advice from university aid councilors , they were actually speaking to company representatives falsely identifying themselves as school employees .
The New York attorney general ’s office announced April 30 that New York art school Pratt Institute made such a deal with Education Finance Partners in 2005 , whereby the lender would provide need - based grant money if Pratt students took out a total of $ 1 million in loans .
As the New York Times reported May 1 , the company was gouging Pratt borrowers for 15 percent interest , or more than double the 6.8 percent rate on federal loans and higher than many credit card rates .
This predatory arrangement is by no means unique .
Cuomo ’s office stated in March that Education Finance Partners had established revenue sharing schemes at more than 60 other colleges .
The company subsequently paid $ 2.5 million into a fund created by the New York attorney general ’s office to educate prospective borrowers about student loans .
Together with Education Finance Partners , lending giants Sallie Mae and Citibank have paid a total of $ 6.5 million into consumer education funds for their improper relations with schools .
CIT Group , JP Morgan Chase , and Bank of America are also implicated by the investigations .
Nebraska - based lender Nelnet hastily drafted its own $ 1 million settlement April 27 with the state attorney general , but is still under investigation by Cuomo ’s office .
While the million - dollar settlements are trumpeted by some as a return of oversight , these payments are less than pocket change to the lending industry .
Nelnet alone holds $ 23.8 billion in student loan assets .
Sallie Mae , which paid $ 2 million , is the nation ’s largest student loan company , with $ 127 billion in loans .
Citigroup , which also paid $ 2 million into the loan education fund , is the largest company in the world , with total assets of more than $ 2 trillion .
The fines will also have no effect on the underlying problem — the explosion of university and college tuition and the drying up of federal aid , which has forced students into the hands of private lenders .
Some Democrats have seized on the issue of student loans because it allows them to posture as defenders of students .
However , university tuition has been increasing steadily for decades , and did not let up during the Clinton administration .
Democrats , now in control of Congress , have not proposed any serious measures to deal with the increasing financial problems confronting students .
Anyone who 's seen too many movies will tell you that even the weakest , ugliest , stupidest ducklings can be transformed into swans .
However , you can't make this sort of change on your own - you need a mentor .
Knowledgeable , wise and charismatic , movie mentors seem to have all the answers , and they 'll share their wisdom with you , usually via a few quick montages or training sequences .
The twenty or so gentlemen you see below are the best of the best of the best - collected in those noggins is enough raw information to put Google out of business .
If you want to know how to hit on women , defeat your enemies or just succeed in life , then look no further ; it 'll be tough , but kid ... if it 's in you , they 'll find it .
20 . CHAZZ REINHOLD in WEDDING CRASHERS
Chazz is something of a living legend .
Spoken of in hushed tones like he 's a modern - day Buddha , he 's the man who stood atop Man mountain and held aloft the new commandments ; the rules to crashing weddings and scoring with horny chicks who 've just seen their best friends married .
When budding crasher John meets Chazz in person , he 's not quite as imagined - he 's wearing a loose fitting dressing gown , lives with his mother and really likes meat loaf - but he 's still got it .
He 's now turned his hand to crashing funerals , because as he says , grief is nature 's most powerful aphrodisiac .
It 's a technique that works , so give him credit where it 's due : " It 's like fishing with dynamite ! "
Wise words : " Her boyfriend just died in a hand - gliding accident .
What an idiot ! "
19 . PAI MEI in KILL BILL VOL .
2
To be a good mentor , you have to be cruel to be kind , so when Bill takes hot young prot�g � Beatrix Kiddo to see head priest of the White Lotus Clan , Pai Mei , she 's guaranteed anything but an easy ride .
Pai Mei mocks
Kiddo's sword - fighting abilities , has her punch through solid wood until her knuckles are a pulp and even makes her eat rice with chopsticks - the bastard !
But it was all worthwhile , as Beatrix learned a few tricks that ultimately saved her life , not least that old five - point palm exploding heart technique - handy when faced with an ex-love / villain who just wo n't stop talking about fucking Superman .
Bill 's other blonde bombshell Elle Driver learned the hard way just how harsh a teacher Pai Mei was ; he plucked out her eye for her insolence .
And because ... y'know , it looked cool .
Wise words : " Your so - called kung fu is really quite pathetic . "
18 . JUAN SANCHEZ VILLA - LOBOS RAMIREZ in HIGHLANDER
That five - barrelled mouthful of a name is n't fooling anyone - Ramirez is cinema 's least convincing Spaniard .
Sean Connery might chew on his accent like you or I might chew on bubblegum ( his pupil , Christopher Lambert , is n't exactly the world 's greatest linguist either ) , but if Connor McLeod is to realise that there can be only one , then he 's going to need all of Ramirez ' tutelage .
Clad in fine 16th century Spanish garments that only the best fancy dress shops can offer , JSV - LR ( it 's just quicker that way ) teaches McLeod how to handle a sword like a true immortal , not to mention dropping in the valuable information that getting decapitated will cause him to die .
He meets his match when faced with the dastardly Kurgan , but defied the rules of immortality ( and logic ) when he re-appeared in the sequel , Highlander II : The Quickening .
Wise words : " If your head comes away from your neck , it 's over ! "
17 . PATCHES O'HOULIHAN in DODGEBALL
How does an underdog sports team change from a bunch of rag -tag losers to genuine tournament contenders ?
Everybody needs a mentor !
The members of Average Joe 's gym looked like a bunch of retards trying to fuck a doorknob before retired Dodgeball champion Patches O'Houlihan came along and beat them into shape with an array of blunt instruments .
Kooky though he may have been - he liked drinking his own urine and always had a hooker or two waiting in his room - there was a method in his madness , not least the invaluable ' 5 D's ' : Dodge , duck , dip , dive and ... uh , dodge .
He met an ironic end beneath a falling ' Luck of the Irish ' neon sign , but his flawless tactics took Average Joe 's all the way to the final of the Las Vegas international open .
God bless you Patches , may you enjoy many a hooker in heaven .
Wise words : " You 're about as much use as a cock - flavoured lollipop . "
16 . PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER in the X - MEN movies
This folically - challenged swot is the cornerstone of the X - Men , despite being something of a fire hazard .
Being bald and disabled might be enough to make lesser men reach for the bleach , but not our Chuck ; harnessing his trippy mind powers for the good of mutant kind , he started Xavier 's School For Mutants and formed the Marvel universe 's most awesome bunch of shit - kickers .
Cool and collected , he 's the perfect foil to the attributes of his students : he curbs Wolverine 's rage , keeps Jean Grey 's incredible power in check and even gives Storm odd - jobs around the mansion when she 's bored .
Xavier also earns bonus points for living in a giant mansion and owning a stealth jet ; more than you can say for his nemesis Magneto , who probably only starts trouble out of jealousy .
Wise words : " Are mutants the next link in the evolutionary chain or simply a new species of humanity fighting for their share of the world ? "

Reports that the new website of the President of Iran is trying to install malicious scripts on the PCs of visiting infidels are almost certainly the result of a false alarm by security packages rather than a hostile attack .
The new weblog of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made a splash in Western media when it launched earlier this week .
In the first posting on the site , the bricklayer - look - alike - turned - Persian - President talks about his early childhood in a village west of Tehran , his admiration for the leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah Khomeini and his antipathy for US foreign policy , particularly referencing the " Great Satan 's " attempts to overthrow Iran 's government and support for Israel .
The weblog site - www.ahmadinejad.ir - is available in Farsi , Arabic , English and French and contains links for RSS fields as well as a picture gallery of the leader himself .
Commentators were quick to note the continuing internet censorship by the Iranian government , pointing to a recent campaign targeting dissident bloggers .
Others pointed to the site 's sloppy design which " failed all of the standard validation tests " , The Telegraph notes .
Meanwhile , an Israeli blogger reports that browsing on the site generated a security alert from her Norton Internet Security software .
Symantec 's popular consumer security package reported that the site was attempting to exploit a vulnerability in Internet Explorer , as part of a potential malware attack , when Yael K , who maintain her own blog on immigrating to Israel , visited links from the President of Iran 's website .
She suggests the attack may be targeted specifically at surfers visiting the site from Israel .
Symantec is yet to respond to our requests for comment on the alert generated by its firewall software .
But other security experts we asked found no evidence of malicious behaviour on the site .
" The most likely explanation is that there is some scripting on the site that , although not malicious , triggers an alert from Symantec 's firewall software , " said Carole Theriault , senior security consultant at UK - based net security firm Sophos .
" It is possible that malicious content has once been on the site , but has since been removed .
It is also theoretically possible , though very unlikely in our opinion , that the malicious content targeted visitors from an Israeli address , " she added . ®
1. Einstein Liked His Feet Naked
" When I was young , I found out that the big toe always ends up making a hole in the sock , " he once said .
" So I stopped wearing socks . "
Einstein was also a fanatical slob , refusing to " dress properly " for anyone .
Either people knew him or they did n't , he reasoned - so it did n't matter either way .
2. Einstein Hated Scrabble
Aside from his favourite past - time sailing ( " the sport which demands the least energy " ) , Einstein shunned any recreational activity that required mental agility .
As he told the New York Times , " When I get through with work I do n't want anything that requires the working of the mind . "
3. Einstein Was A Rotten Speller
Although he lived for many years in the United States and was fully bilingual , Einstein claimed never to be able to write in English because of " the treacherous spelling " .
He never lost his distinctive German accent either , summed up by his catch - phrase " I vill a little t'ink " .
4. Einstein Loathed Science Fiction
Lest it distort pure science and give people the false illusion of scientific understanding , he recommended complete abstinence from any type of science fiction .
" I never think of the future .
It comes soon enough . "
He also thought people who claimed to have seen flying saucers should keep it to themselves .
5. Einstein Smoked Like A Chimney
A life member of the Montreal Pipe Smokers Club , Einstein was quoted as saying : " Pipe smoking contributes to a somewhat calm and objective judgment of human affairs . "
He once fell into the water during a boating expedition but managed heroically to hold on to his pipe .
6. Einstein Was n't Much Of A Musician
Einstein would relax in his kitchen with his trusty violin , stubbornly trying to improvise something of a tune .
When that did n't work , he'd have a crack at Mozart .
7. Alcohol Was Not Einstein ’s Preferred Drug
At a press conference upon his arrival to New York in 1930 , he said jokingly of Prohibition : " I do n't drink , so it 's all the same to me . "
In fact , Einstein had been an outspoken critic of " passing laws which cannot be enforced " .
8. Einstein Equated Monogamy With Monotony
" All marriages are dangerous , " he once told an interviewer .
" Marriage is the unsuccessful attempt to make something lasting out of an incident . "
He was notoriously unfaithful as a husband , prone to falling in love with somebody else directly after the exchanging of vows .
9. Einstein ’s Memory Was Shot
Believing that birthdays were for children , his attitude is summed up in a letter he wrote to his girlfriend Mileva Maric : " My dear little sweetheart ... first , my belated cordial congratulations on your birthday yesterday , which I forgot once again . "
10 . Einstein ’s Cat Suffered Depression
Fond of animals , Einstein kept a housecat which tended to get depressed whenever it rained .
Ernst Straus recalls him saying to the melancholy cat : " I know what 's wrong , dear fellow , but I do n't know how to turn it off . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks slumped Friday , at the end of the worst week on Wall Street in four years , as worries about growth at home and abroad caused investors to stage a mass exodus .
Technology and commodity companies were especially hard - hit , but nearly all stocks in the Dow were down by Friday 's close .
Quick Vote
Is the stock selloff just a blip or the start of a longer downturn ?
Blip
Longer slump
Too early to say or View results
The Dow Jones industrial average ( Charts ) lost 120 points or about 1 percent , while the broader S&P 500 ( Charts ) index fell 1.1 percent .
The tech - fueled Nasdaq ( Charts ) composite fell 1.5 percent .
The major gauges have fallen for three of the last four sessions .
For the week , the Dow lost 4.2 percent and saw its worst decline on a percentage basis since the end of March 2003 .
The S&P 500 lost 4.4 percent for the week , in its worst weekly performance since late Jan. 2003 .
The Nasdaq composite lost 5.8 percent this week and saw its worst five - day percentage drop since August 2004 .
The major gauges had been on an 8 - month upswing that had left the Dow at its highest point ever , and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq at more than 6 - year highs .
After such a run up , stocks were vulnerable to a bit of a pullback - and a steep selloff in the Shanghai market Tuesday got the ball rolling .
The selloff in Chinese markets spread to a variety of world markets , including the U.S. - which also got hit by a weak durable goods orders report and hawkish comments from former Fed chief Alan Greenspan on the economy .
The Dow ended up losing 416 points Tuesday - registering its biggest one - day point drop since the day the market reopened after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
Stocks barely stabilized Wednesday and then declined anew Thursday and Friday .
Stocks briefly flirted with positive territory near midday Friday , before giving up and falling even more through the close .
" This is a market that 's trying to find the bottom , " said Art Hogan , chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co . " Until we get global stability , we 're going to be hard - pressed to find confidence in domestic markets .
Investors will be watching global markets closely next week . "
He said that U.S. declines were based on broad - based concern , rather than worries about a specific sector of the economy .
" You have all three broad market indices down similar percentages , " he added .
" This is n't a sector call ; this is a broader market call . "
However , after an 8 - month rally , a selloff was n't entirely surprising and not necessarily a sign that the 4 - 1/2 - year - old bull market is dying .
" I think we 've seen a correction this week , not the start of something bigger , " said Douglas Roberts , managing principal at Channel Capital Research .
" We 're seeing a lot of fear in the market , yet the fundamental economic conditions have n't changed . "
The supportive economic environment - slower , but not too slow growth , paired with declining inflation - should help stocks going forward , although there could be more downside in the short term .
Among stock movers , 28 out of 30 Dow components fell on the session .
The biggest decliners were General Motors ( down $ 0.92 to $ 30.62 , Charts ) , Citigroup ( down $ 1.11 to $ 49.97 , Charts ) and JP Morgan ( down $ 1.01 to $ 48.19 , Charts ) .
Another Dow component , Boeing ( Charts ) , said it had taken the first step toward shutting down production of the C - 17 military jet , a move that could cost 7,000 jobs by 2009 , due to lack of additional orders for the aircraft .
Dow stock Merck ( up $ 0.20 to $ 44.19 , Charts ) managed to end a bit higher , while AIG ( up $ 2.13 to $ 69.54 , Charts ) jumped 3.2 percent .
AIG rose after reporting higher quarterly earnings late Thursday that nonetheless missed analysts ' forecasts .
The financial company also said it would buy back $ 5 billion in stock in 2007 as part of a broader $ 8 billion stock buyback plan .
Among tech movers , a variety of stocks declined , including heavily traded companies , such as Cisco Systems ( down $ 0.55 to $ 25.30 , Charts ) , Intel ( down $ 0.37 to $ 19.22 , Charts ) , Applied Materials ( down $ 0.47 to $ 17.98 , Charts ) , eBay ( down $ 1.10 to $ 30.83 , Charts ) and Google ( down $ 9.55 to $ 438.68 , Charts ) .
Novell ( down $ 0.26 to $ 6.45 , Charts ) reported a quarterly loss late Thursday , down from a profit a year ago .
Analysts were expecting a 1 - cent - a- share profit , on average .
Shares of the software - maker sank 3.8 percent Friday .
Dell ( up $ 0.17 to $ 23.18 , Charts ) inched higher despite its mixed earnings report , released late Thursday .
The PC - maker reported lower quarterly earnings that topped estimates on lower quarterly revenue that missed estimates .
The company also cautioned that growth and profit margins will be limited during the next few quarters .
Among other gainers , Palm ( Charts ) rallied 111 percent on reports that the maker of the Treo smart phone could be the subject of a takeover attempt by Nokia ( Charts ) .
Market breadth was negative .
On the New York Stock Exchange , losers beat winners 3 to 1 on volume of 1.86 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , decliners topped advancers by almost 3 to 1 on volume of 2.39 billion shares .
Also in focus : comments from Fed speakers .
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole , speaking at a business luncheon in Santiago , Chile , said the economy was not headed for a recession .
Poole 's comments were in contrast to comments made by former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , who said earlier in the week that a recession was possible , though not likely , later this year .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke speaks at Stanford University in California this evening .
On the economic front , investors eyed the revised reading on February consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan .
The index fell to 91.3 from the originally reported 93.3 .
Economists surveyed by Briefing .com thought it would hold steady .
In currency trading , the dollar fell modestly versus the euro and more aggressively versus the yen .
The yen surged anew as investors continued to close out carry trades , or bets on riskier currencies , bought by borrowing in the currencies of countries with low interest rates , like Japan .
Treasury prices rallied , lowering the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note to 4.50 percent from 4.55 percent late Thursday .
Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions .
U.S. light crude oil for April delivery fell 36 cents to settle at $ 61.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .

India banned gender selection and selective abortion in 1994
The minister for women and child development , Renuka Chowdhury , told BBC News the cradles would be " everywhere " .
It is the latest initiative to try to wipe out the practice of female foeticide and female infanticide .
A girl child is often viewed as inferior to a boy .
A bride 's dowry can also cripple a family financially .
Research for the year 2001 showed that for every 1,000 male babies born in India , there were just 933 girls .
Research published last year estimating that the number of female abortions was as high as 500,000 a year was disputed by the Indian Medical Association .
Secret
" We will have cradles strategically placed all over the place so that people who do n't want their babies can leave them there , " Ms Chowdhury told the BBC News website .
The sex ratio is so skewed in some states , men cannot find brides
The cradles could be in places as diverse as the local tax collector 's office , or where local councils meet .
Ms Chowdhury said parents would be able to leave their babies secretly .
The important thing was to save their lives .
She said she assumed that most of the babies left under the " cradle scheme " would be girls .
" They will be collected and put into homes , " she said .
" There are plenty of existing homes and we will be adding some more also . "
' Facade '
In 1994 , India banned the use of technology to determine the sex of unborn children and the termination of pregnancies on the basis of gender .
However , campaigners say many clinics still offer a seemingly legitimate facade for a multi-billion pound racket and that gender determination is a highly profitable business .
Experts say female foeticide is mostly linked to socio-economic factors .
It is an idea that many say carries over from the time India was a predominantly agrarian society where boys were considered an extra pair of hands on the farm .
In a separate development , police in the central state of Madhya Pradesh say they have recovered some 390 bones of babies or foetuses from the grounds of a Christian missionary hospital in the town of Ratlam after a tip off .
" The question of female foeticide and infanticide is part of our investigation , as is illegal abortions , " Superintendent of Police Satish Saxena said , Reuters news agency reports .
Alarm bell
Last November a Japanese hospital announced plans to set up a " baby hatch " allowing mothers to anonymously drop off their newborns so they could be put up for adoption .
The drop - off at Jikei Hospital in southern Japan will consist of a small window in an outside wall , which opens on to an incubator bed , officials say .
Once a baby has been placed inside , an alarm bell will alert staff .
DETROIT , March 21 — David A. Stockman , a former congressman who served as President Ronald Reagan ’s first budget director , is expected to be indicted on charges of accounting fraud related to his role as chairman of an auto parts supplier , people with knowledge of the matter said Wednesday .
An indictment against Mr. Stockman , who left the company , Collins & Aikman , five days before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005 , could be announced as soon as next week , people with knowledge of the matter said .
They spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation , by the office of United States Attorney Michael J. Garcia in Manhattan and United States postal inspectors , was continuing .
The Securities and Exchange Commission also has been investigating Collins & Aikman and is expected to file a civil complaint against Mr. Stockman regarding the same accounting issue , one of these people , a law enforcement official , said .
The other individual , someone with knowledge of Mr. Stockman ’s defense strategy , said Mr. Stockman believed that an indictment would be an “ overcriminalization of accounting judgments . ”
Marissa Mayer , vice president for product development at Google , recalled concerns raised during internal discussion about the likelihood of encountering advertiser resistance to such an unfamiliar format .
At one point near the time of the debut , one of her colleagues leaned over and predicted , " You wait , in a month we 'll be selling banners . "
It did take a little while before prospective sponsors were willing to try Google 's text ads , but soon enough , they attracted the intrepid .
Mr. Brin and Mr. Page deliberately offered advertisers instant gratification : pull out your credit card , plunk down a $ 50 deposit , send in four lines -- and in a blink it would be out there , having been automatically processed without a pre-publication review by a humanoid .
( Google 's language police would follow up later , if need be . )
Ms. Mayer credits small companies for helping to draw the attention , and ad dollars , of Google 's big accounts .
Because of the sheer number of commercial sites run by small operators -- like the one that has bought a sponsored link tied to the unappreciated sport of extreme ironing -- their customers add up to a very large number .
Once upon a time , Goto , another pioneer in online ads that was renamed Overture and bought by Yahoo , thought that search result positions should be sold to the highest bidder .
Bad idea .
Users wanted the order of results determined by algorithm , unswayed by advertisers .
That wish became the unwritten law for search .
Today , Yahoo and MSN serve up text - only ads in the same peripheral locations on the page as Google , and use an almost identical format .
Like Google , they also are fighting the good fight against pop-ups , and forbid advertisers from linking to pages that will bop the user in the nose .
Google 's model is copied for a simple reason : its ads produce profits that prove that size does not matter .
Some analysts view Google 's embrace of text as temporary , predicting that the company will add image advertising to its site just as soon as it can build the infrastructure .
Jordan Rohan , an Internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets , said that given the fact that Google serves up 100 million search - query results a day , were the company to add a single photo - quality image to each page , the bits for each page would increase a thousandfold and the resulting load would figuratively " break the Internet . "
Is Google holding off on image ads because of inadequate infrastructure ?
No , responds Ms. Mayer .
She says Google uses text for ads because of cognitive science : text has the highest information density and allows users to scan a lot of information at the highest speed , or , as she phrased it , " the bit rate on text is very fast . "
Anything that gets in the way of speed - reading must go .
Google does not permit advertisers to use all - capital letters .
( Studies have shown we read those 30 percent slower than properly capitalized words . )
Ms. Mayer did allow for one theoretical exception to text ads in the future : when users search for videos .
" For a query on videos for baking a cake , then , a video might be best , " she said .
The online marketing agency Avenue A , which later became Avenue A / Razorfish , says that about 30 percent of the more than $ 400 million it will spend on behalf of its clients this year will be for text ads on search pages .
Last month , Eric Schmidt , Google 's C.E.O. , said the company 's profits jumped sevenfold in the third quarter , versus the period a year earlier , partly because larger companies were increasingly willing to spend their ad dollars on search - related advertising .
Do n't you just love serendipity ?
Christopher Striemer does .
As a research associate at the University of Rochester in the US , Striemer recently discovered a new ultrathin silicon membrane that could revolutionise the way that doctors or scientists manipulate molecules .
Only 50 atoms thick , it might even improve treatment regimes for haemodialysis patients with kidney failure .
A self - driven and inquisitive scientist who likes doing things well , Striemer was trying to understand how silicon - as used in computer chips - crystallises .
As part of his research into semiconductors under Philippe Fauchet , professor of electrical and computer engineering , he made a thin silicon membrane and placed it in an electron microscope .
At first glance , it appeared full of holes .
But instead of trying again , he stopped in amazement .
Something special
" Holes are seldom a good thing when you are trying to make electrical or optical devices .
However , I immediately recognised that this was something special and unique , " says Striemer .
Size really does matter here .
Striemer 's membrane was less than one millimetre square and , at 50 atoms ( 15 nanometres ) thick , was 4,000 times thinner than a human hair .
Laid flat , it appeared blue , but edge - on was invisible to the naked eye .
And with almost no mass , it might have floated away unnoticed .
Another experiment confirmed his findings : " When I saw small gold nanoparticles pass through , it was obvious it had holes .
The fact that it was incredibly thin with holes in it struck me - this could be a perfect screen . "
Just how perfect was soon apparent when Striemer confirmed his new membrane was thousands of times thinner than existing filters .
The pores were usefully molecule - sized , with later experiments producing a library of membranes with pore sizes ranging from nine to 35 nanometres .
Even more startling , these characteristics were easily controlled by temperature during manufacture .
A meeting with James McGrath , assistant professor of biomedical engineering , led to a series of experiments with McGrath 's graduate student , Tom Gaborski .
McGrath likes solving biomedical problems and this seemed an interesting challenge .
" Chris [ Striemer ] came to us asking what in the world of biology this might separate and our best guess was proteins .
It was a lucky guess because it works brilliantly , but I recall being sceptical at first , " says McGrath .
Conventional polymer molecular filters are a jumble of varying holes and tunnels prone to clogging .
Striemer 's silicon membrane was about as thick as a protein molecule , yet could resist 15 pounds per square inch of pressure - roughly the same pressure that the human body faces in the atmosphere .
This promises fast , clog - free filtering .
To test this , two blood proteins , albumin and immunoglobulin - both small enough to pass through the tiny holes in the membrane - were tried .
" Jim [ McGrath ] and Tom [ Gaborski ] were amazed at how quickly the smaller species [ albumin ] passed through the membrane .
I thought the six minutes that we spent watching this was a long time , until they told me dialysis processes usually take hours , " says Striemer .
Haemodialysis is the treatment used for patients with kidney failure where toxic molecules are removed by dialysis machines .
If the new membrane lives up to expectations , such machines might be made smaller or the same volume of blood might be dialysed quicker .
" Right now we are focusing on the question of whether these membranes can filter out small molecular weight toxins while retaining larger essential blood proteins , " says McGrath .
The scientists have founded a company , SiMPore Inc , to commercialise their work .
Dr John Firth is the director of renal services at Addenbrooke 's hospital in Cambridge .
He says that a typical haemodialysis session for a patient on a kidney machine lasts four hours , three times a week .
This is hard on patients , say the American scientists .
" It is true that many patients are tired after dialysis , and that dialysis membranes do not clear everything from the blood that would be removed by normally functioning kidneys - but it is not clear that the two are connected , " says Firth .
Improving haemodialysis is an attractive goal for the new membrane .
Consultant nephrologist Dr Richard Fluck at Derby City General Hospital is a medical advisor to Kidney Research UK ( kidneyresearchuk.org ) .
What most grabs Fluck 's attention is that Striemer 's discovery also supports " charge " .
By applying a fixed electrical charge , the pores can in effect be made smaller for some molecules - enabling their separation by size and charge .
" It 's not just pore size , it 's charge as well and that starts to mimic more closely what our own kidneys do .
People think of them as a physical sieve but it's more sophisticated than that , " says Fluck .
" Kidney medicine is a very technological , very scientific area in which the adoption of new technology is driven by clinical need .
This is the sort of thing that nephrologists would go out and look for . "
Working in a completely different field , Andrew de Mello of Imperial College has other ideas .
As professor of chemical nanosciences , he 's also involved with the London Centre for Nanotechnology which brings together engineers , physical scientists and life scientists .
His research interest is microfluidics for the emerging " lab - on - a- chip " technology - an ultrathin silicon filter is useful here too .
Unique properties
" There 's no real reason that we as chemists traditionally use test tubes apart from the fact they fit in our hand .
If you can control and manipulate very small numbers of molecules , you can actually do some really interesting and novel things , " says de Mello .
While new haemodialysis systems might be years away from hospitals , filtering applications for lab - on - a - chip technology seem closer .
The membrane 's unique properties are unlike any molecular filter that 's gone before - helping to attract considerable scientific interest .
Thanks to serendipity in the hands of a smart individual , silicon has offered an astonishing new breakthrough .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration told Congress on Friday of plans to sell Iraq about 400 million rounds of small arms ammunition , 170,000 grenades , demolition explosives and other military gear and services valued at up to $ 508 million .
The Pentagon ’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the Iraqi government had asked for up to 100 million rounds of both M855 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm ammunition for small arms , as well as about 200 million other bullets .
“ This proposed sale directly supports the Iraqi government and serves the interests of the Iraqi people and the U.S. , as well as offering hope for a more stable and peaceful Middle East , ” said the agency that handles government - to - government arms sales .
The package would help Iraqi forces “ sustain themselves in their efforts to bring stability to the country and prevent overflow of unrest into neighboring countries , ” a statement said .
In a previous proposed sale to Iraq , the Pentagon said on December 7 it would supply trucks , trailers and related equipment valued at up to $ 463 million .
It said that would support a plan by Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki to train and equip an extra 30,000 Iraqi troops .
The strengthened Iraqi force is aimed at speeding up the departure of U.S. troops who ousted President Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
The notice of a proposed sale is required by law .
Congress has the power to reject it .
The deal could be worth up to $ 508 million if all options are exercised .
As part of the proposed package , the United States would sell 170,000 40 mm HEDP grenades , 80,000 C - 4 1 - 1/4 pound plastic explosive packets and 4.2 million feet of detonating cord .
The deal would also involve up to 75 million gallons ( 341 million liters ) of diesel , 2.9 million gallons ( 13 million liters ) of JP - 8 jet fuel and 56.4 million gallons ( 256 million liters ) of motor gasoline , the statement said .
The administration , in a separate notice to lawmakers , proposed to sell to Turkey Raytheon Co. - built AIM - 9X Sidewinder air - to - air missiles and related gear valued at up to $ 71 million if all options are exercised .
Coalition forces say they must reduce civilian deaths
He said that the military had paid condolence payments to the families in the eastern province of Nangarhar .
Western forces have been accused of carelessness over civilian lives when attacking the Taleban and their allies .
It has become a major issue , with Nato recently saying that its biggest error last year was killing civilians .
In January , it promised to do better .
' Honour stain '
" I stand before you today , deeply , deeply ashamed and terribly sorry that Americans have killed and wounded innocent Afghan people , " US army spokesman Col John Nicholson told reporters in Washington by video conference from Afghanistan .
" The deaths and wounding of innocent Afghans at the hands of Americans is a stain on our honour and on the memory of the many Americans who have died defending Afghanistan and the Afghan people .
" We made official apologies on the part of the US government and payments of about $ 2,000 for each death , " he said , after US officials visited some of the families left bereaved by the incident .
US forces were accused of killing the civilians during shooting near the city of Jalalabad .
Journalists said at the time that US troops confiscated their photos and video footage of the aftermath of the violence .
The Americans said the fighting started when a convoy of Marines was attacked by a suicide bomber and came under co-ordinated small - arms fire .
Local accused US soldiers of targeting civilians in Nangarhar
They said that their soldiers returned fire , and acknowledged that at least eight Afghan civilians had been killed , with a further 35 injured .
Reports said that as they left the scene along a busy highway , the Americans fired indiscriminately on civilians and their vehicles .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai strongly condemned the incident at the time .
Criminal inquiry
Thousands of local people took to the streets shortly after the attack to protest against what happened .
The Associated Press news agency said it would complain to the US military after journalists said US soldiers allegedly deleted footage of the aftermath of the Nangarhar violence .
Freelance journalists working for the Associated Press said troops erased photos and video showing a vehicle in which three people were shot dead during the incident .
US - led forces say they kill fewer civilians than the Taleban
A US military commander determined that the Marines used excessive force and referred the case for possible criminal investigation .
Correspondents say that military killings of civilians have eroded Afghan support for international forces and have put the Western - backed government in Kabul under pressure .
On Thursday , Nato forces vowed to improve co-ordination with the Afghan authorities to avoid civilian deaths .
Their pledge follows the reported deaths of about 50 civilians last week in fighting in western Afghanistan between US - led troops and militants .
In recent days there have been protests by Afghans in different parts of the country - including Jalalabad - over civilian killings .
The bloodshed has returned to levels not seen since the fall of the Taleban in 2001 , and a quarter of more than 4,000 people killed last year were believed to have been civilians .
Correspondents say fewer civilians are killed by international forces than in suicide and other attacks by the Taleban .
Using Emacs org- mode for GTD
A brief overview of org - mode Emacs and how it can be used to implement David Allen 's Getting Things Done methodology .
[ February 2009 - This article has been largely superceded by a more recent article ]
Table of Contents
Getting Things Done ( GTD ) is a productivity system taught by the American consultant and author David Allen .
He has coached many people in this system through seminars and consulting , but the most popular wasy has been his book Getting Things Done .
The Art of Stress - Free Productivity published by Penguin Books .
( More details can be obtained from the Amazon web site
The heart of GTD is a workflow of collecting , processing and making decisions up front about all the things you need to get done in your life .
A key success factor is tracking everything in a trusted system rather than in your head .
A trusted system could be paper based ( notebook , a ring bound planner ) , Palm / PocketPC computer or a computer program such as org - mode described in this tutorial .
To Do lists are a thing of the past .
In the GTD methodology , decisions are made at the time of processing all of the things in your life demanding some of your time , energy and decision making .
Examples include letters , email , action items resulting from meetings or phone calls , ideas , your roles and responsibilities at home and work , and interaction with people .
Instead of making lists of things to do , two questions are asked about each item :
What is the desired outcome ?
What is the next physical action I can take to get closer to this outcome ?
As well as defining the Next Action ( often referred to as an NA ) , a decision is made about the context of the action .
A context is where the action can take place subject to various restraints or resources required .
For example , the context of " Phone " requires having a telephone available .
An " Office " context means that the action can only take place in the office , similarly , the context of " Home " is for items that can only be done in the home .
Each person 's list of contexts will be different and will require some experimenting to determine a practical working set .
My contexts include :
Office ( I use this for phone calls to be made during business hours )
( I use this for phone calls to be made during business hours )
Home ( this context is also used for phone calls
( this context is also used for phone calls Computer ( home computer )
( home computer ) DVD Watching ( I borrow a lot of DVDs from the library )
( I borrow a lot of DVDs from the library ) Reading ( this gets done on my train trip to work )
The GTD methodology uses many lists such as the Next Action lists described in the previous section .
David Allen uses the term " Agendas " to describe lists of actions you need to discuss with particular people or to raise at a regular meeting .
Agendas can be thought of as a special form of next action list .
For example , if you have a regular meeting with your boss , you can create a list called Boss recording items to discuss when you next meet .
If you are manager , you could created agendas for each of the people in your team .
Another type of list is a " Waiting For " list .
Often when you complete a next action or delegate an action , you need to wait for a response .
Writing this information on a " Waiting For " list is a useful reminder .
A Project is an outcome that requires more than one several Next Action steps to be completed .
When reviewing the things you need to get done , think in terms of the desired outcome and as many of the Next Actions as you can .
It is not necessary to think of all of the Next Actions you need to take , but enough to get started .
For example , an outcome of " Dinner Party " is a project .
Some of the Next Actions would have a " Phone " context : " Ring Bill and Hilary " , " Ring Valerie and Mark " .
Under the " Shopping " context , there could be next actions for " Buy red wine from bottle shop " .
Make a list of your active projects to use as a checklist during your weekly review .
This will ensure that you are creating next actions for each of your projects , and approaching completion on each of your projects .
Calendars are used to record date - specific or date and time specific information only .
Calendars are not used to write to - do lists as encouraged in the old style of planners .
The calendar is a place for recording appointments , meetings and date - specific information ( for example , birthdays ) .
This a system to store forward - dated action items .
Often this takes the form of 43 folders ( 12 months + 31 days ) , although a software based system is feasible .
For example a bill requiring payment on the 20th of the current month would be filed in the folder labelled " 20 " .
The list of Christmas card recipients would be filed in the " December " folder .
You can't do everything now , so the Someday / Maybe List is used to record ideas about things you would like to do but do n't want to schedule them now or make further progress .
This list is frequently updating during the Weekly Review .
Items on the list may become active projects , or conversely , you may decide to de an active project or Next Action to a later date .
Deciding what to do next is going to be based on context , how much time you have available and your energy level .
Because your Next Action lists are reviewed at the Weekly Review , you have a means of directing your activity during the week .
When you are at home , you can review the HOME list without being distracted by items in OFFICE context .
The heart of the GTD process is a weekly review of all projects , Next Action lists , Waiting for Items .
Each project is checked to ensure that a next action has been defined .
The goal of GTD is to get everything out of your mind into an external , trusted system .
This will maximmise the readiness of your mind to gain focus on getting things done .
A mind sweep is a technique used to recall all of the things that you are thinking about doing .
Emacs is a highly extensible , customizable , self - documenting real - time display editor ( quoting from the Emacs Manual ) .
Emacs dates back to the mind 1970s and is very popular on Unix systems .
The core of Emacs is a Lisp interpreter and this forms the basis of writing extensions that add functionality to the editor .
org - mode is an example of such an extenstion .
Emacs is available for Windows , Linux , Mac -OS X , and just about every other Unix operating system .
The org - mode package is a mode for keeping notes , lists and doing project management with a fast and effective plain - text system .
Org - mode is based on top of the Emacs outline - mode and provides a very usable , color - coded outliner with powerful functionality .
The heart of org - mode is organising the contents in a hierarchical structure , using the outline , and assigning tags ( for contexts ) and optional dates to headlines .
Viewing and editing the document is achieved by folding ( hiding ) parts of the document to show the relevant content .
A headline has one or more asterisks at the beginning of the line with the level being determined by the number of asterisks .
* Colors ** Red
This is a content for the Red headline ** Green ** Blue
The contents of the file can be shown or hidden using the Shift - TAB key .
Pressing the TAB key cycles through a top level overview , all headings and all headings with content .
Here are three screen shots from an outline about the twelve months in Australia , shown side by side .
At the left is the top level view , then all the headings , and on the right is the complete contents of the file .
A headline ( a line beginning with one or more asterisks ) and the lines following ( without asterisks at the beginning ) make up a branch on the outline and can be moved around with " structure editing " commands .
Org -mode provides a full range of commands to promote and demote headings and subtrees , moving branches up and down the file , as well as copying , killing and pasting sub - trees .
Tags are added with the C-c C -c command , which prompts for a tag .
This can be seen in the screen - shot shown above .
Tag completion is supported , for example typing the letter C followed by the tab key will completed the string making COMPUTER .
The list of tags is built up by scanning the buffer .
You can also specify a list of tags with short cut letters for fast tag selection .
The C-c \ command is used to prompt for a tag search expression , then display a " sparse tree " of headlines that contain the tags specified in a search .
A sparse tree means that the entire document is folded as much as possible , but the selected information is made visible along with the headline structure above it .
The tag search can be a single keyword ( for example , HOME ) or a Boolean expression using & for " and " and ' | ' for " or " , for example " HOME | COMPUTER " .
The following example shows a search on the keyword of HOME :
Org -mode provides functionality to tag headlines with a Todo tag , commands to display these Todo tags and marking for completion .
I do not use this feature as GTD relies on lists of actions by context .
Choosing which Next Action to do next depends on the context , and time and energy available .
I use one file to contain all my projects , tasks , agendas and someday / maybe lists .
I named my file mygtd.org and included the following three lines at the top of the file .
#+STARTUP : overview #+TAGS : OFFICE (o) COMPUTER( c ) HOME (h ) PROJECT( p ) READING (r ) DVD(d ) #+STARTUP : hidestars
The first line tells org - mode to only display the top level headings when the file is opened .
The second line is a list of contexts I use .
The single letters in parentheses are used for the fast selection of contexts .
Choosing a contest is done by issuing the command C-c C-c then entering the letter correspoding to the category .
The third line causes org - mode to suppress the leading asterisks on headings which greatly improves readability .
You will probably need to experiment with a file structure that makes it easy to review your areas of responsibility , projects and life areas .
The category tags are the useful components but the sequence of headlines and structure is not important .
One possibility is to create some headlines corresponding to your key areas and responsibilities at work and home .
List the names of your family members and their activities .
Each active project can have a headline .
At the weekly review reviewing the file will double up as a checklist .
* Miscellaneous tasks ** Ring Service Station to book car for service : PHONE : ** Send email to Bill regarding sales order : COMPUTER : * Emily
This headline is to remind me to check on my daughters school activities !
** School subjects ** Viola ** Piano ** School Certificate Exam preparation * Work ** Work Prject 1 *** Next action item :OFFICE : * Home ** Ready for Anything ( David Allen ) reading project *** Read Chapter 1 :READING : * DVDs to watch ** Casablanca :DVD : ** King Kong : DVD : * Someday / Maybe ** Books I would like to read *** Life - A users manual ( Georges Perec ) ** Movies I want to see ** Restaurants I want to try ** DVDs I would like to hire *** Godfather III *** Memoirs of a Geisha
An excellent way of ensuring you have thought of everything for your file is to do a " mind - sweep " .
Start a heading at the end of the file and start a new line with two asterisks .
* Mind Sweep ** Ring Bill about that meeting ** Change tap washer in laundry ** Pay membership subscription .
Set a timer or alarm clock and spend five minutes brainstorming all the things on your mind that need doing .
As you think of the item , type a brief description , then Alt - Enter to start a new line to create a headline at the same level .
Work fast to get everything out of your mind .
When the timer is finished , review the list , add tags and move to the appropriate section of the file .
I have played my file ( mygtd.org ) under source code control .
I use the SubVersion program for tracking changes made each day .
The file gets backed up to CD as well as copied to a USB - drive for portability between home and office .
I added some code to quickly open my GTD file .
Now I can enter the command M-x gtd and a new window is opened with my org - mode file .
( defun gtd ( ) ( interactive ) ( find- file " c:/homes/charles/gtd/gtd/mygtd.org " ) )
I use index cards ( 3 by 5 inches ) to capture ideas and next actions .
Sometimes I use the cards as the basis of my decision making .
These cards are reviewed during the weekly review and my GTD file is updated with actions that are still outstanding .
I use a week to an opening paper diary to record my appointments , due dates for library books , family events , children 's school activities and so on .
Therefore I do n't use use the scheduling features of Org-mode .
Refer to the org - mode documentation for details on assigning deadlines and scheduled dates to headings .
The agenda view ( C- c a ) is used to display items with associated dates in a date and times sequenced display .
I like to carry a simply formatted printed list of my next actions for each context .
I wrote a Perl script ( file:orghip.pl ) to read my Org- mode formatted GTD file and produce Next Action lists by context .
[ February 2009 - This Perl script was written before I understood writing customised agenda commands .
Refer to the main page for more articles . ] .
The script displays the PROJECT list first , followed by the OFFICE context , then the remaining tags are displayed .
The sequence of the items in each context correspond to the order in which they were found in the file , and this gives some sontext to actions in the same context .
Here is an edited version of this file using the an example file , mygtd.org .

From Paul Kane 's Capitol Briefing blog at the WaPo comes the story of mumbling equivocator Arlen Specter .
Faced with the prospect of having to figure out where he stood in the face of a looming Constitutional confrontation for which all precedent weighs against his party , Specter and other White House apologists asked for a voice vote on authorizing subpoenas in the investigation of the firing of the US Attorneys .
Why a voice vote ?
So nobody would actually have to go on record in support of the Pretzelnit .
Fine .
Whatever it takes .
But Specter could n't even manage that :
Leahy ordered a voice vote and barked out for all those in favor of the subpoenas to say " aye " - and all 10 Democrats clearly yelled " aye " , as did Sen.
Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) .
Specter , who is advocating a compromise in which Rove would testify publicly but not under oath and without being subpoenaed , clearly opened his mouth and seemed to move his lips .
Then Leahy asked for the " nays " , and Specter 's mouth did n't open a sliver .
Capitol Briefing convened a meeting of reporters afterward to decide whether Specter had voted in favor of the subpoenas .
There was no clear answer , no one could actually confirm whether they heard him say " aye " .
We pounced on Specter and demanded an answer .
But Specter refused to say which way he voted .
He said he did what he did and if we did n't notice he was n't going to help us .
After trying a number of different ways to get him to show his hand , we gave up and left .
But Specter had a change of heart and decided to clear the air , tracking down a few reporters .
He did not deny that his mouth might have opened during the call for " ayes " , but Specter denied saying anything , uttering any sound .
" The fact of the matter is that I did not say anything .
I did not vote and say either ' aye ' or ' nay ' .
I just sat there hoping that it would all go away through negotiations , " he said .
" Factually , I did not say a thing . "
" Factually , I did not say a thing . "
This was supposed to be a clarification , mind you .
Arlen Specter , asked what he did in the face of Constitutional conflict , says , " I did not say a thing . "
Story of his life .

It ’s a sad day for many of us here at PBH as we learn that today , New York City , has banned the use of one of my and many of my associates favorite words :
The “ N ” - word .
I ’ll spell it out in case you have n’t heard this particular euphemism : nigger .
I ’ll define from the urban dictionary below :
A word that everyone else is afraid to define except in utter seriousness , for fear of being branded a rascist [ sic ] , in total ignorance of the colloquial usage of the word , its characterization in popular culture , and the populations of people it is used most by .
Urban Dictionary : Nigger
This ruling is actually quite interesting for two reasons ..
This is probably the first time in history that a WORD has been outlawed .
There ’s no actual penalty for using the word , thus , the rule is pointless .
But I ’m sure our astute readers already figured that out
Anyway , since the “ N ” - word has apparently been banned for casual conduct , We ’ve got a great plan here .
Since this was announced today , we ’ll mark each and every March 1st as Nigger Day !
Kool - Aid and Watermelon for all !!!
Racial Slur Banned in New York
[ UPDATE ]
It turns out that we ’ve just finished Black History month …
Nigger Day !
What a great way to finish that one off and get onto real biz !
また、独自技術によって開封して48時間を経過しても90％以上の水素残存率があるから、慌てて500mlを飲み切る必要がないのもいいですね。
気になるのが水素濃度ですが、「 ビガーブライトＥＸ」は充填時に1.6ppmと常温・常圧時の限界濃度を実現しているだけでなく、新技術のエアムーブや独自の特殊4層構造のアルミパウチを採用しているので、お手元に届いて飲むときにも十分な水素濃度を保持することができているのでご安心ください。
水素が悪玉活性酸素と結びつき体に無害な水となって体外に排出されるので、体のさびを中から除去することができるからです。
ミネラル成分が多いと独特な風味・くせがあって飲みにくいと思う方もいらっしゃるでしょうが、日本人の味覚になじむミネラル豊富な阿蘇山外輪系湧水を特殊技術によって品質アップさせて飲みやすく仕上げているので毎日おいしく飲み続けることができることでしょう。
10代や20代の若いうちなら、そんなこと微塵も感じない！という方が多いと思いますが、30代も後半になってくると・・
ミネラル豊富な水は、ツンツンしていて飲みにくい。というイメージがあるかと思いますが、こちらの水素水には、ミネラル豊富でもまろやかで飲みやすい「 阿蘇山外輪系湧水 」を使用しています。
シリカは1日30mgの摂取が好ましいと言われており、こちらの水素水の中には、72mg/L含有しているので、日本一シリカが多い水といっても過言ではありません。
コラーゲンをサポートする役割があると言われており、アメリカでは、コラーゲンを摂取するよりもシリカを摂取する方が人気です。
肌の衰えが気になり始める、30代からお飲みになる方が急増している。という話題の商品でもあり、10人中9人がリピートしている。というのも驚きです。
世の中には様々な 「 高濃度水素 水
」が販売されていますが、何をもって高濃度か、という基準もないため実質表示し放題の状況です。
また、水素は体の中に溶け込むことは分かっていますが、どうやら濃度が低いと吸収されずにほとんどが体外に排出されてしまうようです。
そのため、実際1.0ppｍが保たれているのは最初の一口目だけで、あとは延々と効果の薄い濃度の水素水を飲んでいる、という場合も少なくありません。
次に水素ですが、先ほど書いたように1.0ppmのもの以外は効果が低いのですが、例え1.0ppmの濃度があったとしても水素は時間とともにどんどん逃げていってしまいます。
たっぷりのシリカと、高濃度の水素がギュッと濃縮されていますので、これまでにない若々しさというものを実感出来るかもしれません。
ビガーブライトＥＸを利用させていただいた時の体験談です。
楽天でいろいろな商品をあさっていたときにたまたま見つけたものです。クチコミの評価も高かったので試しに買ってみることにしました。利用してみると様々な効果を発揮しました。お肌がすべすべになり、寝起きが良くなりました。他にもお通じがよくなったり、肩凝りがやわらいでいったりしました。また、非常に飲みやすかったのでとてもおすすめしたい逸品です。これからも使用させていただきたいと思います。
ビガーブライトＥＸを飲んでみて1番実感したのは肌荒れの改善です。今までは様々な化粧水や美容液、ビタミンサプリなど、色々なことを試しても改善されなかった肌荒れが、ビガーブライトＥＸを飲んだらしっかりと改善され、スベスベした滑らかな肌を取り戻すことができました。さらに口当たりも滑らかで角がないので飲みやすく、体にしっかり吸収されている感覚を味わうことができます。お腹に溜まらず飲めるので非常に助かってます。
ビガーブライトＥＸを飲んでみようと思ったのは、通っているジムで流行っていたからです。
ジムで飲んでみるとだるさや眠気などが改善され、代謝も上がって体が軽く感じるようになったので本格的に試してみようと思いました。
就職してから疲れと寝不足のせいから肌荒れが気になっていて、皮膚科にも通っていたのですが処方されている薬に頼りきりになるのはどうなのかなと思っていたのです。
ビガーブライトＥＸを飲み始めて3ヶ月くらいすると、気になっていたニキビや吹き出物が出来にくくなって肌が綺麗になったので驚きました。
今ではビガーブライトＥＸを普通の水を飲む感覚で気軽に飲むようになり、自分にとって手放せない物になりました。
ビガーブライトＥＸを飲み初めてしばらくすると、手の肌荒れが良くなっていることに気が付きました。毎年冬の乾燥する時期になると、手の肌荒れが大変だったのですが、思ってもみなかった効果だったので正直驚きました。ビガーブライトＥＸは他の類似商品と比べて、水素の濃度が高いということで選びましたが、その効果があったということかもしれません。価格もそれほど高くないので、これからも飲み続けていきたいと思っています。
今まで寝起きが悪かった自分がビガーブライトＥＸを飲み始めてから3週間程度で目覚めの良さを実感できています。体内時計のリズムが良くなるので、早寝早起きを当たり前のようにできるようになりましたし、そのおかげで暴飲暴食がなくなり、肩こりや首こりなどにもかなりの効果を実感できます。また、美容成分のシリカが入ってるのも好印象で、肌のツヤも出てくるようになりました。水素水なので副作用の心配もなく快適に飲むことができています。
数年前から、肩こりに悩まされていました。色々調べましたがこのビガーブライトＥＸには抗炎症作用があるという事で、購入いたしました。
飲み始めて、まず感じたのはまろやかで柔らかく非常に飲みやすいです。体に吸収されていくのが感じられます。
そして体が軽くなってくるのに気づき、寝起きもよくなってきました。
肩こりのほうも以前に比べて楽になってきているので徐々に改善していっています。肩こりの効果を期待して購入しましたが他の部分でも良い効果が出ています。
体が重く感じることが多くなり、体のサビを取るという水素水を日常に取り入れることにしたのです。たくさんある水素水から「ビガーブライトＥＸ」を選んだのは、開封後も一定時間は水素濃度が抜けにくいことが決め手となりました。パウチタイプなので持ち運びしやすいのも気に入りました。実際に飲んでみた感想は、とにかく体に浸透していくような感じがすることでした。細胞の隅々まで行き渡り、飲み続けるたびに体が軽くなっていくことを実感し始めたのです。それに加えてお肌の調子もよくなり、良いこと尽くめでこれからも続けていきたいです。
ビガーブライトＥＸは、身体に負担が少なく続けられると思い購入することにしました。阿蘇山の湧き水を使っているようで、天然由来であることも飲もうと考えた理由の一つです。実際飲んでみると、くせのない味でとても飲みやすいと思いました。豊富な栄養素が含まれていて、摂取しやすいなら文句はありません。一つ当たりの価格は230円前後なので、市販されている栄養補給ドリンクなどと比較しても高くはないのでとりあえず利用してみるのも良いと思います。
忙しいためか、体が疲れやすく肌荒れなどが気になっていました。友人によい方法はないか相談したところ、勧められたのがビガーブライトＥＸです。他の水素製品では、開封した後はすぐに飲まなければいけません。ビガーブライトＥＸは、開封しても48時間までは大丈夫なので無駄にすることがありません。飲み始めてから感じたことは、体が疲れにくくなってきたことです。すぐに眠ることができるようになり、肌荒れも改善してきました。ビガーブライトＥＸを飲むようにして、本当によかったと感じています。
ビガーブライトＥＸも水素水とはいっても所詮は水だから味なんかは特に変わらないと思っていたのですが、飲んでみると普通のペットボトルの水なんかと比べてもまろやかで飲みやすい感じがしました。普段は飲もうと思ってもそんなに量は飲めないのだけど、ビガーブライトＥＸは無理をしなくても自然に飲める感じです。 ビガーブライトＥＸを飲むようになってからは、水分補給もしっかりとできているからか汗をいっぱいかけてすっきりとできるようになりました。
肌の調子が悪く疲れやすいと感じていた時に、水素水が体の老化を抑えてくれるという事を耳にしました。ネットで評判の良かったビガーブライトＥＸが気になりお試しで30本購入しました。1本当たり230円と少し高く感じたのですが、体の改善の為に頑張りました。飲んだ感想は特にクセもなく飲みやすかったです。毎日1本を飲み、20日が過ぎる頃には肌の調子が良くなり、疲れにくくなったことも感じました。私の体に合っているのを感じたので、今では定期購入しています。
ビガーブライトＥＸという水素水を買ってみました。 水素水自体は、前によく飲んでいたので特に抵抗はなく今回もおいしく飲めました。
飲み始めてすぐには効果はわかりませんが1ヶ月過ぎると、肌の調子が良い事に気付きました。乾燥が少し和らいだかんじです。便通も良くなり、体がすごく軽くかんじました。両親にも飲んでもらいましたが、体が軽くなるみたいで定期的に購入する事に決めました。やっぱり健康が一番良いので、効果があるものが有難いです。
ビガーブライトＥＸは比較的、他の製品より安くて続けやすかったです。味もさっぱりしていてどことなく軽いイメージがありました。一日一本、一週間飲んでみたら朝起きるのが差ほど苦しくなかったです。始めは疑っていましたが、水素はきちんと身体にも機能するのだと実感しました。他にもシリカなども入っていますから、ミネラル補給にも適した飲料だと思います。ビガーブライトＥＸは他の水素飲料より口あたりも良く、飲みやすいからお勧めしたいです。
水素水の良さを友人から聞いたので、ネットの口コミ評価が高かった「ビガーブライトＥＸ」を購入しました。少しお高めなのですが、自分の身体が若返るかもしれないのを信じていました。抵抗を感じることなく飲むことが出来、気が付くと今まで休み明けまで残っていた疲れが無くなり、スッキリと目覚めることが出来ます。カサカサでボロボロだった肌の状態も良くなり、メイクのノリも良くなりました。今では母にも勧めて一緒に飲んでいます。
体の健康を求めて、水素水を飲むことにしました。
たくさんある中から選ぶのは難しかったのですが、パウチタイプの水素水を試してみました。
天然ミネラルのシリカも入っているので、美容にも効果があるのが嬉しいです。
ビガーブライトＥＸを飲むようになってから、お肌がすべすべになりお通じがよくなりました。
デトックス効果があるので、汗をたくさんかいて体の中から綺麗になっていけるような気がします。
お値段も安いので続けやすいです。
本格的にダイエットをしたくてビガーブライトＥＸを飲んでいます。中年になると代謝が悪くなり、少し運動しただけでは全く痩せないので、色々なダイエット方法を探した結果、岩盤浴で体の中をデトックスして代謝を上げる事にしたのです。その時に飲んでいるのがビガーブライトＥＸ水素水で、これを飲んで岩盤浴をすると大量の汗が出てくるのです。岩盤浴でビガーブライトＥＸを飲むうちに肌がスベスベになり、少し痩せる事ができました。
水素水が体に良いと聞いたことがあるのですが、色々似たようなものが色々あって迷っていました。そんな時ビガーブライトＥＸという製品が良いと聞いたので、試しに購入してみることにしました。ビガーブライトＥＸは500ml入りのパウチ上になっていて、持ち運びしやすいのが気に入っている点の1つです。他にもシリカなどの美容に良いとされるミネラルがとれますし、阿蘇の名水から作られていて、飲みやすさの面でも個人的に気に入っています。
加齢によりお肌の衰えを感じるようになり、何か効果のある化粧品を探そうかと思ったのですが、体の中から綺麗にしたいと思い、体に良いとされる水素水を飲むことにしたのです。実際購入しようと思うと巷には色んな水素水があり、正直どれにしようか迷ったのですが、パウチタイプで外出時の持ち運びも便利で、何度かに分けて飲むことも出来、しかも一定の時間内なら水素濃度が保持されることに魅力を感じて「ビガーブライトＥＸ」を購入することにしたのです。個人的にはくせがなく、飲みやすくて、体の細胞に浸透するような感覚があります。飲み始めて数か月経ちますが、お肌にハリやツヤが出てきて、血色もよくなり調子がとてもよくなりました。
健康オタクの私は、近年話題の水素水が気になっていました。そこで、ネットで見つけたビガーブライトＥＸを試してみました。水素水は味がどうなのか気になりましたが、ビガーブライトＥＸはまろやかでとても飲みやすかったです。飲み始めたからは、何となく体の調子が良くなったと思います。便秘気味だったお通じも良くなり、何といっても夜の寝つきがよくなり朝の目覚めが良くなったのが嬉しいです。クセがなく飲みやすいので、今後も続けていきたいです。

The West plus liberalism equals this » The “ Clockwork Orange ” Nation
In London , two thugs named Daniel - Lance Samuels and Jack Turner , for no reason , just for kicks , attacked a young off - duty police officer , Daniel Coffill , kicking his head in and damaging his brain , leaving him in a persistent vegetative state in which he must be cared for by his parents 24 hours a day .
The criminals were sentenced to a measely eight and nine years in jail , and now a judge has , two thugs named Daniel - Lance Samuels and Jack Turner , for no reason , just for kicks , attacked a young off - duty police officer , Daniel Coffill , kicking his head in and damaging his brain , leaving him in a persistent vegetative state in which he must be cared for by his parents 24 hours a day .
The criminals were sentenced to a measely eight and nine years in jail , and now a judge has reduced the sentences by two years apiece because the sentences were “ excessive . ”
So the perpetrators each get approximately a six year sentence , with good behavior down to three years , for turning a 23 - year - old man into a vegetable , for destroying his life , for preventing him from ever marrying and having children , for ruining the lives of his parents , and all for nothing , for a whim , for a cruel impulse to hurt and destroy .
Where are the troubadours , where are the Bob Dylans , who will sing about this injustice ?
Who will write a version of “ The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll ” for Daniel Coffill and his parents ?
Who will rouse society ’s indignation over the casual savagery that Britain ’s nonjudgmental culture and justice system have unleashed on innocents ?
Why do the protest singers only protest when it ’s a non-white who is harmed , and a rich or powerful white who has done the harm ?
How many deaths of whites will it take before we know that too many people have died ?
Who will enflame the people ’s burning moral rage against liberalism ?
THE LONESOME DEATH OF HATTIE CARROLL William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gatherin ’
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first - degree murder .
But you who philosophize disgrace
And criticize all fears ,
Take the rag away from your face .
Now ai n’t the time for your tears .
William Zanzinger , who has twenty - four years
Owns a tobacco farm with six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland ,
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering , in his tongue it was a’ snarling ,
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking .
But you who philosophize disgrace
And criticize all fears ,
Take the rag away from your face .
Now ai n’t the time for your tears .
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen .
She was fifty - one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And did n’t even talk to the people at the table
But just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow , lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger .
But you who philosophize disgrace
And criticize all fears ,
Take the rag away from your face .
Now ai n’t the time for your tears .
In the courtroom of honor , the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all ’s equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ai n’t pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught ‘em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin ’ that way without warnin ’
And he spoke through his cloak , most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly , for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger , with a six - month sentence .
Ah , but you who philosophize disgrace
And criticize all fears ,
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now ’s the time for your tears .

The same exact phrase , “ ‘ Clockwork Orange ’ Nation , ” occurred to me several years ago when for the second time I read about teenage boys breaking into a pensioner ’s home in London and proceeding to torture him to death .
No theft was involved in either incident .
Amazing how only 50 years of paternalist government ( whether of the Labor or Conservative stripe ) has so completely demoralized and barbarized one of the most solid and admirable native working class populations in the entire West .

The official inquiry into the 7 July London bombings will say the attack was planned on a shoestring budget from information on the internet , that there was no ' fifth - bomber ' and no direct support from al - Qaeda , although two of the bombers had visited Pakistan .
The first forensic account of the atrocity that claimed the lives of 52 people , which will be published in the next few weeks , will say that attacks were the product of a ' simple and inexpensive ' plot hatched by four British suicide bombers bent on martyrdom .
Far from being the work of an international terror network , as originally suspected , the attack was carried out by four men who had scoured terror sites on the internet .
Their knapsack bombs cost only a few hundred pounds , according to the first completed draft of the government 's definitive report into the blasts .
The Home Office account , compiled by a senior civil servant at the behest of Home Secretary Charles Clarke , also discounts the existence of a fifth bomber .
After the bombings , police found an unused rucksack of explosives in the bombers ' abandoned car at Luton station , which led to a manhunt for a missing suspect .
Similarly , it found nothing to support the theory that an al - Qaeda fixer , presumed to be from Pakistan , was instrumental in planning the attacks .
A Whitehall source said : ' The London attacks were a modest , simple affair by four seemingly normal men using the internet . '
Confirmation of the nature of the attacks will raise fresh concerns over the vulnerability of Britain to an attack by small , unsophisticated groups .
A fortnight after 7 July , an unconnected group of four tried to duplicate the attack , but their devices failed to detonate .
However , the findings will draw criticism for failing to address concerns as to why no action was taken against the bombers despite the fact that one of them , Mohammed Siddique Khan , was identified by intelligence officers months before the attack .
A report into the attack by the Commons intelligence and security committee , which could be published alongside the official narrative , will question why MI5 called off surveillance of the ringleader of the 7 July bombings .
Patrick Mercer , shadow homeland security spokesman , said the official narrative 's findings would only lead to calls for an independent inquiry to answer further questions surrounding 7 July .
He said : ' A series of reports such as this narrative simply does not answer questions such as the reduced terror alert before the attack , the apparent involvement of al - Qaeda and links to earlier or later terrorist plots . '
The official Home Office report into the attacks does , however , decide that the four suicide bombers - Siddique Khan , Hasib Hussain , Shehzad Tanweer and Jermaine Lindsay - were partly inspired by Khan 's trips to Pakistan , though the meeting between the four men and known militants in Pakistan is seen as ideological , rather than fact - finding .
A videotape of Mohammed Siddique Khan released after the attacks also featured footage of Osama bin Laden 's deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri .
The Home Office believes the tape was edited after the suicide attacks and dismisses it as evidence of al - Qaeda 's involvement in the attack .
Khan is confirmed as ringleader of the attacks , though the Yorkshire - born bomber 's apparent links to other suspected terrorists are not discussed for legal reasons .
The report also investigates the psychological make - up and behaviour of the four bombers during the run-up to the attack .
Using intelligence compiled in the nine months since , the account paints a portrait of four British men who in effect led double lives .
It exposes how the quartet adopted an extreme interpretation of Islam , juxtaposed with a willingness to enjoy a ' western ' lifestyle - in particular Jermaine Lindsay , the bomber from Berkshire .
According to the report , the attacks were largely motivated by concerns over foreign policy and the perception that it was deliberately anti-Muslim , although the four men were also driven by the promise of immortality .
Look at my last post .
Now read this one over on LiveSide .
It ’s a short report that Microsoft executives are bragging to MVPs that “ we ’re in it to win . ”
I do n’t think Microsoft is .
The words are empty .
Microsoft ’s Internet execution sucks ( on whole ) .
Its search sucks .
Its advertising sucks ( look at that last post again ) .
If that ’s “ in it to win ” then I do n’t get it .
I saw a bunch of posts similar to the one on LiveSide coming out of the MVP Summit .
I did n’t post any of them to my link blog for a reason :
All were air , no real demonstrations of how Microsoft is going to lead .
Microsoft is n’t going away .
Do n’t get me wrong .
They have record profits , record sales , all that .
But on the Internet ?
Come on .
This is n’t winning .
Microsoft : stop the talk .
Ship a better search , a better advertising system than Google , a better hosting service than Amazon , a better cross-platform
Web development ecosystem than Adobe , and get some services out there that are innovative ( where ’s the video RSS reader ?
Blog search ?
Something like Yahoo ’s Pipes ?
A real blog service ?
A way to look up people ? )
That ’s how you win .
Oh , and Ballmer , if I ran Google your speech at Stanford yesterday would be plastered on every door on every campus Google has .
Why ?
It ’ll motivate Google employees the same way a coach will motivate an opposing team during the Superbowl by taking trash in the press .
You ’re up against a formidable competitor and one you ’ve never seen before that has some real , significant weapons that you ca n’t deal with ( and YouTube is n’t even close to it ) .
Google ’s secret weapon ?
It controls the entire stack in the datacenter .
Google writes its own hard disk drivers .
It has its datacenter hardware built to its spec .
Ever wonder why Live.com is slower than Google ?
Hint : it ’s cause Google is out executing Microsoft in the datacenter .
This is n’t Netscape you ’re talking trash to , Steve .
Have you really studied Google ?
It does n’t sound like you have .
Again , Microsofties , you ’d be better served not to talk trash until you have something YOU CAN SHIP !
I sure hope they do n’t show up at Mix07 with this kind of “ we ’re in it to win ” talk .
The MVPs might be easy to talk into doing some cheerleading but the rest of us are over that now .
We ’re looking for signs of leadership and so far we do n’t see it .
Sigh .

BBC News , Baghdad
Fierce opposition to Iraq 's draft constitution looks set to ensure there will be no withdrawal of US troops in the near future , and as the violence continues , the Vietnam comparisons return .
August has been one of the bloodiest months of the conflict
" Can you go to Baghdad ? "
Five words which send a shiver down the stiffest journalistic spine .
After covering more than a dozen conflicts during the past couple of decades , I was in no doubt as to what a trip to one of the world 's most dangerous capitals would be like .
Two and a half years on from the war which brought down Saddam Hussein , death is still part of daily life in Baghdad .
The past few weeks in Iraq have been particularly bloody .
Twice in recent days my breakfast has been interrupted by the crump of nearby explosions and the crack of rifle fire .
The continuing violence is fuelling yet more comparisons about whether what is happening here - with American troops bogged down in a seemingly endless battle against the insurgents - is similar to the United States ' terrible experience in Vietnam .
Demoralised forces
When I was growing up as a kid in the early 1970s , I remember watching BBC reporters in Vietnam talking about the demoralised American forces , unable to defeat their enemy .
It was seeing these glamorous figures on television that made me want to be a foreign correspondent .
Half a million American troops spent 10 years in Vietnam fighting the communists
It is an easy analogy for critics of the American presence here to bandy about , and the truth is that there are both similarities and differences .
Half a million American troops spent 10 years in Vietnam fighting the communists before suffering their humiliating withdrawal .
This time the United States ' commitment is much smaller , casualties have been fewer and the aim is to leave heads - held - high much sooner .
But in some other ways , the conflicts are alike .
Losing control
The American troops - just like their predecessors in Vietnam - do appear to have low morale .
So far , almost 1,900 have been killed and the number rises every day .
The soldiers can sense that life is n't improving here .
One captain I spoke to said he feels as though his men are moving around Baghdad with their backs against the walls .
He told me they can feel what control they had slipping from their grasp .
He said in his unit , part of an infantry division , many of his soldiers are beginning to lose faith in their mission .
Falling morale goes hand - in - hand with a lack of discipline .
There was a vivid example of that here earlier this week when an Iraqi working as a TV sound recordist for the Reuters news agency was shot dead by an American soldier .
His only mistake was to have approached an area where there had been a shooting incident .
Innocent civilian
Waleed Khaled appears to have been fired on without any warning .
He leaves behind a wife who is four months pregnant and a seven - year - old daughter .
The Reuters cameraman with him was injured and , although the main witness to what had happened , he was promptly arrested by the Americans .
Before he was taken away , the cameraman was able to tell colleagues what had occurred .
A senior British official admitted there was now a problem with American troops
They were also refusing to give the injured cameraman any water .
The security adviser - a former British soldier - said it was apparent to him that the American troops wanted to clear away any evidence before there could be an outside inquiry .
He said what was most worrying was that the unit did not seem to care that they had shot dead an innocent civilian .
The American military authorities say their investigations are continuing .
Disastrous consequences
When I raised the matter with a senior British official in Baghdad , he admitted there was now a problem with American troops .
The US needs the backing of the ordinary Iraqi population
Every civilian death means that another family turns against the Americans , he said .
In Vietnam too , America lost the " hearts and minds " campaign with disastrous consequences .
During the final years in Vietnam , the Americans started handing over more and more military responsibility to local troops - the policy of " Vietnamisation " - but they proved ineffective , unable to stop the communist onslaught .
In Iraq today , there is a policy of " Iraqisation " .
Frightened army
Driving around Baghdad , I have seen more and more checkpoints manned by Iraqi troops , but they too appear badly led and trained .
It is critical for the US that the Iraqi security forces are effective
At one roadblock this week , I saw Iraqi troops with black woollen balaclavas over their heads , a bizarre sight in the stifling heat of the Baghdad summer .
They did not want to be recognised , worried that they and their families would be targeted .
It shows what little belief they have in their abilities .
Even members of the country 's new army are frightened of the insurgents .
Mention Vietnam and Iraq in the same breath here and American officers raise their eyes despairingly to the skies .
It is premature to make a real comparison but some of the similarities are becoming too close for comfort .
The last thing the Americans want is another humiliating pullout .

The California Energy Commission today announced that an innovative flywheel energy technology to enhance California ’s electricity grid is now one step closer to commercialization .
The Smart Energy Matrix system , developed by Beacon Power ’s , is a 100 - kilowatt scale - power flywheel energy storage system and a prototype for Beacon ’s planned 20 - megawatt - level commercial system .
Check out a flash animation of how this technology would be used to regulate the grid .
This regulation feature could also be used to do the same for variable output renewable technologies like wind or solar .
See a very good video of how these techs would work with renewable energy and how the energy market works here .
“ We ’re grateful for the consistent and effective support we ’ve received from the Energy Commission throughout the project , ” said Bill Capp , Beacon Power president and CEO .
“ We ’re also very pleased that our technology has been certified by the California ISO , which we announced earlier this week .
These two important authorities , in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy , are demonstrating energy policy leadership and vision .
They understand that new technologies will be required to maintain grid reliability while achieving ambitious goals for the deployment of renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions . ”
“ The application of new energy storage technologies is a high priority as California upgrades its electricity grid system .
The Energy Commission is pleased at the results of Beacon ’s testing and the potential for use of this technology in California , ” said Energy Commissioner John Geesman .
“ California has made a significant commitment to deploy renewable energy placing greater demands on the state ’s electric grid .
Technologies such as Beacon ’s flywheel - based energy storage system provide attractive options to address these emerging issues . ”
Beacon Power completed the Critical Project Review ( CPR ) , a significant milestone that assesses the status of research contracts and validates that the contractor is complying with the terms of the contract .
The CPR evaluates the field performance of the flywheel system and recommends any final actions required to complete a full assessment of this innovative technology .
The flywheel system is actually a kinetic , or mechanical battery , spinning at very high speeds to store energy that is instantly available when needed .
In addition to the environmental and transmission benefits of flywheel technology , current research at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories indicates that 10 megawatts of fast - responding flywheel energy could provide the grid with the equivalent energy of 20 megawatts or more of traditional slow - responding power plant energy .
Flywheel technology also serves as a method to reduce electrical fluctuations and helps regulate the even flow of power ( frequency regulation ) on the grid .
Grid operators , such as the California ISO , purchase frequency regulation services every day .
In 2005 , the value of regulation services purchased by four U.S. regional grid operators in open power markets was in excess of $ 600 million .
California ISO ’s David Hawkins states , “ A 40 - megawatt facility , or two of the plants that Beacon is designing under a Department of Energy contract , could provide a portion of the regulation services required by California ISO .
Due to its very high - speed rate , this technology also has the potential to provide valuable transmission grid services and reduce greenhouse gas emissions . ”
The California Energy Commission contracted with Massachusetts - based Beacon Power in 2005 , to develop and install a system to demonstrate the potential benefits of using flywheel energy storage for frequency regulation of the grid , a service required by all grid operators .
The system first became operational in 2005 and completed a series of performance tests and technical assessments prior to a six - month field trial phase on August 1 , 2006 .
Field demonstration testing of the Beacon Smart Energy Matrix will continue until January 31 , 2007 .
After that , the Energy Commission and DOE will review all the performance data collected over the six - month period and produce a publicly available report summarizing the testing program , results and recommendations .
The Department of Energy ( DOE ) Energy Storage Systems Program Office , through Sandia National Laboratories , is also providing technical assistance to the Energy Commission for this contract .

Sometimes all it takes is one smart move .
Darren Barefoot , annoyed by a swell of media coverage about the virtual world Second Life , created a parody of it -- getafirstlife.com .
( The subhead : " Your world .
Sorry about that . " )
Barefoot launched his site in January , submitted it to recommendation sites , and sent it to a few bloggers ; it worked its way up Digg .
Soon he was enjoying his own little windfall : 350,000 visitors in 30 days , and roughly $ 1,000 from Google ads -- ironically enough , ads for the myriad businesses and services that cater to Second Life users .
" This was a fire - and - forget project , " says Barefoot , a public relations exec in Vancouver , British Columbia .

It 's 6 a.m. and I 've been tossing and turning for the last hour .
That 's what you get from drinking too much champagne while helping an uncle configure his Mac for web and mail .
Actually , maybe it's all Paul Graham 's fault , since most of the ideas jumping around in my mind have to do with his Startup School from two weeks ago .
I decided I might as well get up and write that post I 've been wanting to write ever since I got back from Boston .
All in all , It was quite an experience .
I almost did n't make it to the US .
It was only the night before my flight to Boston that I found out that my perfectly valid Portuguese passport was no longer good enough to get into the States .
Since last April , US visa waivers only apply to holders of machine - readable passports .
Next morning at 8 AM I was standing in line in front of the US embassy to try to get an entry visa .
When I finally got in , I found out that the computer system was down , and that the list of requirements for getting a visa was so long that there was no way I was going to get one that morning .
I switched to plan B and tried to get a new passport issued in 2 hours instead of the usual minimum 24 hours .
Things did n't look good when I got to the " Governo Civil de Lisboa " :
Their computer system was also down , and they told me my chances of getting a new passport in time for my flight were very slim .
Fortunately , at 11:45 it finally started working , and I got a brand new passport just in time to catch my 2 PM flight .
I left wondering what kind of shared distributed system that was causing problems both at the US embassy and the local passport issuer .
Maybe some kind of Interpol felon database ...
I got to the Harvard Science building next morning at around 9:15 and joined a nearly packed auditorium .
I did n't catch much of the first talk by Trip Advisor 's founder , although it sounded interesting .
I took a good look around :
Most people seemed to be in their early twenties and the audience was overwhelmingly male .
I saw 10 to 20 people who might be women , and discovered later that some of them were just guys with long hair ( in his talk , Paul Graham came up with an interesting explanation for why so few women start tech startups ) .
Many in the audience were using laptops , particularly Apple laptops - mostly Powerbooks , with a few scattered iBooks .
Many seemed to be engaged in collective note - taking with SubEthaEdit .
I tried to join in , but for some reason it did n't work .
I also tried use Bonjour iChat to see if anyone was talking about the conference , but although I could see a lot of users I could n't chat with anyone .
A few other Mac users had the same problem .
The day went by pretty quickly as I was engrossed in the presentations , a total of 13 from 9 to 5 .
Topics included Intellectual Property , Legal Issues , Economics , Venture Capital and Finance for Startups ( I actually found this last one quite interesting ) .
Most speakers were quite good , some were excellent .
Steve Wozniak was amazing , and was the only speaker to get a well deserved standing ovation .
The Yahoo guy was perhaps the least exciting of all speakers , I found it hard to pay attention to what he said .
Stan Reiss was in my opinion one of the best speakers , presenting a fascinating account of how Venture Capital firms work and why they can be useful .
Olin Shivers also did an excellent , gripping presentation covering a lot of stuff , including a critique of VCs with the über - quotable headline " VCs : soulless agents of Satan or just clumsy rapists ? " .
I managed to ask Paul Graham a question in his keynote 's question round ( " yes , you , the guy in the orange shirt " ) : " if you have an idea you believe is valuable , how hard should you try to protect it , and who can you share it with ? " .
Paul answered with some good advice , but I still asked him , tongue - in - cheek , " should I tell you ? " , to which he promptly replied " No ! ! " , drawing a round of laughter .
A lot of interesting data entered into my brain , hopefully some of it stuck .
Fortunately I can always recap with the online slides , the mp3 podcasts and the assorted notes .
The best part of the conference , however , was the social networking that took place in and around it , and the sheer buzz and energy that people seemed to share .
Although most people left at the end of the conference , a few dozen people remained clustered around some of the speakers , asking questions and exchanging ideas .
I had a nice burrito at some Mexican place near Harvard Square ( Felipe 's something ? ) with a bunch of them , and we had fun discussing tools , languages and startups .
One of them was a Google guy who earlier had declined to answer a couple of questions I asked , saying " I do n't have clearance for answering that " .
Paul Graham
I was lucky enough to be invited by Paul Graham at the end of the conference to show up next day at Y Combinator 's open house - I think he was so amazed that I had come all the way from Europe ( I was one of only 4 europeans at the conference ) that he thought I deserved a break .
Y Combinator is about half an hour on foot from Harvard Square , and is housed in a small one - floor square building .
From the outside it does n't look like much , but inside it 's very pleasantly laid out and decorated - I took a few photos with my phone camera .
It seems that Paul 's aesthetic sense does n't only apply to computer code , which is not altogether surprising given that he 's also a painter .
Around 30 people were there , about a third of them members of the Summer Founders program .
I met a lot of interesting and interested people , who were discussing their projects .
I do n't yet have a project of my own to discuss , so we discussed practices , tools and languages , same as the day before .
What emerged from the discussions at the open house and later around dinner was a kind of consensus : nobody at the Startup School seems to consider using anything other than agile programming languages .
No mention was made by anyone I talked to of using Java , C# or other staticly typed languages , but also no mention of Perl or even PHP .
The only credible contenders seem to be Lisp , Scheme , Ruby and Python , at least for this crowd ( applications for Startup School were selected by Paul , who has a generic dynamic language bias and is a Lisp evangelizer ) .
Oh , and EVERYBODY 's heard about Ruby on Rails , most are interested , many are already using it .
I 've been learning Rails too , and I have to agree : it 's a wonderful tool .
So , apart from meeting celebrities , learning stuff , having fun , meeting people , discovering Boston and spending a lot of money on air flights and hotels , what did I get from this conference ?
Well , most of all a sense that the time is pregnant with opportunities , and the sooner you have something you can show other people the better .
The fact that so many clever and dynamic people believe this and are doing something about it really excited me and gave me the confidence and the energy to do something of my own .
One of the guys I met at Y Combinator repeatedly said " We 're crazy !
This is all crazy " .
In a way he 's right : most of us will fail .
Nevertheless , I still left Boston feeling that it was sheer insanity not to try to act on my ideas .
Many thanks to Paul Graham for conceiving and organizing this new kind of event .
I hope it will inspire other events of the same kind , particularly in Europe where people as not as interested in entrepreneurship ( probably someone other than Paul will have to do it - his plans are to eventually do another Startup School on the West Coast , and perhaps later in China ) .
I 'm confident many a doubter will be more eager to dive into the water after such an experience .

ちょっとこの間まで世界大会のお手伝いに行ってきました。
ディズニーランドとかはあんまり興味なかったのですが、
世界中からスーパープログラマが集結する機会というのは
やはり貴重なので、今年もその場に立ち会えてよかったです。
会場にいる間はもうずっと自分がもう出られないことが
ひたすら残念で残念で、現役の選手がうらやましくて
たまらなかったです。ことさら、問題がやさしかったなら。
オープン参加でもいいからあの時間を共有したかった。
終わったあとにコンテスタントと感想戦をしたのですが、
やはりそれが面白かったです。
全問題の結論がでるまで検討したかった。
表彰式は今年もすごかったです。
ワルシャワ大は神といわざるを得ない。
残り時間一時間でスコアボードが凍結されていて、
表彰式の時にサブミットしてた問題が通っていたかどうか
公表されていったのですが、
ほかのチームがどんど んWAになっていく中、
ワルシャワ は7→8 問、
その瞬間、会場はもうスタンディングオベーションでした。
ちなみに、コンテスト期間中の一番驚いたのは
26行の最小費用流のコード。
練習セッション中の印刷物を運ぶのをやっていたのですが、
どこかのチームがとても短い min_cost_flow とかいう関数を
印刷していて、それが数えてみると26行しかない。
しかも、それも無理に詰め込んだ感じではなくて、
いたって普通のコードで、
ほんとうにこれで最小費用流が動くなら、
去年の世界大会でロシアチーム に「 As Usual 」
とか言われたのも納得せざるを得ません。
というわけで、どなた か26行以下で
最小費用流のコードを書いてみませんか？
そして、私にこっそり教えてください。
大会期間中はコードが書けなかったので、
とりあえず、帰ってきてから8問分ほど書いてみました。
せっかくなので、問題の考察をしてみようかと思います。
http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/Finals/2007WorldFinalProblemSet.pdf
問題はここから参照できます。
・問 題A
両親と子の三人のうち二人の血液 型( ABORh ) が与えられるので、
残りの一人の血液型でありうるものを列挙せよ。
血液型は冗長に数えても36通りを考慮すれば十分なので、
三人の血液型の組み合わせ36^3すべてをチェックすればよいだろう。
適当に書いたら98行になった。
・問題B
A - Zの番号の付いた荷物が港にやってくる。
荷物はやってくる順に何列かのスタックに積む。
積み終わった後に番号の若い順に荷物を回収する船が来る。
その際、スタックの下のほうにある荷物は
回収できないので、ある船が来た時、
その船が回収する荷物はすべてスタックのトップにあって欲しい。
スタックは最小で何列必要か。
問題の要求より、小さい番号の荷物の上に大きい番号の荷物を置くことは出来ない。
荷物がやってくる順に、既存のスタックの上にその荷物が置けるなら置く、
置けないなら新しいスタックを作る、
複数置ける場所があるなら、よりスタックトップが小さい番号のところに置けばよい。
置ける場所があるなら置いたほうが良い理由は、いまやってきた荷物をx,置こうとしている場所のトップをyとすると、
置いた場合のスタックトップの組は(x , *) 、置かなかった場合の組は(y , x ) で、前者は後者よりも完全に良いから。
複数箇所おける場合に小さい番号のところに置いた方が良いのも同様に。
コードは大変簡単に書ける。
・問題G
ルーター (？) にいくつかのメッセージを細切れにしたいくつかのパケットがやってくる。
各メッセージをまとめて順番に出力するために必要なバッファの最小のサイズは？
ある番号のメッセージを出力し始めたら、そのメッセージが終わるまで
ほかのメッセージを出力できない、という仕様を
各メッセージを細切れに出力しても良いと読み違えたチームが多かったらしい。
しかし、よく考えるとそれだとバッファサイズの最小値も何も一通りしかないような気がする。
解法は、メッセージが5個しかないので、メッセージを出力する順番をすべて試せばよい。
あとは書くだけ 。
・問題F
4*4の盤面に番号の付いた石と番号の付いた穴がある。
盤面を4方向に傾けて、その方向に全部の石を移動させることが出来る。
全ての石を対応する穴に落とせばゴール。
最短手数を求めよ 。
ありうる盤面のパターンは多分とても少ない。
石の数は8個まであるが、石が多いとほとんど身動きが取れないし、
少ないとそもそもパターンが少ないし、一度でも盤面を傾けると
石は壁沿いにしか存在できないので、やはりもっと少ないだろう。
というわけで幅優先探索。
コードはこれまた適当に書いたら95行ぐらいになった。
・問題C
二次元平面状にジグザグの経路が与えられる。
これをある角度傾けた時にすべて上り坂になっているようにしたい。
元の経路を時計回りに何度回転させればそうなるか？
あるいははじめからそうなっているか？
それともどう回転させても無理か？
各線分について回転させて上りになるか、下りになるか、切り替わる角度を0から2πの範囲で列挙。
あとは角度を下からなめていって、上り坂の数が線分の数に等しくなることがあるかどうかを調べればよい。
θ=0の場合は明らかに引っ掛け、常にOK 。
・問題D
格子点上のポリゴンが与えられる。
そのポリゴンと相似で、格子点上にのる最小のポリゴンを求め、
それの1倍、2倍、...、M倍の大きさのポリゴンの内部の格子点の数の
和を求めよ。答えは64ビット符号付整数に収まる。
1000 角形まで 、Mは100万以下。
ピックの定理を使えばよいらしい。
格子点上の図形は 、
( 面積 ) =( 内部の格子点の数 ) +( 辺上の格子点の数 ) /2-1
が成り立つ 。
1倍の図形について、面積sと辺上の格子点の数aを求めると
答えは Σ( i=1..m ) s*i*i-a*i/2+1 となり、これは展開すると
s*m *( m+1 ) *( 2*m+1)/6-a*m*( m+1)/4+m
になる…のだが ！
割る6とか引き算とかが出てくるので、これは答えが64ビット符号付整数に収まったとしても
計算途中の値も収まるとは限らない。
というわけで、ここでは多少時間がかかっても一つずつ級数を計算するのがベター。
100 万 だから計算が間に合ってしまうのがなんとも。
日本チームはここに引っかかっていた可能性が高いということ。
一つずつの計算なら、引き算は入るけど 、
途中の値が求める値の二倍を越えないので、
unsigned long long で計算すれば十分かと思われる 。
( あるい はJava使ってるチームだったらBigIntegerで何も考えずに書けるのだろうなあ)
さて、ここからが本番 。
・問題I
多 分2チームしか通してない問題。
筒状のタンクが何本かあり、
隣り合うタンクはパイプで繋がれている。
それぞれのタンクの高さと、パイプの高さが与えられる。
パイプの高さは左か ら" 単調増加 " 。
一番左のタンクからゆっくりと 、
あふれるまで水を注ぐ 。
タンクにどれぐらい水が入るか？
物理法則はだいたい現実に即する。
たぶんあってる解法 ：
タンクをつなぐパイプの両端が水没しているなら、
両端の水圧はつりあっている。
一番左のタンクは最終的には水が満タンになるので、
左端のタンクと一つ右のタンクを繋ぐパイプにかかる水圧は簡単に求まる。
この水圧になるように、一つ右のタンクに入っている水の量を推定する。
一つ右のタンクの水の量が分かれば、同様にもう一つ右のタンクの水量を推定し、
同様にさらにもう一つ右の…と計算していき、すべてのタンクの水量を計算する。
その際に、前のタンクとつながっているパイプにかかる水圧および、
現在のタンクを含む空間が「閉鎖」されたときの圧力を持ち回り、
これを用いて計算する 。
まず最初に、一番左から一つ右のタンクについては、
前のタンクとつながっているパイプの水圧P1=1+0.097*(水面からパイプまでの高さ ) 、
閉鎖された時の圧 力P2=1 。
各イテレーションは3パターンに場合わけされる。
┌┐ ││ ← ③ │├ ← ② ││ ← ① ┤│ └ ┘
① 前のパイプから次のパイプの高さの間で水面がつりあうとき
② 次のパイプまで水面が達するが、次のタンクに注ぎ込まれた水の高さがパイプにまで到達しないとき
③ さらに水面が上でつりあうと き
①〜③のいずれになるかは、それぞれ境界まで水を注いだ時の水圧を計算すれば分かる。
①と②の境界まで注いだ時、次以降のタンクの体積の合計をVとし、
現在のタンクの高さをH、前との連結部の高さをh1、次との連結部の高さをh2とすれば、
前との連結部にかかる水圧は、
( P2*( V+H-h1 ) /( V+H-h2 ) ) +0.097*(h2 - h1 )
②と③の境界まで注いだ時は、
( P2*( V+H-h1 ) / ( V+H-h2 - h2 ) ) +0.097*( h2 - h1 )
これ とP1を比較し、①〜③に場合わけする。
①の場合、水面の高さをxとすると、
P1=( P2*( V+H-h1 ) /( V+H-x ) ) +0.097*(x- h1 )
二次方程式を解けばxは求まる。
水は次のタンクに注ぎ込まない。
よってイテレーションはbreakして、計算は終了。
②の場合、次のタンクに注ぎ込む水の高さをxとすると、
P1=( P2*( V+H-h1 ) /( V+H-h2-x ) ) +0.097*(h2 - h1 )
一次方程式を解けばxは求まる 。
水は次のタンクに注ぎ込むが、その量はxと分かっている。
さらに次のタンクには注ぎ込まない。
よってイテレーションはbreakし、計算は終了。
③の場合、水面の高さをxとすると、
P'=( P2*( V+H-h1 ) /( V+H-h2 -h2 ) ) +0.097*( h2 - h1 ) として、
P1 = ( P'*( H - h2 ) / ( H - x ) ) +0.097*(x- h1 )
二次方程式を解けばxは求まる。
水は次のタンクに流れ込み、計算する必要がある。
P2←P '
P1 ←( P '*( H - h2 ) / ( H- x ) ) +0.097*( x - h2 )
と更新し、イテレーションを継続。
この繰り返しにより全てのタンクの水量が求まるので、答えが出る。
最後のタンクにはさらに次に高さ0のタンクがあって、
高さMAXのパイプでつながっているとすれば最後のタンクは必ず①になってくれるので、
例外処理せずにすんで楽。
ここまで計算してしまえばコードを書くのは(多分)簡単。
でも、とても書き間違いをしそう。
しかもサンプルインプットでは①のケースしか検証できない。
通すのは大変そう 。
・問題E
これも2チームしか通していない問題。
コンベア上を荷物が流れているので、
ちょうど荷物にぶつかるように歩いていくという問題？
あんまり詳しく問題の仕様を聞いていないので、
解法は良く分からない 。
解いたチームの話によると、バイナリサーチ。
ここから誰も解いていない問題
・問 題H
三次元空間上に三角形がいくつ か( 1000 個、頂点は300 個 ) ある。
Z軸方向上方から三角形を見下ろした時、可視部分にペンキを塗らなければならない(？ ) 。
可視部分 の " 実際の " 面積を求めよ。小数点以 下2桁。
座標値は100を越えない自然数。
三角形は互いに触れないし、共通部分も持たない。
要求精度が小数点二桁ながら、
三角形が1000個あり、一辺が100の正三角形を
斜めに剣山みたいにたてて置くと全てが見えて、
その場合答えが1000万のオーダまでいくので、
要求精度としては9桁必要になる。
メッシュなどはちょっと不可能ではないだろうか。
一つ思いついた解法としては、スキャンラインによるもの。
三角形が共通部分を持たないので、
上から見た図形としては三角形が重なりあったものになる。
よって、x - y平面を線分の端点と交点のy座標で帯状にスライスすると、
そこに入っている図形は台形のみになる。
あとはその中央辺りで空間を切断して、三角形の入っている区間とその三角形の傾きが分かればよい。
… のだが、ナイーブに実装するとO(n^3)( n=三角形の数)になってしまうような気がする。
うまく実装する とO(n^2 ) になりそうではあるが、
ちょっと私は書いてる途中で良く分からなくなってしまった。
・問題J
無向グラ フ( ノード 数50 、エッジ数1000 ) があり、
点1にスパイがいて、点0に向かおうとしている。
点0にいかれては困るので、エッジをなるべく少ない数爆破して、
スパイが点0にいけないようにしたい。
最小本数を求めよ 。
同じノードの対に複数エッジがあるのは、一部爆破するのは無意味なので、
単にエッジの数で重み付きグラフにしてしまえばよいとして。
これは単なる最小カットではない。というのも、
１ ├┬┐ ２３４ ├┴┘ ０
のようなグラフがあったとき、これの答えが2になるというサンプルインプットがある。
これはスパイが234のいずれかに移動した瞬間にその両端を爆破してしまえばOKということで、
スタート地点からの最小カットを求める意味が無いということ。
また、後の議論により、エッジを時間差で爆破するのが適切であるというケースも見つかった。
これにより、全点からの最小カットを求めて、1から0へのパス中の最小の最小カットが
最大になるようなものを求める、というものでもない。
時間差で破壊するものを考慮しなければならなくなって、
ちょっともうお手上げで、どうして良いのかわからない。
探索がありうるのかとも考えたが、
完全グラフを考えると、ノードの次数が49まで行くので、
あるノードからどのエッジの組を破壊するかの組み合わせだけで2^49通りあるので、
とても無理だという結論に至った。
というわけで、この問題は完全にお手上げ。
・総括
6問目と7問目の境が大きい。
その中で8問通したワルシャワ大学はやはりすごいと思った。
問題EとJは後でちゃんと考えたい。
News agency Reuters has called for the release of an Iraqi cameraman who has been held by the US military for two weeks .
Reuters said it was " concerned and dismayed " by the detention of 36 - year - old freelance Omar Abrahem al - Mashhadani and asked for an explanation for his treatment .
The group 's global managing editor , David Schlesinger , demanded access to Mashhadani , who was arrested on August 8 .
" We are very concerned and dismayed by this unexplained and prolonged detention of a journalist working for us and urge the US military either to release him or provide a full account of the accusations against him , " Mr Schlesinger said .
" Ali al - Mashhadani is a professional journalist whose work for us brings him into contact with parties in conflict .
" In the interests of the independent media the United States has pledged to foster in Iraq , it is imperative the authorities act speedily to clarify with news organisations any suspicions arising from the activities of journalists working for us . "
US military spokesmen have not said why they have detained Mashhadani , who has been working for Reuters as a cameraman and photographer for a year in Ramadi , the capital of Iraq 's Anbar region .
Lieutenant Colonel Guy Rudisill , a spokesman for US detainee operations in Iraq , said the journalist was being held in Baghdad 's Abu Ghraib prison and was not allowed to have visitors for the next 60 days .
Mashhadani's family have said he was detained after US marines found images on his cameras and his desktop computer .
Reuters said it had provided the US military with published work by Mashhadani showing scenes of conflict and gunmen operating in plain view of civilians .
This is not the first time Reuters has clashed with the US military over the treatment of its journalists .
Last year , three Iraqis working for Reuters were arrested at the scene of a helicopter crash near Falluja .
They claimed they were later sexually and physically abused by US soldiers for three days before being released , though a report cleared the troops involved .
Mashhadani's predecessor in Ramadi , Dhia Najim , was killed during fighting between US marines and insurgents in November last year .
Reuters said the exact circumstances of his death had not been clarified despite its requests .
The agency has had two cameramen killed by US troops in Iraq since the war began there in March 2003 : a Ukrainian , Taras Protsyuk , and a Palestinian , Mazen Dana .

Last week , I was working with a C++ team and they needed some testing help so I pulled out my bag of tricks .
I showed them how they could make their code more testable by externalizing object creation and adding constructor parameters .
They were a little shocked that I would add constructor parameters just to make code testable , so I asked whether they ’d ever heard of dependency injection ( DI ) .
My question was met with silence , but frankly I expected it .
In my experience , few people in the C++ community seem to know about dependency injection .
Part of this is understandable .
C++ has been growing away from Java for the last seven or eight years .
There used to be a rather large overlap between C++ and Java programmers , but that ’s changed .
The Java community has spent a great deal of time developing frameworks and tooling to advance their practice , but tooling is difficult in C++ so that community has been spending a great deal of time pushing templates as far as they ’ll go .
I was talking to Scott Meyers at a conference earlier this year and he said that he felt that the real fork in the road was ease of parsing and tractability of analysis ; that C++ was developed before people realized just how valuable those attributes were in a language , and as a result , the things that people do with reflection and tooling in Java are now attempted with template meta- programming because it seems like the easiest avenue .
It does n’t look all that easy from where I sit , but it does look like a committed course of action .
The C++ and OO communities do n’t seem to have much in common any more in the solution space , but they do have some common problems .
Testability is a tough taskmaster .
It ’s hard to write code that is easily testable unless you ’re very diligent .
When we work in statically typed languages , code is coupled by default .
If a class uses another class , you have a compile - time dependency .
C++ does have a sneaky way out of this problem .
Templates are essentially un - typed so you do have some leverage before they are all instantiated to type - safe code , but regardless , testability is hard .
If a class of yours uses vendor software that you can’t really run in your test environment , well , you need an adapter to mock it out .
If you did n’t build one in , you ’re left with the task of refactoring one in .
In the Java community , dependency injection has evolved as a way to solve this problem .
The core idea of dependency injection is simple : object creation is a separate concern .
If you push object creation into a separate area : an über - factory , you can make your code more flexible and more testable .
Most descriptions of DI dwell on XML configuration , but it ’s really simpler than that .
Essentially , a DI system has a big bag of types and you go to that bag ( factory ) and tell it to make you an object of a particular type .
The bag looks at the types and sees if it can create the object you want .
It uses reflection to examine constructor arguments , setters on classes , etc .
If it finds that it can , it will give you the object you asked for .
If you want an instance set up for testing , you alter the types in the bag .
C++ makes this a bit difficult .
There ’s no general way to determine the arity or arguments of a constructor at compile - time so that standard tricks for mimicking reflection with templates do n’t work .
There may be a way to do setter - based injection , using some of Andrei Alexandrescu ’s hierarchy generation techniques , but I ’m not sure yet .
In any case , it seems that to do DI in C++ , you have to place constraints on the classes you create .. you have to make them inherit from some other class , use macro preregistration or a metaobject library .
The one C++ DI framework I 've heard of , QtIocContainer , seems to bring along some of those constraints .
Maybe they are inevitable .
The thing that I do know is that it would be useful to have more awareness of DI in the C++ community .
I may be overestimating it , after all , the C++ community has not had nearly as many widespread , crippled vendor APIs hoisted upon them ..
APIs which make testing a real bear , but I ’ve seen a few , and I suspect that DI could help .

Women are likely to choose masculine looking men when they are ready for fertilization but wo n't search for long - term relationships with them .
However , her choice of the most suitable mate will change considerably depending on the perception of her own attractiveness , study says .
Recent studies on the related theme proved that women are receptive to men's smell at certain time of their periods .
The masculine - looking man featuring firm square chin and keen brows are seen as good partners for short - term relationships , while women are still inclined to spend a lifetime with more feminine looking men .
According to a new research that was conducted at University of Stirling in Scotland , women preferences undergo intricate changes during menstrual cycle ( women taking hormonal pills were not included in the study ) .
Women were asked to express opinion on their own attractiveness on different points of their periods .
Soon after that women had to rate the visual appeal of different male appearance types and were also questioned to tell who was the most attractive short - term or lifetime partner .
The results of the study revealed that those women who were at their most fertile time of the period , were not ready for serious relationships and considered themselves attractive would choose masculine - looking men in most cases .
The reasons explaining such choice of a mate have a biological basis .
Since the physical signs of masculinity are connected to high levels of male hormone testosterone this makes those men a better males : energetic , strong and healthy .
However , men with higher levels of testosterone are known to live shorter than those with lower levels of testosterone , that make them unreliable partners .
At the last quarter of menstrual cycle when women have similar hormonal profile with pregnancy , women are not seeking for a potential procreator .
That 's why their preferences fall for female looking men , who tend to be more supportive , which becomes very important for a woman and baby survival .
But the findings of the research also indicate that biological factors are not the only ones taken into consideration .
There is an essential link between a woman 's vision of her attractiveness and mate choice to add to her biological instincts .
Those who have lower self - esteem will not choose a masculine man even being at their most fertile period .
This can mean that no matter how strong women 's reproductive instincts are , brain is still the most important factor to find a partner .

Hanging around the ruby crowd for a while , I 've come across the term ' Humane Interface ' quite a bit .
It describes part of the rubyist attitude to writing class interfaces , I think it also sets up an interesting contrast between two schools of thought in designing APIs ( the other is the MinimalInterface ) .
The essence of the humane interface is to find out what people want to do and design the interface so that it 's really easy to do the common case .
The obvious contrast to a minimal interface is that humane interfaces tend to be much larger , and indeed humane interface designers do n't worry too much about the interface being big .
This is n't to say that classes with humane interfaces need be larger in terms of implementation .
The fundamental functionality of the two is often quite similar .
A good way of looking at the difference between humane and minimal interfaces is to compare the list components in Java and Ruby .
Java has an interface ( java.util .
List ) which declares 25 instance methods .
Ruby has an Array class ( which is a list not an array ) that has 78 methods .
That difference in size is something of a clue of that there 's a different style here ( although there 's more reasons for that difference ) .
Both components offer the basic same service , but Ruby 's array includes a lot of additional functionality .
This functionality is all relatively small things that can be built on Java 's minimal interface .
Let 's take a small example to help show the difference : getting the last item on the list .
To do this in Java you do :
aList.get ( aList.size - 1 )
in Ruby you do
anArray.last
In fact it 's even more startling than that : Ruby 's Array has a first method too , so rather than going anArray [ 0 ] you can go anArray .
first .
There 's larger elements of functionality as well .
Ruby 's Array has a flatten method that takes nested arrays and turns them into a single level .
irb > [ 1,2 , [ 3,4, [ 5,6] ,7] ,8 ] . flatten => [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]
The point here is all of this functionality , whether as simple as last or as complex as flatten , can be written by clients themselves without increasing the size of the list class .
Minimalists tend to focus on the minimal set of necessary methods to support these behaviors , humane designers try to add methods that are needed .
Often these extra methods are referred to as convenience methods , a term that minimalists do not consider to be a complement .
This begs the question : " what 's the basis for deciding what should be added to a humane interface ? "
If you put in everything anyone might want you 'll get a very complex class .
Humane interface designers try to identify what are the most common uses of a class , and design the interface to make these uses easy .
Not just does this principle inspire the methods you add , it also affects how you name them .
At RubyConf , Tanaka Akira pointed out the value of preferring short names for common methods .
Since these are used more often you get familiar with them - it 's easy to remember brief names if you use them a lot , also it 's more useful since it saves typing and reading .
An example of this is the parse method on DateTime that does a default parse of common date formats and the more flexible strptime that can take any format , but you use less often .
This principle of naming is n't in conflict with the minimalist approach .
Indeed when Java 's List interface appeared it changed the legacy Vector 's element At method to get .
Another interesting consequence of ruby 's humane interface philosophy is the aliasing method names .
When you want the length of a list , should you use length or size ?
Some libraries use one , some the other , Ruby 's Array has both , marked as aliases so that either name calls the same code .
The rubyist view being that it 's easier for the library to have both than to ask the users of a library to remember which one it is .
You can get long and tiresome threads about which style of interface design is best .
Here I 'll try to summarize the arguments in favor of the humane interface ( see MinimalInterface for the other side ) .
Much of an object 's strength lies in its behavior , not its data .
If you only try to provide the minimum , you end up with multiple clients duplicating code for common cases .
In cases like flatten you end up with a bunch of people writing their own recursive functions .
It 's not hard , but why should they bother when it 's not that rare a case ?
Even for simple cases like last , readers have to learn an idiom .
Why should they have to see something indirect , when a simple method reads directly ?
Good software thinks of the users first and makes life easy for them .
Humane interfaces follow that principle .
Humane interfaces do more work so that clients do n't have to .
In particular the human users of the API need things so that their common tasks are easy to do - both for reading and writing .
There are good arguments on both sides .
Personally I lean to the Humane Interface approach , although I do think it 's harder .

Train surfing involves different and often very dangerous moves
" Yes , I can fall , but I can phone my mom , she can take me to the doctor , " he says .
The tall 19 - year - old is one of Johannesburg 's " train surfers " : mostly young men who perform daring stunts on the city 's commuter trains .
The most dangerous is train surfing proper , standing on top and dodging bridges and high - power cables .
Then there 's a trick that involves swinging out of a door as the train travels through a tunnel and running along the sides .
The mildest , and most common , move involves jumping off the train as it begins moving , and jumping back on board again .

Kicking gravel
Johannesburg 's commuter trains have seen an upsurge in train surfing , partly because of the long - running security guard strike that has only just been settled .
Lebohang Motsamai , a strapping young man with hair braided tightly , describes another move , known as " gravul " from the gravel on the tracks : " I get under the train , when it is in motion , and kick the stones , kin , kin , I play with my legs . "
The easiest manouvre is jumping on and off a moving train
Some miles away , Desmond Motsemme , 15 , is lying in hospital .
His arms are tied to the rails of his bed because he 's become aggressive in his disorientation .
It 's visiting time , and his doting grandmother and mother are there every day , talking softly and feeding him yoghurt .
After weeks in hospital , slowly mending , he can still hardly speak .
He fell while swinging out of a train , trying to retrieve his cap that had flown off .
The result : severe concussion , and most of his scalp ripped off .
Injuries
His grandmother , Ruth Motsemme , says the injuries were terrible to see .
" I could n't look at him , really , like that .
The skin of the head was just off , from here to here , he was terribly swelling , and bleeding badly .
Most of the kids see dying as a way of resting from all these problems , from all these issues that life is throwing at them
Nonhlanhla Gasa , social worker
Mrs Motsemme says she spoke to him about the dangers of playing these games just days before the accident , but nothing seems to help : " I said to him , please my boy , that is the train , it is steel , it is going to kill you . "
Metrorail , the company that runs the commuter trains , says it is deeply concerned about the phenomenon .
The company keeps records of the accidents , injuries and suicides on its system , which transports over 500,000 people a day in the greater Johannesburg area .
Although the company wo n't release the figures , press reports about accidents have become a regular phenomenon .
Metrorail 's manager of educational projects , Dolly Gaelesiwe , is charged with visiting schools to talk to the kids about how dangerous the trains are .
But she also finds it very difficult to get through to them : " You know , whenever I go to schools I say guys , I 'm an aunt , granny , mother - to me every child is my child .
I do n't like what you are doing .
Why are you doing it ?
It worries me a lot because you see these kids getting hurt every day .
This is a national crisis , it is a real national crisis . "
Peer pressure
One person who thinks she has an idea of what fuels train surfing is Nonhlanhla Gasa , a social worker with the counselling and support group Childline .
She says that risk - taking is normal adolescent behaviour , but that it has a particular edge for kids from depressed communities .
" Nowadays there is a lot of things happening at home , domestic violence in communities , children 's rights are violated left , right and centre .
" So children want to prove themselves , they want to attract attention in so many dangerous ways , from the people .
It can be peer pressure , they want to see who is stronger than who . "
Life is cheap , she says , and when the teenagers shrug off the possibility of death , it 's not just bravado .
" For them life really does n't matter .
Most of the kids see dying as a way of resting from all these problems , from all these issues that life is throwing at them that they cannot take . "
Now that the security guard strike is over , the incidents may become less frequent .
But the teenagers ' delight in risk - taking is unlikely to disappear , and nor are the too - often disastrous consequences .
Feb. 12 , 2007  --
The latest taped statement from al Qaeda is an unusually personal attack on President Bush , in which al Qaeda 's No. 2 in command , Ayman al Zawahiri , denounces Bush as " an alcoholic , liar and gambler with an addictive personality . "
Zawahiri delivers the attack in a 40 - minute audio tape released overnight on Internet sites , and relayed to ABC News by an American terror analyst , Laura Mansfield .
On the tape , Zawahiri also condemns American Democrats " as one side of the same coin of tyranny , criminality and failure " for failing to challenge Bush policies as they said they would in the election .
The tape , apparently aimed at an American audience , contains English subtitles and a warning that American civilians are responsible for Bush policies because they " chose Bush twice . "
The personal , intemperate attack on Bush was remarkable for the emotion and venom from the usually stoic Zawahiri .
" I do n't know his present condition -- Americans know best about that , as they are experts in alcohol and addiction to it -- but the one who exams his personality finds that he is addicted to two other faults , lying and gambling , " Zawahiri said .
" He has gone down in history as one of its most notorious liars , " he added .

One could argue that the age of digital media truly began in the mid-1990s , when the MP3 standard of audio compression gained popularity , allowing users to rip vast quantities of music to their computers .
Personal MP3 players soon followed , and Apple managed to resurrect itself through the powerful iTunes +
iPod combination .
With the release of the fifth - generation iPod in 2005 , the age of digital video began in earnest .
Along with CDs , computer users sought a method for ripping their DVDs into conveniently smaller files .
While CD - ripping is an old trick by now , there are few DVD - ripping programs out there that can handle the task quickly efficiently -- even fewer of these programs are free .
Fortunately , if you ’re a Mac user , you have access to the best program available for getting those DVDs to your hard drive , iPod , or Apple TV : Handbrake .
You can download Handbrake from http://handbrake.m0k.org.
The program works with Mac OS 10.3.9 and later .
Once you ’ve downloaded and installed the program , you ’re ready to start ripping !
How to Rip DVDs to Your Mac
Basic movie ripping is fairly simple .
Here 's how to do it :
Insert a DVD into your Mac.
Apple 's DVD player will start -- just close it .
Start Handbrake .
First , Handbrake opens the selection screen , but this screen is fairly superfluous , unless you have multiple DVD drives .
Make sure Detected Volume is selected , and click Open .
Handbreak scans your DVD to detect the various titles and chapters , and opens the main Handbrake window .
Click here for a larger screenshot .
Make sure Handbrake has selected the proper title .
Titles and chapters are like headings and sub- headings , and your average DVD will probably have a couple of titles -- one for the main movie , and one or more for any special features .
Handbrake displays the length of the selected title , making it easy to tell if you ’ve got the right one .
If you do n’t , click the Title menu and select the proper title .
It should be the longest title available .
Now , go to the Destination section .
Handbrake ’s default destination is your desktop .
To make life a little easier , though , you can select any location you like .
Also , choose a name for your ripped file .
Click Rip to start importing your movie .
Take a walk or go to sleep -- this process can take quite a while !
Reduce the Size of Ripped Files
Ripping files at full - quality is great if you ’ve got a lot of storage space .
A full movie , ripped fully - quality , can land at a gig of hard drive space or more !
Sometimes , you just ca n’t afford to use that much space , especially if you ’re ripping for your iPod .
In Handbrake , there a couple easy ways to slim down your files :
Cut the Credits .
Be honest .
Do you usually watch the entire credit reel ?
Most people do n’t .
You can get rid of the credits easily through the Chapters selection in the Source section of Handbrake .
This requires a bit of work outside the program .
Remember how Apple 's DVD
Player runs automatically when you insert your DVD ?
You can use that player to figure out what chapter the credits run in .
It ’s usually the last one .
In Handbrake , you can cut out that chapter through the chapters fields .

Trim Down the Video .
Movies , by their very nature , are designed to be seen by large numbers of people at once .
Movie creators spend a lot of time and resources getting the picture quality just right .
However , if you ’re putting your movie on your iPod , it ’s probably going to be seen by only one person , and on a relatively small screen , to boot .
Do you really need anything super - high quality ?
Probably not .
Handbrake ’s Video section features two ways of monkeying around with the video quality of your file .
Target Size :
You can use Target Size to select a desired size for the final product .
This size is measured in megabytes ( MB ) .
You can select any size you like , but remember : the longer the film , the poorer the result when you try and squeeze the file under 300MB .
Constant Quality : With Constant Quality , you can reduce the quality of the file by a specific percentage .
Use the slider to define just what you want that percentage to be .
You can fiddle with these selections until you ’ve satisfied the quality - to - file size conundrum .

Handbrake ’s Video section features two ways of monkeying around with the video quality of your file .
Slim Down the Audio .
Along with tweaking the video quality , you can also reduce the quality of the audio component of your file in Handbrake ’s Audio section .
These controls function much the same as they would if you were ripping an audio CD .
Click Bitrate to change the bitrate of your audio .
The lower the bitrate , the lower the quality -- and the smaller the file .
Most MP3s are encoded with a bitrate of 156 - 192 bps , but for a movie , you can get along fine with a bitrate of 128 bps .
Changes to the audio quality can be a bit more subtle than changes to the video , so play around until you find something you like .
Along with tweaking the video quality , you can also reduce the quality of the audio component of your file in Handbrake ’s Audio section .
Chop the Screen .
This step is a great tool for for anyone ripping to an iPod .
You see , Handbrake automatically creates movies with a picture size close to that of the source you ’re ripping from .
For many applications , that ’s fine -- if you ’re ripping for your new Apple TV , you ’ll want that resolution .
But if you ’re going to load your movies onto your iPod , there ’s no sense in ripping a movie with a screen size twice the size of that on the device .
With Handbrake , you can easily tweak the height and width of the picture to fit the destination .
This keeps your file size down , especially when used with the other three tips .
To do this , click Picture Settings to open the picture dialog .
Click the arrows next to the height and width to adjust the picture size .
Use the Previous and Next buttons to advance through the chapters of your source and preview your screen dimensions .
These tips usually work best when they ’re all used at the same time .
Even if you drop the picture size of a movie down to the iPod ’s screen , it ’s still going to be a large file if you rip it at 100 % quality .
Play around with the settings until you know what you like , and be sure to check your work by loading samples onto your iPod .
How to Rip TV Shows
TV shows are great for iPods , and the process of ripping them is much the same as it is for movies .
The big differences come in selecting the right titles , and in building a queue of titles ( or episodes ) to be ripped .
Here 's how to do it :
Titles :
When you ’re ripping a television show , making sure you have the right title selected is easy -- you just choose the longest available title .
For a DVD from a TV show , the longest available title will be the one you get from selecting “ Play All . ”
It ’s all the episodes wrapped up in one convenient bundle !
If you want that , then it ’s fine .
If not , you ’ll have to select one of the shorter titles :
As you can see , one of these titles is not like another !
The first title is the “ play all ” option .
The last title is probably the animation you see when you first play the DVD .
The other three are individual episodes .
If you open your DVD player , you can figure out how long each episode is and match the title to the episode .
If you ’re not willing to go to that much work , simply use a generic file name for each episode , and rename them when you ’ve finished ripping .
When you ’re ripping a television show , making sure you have the right title selected is easy -- you just choose the longest available title .

If you want that , then it ’s fine .
If not , you ’ll have to select one of the shorter titles : Queues :
When you ’re ripping TV episodes off a DVD , you can build a queue to rip each episode in succession .
That way , you do n’t have to go back to Handbrake after each episode is finished .
To build a queue , first select Enable queue .
This activates the queue buttons .
To build your queue , set up all of the options you want to establish for your episode , then click Add to Queue .
Then , go to the next episode and do the same thing .
You can click Show Queue to look at the various tasks in the queue ; if any are incorrect , you can click Remove to clear them from the queue .
Note that once a task is saved , you cannot edit that task ; you must delete it from the queue and create the task again .
When you have finished building the queue , click Start to rip your episodes .
One more thing about queues :
They ’re a great way to try a number of different settings for ripping the same material .
For example , if you want to try a number of different video compression options to see which looks the best , you can set up a task for each option , then run them all to see which suits your fancy .
Note , though , that if your Mac goes to sleep while Handbrake is running , Handbrake will eventually pause .
How to Add Subtitles
You can use the Subtitle section of Handbrake to select from the subtitles available on your DVD .
When you select a subtitle , Handbrake imprints that subtitle onto the finished movie .
That 's it !
Handbrake is a fairly intuitive program , so if you want to see how things work , it ’s easy !
Feel free to experiment as you see fit .

Stephen Greenblatt , a Harvard professor , leading Shakespeare scholar , and author of the 2005 bestseller Will in the World , penned a piece in the latest New York Review of Books that surveys Shakespeare 's politics -- his take on the uses and abuses of political power .
The piece starts in a wonderful way , so forgive us for quoting it a little at length :
In 1998 , a friend of mine , Robert Pinsky , who at the time was serving as the poet laureate of the United States , invited me to a poetry evening at the Clinton White House , one of a series of black - tie events organized to mark the coming millennium .
On this occasion the President gave an amusing introductory speech in which he recalled that his first encounter with poetry came in junior high school when his teacher made him memorize certain passages from Macbeth .
This was , Clinton remarked wryly , not the most auspicious beginning for a life in politics .
After the speeches , I joined the line of people waiting to shake the President 's hand .
When my turn came , a strange impulse came over me .
This was a moment when rumors of the Lewinsky affair were circulating , but before the whole thing had blown up into the grotesque national circus that it soon became .
" Mr. President , " I said , sticking out my hand , " do n't you think that Macbeth is a great play about an immensely ambitious man who feels compelled to do things that he knows are politically and morally disastrous ? "
Clinton looked at me for a moment , still holding my hand , and said , " I think Macbeth is a great play about someone whose immense ambition has an ethically inadequate object . "
I was astonished by the aptness , as well as the quickness , of this comment , so perceptively in touch with Macbeth 's anguished brooding about the impulses that are driving him to seize power by murdering Scotland 's legitimate ruler .
When I recovered my equilibrium , I asked the President if he still remembered the lines he had memorized years before .
Of course , he replied , and then , with the rest of the guests still patiently waiting to shake his hand , he began to recite one of Macbeth 's great soliloquies :
If it were done when 'tis done , then ' twere well
It were done quickly .
If th' assassination
Could trammel up the consequence , and catch
With his surcease success : that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end - all , here ,
But here upon this bank and shoal of time ,
We 'd jump the life to come .
But in these cases
We still have judgement here , that we but teach
Bloody instructions which , being taught , return
To plague th'inventor .
( 1.7.1 –10 ) There the most powerful man in the world — as we are fond of calling our leader — broke off with a laugh , leaving me to conjure up the rest of the speech that ends with Macbeth 's own bafflement over the fact that his immense ambition has " an ethically inadequate object " : I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent , but only
Vaulting ambition , which o'erleaps itself
And falls on th'other .... ( 1.7.25 –28 ) [ 1 ]
I left the White House that evening with the thought that Bill Clinton had missed his true vocation , which was , of course , to be an English professor .
But the profession he actually chose makes it all the more appropriate to consider whether it is possible to discover in Shakespeare an " ethically adequate object " for human ambition .
The article goes on to explore just this question , and it's well worth the read .
( And , oh how do I miss Clinton in some ways . )
The piece also sets the stage for a radio program that aired last week on one of our favorite shows , PRI 's Open Souce ( Feed - Mp3 ) .
Speaking with Stephen Greenblatt and two other scholars -- Oliver Arnold ( Princeton ) and Jim Fitzmorris ( Tulane ) -- the host Christopher Lydon sorts through Shakespeare 's outlook on power and leadership ( within both monarchies and republics ) , and then they circle back to view America 's political landscape through the Bard 's eyes .
Shakespeare made his political commentary often by looking back over 1500 years to Ancient Rome .
So is it too far fetched to project his thinking forward 400 years , to America 2007 ?

Scientists may be a step closer to understanding one of the most brilliant minds ever to grace the field , that of Albert Einstein , the man who unravelled the mysteries of the atom .
Researchers at Lausanne University identified an unknown role for a type of brain cell that Einstein is thought to have had in more copious supply than the average male .
The scientists said the cells provided energy for neural circuits and helped build connections , leading to a more complex brain structure .
The team , led by Andrea Volterra , investigated specialised cells known as glial cells , which , it was originally believed , helped hold neurons together but did little else .
In recent years , the cells have given up some of their secrets and are now thought to play a crucial role in brain activity .
Researchers found that glial cells ferry calcium to surrounding neurons and control messages around the brain .
Olbermann : Minority voting suppressed by Justice Dept. David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday May 8 , 2007 Print This Email
This Comparing the breaking scandal involving US Justice Department hiring to actions by the Soviet Politburo , MSNBC host Keith Olberman says in the video clip below that political considerations were behind the hiring of Justice Department employees at every level , " right down to the interns . "
Congressional investigators are examining new claims that a top official in the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division based his hiring decisions on politics rather than experience , CNN reports .
Bradley J. Schlozman , who recently returned to Washington after serving as interim U.S. Attorney in Kansas City , Mo. , allegedly hired an employee based on Republican credentials , and Democrats accuse him of pursuing cases in Missouri designed to disenfranchise minority voters before the 2006 elections , according to press reports .
" We are highly disturbed by the emerging information , because it seems to repeat this pattern going on at the [ Department of Justice ] where people are chosen for their positions not for their experience and qualifications , but rather whether or not they match a certain political ideology , " said Rep. Linda Sanchez , D - Calif. , who heads the subcommittee investigating the department , according to CNN .
Olberman , and his guest , Air America Radio host Rachel Maddow , also noted that the Justice Department has a low percentage of African American attorneys in its Civil Rights Division .
" The fact that the Justice Department right now in its Civil Rights Division has two African American attorneys out of 50 on staff , which is the same number of African American attorneys they had in 1978 when I was 5  meanwhile their staff has doubled in size  shows that they 're not taking their civil rights obligation seriously , " Maddow said .
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown .
" If the United States leaves Iraq things will really get bad . "
This appears to be the last remaining , barely - breathing argument of that vanishing species who still support the god -awful war .
The argument implies a deeply - felt concern about the welfare and safety of the Iraqi people .
What else could it mean ?
That the US military can't leave because it's needed to protect the oil bonanza awaiting American oil companies as soon as the Iraqi parliament approves the new written - in - Washington oil law ?
No , the Bush administration loves the people of Iraq .
How much more destruction , killing and torturing do you need to be convinced of that ?
We can't leave because of the violence .
We can't leave until we have assured that peace returns to our dear comrades in Iraq .
To better understand this argument , it helps to keep in mind the following about the daily horror that is life in Iraq :
It did not exist before the US occupation .
The insurgency violence began as , and remains , a reaction to the occupation ; like almost all insurgencies in occupied countries -- from the American Revolution to the Vietcong -- it 's a fight directed toward getting foreign forces to leave .
The next phase was the violence of Iraqis against other Iraqis who worked for or sought employment with anything associated with the occupation regime .
Then came retaliatory attacks for these attacks .
Followed by retaliatory attacks for the retaliatory attacks .
Jihadists from many countries have flocked to Iraq because they see the war against the American Satan occupiers as a holy war .
Before the occupation , many Sunnis and Shiites married each other ; since the occupation they have been caught up in a spiral of hating and killing each other .
And for these acts there , of course , has to be retaliation .
The occupation 's abolishment of most jobs in the military and in Saddam Hussein 's government , and the chaos that is Iraqi society under the occupation , have left many destitute ; kidnapings for ransom and other acts of criminal violence have become popular ways to make a living , or at least survive .
US - trained , financed , and armed Iraqi forces have killed large numbers of people designated as " terrorists " by someone official , or perhaps someone unofficial , or by someone unknown , or by chance .
The US military itself has been a main perpetrator of violence , killing individually and en masse , killing any number , any day , for any reason , anyone , any place , often in mindless retaliation against anyone nearby for an insurgent attack .
The US military and its coalition allies have also been the main target of violent attacks .
A Department of Defense report of November 2006 stated : " Coalition forces remained the target of the majority of attacks ( 68 % ) . "
And here is James Baker , establishment eminence , co-chair of the Iraq Study Group , on CNN with Anderson Cooper : Cooper :
And is it possible that getting the U.S. troops out will actually lessen that violence , that it will at least take away the motivation of nationalist insurgents ?
Baker :
Many people have argued that to us .
Many people in Iraq made that case .
Cooper : Do you buy it ?
Baker :
Yes , I think there is some validity to it , absolutely .
Then we are no longer seen to be the occupiers .
In spite of all of the above we are told that the presence of the United States military has been and will continue to be a buffer against violence .
Iraqis themselves do not believe this .
A poll published in September found that Iraqis believe , by a margin of 78 to 21 percent , that the US military presence is " provoking more conflict that it is preventing " .
Remember that we were warned a thousand times of a communist bloodbath in Vietnam if American forces left .
The American forces left .
There was never any kind of bloodbath .
If the United States leaves -- meaning all its troops and bases -- it will remove the very foundation , origin , and inspiration of most of the hate and violence .
Iraqis will have a chance to reclaim their land and their life .
They have a right to be given that opportunity .
Let America 's deadly " love " embrace of the Iraqi people come to an end .
Let the healing begin .

Craig Atkinson ’s limited edition run of sketch books is just about sold out at Cafe Royal bookstore near Liverpool , but there are still a few of these one - of - a- kind books available .
Each book is a unique record of sketches focusing on the household , featuring TVs , Polaroid cameras , garages , games consoles amongst other things .
The paraphenalia of domesticity is lovingly rendered , yet tinged with a comical irony that subtly distorts and estranges familiar objects .
The detailing on the electrical appliances for instance , dates the items as slightly retro in our streamlined age , and due to the fine relief of graphite these details stand out vividly .
That which once made an item cutting edge now historices not only the item but our relationship with it .
As Atkinson says of the run , “ I work in each book before they ’re sold , so each is unique and contains original stuff .
The drawings were made in 2004 - 2005 .
My collection of Spanish Serviettes is featured as are my drawings of electrical and desirable goods .
I guess if the book ’s about anything it ’s about the stupid place we call home . ”
One of these special , little sketchbooks will set you back £ 10 , available here while they still have copies left .

Wild Turkey in California THE PLAN :
In 1959 a program was started to aggressively introduce wild turkey populations to California .
Officials hoped having the game birds would mean big revenue from local and out - of - state hunters .
IT WORKED … By 1969 there were enough turkeys for a regular hunting season .
By the 1980s , there were tens of thousands of them .
… TOO WELL !
In 2003 California officials began introducing programs to get rid of wild turkeys .
There were more than a quarter million of the birds living in the state , and they were wreaking havoc .
Biologists said they were invading habitats of native birds , consuming endangered species of plants and animals , damaging crops , ruining gardens , fouling backyards — and sometimes even attacking children .
Klum to Model Swimsuit for H&M THE PLAN :
In May 2003 , German advertising firm JC Decaux presented fashion chain H&M with a marketing plan for a new line of bikini swimwear .
The idea was simple : plaster the country with posters of German supermodel Heidi Klum wearing the sexy swimsuits .
IT WORKED … The Klum ads became one of the most successful advertising campaigns in the country ’s history .
H&M reported huge sales .
… TOO WELL !
More than half of the posters were immediately stolen .
Not only that , people smashed display cases to get them .
JC Decaux president Hans - Peter Bischoff said , “ We put up 750 small posters , and they were all gone within a few hours .
It ’s madness . ”
The company had to hire guards to protect the display boxes while they figured out a solution .
The solution : H&M started giving the posters away for free .
Sunscreen Ad Campaign in Australia THE PLAN : After a hole was discovered in the ozone layer above Australia in the mid-1980s , the government began aggressive ad campaigns to warn people about the risks of getting too much sun .
The ozone layer acts as a filter against the dangerous ultraviolet rays in sunlight , and the country already had the highest skin cancer rates in the world .
One of the most popular campaigns was “ Slip , Slop , Slap ” : “ Slip on a shirt , Slop on sunscreen , and Slap on a hat ! ” IT WORKED … National health associations credited the campaign with making sunscreen usage a normal part of life for many Australians , saving countless lives .
… TOO WELL !
In 2000 officials announced that nearly 25 % of Australian adults were vitamin D deficient .
How do you get vitamin D? Primarily by exposure to sunlight — the skin produces it in reaction to the sun ’s rays .
Lack of the vitamin can cause a host of health risks , including osteoporosis , and is believed to be linked to breast , colon , and prostate cancer .
Boost the Economy with Credit Cards THE PLAN :
To get its citizens to spend money , and thus boost the country ’s faltering economy , in 1999 South Korea instituted a program making it easy for anyone to obtain a credit card .
IT WORKED … The nation ’s economic growth climbed by 10 % in the first year alone .
… TOO WELL !
By 2003 the average South Korean worker had four credit cards and consumers had rung up more than $ 100 billion in debt .
There were so many unpaid credit card accounts that the nation ’s largest credit company had to stop issuing money from their ATMs and had to get an emergency loan just to stay afloat .
Credit card debt was also blamed for a rash of suicides , thefts , kidnappings , and prostitution cases .

NASA satellites reveal that Amazon forests are neither evergreen nor dependent on constant rain , and are capable of manufacturing their seasons .
Researchers report a 25 percent increase in the amount of green leaf area during the dry season when the skies are relatively clear .
They found that the rainforests are more dependent on light than rain , enduring several months of dry season by tapping water deep in the soil with their long roots .
“ Our finding is similar to the discovery of a large green continent , nearly a third the size of South America , appearing and disappearing each year , ” explained Ranga Myneni , professor of geography and environment at Boston University , the lead author of this study .
" This has very important consequences for weather , atmospheric carbon , water and nutrient cycling , given that leaves are the air purifiers and food factories of our planet , " Myneni added .
The Amazon rainforest covers an area equivalent to more than half of the continental United States and is home to more than one - third of all living species on Earth .
Scientists used satellite images to study the amount and dynamics of green leaf area of Amazon rainforests .
This study was made possible by more than five years of daily estimates of leaf area over the entire Amazon basin at one - kilometer resolution with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the NASA Terra satellite , by a team of 27 individuals from 15 different institutions .
The researchers report that the rainforests sprout new leaves in anticipation of the coming dry season .
The greener forests capture more sunlight , absorb more carbon dioxide and evaporate more water during the dry season compared to the wet season .
By gradually humidifying the atmosphere , the forests play an integral role in the onset of the wet season , scientists observed .
" This work is an important outcome of over 10 years of NASA ’s investments and teamwork to develop , build and launch state - of - the art sensors and processing algorithms enabling the discovery of hitherto unknown vegetation dynamics on Earth , added Rama Nemani , a co-author of the paper at NASA Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif .
The results of this NASA - funded research will appear in the March 20 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Story Highlights • Presidential candidates taking swings at fellow party members
• Sniping violates cardinal rule of Republican icon Ronald Reagan
• Candidates accuse one another of not being conservative enough
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
When it comes to Ronald Reagan 's 11th commandment -- " Thou shalt not speak ill of thy fellow Republicans " -- GOP presidential candidates seem to be losing their religion .
Republican candidates have been speaking a lot of ill -- sometimes quite directly .
" Governor [ Mitt ] Romney , his views ... have been moderate to liberal in [ the ]
North , in the Northeast , and it's all on videotape , " former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore said on " The Situation Room " recently .
" And now he 's trying to shift to be a conservative . "
At a Republican dinner in Iowa this month , Gilmore took on his party 's front - runners collectively , saying , " Rudy McRomney is not a conservative . "
The former Massachusetts governor 's response ?
He said his rivals -- Sen. John McCain and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- have changed their minds on issues , too .
And talk about speaking ill of a fellow Republican , President Bush is not off limits :
" We all know the war in Iraq has not gone well , " McCain said .
" We have made mistakes , and we have paid grievously for them . "
Bush is very unpopular .
Conservatives want to make the point that it's not because he 's a conservative .
Instead , they say , it 's because his administration has wandered away from conservative principles .
Republicans are supposed to be disciplined and on message .
Not this time .
It has been said that when Democrats lose an election , they form a circular firing squad .
Last year , Republicans lost .
So it 's their turn to fire on one another .
Conservatives argue Republicans lost because they veered from their conservative principles on issues like the deficit .
" I think when you listen to the crowds , listen to our presidential candidates , the spending issue is one that was certainly taken to heart by grass - roots Republicans , " said the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party , Katon Dawson .
The top -tier Republican candidates are all suspect to solid conservatives , who fear they are losing their hard - won influence in the Republican Party .
" [ We are ] very concerned as to whether or not as a conservative movement we will be , in fact , the driving political force in the ' 08 election cycle , " said another GOP presidential hopeful , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee .

German government decides to tackle the myth of the ' Mozart effect ' .
Play along : learning an instrument may do more for your brain than listening to one .
Punchstock
Passively listening to Mozart — or indeed any other music you enjoy — does not make you smarter .
But more studies should be done to find out whether music lessons could raise your child 's IQ in the long term , concludes a report analysing all the scientific literature on music and intelligence , which was published last week by the German research ministry .
The ministry commissioned the report — surprisingly the first to systematically review the literature on the purported intelligence effect of music — from a team of nine German neuroscientists , psychologists , educationalists and philosophers , all music experts .
The ministry felt it had to tackle the subject because it had been inundated with requests for funding of studies on music and intelligence , which it did n't know how to assess .
The interest in this scientific area was first sparked by the controversial 1993 Nature report1 in which psychologist Frances Rauscher and her colleagues at the University of California , Irvine , claimed that people perform better on spatial tasks — such as recognizing patterns , or folding paper — after listening to Mozart for 10 minutes .
The ' Mozart effect ' remained a marketing tool for the music industry , and some private schools , long after a torrent of additional studies started to cast doubt on the finding .
In the wild commercial flurry , which often involved over - interpretation of available data , the issues of listening to music and actively practicing music were frequently mixed up .
" We went through all of the literature to find out which questions were still open , " says lead author Ralph Schumacher , a piano - playing philosopher at the Humboldt University in Berlin .
The report pronounced Rauscher 's ' Mozart effect ' dead .
Most studies on the effect on intelligence of listening to music — a body of work collectively nicknamed ' Mozart 's Requiem ' by music scientists — were either unable to repeat the finding or found a transient effect lasting no more than 20 minutes after listening .
Even the transient effect was not specific to Mozart , but to any sort of music , or even story reading , that the test subject preferred .

The report was less dismissive of claims for an effect of music lessons on IQ development , particularly in young children .
Most published studies are small and difficult to interpret , it found , and some suggest no long - term effect at all on IQ .
" But one or two large and careful studies have shown a small but significant effect on IQ — which can be seen over years , " says Schumacher .
But even if the effect of musical training is confirmed in future studies , he concedes , it is highly unlikely to make your child a genius , " otherwise it would be seen more clearly in the current literature , " says Schumacher .
" The most interesting point will be to find out how the effect , if it exists , is achieved in the brain . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Lloyd ’s of London , the world ’s oldest insurer , offered a gloomy forecast of floods , droughts and disastrous storms over the next 50 years in a recently published report on impending climate changes .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ These things are fact , not hypothesis , ” said Wendy Baker , the president of Lloyd ’s America in an interview on Monday .
“ You do n’t have to be a believer in global warming to recognize the climate is changing .
The industry has to get ready for the changes that are coming . ”
In a report on catastrophe trends Lloyd ’s is disseminating to the insurance industry , a bevy of British climate experts , including Sir David King , chief scientist to the British government , warn of increased flooding in coastal areas and a rapid rise in sea level as ice caps melt in Greenland and Antarctica .
Northern European coastal levels could rise more than a meter ( 3 feet ) in a few decades , particularly if the Gulf Stream currents change , the report says .
Floods , which now account for about half of all deaths from natural disasters , could multiply and become more destructive , with annual flood damages in England and Wales reaching 10 times today ’s level , according to some studies .
At the same time , drought patterns that are already forming in some parts of the world are going to get worse , particularly in southern Africa .
Even the lush Amazon may dry up , and with less vegetation , more carbon dioxide will leak into the atmosphere , making the global warming problem even worse , the Lloyd ’s study says .
Baker said Lloyd ’s has formed a partnership with American International Group , the world ’s biggest insurer , Harvard University ’s Center for Health and the Global Environment and the Insurance Information Institute , a research group .
The four will hold a forum in the fall of 2007 to look at the severity and consequences of future natural catastrophes .
“ The property casualty industry had an easy year in 2006 , when there were no U.S. hurricanes , ” Baker said .
“ But the next one may make Katrina look inexpensive . ”
In August , 2005 Hurricane Katrina slammed into the U.S. Gulf Coast , costing the industry more than $ 38 billion and making it the most destructive storm in terms of property losses ever .
But hurricane modelers say a storm like Katrina hitting the Miami area of Florida or New York could cost as much as $ 100 billion .
Lloyd ’s was founded in 1688 and its 66 syndicates trade in London .
But the United States is its biggest market with nearly 40 percent of its business .
Justin Rowlatt installed a wind turbine to save energy
This means that it would take 150 years for turbines - costing £ 1,500 - to save enough money to pay for themselves .
With UK wind speeds of 5.6m /s ( 18.3 ft/s ) , many Britons would not benefit from high savings .
Chief of Windsave , David Gordon , told Panorama : " [ Between ] 4 - 6 metres , you 'd save about £ 10 a year .
" Six metres onwards and you could save up to £ 50 to £ 100 . "
' Carbon challenge '
In Panorama 's Go Green Or Else report , BBC journalist Justin Rowlatt spent a year trying to reduce his carbon footprint .
As part of a " carbon challenge " set by Professor Tim Jackson of Surrey University , to reduce his family 's impact on the environment , Rowlatt decided to try to install a wind turbine as a way of generating carbon - free electricity .
Windsave offered him one , but seven months later - and three days before it was due to be installed - the company withdrew its offer saying his house was not suitable .
After the offer was withdrawn , David Gordon explained there was not enough wind at Rowlatt 's London home .
They started turning out before daybreak in the bitter cold .
The antiwar demonstrators amassed on the north side of the Lincoln Memorial chanting demands for peace now .
The counterprotesters , fewer in number but no less vocal , gathered on the east side of the Vietnam Wall and shouted political taunts -- many laced with obscenities .
“ I got called a commie .
A lot of middle fingers are going up .
I try to respond with a peace sign , ” said Bethany Louisos , 19 , who had caravaned from the University of Massachusetts with 10 friends in three cars through a snowstorm to join Saturday ’s march at the Pentagon .
“ The last thing our troops need to see is the silliness going on here , ” Bob Chaney , 57 , said , emotion in his voice .
An ex-Marine who served in Vietnam , he had flown from Indianapolis to join the counterprotest .
On the fourth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq , as many as 20,000 people spilled into the heart of the nation ’s capital in a sometimes tense demonstration .

The most dramatic moment came when about 200 protesters , some calling themselves anarchists , tried to make their way up to the Pentagon , where security has been fortified since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
They pushed past the boundaries and were held back by police officers in gas masks and riot gear .
Many of the protesters , most college age , seemed prepared for a confrontation .
Some carried homemade plastic shields , and others wore gas masks or bandannas to protect their faces .
Cmdr .
Joe Carpenter , a Pentagon spokesman , said five protesters were arrested , cited and released .
The mile - and - a - half march from the Lincoln Memorial to the Pentagon was organized by a coalition of civil rights and peace groups called ANSWER ( Act Now to Stop War and End Racism ) .
It was patterned after a demonstration 40 years ago that marked a turning point in the anti-Vietnam War movement , with hippies stuffing flowers into rifles and protesters clashing with police .

Recent polls show that about three in five Americans believe the war was a mistake and do not support President Bush ’s push for increasing troop levels .
Saturday ’s was the second protest in Washington in six weeks .
It drew fewer than the 100,000 who turned out in late January and lacked that rally ’s celebrity speakers .
This one was notable for its angrier tone as protesters and counterprotesters faced off around noon amid an odd mix of chants for peace and shouts of profanity .
One man held a sign that read : “ Peace Sucks . ”
The antiwar demonstrators started across the landmark Memorial Bridge toward Arlington National Cemetery and the Pentagon .
They were greeted at the far end with a homemade banner that said : “ Go to hell traitors . ”

Many of the participants were students and working people who traveled long distances to make their views known .
Some counterprotesters were concerned by rumors of plans to deface the Vietnam Veterans Memorial with spray paint and urine - filled balloons .
Sgt. Robert Lachance of the U.S. Park Police said no memorials were defaced .
His department made no arrests .
Angie Frederick , 43 , drove from Angola , Ind. , with her husband and her son ’s fiancee in their 9 - year - old Dodge .
Her two sons are soldiers ; one ’s just back from Iraq , and the other is still there .

“ There was a lot of cussing , ” she said , acknowledging somewhat sheepishly that she had joined in a little , then adding , “ But we also sang the national anthem . ”
Lisa Olson , 37 , a researcher at Columbia University in New York , shared a bus ride with some college students .
She had never participated in a peace march before .
“ I always feel a little silly about these sorts of things , but it seems it really is a way to show we need a different course . ”
Maggie Johnson , a 35 - year - old homemaker , drove from Detroit with her husband in their hybrid Toyota Prius .
“ It ’s worth it .
We ’ve been in Iraq longer than we were in World War II and we ’ve accomplished a heck of a lot less .
It ’s time we wrap it up , ” she said .

The airfare from Seattle to Washington was a birthday present from Anne Mosness , 62 , to her daughter Jacklyn Wardlow , 41 .
They wore Code Pink : Women for Peace buttons .
Tim Hill , an ex-Marine sergeant who did two tours in Iraq , called through a megaphone : “ Your march is based on lies , and all of you are terrorists . ”
Other former Marines spent a frigid night guarding the Vietnam wall .
But other veterans , equally passionate , lined up on the other side .
Larry Yepez , 58 , took the train from Stockton , Calif. , to meet Jack Fitzgerald , 58 , who came in from Pittston , Maine .
They were part of the 2nd Battalion , 9th Marines in Vietnam .
The last time they saw each other was 40 years ago , when Yepez was wounded and Fitzgerald , a medic , helped save him .

They made contact recently through a squad leader and decided the peace march was as good a place as any for a reunion .
After the crowd had moved on , they stood in the icy wind on Memorial Bridge , each with an arm slung around the other ’s shoulder .
The back of Yepez ’s jacket was embroidered with the phrase “ Support Our Troops -- Bring Them Home . ”
A loose sign , imploring “ Support Our President , ” tumbled past .

Why would anyone use Internet Explorer ?
Do n’t worry , this is not a post about Internet Explorer ’s support ( or lack thereof ) of code support , but instead solely focused on the end user experience .
I regularly try out a number of web browser , and I have one question :
Why would anyone use Internet Explorer ?
The UI
I ’m only talking about their latest version , IE 7 here , and the way I see it , it does n’t offer anything particular that no - on else does .
There have been lots of discussions about the UI and if it ’s actually user - friendly , and I wo n’t go into to the entire thing but to say that it just seems stupid to hide away the File , Edit etc menu ( although it magically appears when you press Alt ) .
Most inexperienced web browsers users use IE , so to hide something as fundamental as that , and give them an inconsistent experience from ( basically ) all other programs , does n’t seem to be the smartest way to go .
Compare it to their biggest competitors on Windows : Firefox and Opera .
Both of them have everything clear and visible , and , more importantly , consistent .
Browsing experience
Surf around a while with IE , and then switch to Firefox or Opera and feel the difference .
To me , IE feels flimsy and shaky , and it has a nasty flicker when scrolling on a web page with a lot of pictures .
Overall , IE seems slower , but naturally , some serious tests have to be made to verify this .
Another thing that thoroughly annoys me is that opening a new tab takes over a second (! ) for me in IE as opposed to milliseconds in the other two .
They have implemented a zooming feature ( although Opera ’s zooming is way better implemented ) , but the result of this is that is almost impossible to find how to resize just the text , if desired .
Security
Yeah , well , I guess this is a given point with IE .
IE has a history of being extremely insecure , and as long as they persist on having such a close tie - in between Windows and the web browser itself , it is without a doubt more prone to security risks than their competitors .
Extensibility
Firefox has a dominating lead in this field with a myriad of amazing Firefox add - ons , and I think this is one of the reasons it has become so popular .
IE 7 is trying their best with Internet Explorer add - ons and Opera has their Plug-ins , but no one is even close to Firefox in this field .
Sidetracking with a little personal rant …
As a little sidetrack ( please forgive me for this ) , but with my post about semantic URLs the other day close in mind , compare the URLs for IE ’s add - ons to the Firefox and Opera equivalents :
Let ’s just say that different companies has various understandings about how the web should work … 😐
Mouse control
Something that a lot of people love about Opera is the ability to control web browsing through Opera mouse gestures .
There ’s a Firefox Mouse Gestures add - on to accomplish the same , and also Mouse Gestures for Internet Explorer .
I rather prefer using the keyboard as much as the possible , but some are mouse addicted .
If you are , check out the three above to find what suits you best .
Conclusion
I ’m open - minded , and want you to use the web browser that suits your need the best .
However , I think that most people using IE do n’t know about the alternatives plainly just do n’t want to .
From my experience , people use IE for one or several of these reasons :
They do n’t know about the alternatives ( without a doubt , the number one reason ) .
It ’s pre-installed on their computer , so they just start it and go ( definitely related to the reason above ) .
Some very poorly developed web sites , like certain bank sites and others , only supports one web browser on one platform .
Really capturing the essence and the spirit of the web …
Not .
It ’s , for reasons beyond me , a company policy from narrow - minded System Administrators to narrow them down to one web browser .
They like everything from Microsoft , and would use it no matter the quality .
They tried something based in the open - source community in 1995 , did n’t like it , and will never give it a whirl again .
Any reason I ’ve missed ?
Is Internet Explorer your primary web browser and you like it ?
Please tell my why , I wo n’t criticise you , but is genuinely interested in why you like it .

An Inside View From a Google Employee
James in the forum points to a very in - depth Something Awful discussion board interview with what seems to be the guy who took over the Google Calculator project as his current 20 % project ( I ca n’t confirm that he ’s indeed a Google employee , though his answers look credible ) .
His nickame is “ ZorbaTHut ” and he ’s been programming for 17 years .
Here are some interesting bits from the multi-page interview :
ZorbaTHut says that Google is mostly C++ , Java , and Python ( or so he ’s been told ) .
( or so he ’s been told ) .
“ We ’ve got extensive automated unit tests , all of which ( obviously ) must pass . ”
, all of which ( obviously ) must pass . ”
On the question of “ Is google concerned about a lot of the fraud that goes on with Adsense ? ” , he answers :
“ Like you would n’t believe .
....
The problem with [ click - fraud ] is just that it ’s a very , very hard issue to fix . “
“ Like you would n’t believe . .... “ On getting hired by Google :
“ The Google application process is annoyingly slow and can easily take months sometimes .
Anyone who ’s really interested in working there would be much better off finding an employee to refer them ”
Zorba adds that you ’ll get interviewed not based on your diploma , but your skills .

Zorba adds that you ’ll get interviewed not based on your diploma , but your skills .
“ Nobody keeps track of 20 % time with any care whatsoever .
It ’s assumed that , if a deadline is pressing on your main project , you ’ll work on that .
If your main project constantly has looming deadlines , it ’s time to talk to your manager or your tech lead and tell them that they ’re pushing too hard . ”
Zorba adds that management understands that a programmer ca n’t be pushed over limits for more than a week at a time .
And : “ At Google , the managers and tech leads assume that programmers can manage their own time .
If a programmer ca n’t manage their own time they ’re probably not a good fit at Google anyway . ”

Zorba says that as a Google employee , his Gmail account has a one - terabyte limit ( or rather , non-limit ) .
( or rather , non- limit ) .
Zorba talks about his “ awkward ” sleep schedule ( awkward to non-programmers , anyway ) , but says , “ Google lets me do this .
It ’s occasionally a bit irritating for everyone involved , like when they really want me to be in the office and I ’m not .
But when I can finish an entire new server in under a week , people appreciate that . ”
After being asked what it takes to get fired at Google , Zorba replies that abusing logins is a fireable offense , saying , “ I do n’t know if anyone ’s actually done this , but they drive it in pretty hard if you try getting anywhere near the log system .
I was told a story about an IT guy who decided to give his wife a full VPN login to the Google network .
I should point out that his wife was a Yahoo employee .
That did not go over well . ”

On the up and downsides of giving unreleased Google products a testdrive , he replies :
“ I was using an early version of Google Maps a week or two before it was launched . ”
Zorba says it was depressing to be able to use Google Maps , but not be able to print out routes to take them along as that might breach confidentiality .
“ Zorba says it was depressing to be able to use Google Maps , but not be able to print out routes to take them along as that might breach confidentiality .
ZorbaTHut tells us he was assigned on Google Desktop first but did n’t like that much , so he was allowed to switch to working on Google Video .
“ I actually worked on some neat stuff on Google Video , all of which got cancelled before release .
I unfortunately ca n’t tell you what it was . ”
On asked about the possibility of having time zone conversions like “ 3:00 GMT to PST ” included on Google , Zorba says , “ I ’ll try to think of a way to pull it off easily , but no guarantees . ”
like “ 3:00 GMT to PST ” included on Google , Zorba says , “ I ’ll try to think of a way to pull it off easily , but no guarantees . ”
Zorba argues that Googlers with relatively technical but not engineering jobs , like HR , finance , or marketing do n’t get less respect .
“ Everyone at Google gets respect .
They do get , sometimes , a little less influence – if engineers need something special from the IT teams , it tends to get done .
Even if it ’s a bother . ”
Zorba writes that he has only about one meeting per month .
.
“ The company ’s structure , at least for engineers , is amazingly flat . ”
Zorba says the Google hierarchy is just five levels : Programmer - Tech lead - Manager - Department lead - Larry / Sergey / Eric .
Google just assumes their workers are competent , Zorba adds .

“ Google is very , very heavily liberal , and the liberal crowd tends to be heavily anti-smoking ”
“ [ T ] he vast majority of computers at Google are Linux boxes .
They give us a laptop also , and we get to choose between a Mac Powerbook and an IBM Thinkpad .
...
Overall there ’s a strong undercurrent of ’ give the coders the tools they want and get the hell out of the way ’ . ”
( You get the feeling someone at Google understands what makes a programmer effective ... )
On what kind of info Google employees are allowed to share :
“ If we have n’t announced it publicly , and it ’s a project or a coming feature or anything more financially interesting than ’ what color are your carpets ’ , do n’t talk about it .
End of story . ”

“ [ M] ost people are Linux - only ”
Zorba says that in his opinion , C++ is the best single programming language out there .
He says however that it also does n’t protect you from shooting yourself in the foot .

Zorba says , “ The thing about Google – and any large company focused on skilled employees – is that everyone there knows that people will spend time off - work thinking about work .
It ’s inevitable .
You ’re lying in bed and your brain wanders onto a problem you ’re having at work and in half an hour you ’ve solved it .
If you ’re spending time away from work doing work stuff , why would people object to the converse ?
We ’re all adults here – we do n’t have to , or want to , be micromanaged to death . ”

On how Google goes about staffing a Test Engineer position , Zorba replies : “ I do n’t know what other teams are like , but on my team everyone owns their own tests and handles their own quality . ”
and handles their own quality . ”
Zorba argues you can divide internet traffic into five approximate and unequal segments : porn , spam , corporate , knowledge , and personal .
Correction : Zarbo told me that this five - categories thing was just used to describe something else , and not a “ theory ” of his , or relevant to a point he was making about search .
He says that a lot of interviewers are handing out extremely hard questions , and follow - up questions .
“ The worst thing you can do when confronted with a hard question is to say ’ Oh , that ’s impossible ! ’ and then sit there grinning like an idiot .
The second worst thing you can do is say ’ I do n’t know how ! ’ and then sit there grinning like an idiot . ”
Zorba explains that Google is “ pretty obsessive ” about not telling people the reasons why they did n’t get the job , arguing that this might be for lawsuit reasons .

Zorba : “ [ W ]e have one monolithic source control system across the entire company .
This lets us link in handy libraries from other projects , and is honestly one of the coolest things about working here – if there ’s something common you want , chances are good it ’s already been written . ”

Oliver Jufer has lived in Thailand for more than a decade
Oliver Jufer , 57 , was arrested last December after drunkenly spray - painting posters of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in the northern city of Chiang Mai .
Earlier this month he pleaded guilty to five charges under Thailand 's draconian lese majeste law .
Judge Phitsanu Tanbukalee said that Jufer received a reduced sentence because he had admitted his guilt .
" This is a serious crime , and he was sentenced to four years for each of five counts , for a total of 20 years , " he said .
" Because he confessed , the court has reduced his sentence to 10 years . "
Jufer is believed to be the first foreigner ever imprisoned for the offence .
Others have been charged in the past , but later expelled from the country rather than jailed .
Sensitive issue
Jufer , who had faced a maximum sentence of 75 years , has lived in Thailand for more than 10 years .
KING BHUMIBOL ADULYADEJ
Born in 1927 , ascended throne in 1946 World 's longest - serving current head of state Official powers are limited , but wields enormous influence because of popular backing Widely believed to have given backing to 2006 military coup
Sensitive regimes
He was recorded on surveillance cameras defacing the portraits on the king 's 79th birthday .
Earlier he had tried to buy alcohol but been refused , since such sales are sometimes banned on important days .
King Bhumibol , the world 's longest - serving current head of state , is a very popular figure in Thailand .
The case has highlighted strict laws in Thailand which forbid any criticism of the monarchy .
Such is the sensitivity of the issue , says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok , that it is receiving little attention in the Thai media .
Most
Thais feel a deep reverence for their monarch .
But they also fear discussing the institution because of the severe penalties for criticising members of the royal family .
Jufer has a month to lodge an appeal against the sentence , our correspondent adds , but his best hope now is probably a royal pardon .
It sounds like something that would happen in San Francisco .
In 2005 , a few friends gathered for dinner and started bemoaning the fate of the planet , the environmental impact of consumer excess — and ended up challenging one another to not buy anything new for six months .
By mid-2006 , the rapidly growing group was featured on the “ Today ” show , and people were calling it a movement .
“ We think of it as more of a phenomenon than a movement , ” said John Perry , a co-founder of the group , now known as the Compact .
“ We ’re grateful for our 17 minutes of fame , ” he added , “ but we did n’t intend this to be broadcast .
We did n’t mean to attract followers . ”
Yet for such a simple and not terribly sexy idea — to buy nothing new , other than food and other absolute essentials — the Compact has managed to build a groundswell of supporters .
The group has more than doubled since the fall , to nearly 8,000 members from 3,000 .
It has even found a footing in Europe and Australia .
Alan Kay 's title slide , up during the intro says
Is the Best Way to Predict the Future to { Invent , Prevent} It ? with the { Invent , Prevent} alternating between each other .
He jokes that this afternoon 's talk can be summed up by the fact that he has to wear two microphones to speak instead of one .
The talk was billed as " Software Engineering vs. Computer Science , so I 'm anxious to see how his title relates to that .
I have some more photos too .
Much of what is wrong about our field is that many of the ideas that happened before 1975 are still the current paradigm .
He has a strong feeling that our field has been mired for some time , but because of Moore 's law , there are plenty of things to work on .
The commercialization of personal computing was a tremendous distraction to our field and we have n't , and may not , recover from it .
Almost nothing exciting about computing today has to do with data structures and algorithms One of Alan 's undergraduate degrees is in molecular biology .
He can't understand it anymore despite having tried to review new developments every few years .
That 's not true in computer science .
The basics are still mostly the same .
If you go to most campuses , there is a single computer science department and the first course in computer science is almost indistinguishable from the first course in 1960 .
They 're about data structures and algorithms despite the fact that almost nothing exciting about computing today has to do with data structures and algorithms .
The Internet is like the human body .
It 's replaced all of its atoms and bits at least twice since it started even though the Internet has never stopped working .
Attacks on the ' Net are n't really attacks on the ' Net , they 're attacks on machines on the ' Net .
Very few software systems , maybe none , are built in ways that sustain operation in spite of being continually rebuilt and continually growing .
The future five years out is easy to predict because all of the forces acting on computer science are trying to keep it the same as it is now .
Likely , the future will be more of what we have now .
Are computer science , software engineering , OOP , etc. oxymorons ?
Alan reminisce about Bob Barton , an early Utah professor .
Bob said that " systems programmers are the high priests of a low cult " and " there are few things know about systems design , but the basic principle of recursive design is : make the parts of the same power as the whole .
Bob Barton has a classic paper that contains seven of the most important things that people know about software today .
Another quote : " My job is to disabuse you of any firmly held notion you held when you came into this classroom . "
The best way to get people to think is to destroy their current thinking .
Preconceived notions are largely reactions to what vendors are saying .
Alan says that his course from Barton was the most valuable one he took in college because Barton garbage collected their minds .
A diamond will break if you hit it with a hammer !
A diamond is the hardest natural substance on earth , but if it is placed in an oven and the temperature is raised to about 763 degrees Celsius ( 1405 degrees Fahrenheit ) , it will simply vanish , without even ash remaining .
Only a little carbon dioxide will have been released .
Diamonds are formed over a period of a billion or more years deep within earth ’s crust – about 150 km ( 90 miles ) deep – and is pushed to the surface by volcanoes .
Most diamonds are found in volcanic rock , called Kimberlite , or in the sea after having been carried away by rivers when they were pushed to the surface .
A diamond is 58 times harder than the next hardest mineral on earth , corundum , from which rubies and sapphires are formed .
It was only during the 15th century that it was discovered that the only way to cut diamonds was with other diamonds .
Yet , diamonds are brittle .
If you hit one hard with a hammer , it will shatter .
The largest diamond
The world ’s largest diamond was the Cullinan , found in South Africa in 1905 .
It weighed 3,106.75 carats uncut .
It was cut into the Great Star of Africa , weighing 530.2 carats , the Lesser Star of Africa , which weighs 317.40 carats , and 104 other diamonds of nearly flawless colour and clarity .
They now form part of the British crown jewels .
The Cullinan was three times the size of the next largest diamond , the Excelsior , which was also found in South Africa .
The world ’s largest documented polished diamond – unearthed in 1986 , also in South Africa – is called Unnamed Brown .
It weighs 545 carats and was cut down from a 700 carat rough diamond .
It took an international team of expert cutters 3 years to complete the masterpiece .
Another impressive diamond that also took 3 years to cut , and also is part of the British crown jewels , is the Centenary Diamond .
It weighs 273.85 carats and is the world ’s largest flawless diamond .
Not all diamonds are white .
Impurities lend diamonds a shade of blue , red , orange , yellow , green and even black .
A green diamond is the rarest .
It is not the rarest gemstone , however .
That title goes to a pure red ruby .
Diamonds actually are found in fair abundance ; thousands are mined every year .
80 % of them are not suitable for jewellery – they are used in industry .
Only diamonds of higher clarity are sourced to the jewellery stores .
Synthetic diamonds
Late in the 19th century , Scottish scientist James Ballantyne mixed lithium with bone oil and paraffin , sealed it in iron tubes and heated it to red hot .
He claimed the resultant stones were diamonds .
They were stored away and only many years later they were found to be diamonds , although synthetic .
Weighing diamonds
A diamond carat differs from a gold carat .
The gold carat indicates purity – pure gold being 24 carats .
One diamond carat is 200 milligrams ( 0.007055 oz ) .
The word carat derives from the carob bean .
Gem dealers used to balance their scales with carob beans because these beans all have same weight .
The colourless Cullinan , the biggest diamond ever found , weighed 0,62kg ( one and a quarter pound ) uncut .
The Greek word adamas is the base word for diamond .
It means “ unconquerable . ”
Diamond is the birthstone for April and the anniversary gem for the 10th and 60th years of marriage .
The tradition of a diamond engagement ring started in 1477 when Archduke Maximillian of Austria gave a diamond ring to Mary of Burgundy .
The modern tradition is the result of a clever advertising campaign designed by N.W. Ayer in the 1940s .
The fact is that diamonds have little resale or investment value .
A QUICK NOTE :
This was supposed to be a single treatise on the coding and design principles that * I * think are most important for writing maintainable code .
A draft of this has been on my hard drive for a long , long time and it 's turning into my own great white whale .
Just to get it out , I 'm breaking it into pieces that will follow shortly , depending on ongoing bouts with writer 's block .
I 'm going to intermix quick discussions of these design concepts with some case studies of systems I 've built or worked with that illustrate both the positive outcome of following the principles and the pain incurred by failing to apply the principles .
Some day , I 'll gather the pieces back up into a single coherent article .
Enable Change or Else !
Change is a constant in an enterprise software system .
A system that is expensive or risky to change is an opportunity cost to your business .
Especially if you 're a small company , poor code quality in your flagship product will jeopardize your company 's future .
A couple of months ago I talked about my vision for creating a Maintainable Software Ecosystem in which I claimed that the single most important quality for an enterprise software system is maintainability , i.e. the ease in which a system can be modified or extended .
I spent a lot of screen space talking about topics like source control , test automation , and build automation .
There 's a lot of supporting practices that can greatly aid in shipping working code , but I purposely put off the single most important factor — the Code !
Maintainability will not happen without a commitment to quality code , now , and throughout the lifecycle of a system .
I can always throw code quality to the wind and code faster now , but that slop will catch up to me or the next team in the future , and the future has a funny way of happening sooner than we expect .
Besides , I 've been the " next " team , and it was n't pretty .
I spent much of the past two years at my previous job extending , restructuring , or flat out re-writing legacy code .
I frequently saw my team 's efforts hindered because of existing code that was poorly factored or just flat out hard to understand .
We were consistently faster when we were working with the newer code that we wrote and designed inside of an Agile process than we were working with the older legacy code .
Some of the disparity in productivity between new and legacy code was our familiarity with the newer code and the better build and test infrastructure of the newer code , but I 'd still place much of the blame on the structural flaws of the legacy code .
Ironically , and certainly not for the first time , I thought some of the biggest impediments to extending our system were directly attributable to well meaning attempts at creating extensibility in the existing code .
Extensibility yes , but how ?
One solution for system maintainability is to build in " extensibility " points or use metadata - driven design approaches .
It 's great if the extensibility points match up well with the actual direction of the later change , but the wrong extensibility points can cause a lot of harm by making a design harder to understand or awkward to extend .
David Hayden recently posted some frustrations with this style of design .
If it 's true that most code spends much more time being maintained ( changed ) than the initial write , then it certainly behooves us to create code that can be changed .
Extensibility points can certainly help , but the wrong extensibility points can also do plenty of harm , so they 're not the whole answer .
In My Programming Manifesto , I expressed a strong preference for creating maintainable code throughout the codebase rather than concentrating on specific extensibility points for future needs .
I 've always thought that the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work is largely true because the percentages say that you simply will not be able to anticipate a great deal of the future change with consistency .
Overall , odds are that the best chance for successful maintainability is in creating " malleable " code that can be easily and safely changed in unforeseen ways .
Instead of focusing on future proofing code in a few " strategic " spots , concentrate on making your code easy to change as a simple matter of course .
Coder to Craftsman
When people first learn how to write code they necessarily focus on just making the code work , with little or no thought for style or structure , and certainly no thought for the future .
Any particular piece of code tends to land wherever the coder happened to be working when they realized that they needed that piece of code — or wherever the RAD wizards felt like dropping the code .
I think there is an inflection point where a coder mindlessly spewing out code transforms into a thoughtful software craftsman capable of creating maintainable code .
That inflection point happens the day a coder first stops , lifts his / her nose out of the coding window , and says to him / herself " where should this code go ? "
That might also lead to questions like " how can I do this with less code ? " or " how can I write this to make it easier to understand ? " or even " how can I solve one problem at a time ? "
The rest of a developer 's career is spent pursuing better and better answers to the question " where should this code go ? "
My first " enterprise - y " system was an ASP Classic web application on top of Access to track project auditing for my engineering team .
If you opened up any of the early ASP scripts from that application you 'd see SQL statement construction mixed with post form handling , data access and HTML creation all intermixed .
Business logic happening willy - nilly at various points in the ASP page whenever I was coding away and realized I needed some logic .
A lot of functionality was duplicated because each ASP page was self - contained , causing more effort to write and then change the application .
The pages themselves became difficult to understand because all the code was dumped into one bucket with no rhyme or reason .
Troubleshooting business logic meant sifting through a lot of unrelated http handling code .
Finding data access problems meant reading through quite a bit of the html templating along the way .
The code stunk and I knew it , even as a coding newbie working solo .
There had to be better ways to build the application .
I improved things just by creating a set of common utility subroutines that could be used to reduce the amount of duplicated code .
It was n't much , but it was a start .
The Maintainable Code Checklist
So exactly how do I know " where this code should go " for maintainability ?
To guide your coding and design for maintainability , I 've come up with a checklist of the half dozen questions in the table below that I think should be answered in the positive .
There are three major themes running through the checklist — intention revealing code , getting rapid feedback from the code , and being able to do one thing at a time .
Assuming that maintainability is important to you , it 's also time to talk about the design principles that provide guidance to answering this Maintainable Code Checklist .
In the table below I 've tried to tie the maintainability questions to some of the design principles that will guide the thoughtful developer to answers .
This certainly is n't a comprehensive list , but it 's a start .
Question
Yes comes from …
Can I find the code related to the problem or the requested change ?
Good Naming , High Cohesion , Single Responsibility Principle , Separation of Concerns Can I understand the code ?
Good Naming , Composed Method , The Principle of Least Surprise , Can You See The Flow of the Code ? , Encapsulation
Is it easy to change the code ?
Do n't Repeat Yourself , Wormhole Anti-Pattern , Open Closed Principle Can I quickly verify my changes in isolation ?
Loose Coupling , High Cohesion , Testability Can I make the change with a low risk of breaking existing features ?
Loose Coupling , High Cohesion , Open Closed Principle , Testability Will I know if and why something is broken ?
Fail Fast
You can't help but notice that many of the principles are closely related .
I think you could say that many of the principles are simply looking at the exact same problems from a different angle .
Because of this , I 'm going to first do a survey of the principles , then I 'll try to illustrate the principles in code with some real life examples from my career .
It All Starts with Separation of Concerns
Separation of Concerns is the Alpha and Omega of design principles .
No other design principle that I 'm going to discuss — be it loose coupling , high cohesion , encapsulation , minimal duplication , or orthogonality — is possible without Separation of Concerns .
Simply put , strive to do one thing at a time in your code .
Layering .
Divide and conquer .
A lot of the other principles are about enabling a system to change with minimal effort and risk .
Before you can even think about that , you need to be able to build the system , and then understand that code .
The human mind and eye can only handle so much complexity at any one time .
At a minimum , separating the traditional concerns of user interface , business logic , and data access into " layers " of the application can help minimize the complexity of any single piece of the code .
The system is still as complex as it has to be , but you stand a much better chance of understanding the business rules or data access mapping in isolation than you could if it was all mixed together .
Back to my original ASP application .
Like almost all ASP code circa 1998 there was no separation of concerns .
Business logic , user interface presentation , and data access details were hopelessly intermingled in a single code file .
It was difficult to " see " the business logic flow because it was obscured by all the intermingled html markup and ADO database manipulation .
My first exposure to separation of concerns was the 3 - or n-tier architectures for Windows DNA applications on Wrox 's old ASPToday website ( forget about the physical deployment options and let 's just talk about logical layering here ) .
At a bare minimum , layered systems should be easier to understand because you can look at presentation logic or business logic in isolation .
A couple of months ago at my previous job we were discussing the technical tasks necessary to localize the application with foreign language support .
The company has essentially run out of growth room in the United States and was looking at the European market with great hope .
Localizing the application , and supporting Unicode encoding for that matter , was a major opportunity for the company .
One of the developers was repeating the typical opinion that localization is easy to do upfront and always much more difficult to retrofit .
Sure , but in this particular case the flagship product was going to be extremely tedious to localize because they were building strings to display on the screen very deep within big stored procedures as well as the C# middle tier code .
For that matter , code that created HTML text with string concatenation was intermixed with business logic .
In that particular case , localization after the fact could have been made much less costly simply by a better separation of concerns .
Instead of mucking around with every single area of the code , a good separation of concerns would have enabled us to focus strictly on the presentation layers to make the localization changes .
When you say layering , we probably come up with a knee jerk list :
User interface , presentation , controller logic
Business logic , rules , domain model
Database and data persistence
Service layer
Logging / auditing
Security
That 's an awfully good start , but I think the layering metaphor of higher layers talking to lower layers might not fit perfectly anymore .
" Concern " or " Layer " might be interpreted too coarsely .
Even within a single traditional " layer , " you may have finer grained areas of concern that should be separated as well .
I 'll discuss this more in the section about the Single Responsibility Principle .
Orthogonality
Orthogonality is more a goal than a principle .
In geometry , two or more axis of movement are said to be orthogonal if a change in position on one axis does not effect the position in the other axis .
If I walk north for a mile I 've changed my latitude , but not my east - west longitude .
The Pragmatic Programmers applied the term Orthogonality to software as :
The basic idea of orthogonality is that things that are not related conceptually should not be related in the system .
Parts of the architecture that really have nothing to do with the other , such as the database and the UI , should not need to be changed together .
A change to one should not cause a change to the other .
Unfortunately , we 've seen systems throughout our careers where that 's not the case .
In essence , Orthogonality in software design is the ability to change one thing at a time .
An orthogonal codebase allows different concerns to be changed independently .
Another way to think about Orthogonality is that it's the ability to work in isolation with only one aspect of a system at a time .
A classic , positive example is the invention of Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) in the late 90's .
When I first learned how to create html websites ( in Frontpage 97 ! ) , I embedded all of the style properties directly into the html .
Mixing the content and the structure of the content with the formatting of the content often made large scale websites hard to maintain .
Moving presentation rules into a CSS stylesheet greatly simplified the creation of the html content , while also allowing the style of the web page to be more readily changed than before .
CSS started to make the formatting and content of an html page orthogonal .
In a negative example , I inherited a codebase had very poor orthogonality between the user interface and the business logic .
In this case we had a significantly complex piece of code that worked through business logic to build an html response inside code .
One of the significant problems with this code was that the business logic could only be tested and verified through an examination of the resulting html .
Everytime we had to change the user interface , we broke all of the automated tests that were intended to test the business logic .
We were n't able to change business logic easily because we had html concatenation cluttering up the business logic .
The very first mistake was a failure to separate the business logic and user interface concerns ( < sarcasm > another tip , when you 're rewriting a bad existing system , you might not want to reproduce the existing bad design in the new programming language < / sarcasm > ) .
So how do you make Orthogonality happen ?
Tune in next time — assuming that I can break through my case of writer 's block .
The footage , obtained by the Associated Press , also shows Mr Bush being told of the risk to evacuees in the Superdome .
Speaking by video link from his Texan holiday ranch on 28 August , Mr Bush tells federal disaster officials : " We are fully prepared to help . "
Critics say more could have been done sooner to evacuate the city .
Mr Bush does not ask any questions as the situation is outlined to him .
I do n't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees
George W Bush , speaking after the disaster
The BBC's Justin Webb reporting from Washington said the footage did the president no favours .
It shows plainly worried officials telling Mr Bush very clearly before the storm hit that it could breach New Orleans ' flood barriers .
In the past , the president has said nobody anticipated a breach but the video shows Michael Brown , the top emergency response official who has since resigned , saying the storm would be " a bad one , a big one " .
" We 're going to need everything that we can possibly muster , not only in this state and in the region , but the nation , to respond to this event , " Mr Brown says .
Earlier the Associated Press said Mr Bush had been warned of the levees being breached in the video .
But subsequently it issued a clarification which said that the president was warned about water overrunning the levees rather than breaking them .
The Army Corps of Engineers considers a breach a hole developing in a levee rather than an overrun .
' Very , very grave '
Another official , Max Mayfield of the National Hurricane Center , tells the final briefing that storm models predict minimal flooding inside New Orleans during the hurricane .
It surprises me that if there was that kind of awareness , why was the response so slow ?
New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin
His concern was borne out by events when levees collapsed , letting in the floodwater disastrously .
New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin , shown the footage for the first time at a press conference , told Reuters he was " shocked " by what it revealed .
" It surprises me that if there was that kind of awareness , why was the response so slow ? " he asked .
But Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke said most transcripts of discussions had already been made available to congressional investigators examining the response to Katrina .
" There 's nothing new or insightful on these tapes , " he said .
Mr Bush has accepted he shared some of the responsibility for the flawed response to Katrina and the White House has talked of the " fog of war " rendering decision - making difficult .
Michael Brown told AP this week that he did not " buy the ' fog of war ' defence " .
" It was a fog of bureaucracy , " he said .
Have n’t we heard this argument before , at least in the context of television violence ?
Does exposure to violence breed violence ?
Many people would suggest a connection , but here ’s a twist : a study that considered the effect of exposure to violent scripture .
In the March 8 , 2007 edition of Nature ( this article is available online only to subscribers ) , researchers asked 500 students to read a violent Bible passage .
The story concerned a mob from an Israeli tribe that captured , raped and murdered a concubine .
Half of the participants were allowed to read the conclusion to the story ( based on a real passage from the Old Testament ) : members of other Israeli tribes leveled several cities of the Israeli tribe ( whose members killed the concubine ) , after they were asked to engage in this violence by God himself .
About half of the students came from a religious university in the United States , while the other half came from University of Amsterdam .
Only 27 % of the latter group believed in the Bible .
After reading the passages , the students participated in a lab exercise designed to measure aggression .
The results ?
For both groups - whether the students were based in the Netherlands or the United States , and believed in God or not - the trend was the same : those who were told that God had sanctioned the violence . . . were more likely to act aggressively in the subsequent exercise .
The authors of the article ( to be published in Psychological Science ) commented that the origin of religious violence has been a taboo subject until recently , though recent world events “ has pushed negative uses of religion to the forefront . ”
The study does not show that religious people are more aggressive than nonreligious people .
Researchers conclude , however , that “ people respond more aggressively to a depiction of violence that they feel is justified . ”
Sociologist Mark Muergensmeyer of the University of California , Santa Barbara , says his research has also pointed to the motivational power of scriptural violence , but that the context of the message is key .
“ If violence is presented as the authoritative voice of God , it can increase the possibility of more violence . . . but everything depends on how it is presented . ”
The same passage placed in a nonthreatening historical context might not promote aggression , he argues .
“ When scriptural violence is used to promote hostility , it is extremely effective . ”
In the Nature article , Sociologist John Hall comments that people often choose to ignore the violent side to religion , and dismiss those who commit religiously inspired violence as members of the fringe .
“ When we see religious movements that are prophetically inspired and engaged in violence , there ’s a cultural tendency to say ‘ oh , they ’re not really religious . ' ”

Investigations led by a Republican lawyer named Stuart W. Bowen Jr. in Iraq sent American occupation officials to jail on bribery and conspiracy charges , exposed disastrously poor construction work by well - connected companies like Halliburton and Parsons , and discovered that the military did not properly track hundreds of thousands of weapons it shipped to Iraqi security forces .
And tucked away in a huge military authorization bill that President Bush signed two weeks ago is what some of Mr. Bowen ’s supporters believe is his reward for repeatedly embarrassing the administration : a pink slip .
The order comes in the form of an obscure provision that terminates his federal oversight agency , the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , on Oct. 1 , 2007 .
The clause was inserted by the Republican side of the House Armed Services Committee over the objections of Democratic counterparts during a closed - door conference , and it has generated surprise and some outrage among lawmakers who say they had no idea it was in the final legislation .
Susan Collins , a Maine Republican who followed the bill closely as chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs , says that she still does not know how the provision made its way into what is called the conference report , which reconciles differences between House and Senate versions of a bill .
Neither the House nor the Senate version contained such a termination clause before the conference , all involved agree .
“ It ’s truly a mystery to me , ” Ms. Collins said .
“ I looked at what I thought was the final version of the conference report and that provision was not in at that time . ”
“ The one thing I can confirm is that this was a last - minute insertion , ” she said .
“ It appears to me that the administration wants to silence the messenger that is giving us information about waste and fraud in Iraq , ” said Representative Henry A. Waxman , a California Democrat who is the ranking minority member of the House Committee on Government Reform .
“ I just ca n’t see how one can look at this change without believing it ’s political , ” he said .
UPDATE
Matt Taibbi's superb cover article in this month 's Rolling Stone is entitled " The Worst Congress Ever , " and it details the corruption , sleaze , bloated hubris , and undemocratic power structure which drives every crevice of that tragically worthless institution .
The article is so well - documented and the abuses it chronicles are so severe that it will astonish even the most cynical and hardened critic of corrupt one - party Republican rule .
As Taibbi documents , even the most significant bills are voted on with no debate or even time to read the bills .
Worse , after the bills are approved by both houses , even their most central provisions are drastically changed and agreed to in secret " conference " by a small handful of Republican Congressional leaders , with no input from anyone other than their favored industry lobbyists .
They go out of their way to avoid any oversight of any kind of the activities of the executive branch , and most of the time , they literally have no idea what they 're voting on .
It is difficult to summarize how broken and corrupt the Congress has become .
Anyone who has read Taibbi's exposé will not be surprised in the slightest by this astounding article in The New York Times today , concerning a relatively aggressive fraud - prevention agency in Iraq designed to uncover corruption in how U.S. government contracts are being obtained and how American money is spent over there .
The agency , headed by a conscientious Republican lawyer who seems to take his job seriously , has had some real success in uncovering serious fraud :
But unbeknownst to virtually everyone outside of a tiny number of Congressional Republicans , a provision was surreptitiously inserted into the sprawling military authorization bill signed into law two weeks ago by the President that simply abolished Bowen 's office :
This is how the Congress works .
They prepare huge bills that nobody has time to read before voting on , they allow virtually no debate on these bills , and they have no idea what is even in the bills when they vote .
Even when the House and Senate vote on bills , they are often dramatically changed by a handful of Republicans who secretly meet in " conference . "
As a result , not only was this provision totally unknown to most of the members who voted on it , even now they can't figure out who is responsible for its insertion .
Nobody knows how it got put in : Whoever was responsible for the magic appearance of this provision was obviously interested in blocking further investigations into how contracts in Iraq have been awarded , what has been done with the $ 8 billion per month we are spending of American ' money to stay there , and who has their hands in all of those decisions .
That has long been one of the festering sores the administration ( with the active help of its compliant Congress ) has desperately concealed .
A Democratic takeover of the House is the one thing that can ensure that Americans will learn of what has been done .
I have no doubt that Henry Waxman has his subpoenas ready and dreams at night of the hearings he wants to hold on this issue :
One of the very few things that has worked in Iraq is this office to uncover at least a tiny fraction of the fraud and theft perpetrated against this country by stealing corporations and their lobbyists and Congressional enablers .
Thus , Republicans in Congress eliminated the office .
And they did it deceitfully and in secret , by inserting it into a huge bill that was voted on with no time to detect it .
And now none of them will admit responsibility for what they 've done .
That is as good a snapshot as any of the incomparably destructive one - party Republican rule to which we have been subjected .
This small story has virtually every element of how they function . :
As KagroX points out in Comments , the Times article says that even though " Senators Collins and [ John ]
Warner said they had nothing more than hunches on where the impetus for setting a termination date had originated , " it seems that " the termination language was inserted into the bill by Congressional staff members working for Duncan Hunter , the California Republican who is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and who declared on Monday that he plans to run for president in 2008 .
" As Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , Rep .
Hunter is one of the largest beneficiaries of contributions from the very defense contractors who are the target of the investigative agency his staff secretly caused to be abolished .
As the Times reports : " Three of the companies that have been a particular focus of Mr. Bowen ’s investigations [ are ]
Halliburton , Parsons and Bechtel . . . .
" That may seem incriminating at first glance , but it 's really all just a big coincidence : " Mr. Holly , who is the House Armed Services spokesman as well as a member of Mr. Hunter ’s staff , said that politics played no role and that there had been no direction from the administration or lobbying from the companies whose work in Iraq Mr. Bowen ’s office has severely critiqued .

The Team - LUX is entering the DARPA Grand Challenge , the world 's most unusual car rally .
The event , being held for the third time since 2004 , is a contest between unmanned vehicles .
The laser technology company , Sick AG , and its subsidiary , Ibeo Automobile Sensor GmbH , participate with their Team - LUX .
They want to demonstrate that laser sensors for autonomous driving will be soon included into safety systems of production vehicles .
The race car is a VW Passat 2.0 TDI with three prototypes of the new ibeo LUX laser sensor concealed in its bodywork .
In view of the Ibeo laser technology , which represents a unique concept for vehicles worldwide , the Team - LUX members believe they have an excellent chance in the contest .
What makes this race so special is that all of the competing vehicles must master a 60 - mile course entirely autonomously , with neither a driver nor remote control .
The DARPA Urban Challenge 2007 is being held in a US city , in real traffic conditions , on November 3 and 4 , 2007 .
The Team - LUX intends to show that intelligent technology capable of enhancing road safety can be produced for production cars .
" We are competing against the world 's best in terms of automobile technology , " explains Dr. Ulrich Lages , CEO of Ibeo Automobile Sensor GmbH .
He continues , " Although we are a relatively small team and , unlike the big players , do not dispose of a large budget , we believe we have a great chance at the DARPA 2007 .
Our innovative laser technology gives us a lead of several years over our prospective rivals , especially in the field of object and environmental detection . "

Iraq is not part of war on terror , says top UK diplomat
Former cabinet minister Helen Liddell sparked a diplomatic row today , as she rejected the idea that the Iraq invasion was part of the " war on terror " - despite being high commissioner to Australia , whose prime minister believes Iraq is the frontline of the war on terror .
Ms Liddell , who was Scottish secretary at the time of the invasion in 2003 , went further , dismissing the term as a " tabloid slogan . "
Potential embarrassment comes from the fact that Australia 's rightwing PM , John Howard , has been one of George Bush 's closest allies in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Mr Howard has said that Australian troops must stay in Iraq because it is a key front in the " war on terrorism " .
Her comments were seized upon by Australia 's opposition Labour party , which said that they exposed the " lies " of Mr Howard 's Liberal - National coalition .
Ms Liddell said in a speech to the National Press Club in Canberra yesterday that the term " war on terror " was a " tabloid slogan " .
" We have never seen Iraq as part of the war on terror , " she said .
" Certainly we are engaged in a war on the streets in Iraq against terrorism , but our raison d'etre for our involvement in Iraq has not been about terrorism . "
The Australian Labor party 's defence spokesman , Joel Fitzgibbon , said that Mr Howard 's government had been embarrassed .
" I 'm sure it was n't intentional on her part but she 's embarrassed John Howard and his government , she 's exposed the lie that our participation in Iraq is all about the war on terror , " he told reporters .
But Mr Howard told the Australian media there was no split with the UK over Iraq .
" The British government believes Iraq is very much part of the war against terrorism , " said Mr Howard .
" There can be no doubt in the mind of the head of the British government that Iraq is part of the battleground against terrorism , and our view and the view of the British government is identical . "
In fact , Mr Howard 's remarks have already been partially contradicted by the stance of the cabinet minister Hilary Benn , who this week explicitly said the British government did not use the phrase " war on terror " , as it gave succour to terrorists and was too narrow a definition .
Mr Benn said : " In the UK , we do not use the phrase ' war on terror ' because we can't win by military means alone .
" And because this is n't us against one organised enemy with a clear identity and a coherent set of objectives . "
It is " the vast majority of the people in the world " against " a small number of loose , shifting and disparate groups who have relatively little in common " , he said .
" What these groups want is to force their individual and narrow values on others , without dialogue , without debate , through violence .
" And by letting them feel part of something bigger , we give them strength . "
The Australian Labor party , which is leading in the polls ahead of this year 's general elections , is promising to withdraw the country 's 1,400 troops from Iraq if it wins power .
The remarks were pounced on by the SNP , currently campaigning for the May 3 elections in Ms Liddell 's native Scotland .
Angus Robertson , the party 's international affairs spokesman , pointed out that Mrs Liddell was a cabinet minister when the decision to go to war in Iraq was made .
He said : " As a cabinet minister who was part of the collective decision to invade Iraq , her comments make it even more clear that Tony Blair only took us into the Iraq war on the coat tails of President Bush , and for no other reason . "
Mr Robertson added : " George W Bush and Tony Blair sold the Iraq war on the basis that it was part of the war on terrorism , and even that its weapons of mass destruction could be obtained by terrorists .
" We now know that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and now Helen Liddell is telling us that it was n't part of the ' war on terror ' . "
The Liberal Democrat leader , Sir Menzies Campbell , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Ms Liddell 's comment " seems to me to undermine the whole philosophy the [ British ] prime minister has used " .
Ms Liddell is no stranger to controversy .
Nicknamed " Stalin's Granny " at Westminster for her bruising reputation , she had to fight off accusations that her cabinet post as Scottish secretary was a non-job in the wake of devolution .
A newspaper printed her appointments diary , after it was revealed that she had time for French lessons , with only a Burns dinner during one week 's worth of appointments .
She inherited the late John Smith 's Monklands seat , but won it in what the Guardian called the " nastiest sectarian battle in Scotland for decades " .
She is also the author ofa racy thriller , Elite , about a ruthless female Scottish politician who becomes deputy prime minister - and the mistress of the future US president .

New calculations show that sensitivity of Earth 's climate to changes in the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) has been consistent for the last 420 million years , according to an article in Nature by geologists at Yale and Wesleyan Universities .
A popular predictor of future climate sensitivity is the change in global temperature produced by each doubling of CO 2 in the atmosphere .
This study confirms that in the Earth 's past 420 million years , each doubling of atmospheric CO 2 translates to an average global temperature increase of about 3° Celsius , or 5° Fahrenheit .
According to the authors , since there has continuously been life on the planet over this time span , there must be an ongoing balance between CO 2 entering and leaving the atmosphere from the rocks and waters at Earth 's surface .
Their simulations examined a wide span of possible relationships between atmospheric CO 2 and temperature and the likelihood they could have occurred based on proxy data from geological samples .
Most estimates of climate sensitivity have been based on computer simulations of climate or records of climate change over the past few decades to thousands of years , when carbon dioxide concentrations and global temperatures were similar to or lower than today .
Such estimates could underestimate the magnitude of large climate - change events .
To keep Earth 's carbon cycle in balance , atmospheric CO 2 has varied over geologic time .
Carbon - cycle models balance chemical reactions that involve carbon , such as photosynthesis and the formation of limestone , on a global scale .
To better predict future trends in global warming , these researchers compared estimates from long - term modeling of Earth 's carbon cycle with the recent proxy measurements of CO 2 .
This study used 500 data points in the geological records as " proxy data " and evaluated them in the context of the CO 2 cycling models of co-author Robert Berner , professor emeritus of geology and geophysics at Yale who pioneered models of the balance of CO 2 in the Earth and Earth 's atmosphere .
" Proxy data are indirect measurements of CO 2 -- they are a measure of the effects of CO 2 , " explained co-author Jeffrey Park , professor of geology and geophysics at Yale who created the computer simulations for the project .
" While we cannot actually measure the CO 2 that was in the atmosphere millions of years ago , we can measure the geologic record of its presence .
For example , measurement of carbon isotopes in ancient ocean - plankton material reflects atmospheric CO 2 concentrations . "
Led by Dana L. Royer , assistant professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Wesleyan University , who did his graduate work in geology at Yale , the collaboration simulated 10,000 variations in the carbon - cycle processes such as the sensitivity of plant growth to extra CO 2 i n the atmosphere .
They evaluated these variations for a range of atmospheric warming conditions , using the agreement with the geologic data to determine the most likely warming scenarios .
The model - estimated atmospheric CO 2 variations were tested against data from ancient rocks .
Other proxy measurements of soil , rock and fossils provided estimates of CO 2 over the past 420 million years .
Calculation of the climate sensitivity in this way did not require independent estimates of temperature .
It incorporated information from times when the Earth was substantially warmer and colder than today , and reflects the sensitivity of the carbon - cycle balance over millions of years .
" Our results are consistent with estimates from shorter - term records , and indicate that climate sensitivity was almost certainly greater than 1.5 , but less than 5.5 degrees Celsius over this period , " said Park .

The US has fewer troops in Iraq than Vietnam , but pays them more
The report put costs in Iraq at $ 500 m ( £ 278 m ) a month more than in Vietnam , adjusted for inflation .
This makes Iraq the most expensive US war in the past 60 years , they say .
But an analyst from the conservative American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) said the cost was small in the context of the whole US economy .
The report by the Institute for Policy Studies ( IPS ) and Foreign Policy in Focus ( FPIF ) , called The Iraq Quagmire , calculates the cost of current military operations in Iraq at $ 5.6 bn ( £ 3.1 bn ) every month .
By comparison , the eight - year campaign in Vietnam cost on average $ 5.1 bn ( £ 2.8 bn ) a month .
' Poor preparation '
The IPS and FPIF say this is partly down to differences in the way modern war is waged .
Although there are fewer troops in Iraq than Vietnam , they are paid more and weapons are more expensive , the report says .
Weapons have become more expensive since the Vietnam War
" Broken down per person in the US , the cost so far is $ 277 per person , making the Iraq War the most expensive military effort in the past 60 years , " it concludes .
Co-author Erik Leaver told the BBC costs in Iraq had spiralled since 2003 because the US had not been well - prepared .
" We have deployed now roughly one million troops in Afghanistan and Iraq , and the numbers just keep going up and up , " he said .
" We are going to continue to see costs not only from the fighting now but also from the health care of these soldiers and veterans when they come home . "
' Drop in the bucket '
However Thomas Donnelly , a defence expert with the AEI , believes the eventual result of the Iraq war is more important than its cost in dollars .
" The more valued criticism is whether the Bush administration is winning the war and prosecuting it in a successful way , " he said .
" So what price victory ?
I would say that $ 5bn a month is certainly something I would be willing to pay . "
Mr Donnelly said the relative cost of operations in Iraq , at 2 % of America 's annual GDP , was less than either the Vietnam conflict at 12 % or World War II at 40 % .
" Although the costs of war have grown ... the American economy is exponentially larger than it was in the Vietnam War years , " Mr Donnelly said .
" When it [ the Iraq war ] is compared to the overall size of the American economy , it 's really a drop in the bucket , certainly by historical standards . "

It 's a sweltering day , and the beach is packed with suntanned bodies .
Girls in swimsuits lounge on the sand while their boyfriends cradle surfboards .
Mecca Laalaa is the lone exception .
Instead of a barely there bikini , she 's in a burqini – a top - to - toe two - piece lycra suit complete with hijab , or Islamic head covering .
Loose enough to preserve Muslim modesty , but light enough to enable swimming , the burqini , taking its name from the burqa , is at the forefront of a dramatic shift within Australia 's iconic surf lifesaving clubs .
No longer wanting to be associated only with bronzed , blue - eyed action men , Surf Life Saving Australia is attempting to better reflect the country 's multicultural mix .
Ms. Laalaa is one of 24 young people of Arab descent who signed up for a 10 - week surf lifesaving - training course .
" Normally , I 'd wear cotton trousers and a top but they get very heavy in the water .
This meets our cultural requirements , " she says , preparing to go out on a beach patrol .
The burqini that she wears was specially designed to allow Muslim women like her to join one of the surf lifesavers clubs .
For a century , surf lifesavers have been the embodiment of Australian beach culture , as quintessential an icon as the Anzac soldier and the outback jackaroo , or cowboy .
With 115,000 lifesavers patrolling the continent 's beaches and more than 300 clubs , Surf Life Saving Australia is the nation 's largest volunteer movement , its unpaid members responsible for saving more than half a million lives in the past 100 years .
But the movement has also been deeply conservative , built on a stern , militaristic tradition fostered by soldiers returning from the world wars .
Until 1980 , women were banned from joining .
The overhaul coincides with the 100th anniversary of the first surf club , at Sydney 's famous Bondi Beach , as well as the Year of the Lifesaver .
This initiative , aimed at diversifying the clubs , is also in response to events that shocked Australia and the world just over a year ago .
A few days before Christmas 2005 , gangs of whites and ethnically Middle Eastern young people clashed around Cronulla Beach .
The fighting revealed a deep gulf between the white Australians of mainly British and Irish heritage and recent immigrants from Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries .
The lifesaving program is a small step intended to help heal the wounds left by the Cronulla violence .
" I was shocked by the magnitude of it , so to have a group like this training as lifesavers is of tremendous importance , " says Jamal Rifi , the president of the community sports club from which most of the trainees were recruited .
" It 's about counteracting the negative stereotyping of Muslims , which has been very bad over the last five years .
Our greatest enemy is ignorance . "
The campaign to recruit Australians of Middle Eastern heritage has been funded by a grant of AU $ 600,000 ( US $ 467,000 ) from the federal government .
The original 24 in the group has been whittled down to 14 , the dropouts realizing they were not strong enough swimmers or finding that the schedule clashed with other commitments .
The grueling training regime has included first aid , radio communications , rescue drills , and fitness tests , and culminates this week in written and practical tests .
If successful , the recruits will become fully qualified surf lifesavers , entitled to wear the organization 's distinctive red and yellow caps .
The group 's trainer , Tony Coffey , says the burqini makes swimming more difficult compared with being dressed in a bikini or swimsuit .
" It 's the biggest hurdle the girls face .
But we can't do anything about it , it 's part of the deal .
They just need more intensive training . "
The new recruits will be expected to volunteer for one weekend a month , rescuing swimmers and dealing with jellyfish stings , surfing injuries , and lost children .
" We 're breaking down social barriers , " says Malaak Mourad , a student whose parents emigrated from Lebanon in the 1970s .
" Most of the lifesavers are Anglo - Saxon .
We 've been getting a lot of attention from the public but I think it 's admiration more than anything negative . "
To be sure , the push to diversify the surf lifesaving clubs coincides with an overall change in Aussie beach culture .
In Sydney , beachside suburbs that until a decade ago were populated by working class Australians have been gentrified and colonized by professionals , many of them expatriates .
At the Coogee surf lifesaving club , around 15 percent of the 600 active members are foreigners , including individuals from Britain , New Zealand , France , Germany , Chile , and the United States .
Claire Folland from Edinburgh , Scotland , was attracted by the fitness regime and social life provided by membership of the club .
" Initially , it was very hard because I was n't very good in the ocean .
There 's not much swimming in Scotland unless you 're drunk or mad , " says Ms. Folland , who works in occupational health and safety .
But rigorous training and the demands of being on regular beach patrols have honed her swimming skills .
Not even an initial fear of sharks has put her off .
" I figured I 'd swim next to one of the fatter members of the club and hopefully they'd get eaten instead of me , " she jokes .
Ordering the locals to avoid dangerous currents has not presented problems for Liz Couch , who is from San Diego , Calif .
The former professional lifesaver moved to Sydney two years ago and decided to join the club to meet new people .
" If people can't swim properly and you can , they really do n't have much choice but to listen to you if you 're coming to rescue them , " she says .
The lifesavers of the future will still be tanned and fit , and wear the distinctive red and yellow swimsuit and cap , but their accents are as likely to be Arabic or American as the familiar Aussie twang .
Senator Clinton wo n't rule out use of force to stop ' pro-terrorist '
Iran

This article has been corrected .
At a speech Friday to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) said " no option can be taken off the table " when dealing with Iran , RAW STORY has learned .
Clinton tempered her remarks by saying she 's advocated engagement with " our enemies and Israeli 's enemies , " adding , " I believe we can gain valuable knowledge and leverage from being part of a process again that enables us to get a better idea of how to take on and defeat our adversaries . "
Her quotes were reported by the Associated Press .
The dinner was held by the nation 's largest pro-Israel lobbying group , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
AIPAC is widely believed to the most powerful lobbying group in Washington and routinely sees major politicians from both sides of the aisle -- also in attendance Friday was former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) .
AIPAC tends to take a more hawkish stance on foreign policy , and has routinely labeled Iran a serious threat .
In a Dec. 6 memo , the group labeled Iran " The Core of Instability in the Middle East . "
' No option can be taken off the table ' Clinton told some 1,700 AIPAC supporters that the US must take any step to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons .
" U.S. policy must be clear and unequivocal :
We cannot , we should not , we must not permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons , " she said .
" In dealing with this threat ... no option can be taken off the table . "
" To deny the Holocaust places Iran 's leadership in company with the most despicable bigots and historical revisionists , " she added .
Clinton excoriated the Iranian administration 's " pro-terrorist , anti-American , anti-Israeli rhetoric . "
" We need to use every tool at our disposal , including diplomatic and economic in addition to the threat and use of military force , " she added .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been a vehement critic of Israel , and according to various media reports Israel has prepared strike plans to target Iran 's nuclear enrichment sites .
In December 2006 , Iran held an " International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust , " which drew widespread criticism .
Iran insisted that it was not a Holocaust denial conference .
In October 2005 , Ahmadinejad said he concurred with Ayatollah Khomeini 's remarks on Israel that the " occupying regime " had to be removed , calling it a " disgraceful stain [ on ] the Islamic world " that must be " wiped off the map , " according to a translation published in the New York Times .
Ahmadinejad did not use Israel by name in his speech .
Some Middle East experts disagree with the translation , which was widely used by the Associated Press and other news agencies .
Some say the phrase is more accurately translated as " eliminated " or " wiped off " or " wiped away " from " the page of time " or " the pages of history , " rather than " wiped off the map . "
New York Times deputy foreign editor Ethan Bronner later responded to critiques of the Times ' translation , saying , " all official translations " of the comments , including the foreign ministry and president 's office , " refer to wiping Israel away . "
He agreed , however , that " map " was not the most suitable translation .
Iran continues nuclear development Iran continues to develop its nuclear program despite protestations from its European neighbors and the United States .
Diplomats said this week that the Persian nation would begin installing more than 3,000 cetrifuges at their underground nuclear enrichment site at Natanz .
Analysts disagree over the timeframe in which Iran might develop a nuclear bomb .
Most place an estimate somewhere between 3 - 5 years .
Iran has said they intend to use the program for " peaceful " civilian power needs .
According to New Yorker investigative reporter Seymour Hersh , a classified draft CIA assessment has found no firm evidence of a secret drive by Iran to develop nuclear weapons , as alleged by the White House .
Still , Iran 's plans to install as many as 50,000 centrifuges comes in direct defiance of the UN Security Council , which called on Iran last summer to suspend uranium enrichment .
Iran opened the doors of its enrichment plant to ' non-aligned ' nations Saturday in an effort to give ambassadors " the opportunity to see for themselves what is going on in the peaceful nuclear activities of Iran , " said Iran 's envoy to the UN Atomic Watchdog , Ali Asghar Soltanieh .

Correction :
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad referred to Israel as the " Zionist state . "
A more accurate translation of his remarks were , " occupying regime . "
The updated version of this article also includes a more detailed discussion of the translation .
Title also used " run " instead of " rule . "
China acknowledges it faces climate change problems
The International Energy Agency had predicted China 's carbon dioxide emissions would pass the US by 2010 .
But IEA chief economist Fatih Birol said the rate of China 's economic growth this year defied expectations .
His comments come days after a Chinese government report warned of the impact of climate change on the country .
The report , compiled by several government bodies , said that higher temperatures would lead to worsening droughts , spreading deserts and reduced water supplies .
But it stopped short of recommending cuts in greenhouse gas output and risking the country 's economic growth .
Coal reliance
Mr Birol , of the Paris - based IEA , which advises governments on energy policy , said : " China 's economic growth and use of coal production over the last few months has surprised us all .
" If they continue to surprise us in terms of very high economic growth and corresponding coal production , China will overtake the US much earlier than 2009 - more like this year or the next . "
Though that gap could widen considerably in the coming years , he said per capita emissions from China still remained well below those of the US and other developed countries .
But he warned that both China and India - another fast - developing nation - needed to be involved in global efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions , otherwise there would be " no chance the climate change fight can be won " .
He also said slowing China 's growth was not the answer to curbing high greenhouse gas emissions - rather it needed a change of approach to energy production .
" China is a developing country and it needs growth , " he said .
" The question is what kind of energy and policies will be used in order to get that high level of economic growth .
" If they were to use much more sustainable policies and energy efficiency it would be good both for China 's economy and for the climate change issue . "
China is heavily reliant on highly polluting coal for its energy , and mines far more coal than any other country .
While the Chinese government has pledged to try to develop alternative energy sources , it says wealthy nations are the most to blame for high gas emissions .

Lunar dust brought back to Earth from the Apollo 17 mission
A study suggests the smallest particles in lunar dust might be toxic , if comparisons with dust inhalation cases on Earth apply .
Teams hope to carry out experiments on mice to determine whether this is the case or not .
Nasa has set up a working group to look into the matter ahead of its planned return to the Moon by 2020 .
A team at the University of Tennessee ( UT ) in Knoxville is also looking at ways of using magnets to filter dust from the living environments of lunar bases and spacecraft .
The health effects of inhaling lunar dust have been recognised since Nasa 's Apollo missions .
Astronaut Harrison H ( Jack )
Schmitt , the last man to step on to the Moon in Apollo 17 , complained of " lunar dust hay fever " when his dirty space suit contaminated the habitation module after an energetic foray on the lunar surface .
The US space agency ( Nasa ) is now keen to assess the effects of more prolonged exposure and to address the problem before humans are sent back to the Moon in just over a decade .
Details of the work were presented to the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston , Texas .
' Dangerous fraction '
Nasa 's Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Advisory Group ( LADTAG ) , which includes medical doctors as well as scientists from UT , have been working to characterise the dust 's properties .
Lunar dust will be tested before humans set foot on the Moon again
" I 've been working on lunar samples for 35 years and I have looked at fractions down to a few microns ( millionths of a metre ) , but never anything less , " said Professor Larry Taylor , director of the Planetary Geosciences Institute at Tennessee .
" The medical doctors are interested in things that are less than about three microns .
" So we did some particle size determinations and discovered that a very large portion of lunar soil is potentially dangerous , approximately 1 - 3 % of the total soil by weight . "
Most particles in lunar soil should get coughed up , or moved out of the lungs by specialised hairs called cilli .
But any particles smaller than about 2.5 microns will stick in lung tissue .
When dust is deposited in the lungs , inflammation occurs .
Ultimately , scar tissue called a fibroid grows around the particle .
This scar tissue replaces cells which facilitate the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the lungs .
The magnetic properties of lunar dust could be useful
This is the process at work in the condition silicosis - an occupational hazard in mining , quarrying and foundry work - and asbestosis , which results from inhaling asbestos fibres .
It also occurs in bronchitis and as a consequence of smoking .
" If you took a healthy pair of adult lungs and smeared them out , they would cover a football field , " Professor Taylor told BBC News .
" Once you are down to the size of a square table 's worth of surface area in your lungs that is useable ; you are just about dead . "
Fine particles
The team at the University of Tennessee has shown that about one percent by weight of lunar soil comprises particles less than one micron in size .
A smaller - but still significant - fraction is less than 100 nanometres ( billionths of a metre ) in size .
They determined that most of the fine particles in lunar dust are composed of glass formed through the impact of micrometeorites on the surface of the Moon .
But the glass also contains metallic iron grains , much like that in a carpenter 's nail and measuring just 10 - 20 nanometres in size .
Machines could be sent to the Moon to " pave " its surface
These grains , called " nano - phase iron " , are so small that , if inhaled , some would pass directly from the lungs into the blood circulation .
Once in the blood , the iron could " de- energise " the haemoglobin molecule which carries oxygen to the body 's tissues .
If enough gets dissolved in the blood , it could produce effects similar to carbon monoxide poisoning .
However , exactly how much is required for this to happen remains an open question .
In addition , when some fine dust particles are examined under the microscope , they can be seen to be filled with holes - like Swiss cheese .
These vesicles give them a much larger surface area to react with the lung tissue , says Dr Yang Liu , a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Tennessee .
" If you have a solid particle of dust and add vesicles , you can calculate how much the reactive surface area is increased .
Sometimes you can get increases of up to a factor of five , " she told BBC News .
" With jagged particles , because of the way they follow the path of the air , there 's a lower chance of them impacting the sinus walls at the back of the throat - which is the body 's defence mechanism for keeping particles out of the lungs , " said Dr Benjamin Eimer , another postdoctoral researcher at the University of Tennessee .
Lab tests
Previous in vitro experiments with rodents found little effect from the inhalation of samples of lunar soil of average grain size .
But Larry Taylor says that new experiments need to concentrate on the effects of breathing in the fine dust particles .
If they are going to do any work on the Moon , they do n't want dust in the way , so there is a big effort to minimise it
Dr Benjamin Eimer ,
University of Tennessee
Virtually all particles smaller than about 50 microns are attracted by a simple hand - held magnet .
To demonstrate , Professor Taylor brought with him a vial of lunar dust returned from the Moon in the 1969 Apollo 11 mission .
Sure enough , the dust was attracted to the magnet as he moved it around the plastic container .
" I discovered that if you put lunar soil in your microwave oven , next to your tea , it will melt at 1,200C before your tea boils - which is a magical thing , " he said .
This property is almost entirely due to a coupling effect between the microwaves and the nano - phase iron in the dust .
The molten dust from the microwave treatment hardens into solid glass , which has given rise to the idea that robots could be sent ahead of human missions to " pave " landing pads and roads by firing microwaves at the lunar soil .
Professor Taylor has come up with a concept for a wheeled vehicle , much like an ice - rink resurfacer , that could perform the task , and has developed a prototype microwave device that could be carried to the Moon .
Paving the Moon would prevent dust being kicked up by the manned spacecraft and vehicles which would follow to the surface , but some of the finest dust may be " levitated " electro- statically above the surface .
This is relevant not only for the health of the astronauts , but also for astronomy on the Moon .
" If they are going to do any work on the Moon , they do n't want dust in the way , so there is a big effort to minimise it , " Dr Eimer told BBC News .
He has been working on ways to filter dust out of habitation modules and vacuum it up from the surface with devices that use magnets to attract the lunar soil and dust .
One concept , called the Lunar Air Filter with a Permanent Magnet System ( LAF - PMS ) , consists of many permanent magnets placed with their magnetic poles very close , creating a large field gradient that attracts lunar dust particles from the air .
In order to clean the filters out , small blocks of iron are moved into the gaps between the magnets to close off the magnetic fields .
With the filter turned off , the dust can be wiped away .
Another concept , called the Lunar Soil Magnetic Collector ( LSMAC ) , comprises a series of wound magnetic coils arranged along a tube that could be turned on in sequence to effectively " suck up " lunar dust , giving the impression of the leaf - gathering machine used here on Earth .
" We will want to collect the soil to extract oxygen and hydrogen and perhaps to use for building materials .
So we will have to collect massive amounts of lunar regolith .
Our idea was to make something that could gather up the soil without creating a large dust cloud , " said Dr Eimer .

EclipseCon Eclipse spent today weathering criticism from developers when it dared ask : " What sucks about Eclipse ? "
A day after unveiling plans for tools to help build Web 2.0 applications , Eclipse was dinged by developers for giving them a dated and confusing interface .
Developers attending an EclipseCon open mic session in Santa Clara , California , chided Eclipse for hiding new functionality under successive interfaces , of using inflexible dialogue boxes , and for not offering a more Web 2.0 look and feel .
One delegate said Eclipse should be more " dynamic " on change and asked why Eclipse could n't co-ordinate a unified interface design project .
Earlier , Eclipse was grilled over its strategy for three Web 2.0 projects , to provide AJAX and scripting developers improved tooling in debugging - with a Java debugger and debugging in Firefox - and frameworks .
Overall , the idea is to eliminate common programming headaches and help take Eclipse into Web 2.0 markets .
Concerns centered on frameworks , and whether the new Eclipse projects will mandate use of a framework and whether there are too many frameworks for Eclipse tools to support .
The planned Eclipse Rich Applications Project ( RAP ) , promises plug-ins to " leading " frameworks such as Dojo , Rico , Zimbra and script.aculo.us .
" There 's a misconception you need a framework , " one Ruby developer told EclipseCon delegates .
" Committing yourself to one toolkit is dangerous .
You become [ overly ] reliant on one framework , " he said .
There exist 160 frameworks , up from four dozen a year ago , with 25 per cent of scripters eschewing a framework , according to an Ajaxian poll last September
Complaints against Eclipse tools incorporated several pet peeves .
These included complexity of installing Eclipse on Windows , Mac , Linux and Unix , which Eclipse is trying to solve through the Equinox and proposed Maya projects .
Other issues included separation between views and editors , use of different XML editors , and existence of two Subversion plug-ins - here and here .
As ever , the confusion over Eclipse plug-ins and complexity of the Eclipse architecture and interface tdrew most complaints .
In a display of hands , the audience of around 80 attendees voted to remove model dialogue boxes .
One developer , a former NetBeans user who'd traveled to the Heart of Darkness after recently switching platforms with jobs , said of the Eclipse interface : " I was overwhelmed by the functionality I get in the first screen .
I propose an ' easy to view perspective ' that would show developers [ only ] what they need . " ®

BBC Click
We have come to expect a lot from search engines .
Google has tried to counteract ' link bombs '
Type in a phrase , and we not only expect it to find millions of relevant websites , but we also expect it to list the best or most important sites first .
Woe betide a search engine that requires me to click to page two of the results before I find the site I am looking for .
Generally they do a decent job but , up until very recently , if you were to search on the term " miserable failure " , top of the Google search results was the official George Bush page on the official White House site .
Bush trick
This is an example of how even the biggest search engines can be manipulated .
Essentially , the web is a collection of pages , all linking to each other .
If you are searching for something , search engines like Google , Ask , and Yahoo ! will first find all the pages they think are relevant .
Then , crucially , they need to decide which order to display search results in .
One of the most important factors in deciding how relevant particular sites are is to count how many other sites link to it .
The more references , or links there are to a site , the more important it is deemed to be .
Because lots of people quote and link the BBC website , for example , the BBC site is seen as relevant and a good hit .
That is why the site ranks quite highly for many search terms .
An underground movement of bloggers exploited this fact , to create a " link bomb " .
They encouraged thousands of their peers to include a link to the Bush homepage in their blogs , and label it " miserable failure " .
With all of these links , the main search engine algorithms were fooled into thinking this was a relevant result for that search term , and Bush was driven to the top of the rankings .
Mr Bush had been link bombed .
Politicians have been targeted by bloggers
At first , the search engines ignored it - it was not their job to censor search results , however controversial .
Nor did they censor other link bombs - googling " liar " would show Tony Blair 's homepage first .
Link bombs are usually self - defeating - as they become successful , other popular sites begin to discuss the bombs , and end up becoming more popular than the link bomb , driving it from number one .
Apostolos Gerasoulis , co-inventor of search technology for Ask.com said : " I do n't think this is the problem though .
This is just fun . "
" Why we do n't remove it , or why the search engines do n't remove it , is because as long as we give relevant results for most of the queries that you type then we 're OK .
" The impact of this bombing , as it is called , is minimal , insignificant .
It might be two or three examples , " he added .
Google decided to tweak its search algorithm to spot link bombs , and the miserable failure dropped away .
On other search engines , such as Ask , it remains high .
If they build the right page , it is OK , if they build a great page it 's OK but the problem comes when they really try to cheat you
Apostolos Gerasoulis search expert
The link bomb actually achieved what any business would love to have - the number one search result in their category .
The ideal place to be is in the centre of the search result , the so - called natural search result , online marketer Fadi Shuman , explained .
" You get 80 % of the clicks from the natural results .
That is where we all want to be .
The way to achieve that is through search engine optimisation . "
Optimisation is produced by making the website as visible to search engines as possible and having other sites linking to it .
However search engine optimisation also has a darker side .
Blacklisted
In February 2006 , BMW Germany got into hot water over its website .
The problem was that the site was laden with keywords which customers could not see , but which search engines could .
They were there specifically to boost the rankings .
Google has rules to guard against so - called black hat methods - specifically , " do n't present different content to search engines than you do to your users " .
Once discovered , Google blacklisted the site and dropped it from their search results altogether until BMW redesigned the site .
Jason Duke , search engine optimiser , said : " We try and persuade people to link to us , whether that be via content , whether that be via methods of creating controversy in the marketplace . "
It is an ongoing battle of sorts , between the search engines and the optimisers who would love to work the system to their clients ' advantage .
Although both sides prefer to call it an uneasy truce .
Mr Gerasoulis added : " If they build the right page , it 's OK , if they build a great page , it 's OK .
But the problem comes when they really try to cheat you . "
On tonight 's " Factor " Bill O'Reilly continued his hilariously delusional and debunked attacks on George Soros ( complete with spiffy , state of the art graphics ) .
You may want to finish your drinks and extinguish all smoking devices now .

To prove that George Soros is the Ruler of the Universe , O'Reilly references a New York Times article on anti-war groups meeting with Democratic staffers .
Of course , Soros is n't mentioned in the article , but Billy is convinced that the evil Soros is at the center of it all .
The hysterical rants do n't stop there .
BillO once again claims that all Democrats , including John Edwards , answer directly to Mr. Soros and that he has the power to ruin entire countries at will .
The hits are too numerous to mention so have at it in the comments .
Loose Change 9/11 Available Now !
Today ’s Freshmen in High School will be learning about the events of September 11th , 2001 as an event that happened before they were born .
Yet , the relevance of 9/11 echoes through our lives to this day .
It is impossible to avoid the places we as a nation have gone .
Scars and open wounds stain our stars and stripes .
We must understand that what we were told about that day is a lie and those lies drastically changed the course of peace to a course of perpetual war .
How many more people need to die until we realize a revaluation of the day ’s events is needed ?
Loose Change was created as a voice for the victims of September 11th , 2001 , to ask the questions they were robbed of the ability to ask about their fate .
A new investigation into the events of that fateful day can give context to the perils we fight today .
It ’s not too late .
Ask questions , demand answers .

I was up late researching something last night and DH does n’t have to work today , so we slept in .
Sorta .
I just finished Cuppa # 1 .
Last week was intense ; we finished up two major farming projects ( pig harvest and goat kidding season ) , and went right into the next items : starting to get fields ready for either grazing , haying or plowing .
Plus we ’re helping our landlord get his land certified organic , and there ’s a lot of stuff to consider with that .
But we ’re honored to be asked to help with that task .
In the middle of that , DH managed to injure his hand really badly , badly enough that we had to drop everything at 9 pm at night and speed down to the ER to have it assessed by doctors more skilled than I at triage .
Happily , no permanent injury , some stitches and bandages that had to be changed every day , but he gets the stitches out today .
That meant that I had to do all the chores again during the week since he could n’t lift anything and could n’t get that hand wet .
So it was a hugely busy week .
BUT , we had several nice conversations about how to manage money , which is such a huge improvement over the fights we used to have .
One big update – that escrow refund ?
We ’ve decided to put it into savings for the time being , while we continue to consider options and particularly while we wait to see what a few certain things are going to cost us .
But long term , it looks like the money will be used as “ starter money ” for an ongoing farm sinking fund .
We came to that decision via a roundabout way .
We have predictable , repeating costs well in hand with our monthly budget , for both the household and the farm , and our snowball is clicking along OK .
But sometimes we would still bicker as we came upon unexpected , non-repeating costs or one - time capital investment expenses for stuff with the farm .
For instance , getting a new pasture fenced in , so that we can expand our grazing area and cut down on feed costs .
But it ’s going to cost us about $ 1000 to get that initial setup done .
Once it ’s done , it ’ll pay for itself within a few months .
But until now , we just could n’t quite squeeze the weekly / monthly budget enough to get that money together .
With this refund , we ’ll be able to get an account going for that sort of thing , start it off with a nice fat amount , then continue to contribute to it and pull from it over time as needed .
I ’m pretty happy with that solution and DH is too .
So I guess that ’s our biggest news .
Oh , and whatever folks do , try real hard not to injure their hands when they do manual labor every day .
Really messes up the schedule .
I ’m glad he ’s OK but wow he ’s getting stir crazy , waiting for his hand to heal .
Unfortunately that “ not - quite - just - in time - production ” nature of the supply train also has a downside at the other side of this situation .
When production increases again , if it does , then there will be an equivalent lag - time before our Japanese retailer can take down his EMPTY sign because the gas is back in town .
The gas that is in the pump came out of the oil well some time ago , and has had to pass though pipelines , storage , tanker shipment , refineries and additional storage before it actually leaves the pump nozzle to flow into the car gas tank .
This takes away some of the immediate impact of the OPEC cut back in supply , and if this is , concurrently , occurring when the refineries normally reduce demand because of maintenance , then the impact can be further concealed .
Thus , if for example , Saudi Aramco tells Asian refiners that it is cutting supplies by 9 % that does not mean that when a Japanese driver pulls into the gas station tomorrow that he will face a large EMPTY sign .
Rather , in March Aramco tells the refiners that it will cut supply in later months , and thus the impact is not immediately evident . :
One of the critical factors in making sure that there is enough of an energy supply to meet the growing international demand lies in the logistics of the supply train that is going to have to provide it .
When CERA and others point to the totality of the available resource , as Nate is pointing out in his series , they neglect the realities of that chain , and the parts that all have to work if the electric light is to go on the next time that you flip the switch on the wall .
One way that individuals , companies and nations can protect themselves from the violent price fluctuations that usually occur during shortages it to provide themselves with a strategic reserve .
Now I do n’t call it that when I buy 4 cords of wood in the fall , so that I do n’t have to struggle through the blizzard to the store for my daily wood supply , but I could .
There was discussion on fluctuations in coal production a week or so ago , and part of that was because of the more common national strikes that used to occur in struggles between management and unions .
With strikes lasting up to a year power stations would build stocks of coal ahead of time so that they could continue work during the strike , but this exacerbated the fluctuation .
And power stations must now , because of the variable timing of coal by rail , have an operating reserve just to ensure stable operation over a month .
And as a passing comment , driving down the Delta after Katrina I was surprised to see how little damage the coal stockpiles had suffered .
Nations and corporations normally have operational stockpiles for oil ( and the relative state of these get posted and commented on fairly regularly ) .
And beyond these short - term reserves the US has a Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( SPR ) which we are in process of enlarging .
It proved useful after the Hurricanes of 2005 , and China has built and filled some , but is , interestingly renting out space to Sinopec at the Zhenhai SPR .
This does not seem consistent with plans discussed last year for China to build a reserve of 800 million barrels .
If they are still waiting for the price to come down , they may have a long wait .
India is also moving ahead with the creation of underground space .
It is the more normal stocks , however , that are first run down , should supply become inadequate , but since current U.S. stocks are at typical levels , around 22 days supply , this is still more of a conjectural scenario .
However it is a point of vulnerability and is one place to see the impact of a prolonged OPEC reduction .
OPEC , for example , see the size of these inventories as a sign of oversupply .
Moving further back along the supply train , and skipping the refining process itself , and recognizing that it takes several weeks to ship oil from Ras Tanura to Houston , or other distant destinations , one arrives back at Saudi Arabia , and two more points that I would like to interject into the debate on Aramco production .
And they are more intended to be helpful to those who do n’t know some of the language and technologies .
The first relates to the debate between Stuart and Euan on the decline in Saudi production .
Foregoing , for now the intent of the Saudi Government ( see reference above ) and the sudden chilling we seem to be seeing in the U.S. relationship with them , the need for time in changing oil production should be recognized .
When Aramco decide to increase production from a field , or to add another field to their supply network , they cannot just drill another well , hook it into the line and see their exports increase .
Because of the nature of the fluid that actually comes out of the hole , it has to be run , first through a GOSP , or gas oil separation plant .
Here the oil , formation water and gas that come out of the well together are separated , so that they can be piped to the different treatment plants .
( And as a side point readers might want to look at some of the articles on oil production from Saudi Aramco World since they are written more for a family audience than a technical one . )
These plants are generally rather large , the one in the article treats 450,000 bd of oil , and they take considerable time to build , install and connect up .
Thus when new production is planned one has to wait for the plant to be in operation before the wells themselves can be productive .
The new addition that is planned for Khurais , for example , must also have a new central processing plant constructed , and when Haradh Stage 3 began , it had , first to have the new GOSP in place and running , which is was by the second quarter of 2006 .
Thus the production increments in the country are controlled by the rate at which these can be brought on line .
In addition the older ones are being upgraded .
( Side comment , though the KSA centralize their GOSPs they do n’t have to be that big we have had an individual well unit hauled through our yard behind an SUV ) .
The final point that I wanted to slip in was to extend the " back of the envelope " type of calculation that I had originally done for Abqaiq ( continued here and here ) to do the same thing for Northern Ain Dar , since this was the subject of the one of the papers that Stuart quoted the other day .
As you may gather from that post Ain Dar has been producing for some 50 years , and for the last 30 of these water has been injected around the edges of the field to gradually push the remaining oil up towards the crest of the anticline ( fold ) that caused the oil to be trapped there .
And while the pictures that Stuart posted tell some of the story , it may also help to look at some numbers .
If we begin by seeing how much oil that there can be in this part of the field , we can do this by calculating the total volume of the reservoir , and then seeing how much of this is not rock ( the porosity ) .
This part of the field is roughly 7 miles wide , and some 20 miles long ( from Greg Croft and is some 200 ft thick .
This gives a volume of rock of some 836,000,000,000 cu ft .
If this has a porosity of 25 % then the volume of space that can be filled with oil is 209,000,000,000 cu.
Ft . If it were all oil , then at 7.48 gal / cu ft this would be 37,237,000,000 barrels , or 37 billion barrels give or take .
And I should , here , point out that this is only Northern Ain Dar , and that when larger figures are quoted I believe that they refer to the whole field , which extends about another 25 miles further South , and which is often combined with the adjacent Shedgum which , in 2001 , for e.g. was producing about 2 mbd , to the roughly 0.5 mbd coming from North Ain Dar .
Now this is , at maximum , the total volume of oil .
However there is , at Ain Dar , apparently a certain amount of water already in the formation with the oil , so this will reduce the total volume that can be recovered .
At the same time , even with water flood only a certain fraction of the oil in the rock will be recovered .
So that if we say .
For example , that the oil filled about 80 % of the space , then the total would drop to around 30 billion barrels .
And of this one might , at best , anticipate recovering about half of it .
So that the ultimate resource recovery might be about 50 % , which would mean a total of 15 billion barrels .
The reality is , however , of that ultimate potential resource we are only likely to produce a certain fraction .
It is the value of that fraction that is often the subject of debate , since by increasing the number , without doing anything else , we can , apparently , increase the amount of oil that is available in a reserve .
Well let us say , just for the sake of creating an example , that the amount we can recover is 70 % .
( I am going to include in this the oil formation volume factor that plucky underdog explained .
Then this drops the available oil down to around 10 billion barrels .
Now of this , over the past 50 years they appear to have produced around 7 billion barrels ( adding up the columns in the first graph of the paper Stuart used ) .
Which would give them about 3 billion barrels left .
If they are producing about 200 mb a year , then this would give the field a remaining life of around 15 years – which is the length of time that they say that the field can continue to produce in the paper .
But then , of course , it will be all gone .
And , considering the condition of the rest of Ain Dar and Shedgum , as Stuart pointed out , and the condition of Abqaiq , one may presume that they also , by that time will be out of oil also .
The other interesting thing , that I thought to note in the paper was that while they had drilled some horizontal wells in this field , they had only started to implement their use in water control in 2005 , and the first MRC well had only been completed at the time of the paper and was not yet on stream .
They will be used to produce relatively dry oil from the upper layers of the field , and to mix it with the oil and water coming from the rest of the field through the conventional vertical / inclined wells that go into the area that the water has already reached to maintain the overall water cut at around 42 % .

The Day That Nothing Happened
The Wal - Mart in the basement of my building sells live frogs in a big aquarium , for eating .
I do n't know what surprised me more when I moved here - the frogs , or the Wal - Mart .
Our favorite intergalactic retailer does n't mess around when it comes to creating ' capitalism with Chinese characteristics ' , as a group of Kentucky tourists hunting fruitlessly for American cheese in the dairy aisle found to their chagrin the other day .
The company knows its market ; in addition to the frogs there are live turtles ( plastic bar code tags threaded through little holes in their shells ) , a special hot Peking duck stand , endless noodles and only a small selection of beer and spirits , though you are welcome to down a big shot of Chivas regal from the sampling booth as you shop .
Chinese Wal - Mart has a lot to recommend it .
This being China , any employee handling food inevitably wears a gauze mask and sanitary outfit that gives the deli counter the feel of a level - 3 containment facility .
Other employees are busy out on the floor , hawking bargains or manning the ubiquitous tasting stands in every aisle .
Almost everyone who works at the Beijing Wal - Mart falls in the same demographic - women just barely past university age .
The ' associates ' are required to have a name tag with an English name in addition to their Chinese one , and they pick them from the same mysterious , outdated source of American names that has been serving the Taiwanese and Singaporeans for decades - Mildred , Ethel , Rufus , Crystal , Sea , Sky , Gladys , Happy , Janice , Lydia .
I was heartbroken the other week to have my bottled tea scanned by a woman whose name tag read simply " Lonely " .
People like to say that if Wal - Mart were a country , it would be China 's eighth - largest trading partner , spending $ 18 billion on Chinese goods in 2004 and probably in the neighborhood of $ 30 billion this year .
This hypothetical is meant to illustrate the staggering volume of Wal - Mart 's Chinese operations , but I always get hung up on the idea of a what a sovereign Wal - Mart nation would look like in practice .
It would be a fascinating and creepy place to live - a kind of capitalist North Korea with Bentonville as its Pyongyang , building - size portraits of Sam Walton , obligatory morning song for all citizen - associates , no offensive books allowed , border checkpoints manned by old people and a perimiter fence electrified at night to prevent the suspiciously high numbers of illegal immigrants from smuggling anything out .
Its main import - American shoppers ; its leading export - happiness .
As the excellent Frontline special on the company explains , the opening of free trade with China had approximately the same effect on Wal - Mart 's retail business as the parallel introduction of steroids did on American baseball .
The retailer swelled to enormous size by creating an extremely efficient means of swapping Chinese goods for American dollars .
American shoppers had an insatiable appetite for cheap imports , and Chinese suppliers were able to draw on an inexhaustible reserve of young people willing to work very hard for very little money to supply them .
Wal - Mart became the conduit between these two great reservoirs of cheap labor and disposable income , operating with low margins but at such colossal volume - a quarter of a trillion dollars in sales worldwide - that it became the largest company in the world .
The effects of the rise of Wal - Mart on the American economy have been well - documented .
Still , what on earth is one doing downstairs from me in Beijing ?
How can Chinese people afford to shop at Wal - Mart ( the place is packed ! ) when they are the ones being paid the low wages that allow the company to charge those everyday low prices to begin with ?
The answer is that there are two Chinas - a small urban China that is getting richer , and an enormous rural one that remains desperately poor .
Imagine cities in the United States surrounded by rural Mexico and you have the dynamic .
The fifty - seven Wal - Marts here - with many more to come - are selling to that affluent urban China .
The massive amounts of money flooding in from the West has created a prosperous urban elite within the country ; having saturated their original markets , Wal - Mart ( and its international competitors like Carrefour ) now want to grow more by selling to the newly rich classes their spending helped create .
The engine for it all remains the same - the second , impoverished China , source of the innumerable migrant workers whose labor the whole system depends on .
What makes the situation exceptionally weird is that this is happening in a country that still professes to be Marxist .
And the new Chinese capitalism feels like it was introduced by people whose understanding of it came solely from reading Marx : it is ruthless , exploitative , and contains the seeds of its own destruction .
The only hitch is that the inevitable finale - proletarian revolution - is supposed to have already happened .
In theory , in Communist China , the working class exploits itself .
Out of pure curiosity I took the subway down to Tiananmen square today .
I knew better than to expect any overt acknowledgement of the anniversary , but I was curious to see if there would be any hint at all that something significant had happened here .
It was another one of those wet sponge dust storm days that Beijing seems to specialize in , the stifling humidity somehow leaving the fine sand in the air untouched .
Despite the heat , people were out in droves around the Forbidden City , strolling or sitting in the shade , enjoying their day off .
Tiananmen square is immense , so on a day like this various buildings swim in and out of sight as you walk thorugh the thick air .
The police presence is heavy but intelligently managed so you do n't quite notice the number of people with their eyes on you .
Plainclothesmen , I 'm told , move around as a quick reaction force in case anyone should try to make a gesture , but far more noticeable than any police or soldiers are the throngs of kite salesmen , snack vendors , and people trying to sell you Mao watches for a dollar .
The Maosoleum itself is closed , and a number of monuments on the square have been discreetly roped off , but there is no other acknowledgement that the day is out of the ordinary .
The square is filled with tourists , Chinese and foreign , walking alone or in big groups behind a flagbearer .
The way the government watches this square mirrors the way it watches the country .
Surveillance is discreet but systematic ; you are free to think and say what you like in private , but any public gestures are swiftly punished .
There 's no need for an overt show of force .
In part because of what happened here , everyone knows the consequences of crossing the line .
The deal cut after Tiananmen was shrewd : urban Chinese were offered a path to prosperity in return for staying out of politics .
The results are now visible in every Chinese city , most noticeably in those ( like Shenzhen and the east of Shanghai ) that have sprung up out of nothing in the past twenty years .
They are a direct rebuttal to the Reaganite belief that free enterprise opens the way for democracy .
So far China has proven that if you can grow fast enough , democracy can wait .
During the Cold War , for - profit corporations seemed to be the natural enemies of Communism .
What was a virtue called ' enterpreneurship ' in the West was a crime called ' speculation ' in the Eastern bloc .
But since the Chinese Communist party shed its aversion to business and opened its markets , western companies have found that their interests and those of the People 's Republic are wonderfully aligned .
Both want to create a large Chinese middle class , both want to sell as many Chinese goods as they can to the developed world , and both are interested in maintaining a docile , stable workforce , with none of the hooliganism that marred China 's international image so badly seventeen years ago in Beijing .
China 's bravura reinterpretation of socialism has been so successful that it has caught the eye of other regimes looking for a way to transition out of economic failure without relinquishing power .
Even North Korea is joining the fun , advertising the lowest labor rates in Asia ( $ 30 / month ! ) and what is without question the continent 's most obedient workforce .
So Wal - Mart shoppers can rejoice - the everyday low prices are here to stay .
When the Chinese hinterlands finally get too expensive , there will always be India , North Korea , and even that very retro favorite , Africa , to step in with the human capital .
Economically , we can probably keep the cheap goods flowing for a very long time .
Morally , it might not be such a great idea .
The Chinese government has recently begun to worry about the disparities of income among its population , since this threatens stability , and has announced measures to try and address the growing levels of social inequality .
Wal - Mart , for that matter , has felt the sting of bad publicity , and is taking care now to put some distance between itself and the more ruthless elements in its supply chain .
But something has gone wrong if the Chinese government and Wal - Mart are in the vanguard of the struggle for workers ' rights .
What the migrant workers in China really need is a political voice , a way of getting their own government to give them the basic guarantees of existence that workers in the western democracies fought so hard for at the start of the twentieth century .
But that goes against the deal offered after Tiananmen .
As long as the boom continues , there will be no political change , and so the workers ' own labor is being used against them .
They have become the agents of their own oppression in a way that Marx would have appreciated .
And in a nice twist , their labor is also helping dismantle the working class in the advanced capitalist states that purchase all of their copious output .
China has updated Khrushchev 's old slogan : " We will bury you - in bargains ! "
A big hero of mine , the Polish dissident Jacek Kuroń , wrote in his history of the Polish People 's republic that the one time he came near losing hope in eventual democratic change was during the 1970's , when the Party leadership borrowed billions of dollars from Western banks in order to provide the population with consumer goods .
For a few years coinciding with my childhood , before the loans ran out , people could buy kitchen appliances , a dinky little kind of car , furniture , shoes , and all kinds of other minor luxuries in a counterfeit version of the kind of real consumer boom urban China is enjoying today .
This modest injection of wealth was enough to completely depoliticize all but the most fringe activists for several years , until the loans ran out and the government had to raise the price of meat .
That was the birth of Solidarity .
What brought down the Berlin Wall , indirectly , was a nation of people hungry for sausage .
China is now trying a much bigger version of this experiment , on a firmer economic basis , in the hopes that it can be prolonged indefinitely .
And if rising prosperity can mollify people living in a police state like China , what chance are niggling questions of principle going to have in the prosperous West ?
Those are awfully low prices , after all .
The fact that the Chinese authorities took a number of people into preventive custody in advance of the June 4th anniversary is n sign that the memory of the Tiananmen democracy rallies has n't been completely erased .
But the Wal - Mart downstairs speaks volumes about our own reaction to that day .
On the east side of Tiananmen Square is a giant countdown clock showing the days and hours until the start of the 2008 olympics .
I would not know how to exaggerate the level of preparation taking place in Beijing for this .
Everything from new subway line construction to mass English lessons to an aggressive ( and very temporary ) clean air campaign is under way to make sure the sporting event shows the city off in the best possible light .
This is China 's big coming out party as a world power , the moment when the awkward memory of 1989 is supposed to definitvely give way to a " New China " , open for business and looking to the future .
The entire Western media will be here to document it .
I 'm sure it will be a glorious celebration .
In the book of Proverbs we are told : " Train up a child in the way he should go : and when he is old , he will not depart from it . "
Somehow that lesson gets lost for many families when it comes to teaching children about money -- even though there are a number of government agencies , nonprofits , and private companies promoting financial literacy .
As parents , we know it 's imperative to teach our kids to say no to drugs and alcohol .
But can we honestly say we 're doing enough to help them fend off consumerism and credit dealers ?
I 'm doing my best , but I could do better .
Most important , are you training your children to live off an average salary as young adults ?
Or are they now living so large based on your income that they will be incapable of managing their finances on a modest starting salary once they get into the real world ?
According to one survey , today 's teens expect to make big bucks when they reach adulthood .
But what they know about personal finance wo n't help them live off what they most likely will earn .
That disconnect is part of the reason why there are so many adults in credit card trouble or struggling to manage mortgages on homes they can't afford .
American teens believe , based on the career that interests them the most , that when they get older they will be earning an average annual salary of $ 145,500 .
Interestingly , boys expect to earn an average $ 173,000 a year and girls $ 114,200 , according to the findings of Teens & Money , an annual survey released last month by Charles Schwab & Co. and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America .
While it 's true that adults with advanced degrees earn four times more than those with just a high school diploma , many college students wo n't know how to get by on what they make once they graduate .
" It 's great that teens are optimistic about their futures , but the reality is that these kids will face financial choices and decisions that are far more pressing and complex than anything their parents or grandparents ever encountered , " said Carrie Schwab Pomerantz , chief strategist of consumer education at Schwab .
It 's fine that teens have hopes of earning high incomes , but just in case things do n't turn out as they plan , you 've got to teach them to live within their means .
Nearly two - thirds of teens surveyed by Schwab said they were prepared to deal with personal finance issues once they graduated from high school .
The majority said they were knowledgeable about money management , including budgeting , saving , and investing .
But fewer than half of the teens surveyed knew how to budget .
Others did n't know how to pay bills , how credit card interest and fees work , or whether a check cashing service is good to use ( it 's not ) .
Yet teens certainly know how to spend .
They have no problem using credit .
That , we 've taught them well .
Although 88 percent of them said they do n't like the way it feels to owe someone money , almost a third ( 29 percent ) have incurred debt ( close to $ 300 on average ) .
The survey found more than half ( 51 percent ) believe " it is easier to buy things with a credit card than cash " and , given the choice , more than a quarter ( 29 percent ) would actually prefer using a credit card , a 61 percent increase over last year .
The surveyed teens say they are n't being taught basic money management by the people who have the most influence over them -- their parents .
Only one in four said their parents or guardians are training them about money by giving them a lot of experience budgeting , spending , and saving it .
Your children will have a better chance to live within their means as adults if you spend time while they 're young showing them how to handle money .
Teach them how to create a budget .
You will train your children well if you rebuff many of their consumer demands .
It will be good practice when they 're on their own and do n't have the money to satisfy their every desire .
Right now what many know is : I want .
Mommy and Daddy give .
It will be hard for them to depart from that habit once they 're grown .
As Pomerantz says , " Teens not only want the keys to the world of adult finance , they are actually looking to their parents for driving lessons . "

The real cost to the US of the Iraq war is likely to be between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion ( £ 1.1 trillion ) , up to 10 times more than previously thought , according to a report written by a Nobel prize - winning economist and a Harvard budget expert .
The study , which expanded on traditional estimates by including such costs as lifetime disability and healthcare for troops injured in the conflict as well as the impact on the American economy , concluded that the US government is continuing to underestimate the cost of the war .
The report came during one of the most deadly periods in Iraq since the invasion , with the US military yesterday revising upwards to 11 the number of its troops killed during a wave of insurgent attacks on Thursday .
More than 130 civilians were also killed when suicide bombers struck Shia pilgrims in Karbala and a police recruiting station in Ramadi .
The paper on the real cost of the war , written by Joseph Stiglitz , a Columbia University professor who won the Nobel prize for economics in 2001 , and Linda Bilmes , a Harvard budget expert , is likely to add to the pressure on the White House on the war .
It also followed the revelation this week that the White House had scaled back ambitions to rebuild Iraq and did not intend to seek funds for reconstruction .
Mr Stiglitz told the Guardian that despite the staggering costs laid out in their paper the economists had erred on the side of caution .
" Our estimates are very conservative , and it could be that the final costs will be much higher .
And it should be noted they do not include the costs of the conflict to either Iraq or the UK . "
In 2003 , as US and British troops were massing on the Iraq border , Larry Lindsey , George Bush 's economic adviser , suggested the costs might reach $ 200 bn .
The White House said the figure was far too high , and the deputy defence secretary , Paul Wolfowitz , said Iraq could finance its own reconstruction .
Three years later , with more than 140,000 US soldiers on the ground in Iraq , even the $ 200 bn figure was very low , according to the two economists .
Congress has appropriated $ 251bn for military operations , and the Congressional budget office has now estimated that under one plausible scenario the Iraq war will cost over $ 230 bn more in the next 10 years .
According to Mr Stiglitz and Ms Bilmes , whose paper is due to be presented to the Allied Social Sciences Association in Boston tomorrow , there are substantial future costs not included in the Congressional calculations .
For instance , the latest Pentagon figures show that more than 16,000 military personnel have been wounded in Iraq .
Due to improvements in body armour , there has been an unusually high number of soldiers who have survived major wounds such as brain damage , spinal injuries and amputations .
The economists predict the cost of lifetime care for the thousands of troops who have suffered brain injuries alone could run to $ 35 bn .
Taking in increased defence spending as a result of the war , veterans ' disability payments and demobilisation costs , the economists predict the budgetary costs of the war alone could approach $ 1 trillion .
The paper also came amid the first indications from the Pentagon that it intended to scale down its costly presence in Iraq this year .
Last night , Ayman al - Zawahiri , al - Qaida 's number two , said in a video that hints of the American withdrawal amounted to a " victory for Islam " .
The unforeseen costs of the war have been blamed on poor planning and vision by the architects of the invasion .
In a frank admission yesterday , Paul Bremer , the first US administrator of postwar Iraq , said the Americans did not anticipate the uprising that has persisted since flaring in 2004 .
" We really did n't see the insurgency coming , " he told NBC television .
But the economists ' costings went much further than the economic value of lives lost .
They factored in items such as the higher oil prices which could partly be attributed to the war .
They also calculated the effect if a proportion of the money spent on the Iraq war was allocated to other causes .
These factors could add tens of billions of dollars .
Mr Stiglitz , a former World Bank chief economist , said the paper , which will be available on josephstiglitz.com , did not attempt to explain whether Americans were deliberately misled or whether the underestimate was due to incompetence .
But in terms of the total cost of the war " there may have been alternative ways of spending a fraction of that amount that would have enhanced America 's security more , and done a better job in winning the hearts and minds of those in the Middle East and promoting democracy " .
Reading the Mind Test
This " Reading the Mind " test was first published in the book , " The Essential Difference " , by Simon Baron - Cohen , Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at the University of Cambridge .
It lets you see how well you can judge the feelings and thoughts of people by just looking at a photograph of their eyes .
Most people are actually pretty good at this , women being slightly better than men .
Its clinical use is in helping with the diagnosis of High Functioning Autism and Asperger 's Syndrome ( which disproportionately affects programmers ) but I think it 's an interesting test for just about anyone to try .

The " Reading the Mind test " is a load of rubbish and so are Simon Baron Cohens air - brain ideas , just like his cousin Sacha Baron Cohen otherwise known as Borat !
Both are vastly over - rated .
Did anyone tell the people in the photographs what they were meant to be feeling so they acted ?
Or did the photographer actually use a stimulus to create the feeling ?
In the event of the former , it is n't reading the mind through the eyes if the part is being played out .
In the case of the latter , a stimulus is very dubious .
Which came first : the photograph or the assigned " feelings " to the eyes ?

Oddly , this website and test gives me a great deal of insight to myself .
I have had peculiar occurrences in my life that have left me guessing if there is something different about myself .
There was a point in time about ten years ago where I experienced what I thought to be a very unusual occurrence .
For a short period I came across this looking into the eyes and reading the mind activity .
I never researched this or knew that it was something that was studied .
I thought maybe I was having some sort of mental breakdown , but for a short while I was looking into peoples eyes and thinking that I could almost read their minds .
I could not actually hear what they were thinking but I could somehow understand their disposition .
It was as if I had never looked anyone in the eye before .
Ten years later I have been trying to understand what it was that happened .
I have a brother that I believed had narcissistic personality disorder .
From what I have read , a person with this disorder can not empathize .
I was thinking that I , myself , may have had this same disorder and came out of the disorder by somehow suddenly being able to empathize .
I connected this occurrence of looking into someone 's eyes and understanding their disposition as an all the sudden being able to empathize .
Supposedly , it can be somewhat common for children to have the affects of narcissistic personality disorder and then to grow out of it due to life occurrences .
After reading an article about how many times people with Asperger can be misdiagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder and then seeing this test as a test for asperger I am becoming aware that I may suffer from asperger rather then narcissistic personality disorder .

We Need To Throw Money At Science
Posted by : mutant minds at November 16 , 2008 05:02 AM
A group of organisms that has never had sex in over 40 million years of existence has nevertheless managed to evolve into distinct species , says new research published today .
The study challenges the assumption that sex is necessary for organisms to diversify and provides scientists with new insight into why species evolve in the first place .
The research , published in PLoS Biology , focuses on the study of bdelloid rotifers , microscopic aquatic animals that live in watery or occasionally wet habitats including ponds , rivers , soils , and on mosses and lichens .
These tiny asexual creatures multiply by producing eggs that are genetic clones of the mother - there are no males .
Fossil records and molecular data show that bdelloid rotifers have been around for over 40 million years without sexually reproducing , and yet this new study has shown that they have evolved into distinct species .
Using a combination of DNA sequencing and jaw measurements taken using a scanning electron microscope , the research team examined bdelloid rotifers living in different aquatic environments across the UK , Italy and other parts of the world .
They found genetic and jaw - shape evidence that the rotifers had evolved into distinct species by adapting to differences in their environment .
Dr Tim Barraclough from Imperial College London 's Division of Biology explained : " We found evidence that different populations of these creatures have diverged into distinct species , not just because they become isolated in different places , but because of the differing selection pressures in different environments .
" One remarkable example is of two species living in close proximity on the body of another animal , a water louse .
One lives around its legs , the other on its chest , yet they have diverged in body size and jaw shape to occupy these distinct ecological niches .
Our results show that , over millions of years , natural selection has caused divergence into distinct entities equivalent to the species found in sexual organisms . "
Previously , many scientists had thought that sexual reproduction was necessary for speciation because of the importance of interbreeding in explaining speciation in sexual organisms .
Asexual creatures like the bdelloid rotifers were known not to be all identical , but it had been argued that the differences might arise solely through the chance build - up of random mutations that occur in the ' cloning ' process when a new rotifer is born .
The new study proves that these differences are not random and are the result of so - called ' divergent selection ' , a process well known to cause the origin of species in sexual organisms .
Dr Barraclough adds : " These really are amazing creatures , whose very existence calls into question scientific understanding , because it is generally thought that asexual creatures die out quickly , but these have been around for millions of years .
" Our proof that natural selection has driven their divergence into distinct species is another example of these miniscule creatures surprising scientists - and their ability to survive and adapt to change certainly raises interesting questions about our understanding of evolutionary processes . "

People believed discipline had worsened in recent years
The Teacher Support Network asked teachers about their experiences of classroom violence , and 433 chose to volunteer their experiences .
More than 90 % said they had been verbally abused , and half physically .
One woman was strangled unconscious , another stabbed with scissors and a third knocked out by a thrown rock .
More than a third also reported vandalism to personal property such as cars , clothing and books .
The respondents were sceptical about new legislation giving teachers powers to tackle bad behaviour , doubting its effectiveness without the backing of the local authority , senior management team and parents .
A spokesperson for the support network said three incidents had involved guns of some sort .
The only one on which details were available involved a student showing his teacher a pellet gun , for which he later apologised - " but she was terrified nonetheless " .
The charity 's chief executive , Patrick Nash , said : " Fortunately , extreme cases of violence and abuse are rare and only 2 % of calls and e-mails to Teacher Support Network focus on pupil indiscipline .
" However , for those teachers seeking our support , the effects of violence and abuse can be devastating . "
Some 37 % of the respondents said they had taken time off work due to their injuries or the resulting stress and depression .
Parental concern
In a separate report for the Department for Education and Skills , discipline emerged as " the key education issue " for most parents asked about recent government initiatives in England .
Mori organised eight 90 - minute discussion groups in London and Manchester .
Government proposals to tackle indiscipline found favour but there was a debate about the extent to which parents could be held responsible , especially for their children 's attendance .
' Boot camp '
The term " off - site provision " was misconstrued by many .
" Some believe it refers to a youth club style arrangement for delinquent children and others to a boot camp , " Mori said .
" The latter is preferred in order to drive up standards of discipline . "
A spokesman for the Department for Education and Skills said : " Real progress had been made in tackling serious bad behaviour in schools . "
Behaviour in most schools was good for most of the time .
But Mori 's report said many participants were of the opinion that it had declined over the past few years - with more reports of attacks on teachers and other pupils .
Teachers were also believed to have fewer rights to enforce order .
Google does not render resistance futile David 75 comments Latest by Brian Graves
From the ashes of Kiko , Paul Graham reads that Google is unstoppable .
That all hope is lost when fighting big G on its home turf .
That resistance is futile :
The best solution for most startup founders would probably be to stay out of Google ’s way .
What a depressing conclusion from a man who has inspired so many and gives hope to those who dare challenge the incumbents .
No .
Do n’t run , do n’t hide .
Be different .
You ca n’t outdo Google by trying to match them point - by - point , but you do n’t have to .
There are other , better ways to fight .
Compete differently .
Naturally , all examples are different , but we launched the Backpack calendar late in the game .
After Gcal , Kiko , and many others .
We even dared hide it behind a pay - to - play wall ( starting at $ 5 / month ) .
Guess what ?
Paying Backpack subscriptions are up about twenty percent in just the three weeks since launch .
People are writing us about how they switched from Google Calendar to Backpack , even though they have to pay .
They liked our take on a calendar better .
That does n’t take anything away from Google ’s Calendar — it ’s a fine product — but it ’s not the only one ever for everyone in the whole wide world .
Obviously Backpack is more than just a calendar , so it does n’t perfectly compare , but this example does provide a data point in the opposite direction .
Google does not win by default in any territory it enters .
But even more troubling than the fear of Google is Paul ’s abdication of power :
They tried hard ; they made something good ; they just happened to get hit by a stray bullet .
That leaves the Kiko developers without recourse , predestined by fate to suffer at the hands of the G overlord .
How demoralizing !
Do n’t believe it .
You ’re not governed by fate .
You can react .
Kiko ’s demise is sad for the parties involved , but it does not spell the end of innovation in calendars or any other area
Google might enter now or later .
NEWS FEATURES , political commentaries and institutional reports incessantly berate the sexual excesses of modern teenagers .
“ Reports of young studs ‘ playing rape ’ ... during recess , of 9 - year - old sexual harassers and fifth - grade rapists and sodomists have become too common to pass off as simply anomalous , ” wrote conservative Manhattan Institute researcher Kay Hymowitz .
The progressive Media Education Foundation , which distributes educational videos , warned in “ Deadly Persuasion ” of “ widespread and increasing violence against women ” by young men incited by brutal , misogynist popular culture and corporate advertising .
Evidence supporting the claims of rising teenage sexual violence is seldom offered .
Commentators instead ask , given today ’s salacious ads , slutty preteen styles , women - hating rap lyrics , MySpace.com , designer porn and binge - drinking orgies , how could young people not be “ hooking up ” more randomly , more violently and younger ?
Yet crime reports , victimization surveys and public health measures consistently reveal something else : large declines in the percentages of young women reporting violence against them , especially sexual attacks , and of young men committing rape and other violent offenses .
The U.S. Justice Department ’s National Crime Victimization Survey ( considered our best measure of crime because its anonymous surveys capture offenses not reported to police ) reports that rape has been falling dramatically for decades .
The first survey , in 1973 , estimated that 105,000 females , ages 12 to 24 , were raped that year .
In the 1980s and early 1990s , the survey was expanded to include sexual assault and attempted or threatened offenses .
Even so , the latest survey ( in a young female population 1 million larger than in 1973 ) reported that 30,000 females , ages 12 to 24 , were raped and 60,000 were victims of attempted rape or real or attempted sexual offenses ( including verbal threats ) in 2005 .

The crime surveys further indicate that the decline in sexual violence is greater among younger females than older women .
In the last dozen years , they found that sexual victimization rates among girls ages 12 to 19 fell by 78 % and among women ages 20 to 24 by 70 % , nearly double the drop among women older than 25 .
The decrease in violence is reflected in big drops in teenage rape arrests .
Led by decreases of 90 % in San Francisco , 85 % in Orange , Riverside and Ventura counties , and 80 % in Los Angeles , San Bernardino and Sacramento counties , California ’s teen rape - arrest rate fell by 70 % over the last three decades .
Fewer teens were arrested for rape in 2005 ( 236 ) than in 1957 ( 331 ) , the first year statistics were reported , in a teenage population just one - third today’s .
But can we trust these statistics ?
Rape is an underreported crime :
Only four in 10 victims told the National Crime Victimization Survey that they had reported their rapes to police .
But rape is less hidden than before .
Thanks to feminist campaigns , laws have been extended to criminalize nonconsensual sex with intoxicated , disabled , same - sex and acquaintance victims and other offenses that narrower rape laws excluded .
All this makes the recent declines in teenage sexual violence even more impressive .
Why has rape and violence against women , particularly younger women , declined so dramatically over the last generation ?
Advertisement
Little research exists on this question , and tentative explanations -- from tougher sentencing of violent offenders to pornography ’s effects in sublimating violence -- are not persuasive .
The three - decade decline in teenage and young - adult rape accompanies huge drops in all crimes -- murder , assault , drug abuse and property -- committed by youth .
And get - tough policies designed to imprison more teenagers do n’t seem to be a factor either .
Just - released California Division of Juvenile Justice figures show that fewer youths are locked up today than in 1959 , when numbers were first reported .
The most likely explanation involves impressive generational developments .
In 1970 , women made up one - third of all college students ( versus 57 % today ) , earned about one - fourth of all young - adult income ( versus nearly half today ) and made up small fractions of doctors and lawyers ( versus majorities of new entrants into these fields now ) .
Women ’s rapidly rising status and economic independence in the larger society fostered new attitudes and laws that rejected violence against women .
That younger people growing up in this environment of greater gender equality should show the biggest decreases in rape , while older generations lag behind , is consistent with this explanation .
The youngest teenagers ( presumably those raised with the most modern attitudes ) show the biggest declines of all .
Over the last 30 years , rape arrest rates have fallen by 80 % among Californians under age 15 , much larger than the 25 % drop among residents age 40 and older .

Ultimately , however , sexual violence remains a serious danger .
That is the best reason for rigorously scrutinizing its real patterns and trends ( rather than taking tiresome potshots at “ young people ” and “ popular culture ” ) to learn how to further reduce it .

Lexical Closures
In C
By Hiran Ramankutty
Introduction
/* Sample 1 . */ main ( ) { }
Even if one is an experienced C programmer , a successful compilation of your program in the first attempt certainly brings a sense of satisfaction - whatever the logic behind it may be .
" Hey , look !
The GNU C Compiler has accepted my program ! "
Take a look at the two code samples given below ; these are the two most common methods used by programmers to start coding a program .
/* Sample 2 . */ #include < stdio.h > int main ( ) { return 0 ; }
What is important while writing code is not the caution but the approach - but at times , it is good to be skeptical about your C programs to some extent .
Not necessarily the logic , but the compiler you are using .
The GNU C compiler provides several options for compiling a piece of code ; the more options you know , the more useful ( and the more confusing ) it can be .
I have aliased the GCC front - end cc like this :
alias cc='gcc - Wall -- pedantic - errors - Wstrict - prototypes '
The option -- pedantic - errors helps me make my C programs adhere to strict ANSI standards .
GCC provides several extensions to the C language , which are often either unnoticed or taken for granted due to people 's assumptions .
Here , I am going to give a brief description on one such extension - nesting of functions .
Nesting of Functions and Closures
In the article Functional Programming with Python , a function or a procedure is said to have some analogy to mathematical functions .
If 'x ' is a variable , then we have a function f( x ) which does some operations on ' x ' to give some value 'y ' .
Hence we have :
y = f( x )
The article also briefly describes closures .
A closure is a property associated with functions ; when a function manipulates input and produces output which holds the features and characteristics of the input , then the function is said to possess ( we should say ' satisfy ' instead of ' possess ' ) the closure property .
[ The above definition is , perhaps , less rigorous than it could be ; the standard definition of ' closure ' in programming is a data structure that contains both a function and a set of variables defining the environment in which that function will be executed .
-- Ben ]
For example : consider the set of natural numbers ' N ' .
If x 1 and x 2 are elements in the set N , and the function f( x ) is an addition ( by binary operator `+' ) of x 1 and x 2 then addition has the closure property .
Since sum of x 1 and x 2 is again a natural number , we can say that the binary operator '+' satisfies the closure property over the set of natural numbers .
Programming languages like Python and LISP support nesting of functions .
The above mentioned article explains with an example in Python .
An example for LISP is given below :
( defun foo ( a ) ( defun bar ( b ) (+ b 1 ) ) (+ a ( bar 3 ) ) ) ( setq a ( foo 4 ) ) ( print a )
The function `bar ' is nested and defined inside the definition of `foo '.
`bar ' increments and returns the parameter that it takes , and `foo ' returns the sum of the return value of `bar ' invoked with parameter 3 and the parameter that it takes .
The variable `a ' then is set to :
3 + 1 + 4 = 8
Hence , `a 's value is printed as 8 .
This feature of function nesting is seen in the C language , as an extension of GCC .
Compiling the code below , with the -- pedantic - errors option enabled , will tell you that `ISO C forbids nested functions ' - but the code will compile cleanly without the option .
Check out the code :
/* compile it with gcc -- pedantic - errors filename .c*/ #include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > int main ( ) { void foo ( ) { printf ( " Hello World
" ) ; } foo ( ) ; return 0 ; }
Like local variables , nesting of functions will restrict the scope of the function in which it is defined .
For the above example , the binding of functionis not visible outside .
The association between identifiers and the place to store their values is called binding , and scope refers to the part of the code where the binding of the identifier is visible .
Consider another example given below :
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > int main ( ) { int x ; x = 10 ; { float x ; x = 4.2 } return 0 ; }
In the above example , `x ' has two bindings with respect to main .
But if we remove the declaration float x ; , then the binding will be same throughout .
Scope
Consider a binary search algorithm performed over a list of sorted numbers .
The code can be seen here , in listing 1 .
We can localize the array ' A ' and the function ' binary_search ' to ' main ' if we do n't have any other functions that need to access ' binary_search ' ; an example of this can be seen here , in listing2 .
Now both ' A ' and ' binary_search ' are within the lexical scope of ' main ' ; hence , they are enclosed in the same scope .
Let us define lexical scoping a bit more : Lexical Scope is the scope defined by the structure of the code .
A language with lexical scoping can support function definitions within another function .
With this , the nested function gets access to the local variables defined in the enclosing scope , and is itself visible during the definition of the function being nested .
That is :
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > int main ( ) { int x=10 ; void foo ( ) { printf ( " hello
" ) ; } int y= 20 ; void bar ( ) { printf ( " World
" ) ; } }
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > int main ( ) { int x=10 ; auto void bar ( void ) ; void foo ( ) { printf ( " Hello
" ) ; bar ( ) ; } int y= 20 ; void bar ( ) { printf ( " World
" ) ; } foo ( ) ; return 0 ; }
Here , only the binding of ' x ' is visible to ' foo ' , whereas ' bar ' can " see " the binding of ' x ' , ' foo ' , and 'y ' .
We can now say that the textual arrangement determines the lexical scope .
Now , what if function ' foo ' wants to access function ' bar ' ?
One of the options here would be to declare the prototype of ' bar ' before the definition of ' foo ' .
See the listing below :
Thomas M. Bruel 's paper on lexical closures in C++ describes this as a method to allow definition of mutually recursive functions at inner lexical levels .
Removing the ' auto ' keyword will give a warning message .
Try it !
( Refer to Section A.8.1 in Storage Class Specifiers by Kernighan & Ritchie for clarification and details . )
The other type of scoping is dynamic scoping , in which the active call stack handles name resolution during run time .
To make it more clear , see listing3 .
' x ' in function ' foo ' is a non-local reference , but it is local to function ' bar ' .
The print statement in function ' main ' is also a non-local reference .
If C was a dynamically scoped language ( thank god that it is n't ) , then reference to ' x ' in function ' foo ' would be bound to its definition in the function ' bar ' .
However , C is a lexically scoped language , and thus reference to ' x ' in function ' foo ' is bound to its global definition .
If we run this program , the output will be ' 1 ' , not ' 0 ' .
Now consider the following ( listing4 ) : we have the definition of function ' add ' within the scope of ' init_add ' .
It is interesting to note that ' add ' refers to the parameter ' i ' , which is passed to the function ' init_add ' .
For the function ' init_add ' , the binding of ' i ' is retained ( even inside the function ' add ' ) until ' init_add ' returns .
Now , from the mathematical definition of ' closure ' , the function ' add ' is said to " close over " the parameter ' i ' ; therefore , ' add ' satisfies the closure property over ' i ' , and this is termed a lexical closure , in which the lexical scoping is preserved ( the reference for ' i ' is not overridden by any other local definition of ' i ' - not that there are any ) .
It should be clear by now that lexical scoping provides several advantages .
Functions can be made reentrant and hence the compiled machine code will be reentrant .
Local declarations can be stored in registers ( in an optimized way ) which eliminates the symbol references upon compilation ( an optimization performed by the compiler . )
We are no longer restricted to declaring all variables global ( a very bad practice leading to problems like variable suicide among others ) and passing parameters to every function that is invoked .
Why is there no nesting in ANSI , then ?
Conclusion and Further Reading
I had mentioned earlier that nesting of functions is only seen in C as an extension of GCC .
While it is an advantage to some extent , we cannot guarantee safe access to variables or functions within the lexical scope just because the closure property has been satisfied .
We must not forget that even when the closure property is retained , in certain cases there will be no reference to a variable within the current activation record in the stack .
We have seen what the nesting of functions means and can do to some extent , given the lexical scoping rules of C .
If you are interested in further reading , you should go through Structure And Interpretation of Computer Programs and the Wiki entry on Lexical Closure .

Analog Concurrency : Boarding a Plane 18 Apr 2007
Last week my family and I returned from a visit with the in - laws and boarded a fully - booked Continental Airlines flight at Sacramento Airport bound for New York - La Guardia .
Typical of air travel these days , it took nearly a half - hour to shuffle the nearly 140 passengers on board .
There were crying kids , wimpering animals in pet carriers , amorphous lines , bustling mobs , and a cavalcade of renegades who believe boarding by row number can’t possible apply to them .
From a civilian ’s perspective , this was just one more example of the headache and disorganization we come to expect while being carted into passenger carriers like Guernseys onto a cattle car .
From an engineer ’s perspective , though , it ’s actually an interesting and tantalizingly thorny optimization problem .
The Problem
Airlines allow passengers to loiter and congregate around the gate until the plane is ready to be boarded .
At that point , some flavor of queue is requested by loudspeaker announcement .
Such a queue is necessary because the gate crew needs to serialize access to several distinct shared resources : the boarding pass scanner , the jetway , the airplane hatch , and the aisle on the airplane itself .
If a queue did not exist , either the unruly mob would just jockey for position to get past the boarding pass scanner one by one ( everyone holding out their barcoded passes like floor traders on the New York Stock Exchange ) , or they would simply bum - rush the jetway and deadlock shoulder - to - shoulder at the airplane hatch or have access to their seat starved out by more agressive passengers .
The type of queue used by Continental is a relatively simple priority queue where passengers with a higher priority are always cleared before passengers of a lower priority , while multiple passengers of the same priority are serviced on a first - come , first - serve basis .
The highest priority people in the Continental queue , aside from flight crew and airport personnel , are the first - class flyers and elite frequent flyer members .
The second priority is for families with small children or those requiring extra time to get seated , such as those in wheelchairs or other physical challenges .
The third priority is for standard frequent flyer members .
The remaining peons are assigned lower priorities based on the distance of their seat assignment from the back fo the plane .
Obviously , the aim of this type of queue is not to file folks into the plane as quickly as possible , nor it is necessarily to be fair to all passengers .
Though it nicely meters people through the boarding scanner , jetway , and hatch , it causes some stalls as higher priority passengers arrive late to the gate and a fair amount of contention for elbow room along the length of the aisle .
By not uniformly filling the plane from window seat to aisle seat and from the rear of the plane forward , people get blocked on their way back to their seat while other passengers coopt the aisle to put their baggage in the overhead bins or let a latecomer into their row .
Lower priority passengers suffer a much longer trip time to their seat and are in conflict for limited blankets , pillows , and storage space .
Other carriers , such as Southwest Airlines , implement a different form of priority queue that tries to be more fair to all passengers .
People are segmented into one of five priority levels labeled A through E .
For the most part , it people are assigned a priority upon check - in on a first - come , first - serve basis , though those with special needs may get a priority boost .
Once at the gate , passengers queue up in separate lines reserved for each priority .
Once boarding begins , everyone in A goes first , then B , and so on .
Because Southwest does not have assigned seating , this system also creates significant aisle contention .
Some people like windows , some like aisles , but nobody likes the middle .
So windows and aisles fill up first , with the aisle folks generally having to get up and stand in the aisle to usher through the latecomers saddled with the middle seat .
A Survey of Solutions : From Weak To Weird
As I was waiting in line , I started thinking about how to speed boarding through increasing parallelism and lessening the bottlenecks on shared resources .
The boarding problem looks a lot like a standard concurrency problem in disguise , with issues like fairness , bandwidth , arrival ordering , and resource contention in all of their glory .
Imagine it as a stream of messages that need to get routed as quickly as possible to their destinations .
At various points along the way , the messages get signed , transformed , filtered , and otherwise serialized .
Messages at or near their destination require sorting , processing , and storage .
Obviously , there is a limit to how much performance gain we can get from choosing a different queuing algorithm .
The ideal queue is one that loads the plan from window to aisle , from rear of the plane forward , with no exceptions , no latecomers , no preferred boarding .
This reduces resource contention everywhere except in the aisle while folks load the overhead bins or take a little extra time inching to their seat .
Short of eliminating carry - on baggage or the elderly and infirm , the airlines are not going to make much further progress this way and still keep their customers .
We could have multiple lines leading to multiple boarding pass scanners , but that would just cause a backup on the jetway .
We could make a wider jetway that could handle four or more abreast , but then they would just back up at the hatch .
Similarly , a wider hatch causes a back up at the aisle .
A wider aisle is probably unrealistic , though , since the bean - counters at the airline would want to fill up the extra space with seats .
Thinking radical for a moment , we know that the best we could ever do would be to load everyone at exactly the same time .
Imagine if we preloaded people in a 747 - sized overhead scaffold and simply popped open the top of the plane and dropped them into their seats like a bowling pin setter at a bowling alley .
Not practical , but it ’s clearly our performance upper - bound .
Less radical is borrowing the methodology used by FedEx for loading and unloading cargo planes .
FedEx planes are designed as empty hulls .
Cargo is loaded into wheeled covered pallets whose cross-section is exactly the same shape as the interior of the plane but only about six to eight feet deep .
When it ’s time to load a plane , the handlers simply roll a bunch of these pallets in through the back of the plane like LifeSavers into a roll .
What if the airlines made seating pods of six rows each ?
While waiting for your plane to board , you could find your pod inside the airport , load your overhead bin , sit down and get comfortable .
Once your plane was ready , the handlers would roll your pod and all the rest in through the back of the plane .
The performance boost comes from drastically reducing jetway , hatch , and aisle contention increasing the numbers of paths to seats and by widening the window of time that passengers have to get seated .
How about you ?
Got any crazy ideas how to better board a plane ?
Such good irony .
I ca n’t help but shake my head at the many Christians who are temporarily putting on their Skeptic Hats to deal with a bold claim by a Discovery Channel documentary .
That documentary is claiming that a tomb discovered in Israel in 1980 held the bones of Jesus .
If true , the documentary ’s claim would conflict with the alleged resurrection of Jesus .
[ Note : there is controversy about the resurrection , based upon the original writings from the Gospel according to Mark ]
Ebonmuse , an atheist , has pointed out many reasons to doubt the claims of the television documentary that the tomb discovered in 1980 was the tomb of Jesus .
He concludes :
I believe the most likely scenario is that this is a genuine tomb from biblical times , containing several ordinary people with names common from the time , which has been hyped beyond what the evidence supports by overzealous filmmakers trying to create a sensation .
It is not a magic bullet to destroy Christianity . . .
Based upon the points raised in his article , I agree Ebonmuse .
For those same reasons , I agree with the many Christians who are now attacking the Discovery Channel documentary .
There are , indeed , many good reasons to doubt these claims .
It ’s fun to engage in skeptical inquiry , marching side - by - side with devout Christian believers for a change !
No sooner are they finished criticizing the claim about the tomb of Jesus , though , you can hear many of these same believers asserting , as undeniable facts , all of those ancient “ truths ” of their own religions , those tenuous claims they do believe .
According to many Christians , we simply know that Jesus performed each of the miracles described in the Gospels .
We must not doubt that Mary floated into heaven .
And we are absolutely certain that Jesus never had sex with Mary Magdalene ( I ’ve sometimes heard Believers assert “ He just would n’t have done that . . . ” ) .
All of these claims , however , are based on uncorroborated and incomplete ancient writings by unknown authors , most of were n’t even witnesses to these incredible ( alleged ) events that they report .
Many of these claims conflict with other passages from the same sacred writings .
Often , the claims of Believers are based on nothing at all ( e.g. , what hell is really like , how God deals with unbaptised babies or whether Mary was really one of King David ’s descendants ) .
All of this unbudging belief , when there is legitimate doubt about whether a man named Jesus ever really existed at all –Christian writers completely failed to even mention the life or miracles of Jesus of Galilee for more than 40 years following his alleged death ( see “ The Jesus Puzzle ” and here ) .
Most religious beliefs are based on “ proof ” so flimsy that they would be ( well . . . should be ) laughed out of any courtroom ( for those Christians who , by now , must be irritated with me , consider Muslims trying to prove their religion according to well - established rules of evidence ) .
Yet , we hear constant assertions that the factual claims of particular religions are inerrantly true .
We hear these claims even though miracles seem to have entirely stopped in this age of the ubiquitous video camera .
This irony reminds me of an article by mathematician John Paulos , who commented that we readily admit lots of doubt about occurrences that are recent :
Forty years ago in the full glare of the modern media , John F. Kennedy was assassinated , and we have only a hazy idea of the motivation of the killer or , possibly , killers .
Only a bit more than 30 years ago , the Watergate controversy erupted before a phalanx of cameras and microphones , and we still do n’t know who ordered what nor the identity of Deep Throat .
And only two and half years ago , well into the age of the Internet , the World Trade Center and Pentagon were attacked , and we have yet to learn the complete story .
These ( and many , many other ) examples of our ignorance of the details of recent events do n’t seem surprising .
We ’re accustomed to suspending judgment , to estimating probabilities .
We realize that people dissemble , spin , exaggerate , and misinterpret .
And we know that even more frequently events transpire with no witnesses , and so we ’ve developed an appropriate skepticism about news stories ( and personal opinion pieces such as this ) .
When it comes to events that are ancient , though , it is the doubts that fade away and it is the hazy ( and sometimes self - contradictory ) facts that become ever more certain , at least for those who want to believe .
As Paulos concludes in his article about the Passion of Christ : “ Many important stories of the recent and distant past contain large holes and blank spots .
Acknowledging uncertainty about them requires a braver heart than denying it . ”

[ Final Note : Lest anyone think that I am attacking believers personally , rather than pointing out issues regarding belief systems , please note that I have great admiration for the accomplishments of numerous people who sincerely hold religious beliefs .

There ’s a great collection of stuff about William James here , including the famous paper in which he introduced the concept of the ‘ stream of consciousness ’ .
That idea has been more influential in literature than psychology , perhaps , but James ’ work enjoys tremendous respect among contemporary academics – much more than the works of some more recent thinkers whose ideas are tied to largely discredited theories .
Curiously , not all that many years after writing about the stream of consciousness , James produced a trenchant piece calling for the whole idea to be done away with .
Consciousness , he wrote “ is the name of a nonentity … a mere echo , the faint rumor left behind by the disappearing ‘ soul ’ upon the air of philosophy ” .
A century later , this still sounds a perplexingly radical stance .
James himself rather wearily observed that his view would take a good deal of explanation to make it plausible , something he did not feel he had achieved in a single paper .
I think that ’s pessimistic : the paper inevitably leaves a lot of metaphysical washing up to be done , but there ’s nothing half - baked about the central point .
The best way of grasping what James means is to take his point in a historical context , as the quotation above suggests .
Once , straightforward dualism was the unquestioned orthodoxy : there were physical objects and spiritual objects and a great gulf lay between the two .
Souls basically did the perceiving and the physical world did the being - perceived .
Over time , however , the gulf began to close and the two sides began to get closer .
But although the prevailing orthodoxy became increasingly monist , a distinction was always maintained , eventually boiling down to the difference between subject and object : and that difference is , in a word , consciousness .
Subjects possess this mysterious substance , objects do not .
James calls for a further step towards a purer monism .
There is no substantial difference between subject and object , nor ( this is a little more difficult to accept ) between thoughts and things .
It is all a matter of functional relationships .
He offers the analogy of paint : when it ’s in a tin , paint is clearly just a saleable commodity ; when it ’s on canvas as part of a painting , it represents things , it has meaning , and all the rest .
But it ’s still paint : it has n’t become spooky magic meaning paint ; it has n’t been endowed with the miraculous stuff of subjectivity .
It ’s still paint .
The only difference is that on the canvas it now stands in certain relationships to certain things ( objects represented , people ) which it did n’t while it was still in the tin .
Moreover , says James , so far as thoughts are concerned , are n’t imaginary objects fundamentally similar to real ones ?
People have difficulty in accepting that a fictional rose is really red , or a hallucinatory knife really sharp , but why ?
James is n’t arguing that imaginary objects are indistinguishable from real ones , but rather that they are distinguishable only through a difference in the relations between them : real knives cut real objects , while imaginary knives may or may not cut imaginary objects and do n’t cut real ones at all .
Real knives , we notice , have stable and predictable relations with other real objects – that ’s what their reality amounts to , not a fundamental difference of substance .
Everything , it seems , reduces to experience , and in fact , if we reformulate our view of consciousness in those terms , it ceases to be problematic .
So long as we recognise that it is a matter of relations within a monist world , we wo n’t get into trouble : let ’s stop speaking of it as something in a world of its own .
I think that once you get over the initial strangeness of this view , it seems pretty logical .
But I see two problems .
The first is that James speaks as though the different relations between things in his accoung of the world were more or less arbitrary : as it happens , this thing has the relations which make it an idea or a subject , and these things have n’t .
Surely it is n’t quite like that .
Some of these things have qualities which enable them to enter into the required relations , and others do n’t .
A block of stone does not have the qualities needed to become a subject , still less a thought .
On James ’ account , much of the difficulty and many of the challenges arising from the issues of consciousness transfer to the task of describing what these qualities are : and one may legitimately suspect that the dualistic magic he has banished from his account is likely to pop up again in one form or another when that task is undertaken .
Second , I think there are basic problems in saying that imaginary things can be red or sharp in the same sense as real ones .
What imaginary knives have is the property of being thought - of - as - sharp : but that ’s clearly not the same as the property of being - sharp : real things can have the first in addition to , but distinct from , the second : in fact , they can have the property of being thought - of - as - sharp together with the property of not - really - being - sharp - at - all .
All the same , could it be true that we should do better to speak merely of experience , and stop talking about consciousness altogether ?

Op-ed : Growing up in the Army helped make me a liberal RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday April 3 , 2007 Print This Email
This " Growing up in , or at least amid , the Army helped make me a liberal , " writes Robert Wright , a senior fellow at the New America Foundation who runs the Web site Bloggingheads.tv , in a guest column in Tuesday 's New York Times .
Wright , the son of an Army officer , who back in 1969 " was living in San Francisco , epicenter of hippiedom , antiwar fervor and utopian hope for perpetual peace , " remembers his " family once driving toward the Presidio 's Lombard Street gate past tens of thousands of protesters who seemed to think my father was part of a very bad outfit . "
" I was sure they were wrong , and I still am , " Wright continues .
" In fact , the whole , larger stereotype -- that the military is a right - wing institution , best viewed with skepticism if not cynicism by the left -- is way off . "
According to Wright , " Growing up in , or at least amid , the Army helped make me a liberal -- not because I reacted against my environment , but because I absorbed its values .
If all of America were more like the Army , it would be a better country . "
Excerpts from column : # People think of the Army as hierarchical , but compared with the private sector it's a bastion of egalitarianism .
Yes , the Army 's " blue - collar workers " -- privates , corporals , sergeants -- defer to its " white - collar workers , " the officers .
That happens in corporations , too .
But on an Army base you do n't send the white - collar kids to good public schools and the blue - collar kids to bad public schools .
....
My father said Army people were as fine a group as you would ever meet , and the evidence was on his side .
They were conscientious and unpretentious .
And they can be surprisingly soft .
Good commanders have a commitment to their troops that borders on love , a feeling that in the corporate world does n't generally emanate from the executive suite downward .
( I said love , not lust . )
That 's partly because in the Army , the stakes are so high .
Sending people into battle is n't something a good person does with detachment .
Before the Iraq war , when the Army chief of staff , Gen. Eric Shinseki , testified that the postwar occupation would require hundreds of thousands of troops , he was showing not just prudence but devotion .
He did n't want his soldiers needlessly imperiled .

Die EU - Abgeordneten haben sich in ihrer jüngsten Plenarsitzung für eine offene Informationsgesellschaft stark gemacht .
Mit einer mehrheitlich angenommenen Entschließung des EU - Parlaments zur Umsetzung des Lissabon - Programms der Europäischen Gemeinschaft wollen sie unter dem Aufhänger " Mehr Forschung und Innovation –­ In Wachstum und Beschäftigung investieren " unter anderem ein Signal setzen gegen den Kurs der EU - Kommission , andauernd die geistigen Eigentumsrechte zugunsten der Rechtehalter auszuweiten .
Ihrer Ansicht nach ist das Konzept der " Open Innovation " das beste Mittel , um Investitionen in Forschung und Entwicklung zu erhöhen und die Lissabon - Ziele zu erreichen .
Dabei geht es um das Ansinnen der EU , sich bis 2010 zum wettbewerbsfähigsten und dynamischsten Wirtschaftsraum der Welt emporzuschwingen .
Konkret betonen die Volksvertreter , dass ein " nutzerfreundliches System des geistigen Eigentumsschutzes " in der Wissensgesellschaft geschaffen werden soll .
Urheber - , Marken - oder Patentrechte dürften dabei nicht den freien Zugang zu öffentlichen Gütern und öffentlichem Wissen behindern .
Die Kommission fordern die Parlamentarier auf , " eine wissensbasierte Gesellschaft zu fördern , die gesellschaftlich niemand ausschließt " .
Dies soll durch die Unterstützung etwa von freier Software und deren hauptsächlicher Lizenzkonzepte wie der GNU General Public License ( GPL ) und der Public Documentation Licence ( PDL ) erfolgen .
Für nötig hält das EU - Parlament in der vom Wirtschaftsausschuss vorbereiteten Resolution auch die Einführung eines " integrierten " Gemeinschaftspatents .
Dieses müsse auf " demokratischen rechtlichen Standards basieren " und Teil einer allgemeinen Innovationsstrategie sein .
In dieser wiederum sei festzuschreiben , dass eine Balance zwischen dem gewerblichen Rechtsschutz und der Verbreitung technischen Wissens und dem freien sowie ungehinderten Wettbewerb gesichert werden müsse .
Die Abgeordneten unterstreichen in diesem Zusammenhang , dass der Patentschutz der Absicherung einer Erfindung zu dienen habe und nicht für die Kontrolle von Marktsektoren zweckentfremdet werden dürfe .
Die Parlamentarier positionieren sich damit vorab für die Auseinandersetzung um die künftige Patentpolitik der Union , für welche die Kommission momentan im Rahmen einer umstrittenen Konsultation sowie einer kontroversen Anhörung die Weichen zu stellen versucht .
In der Debatte geht es hauptsächlich darum , inwieweit die weit gehende , Softwarepatente nicht wirklich ausschließende Vergabepraxis des Europäischen Patentamts durch ein neues Streitregelungsabkommen mit eigener Gerichtsbarkeit über das European Patent Litigation Agreement ( EPLA ) gestärkt werden soll .
Die Abgeordneten ziehen hier die Alternative vor , in dessen Rahmen Brüssel über das Gemeinschaftspatent eine wichtigere Rolle beim Festsetzen der Grundlagen für die Patentvergabe in der EU spielen könnte .

Indian business tycoons are increasingly trying to control marquee names like Taittinger Champagne and the Carlyle Hotel in New York .
" India Everywhere " was the slogan of the Indian business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , this year .
But the increasingly common , business - centric view of India suppresses more facts than it reveals .
Recent accounts of the alleged rise of India barely mention the fact that the country 's $ 728 per capita gross domestic product is just slightly higher than that of sub -Saharan Africa and that , as the 2005 United Nations Human Development Report puts it , even if it sustains its current high growth rates , India will not catch up with high - income countries until 2106 .
Nor is India rising very fast on the report 's Human Development index , where it ranks 127 , just two rungs above Myanmar and more than 70 below Cuba and Mexico .
Despite a recent reduction in poverty levels , nearly 380 million Indians still live on less than a dollar a day .
Malnutrition affects half of all children in India , and there is little sign that they are being helped by the country 's market reforms , which have focused on creating private wealth rather than expanding access to health care and education .
Despite the country 's growing economy , 2.5 million Indian children die annually , accounting for one out of every five child deaths worldwide ; and facilities for primary education have collapsed in large parts of the country ( the official literacy rate of 61 percent includes many who can barely write their names ) .
In the countryside , where 70 percent of India 's population lives , the government has reported that about 100,000 farmers committed suicide between 1993 and 2003 .
Feeding on the resentment of those left behind by the urban - oriented economic growth , communist insurgencies ( unrelated to India 's parliamentary communist parties ) have erupted in some of the most populous and poorest parts of north and central India .
The Indian government no longer effectively controls many of the districts where communists battle landlords and police , imposing a harsh form of justice on a largely hapless rural population .
The potential for conflict — among castes as well as classes — also grows in urban areas , where India 's cruel social and economic disparities are as evident as its new prosperity .
The main reason for this is that India 's economic growth has been largely jobless .
Only 1.3 million out of a working population of 400 million are employed in the information technology and business processing industries that make up the so - called new economy .
No labor - intensive manufacturing boom of the kind that powered the economic growth of almost every developed and developing country in the world has yet occurred in India .
Unlike China , India still imports more than it exports .
This means that as 70 million more people enter the work force in the next five years , most of them without the skills required for the new economy , unemployment and inequality could provoke even more social instability than they have already .
A detainee accused of being Al Qaeda ’s Persian Gulf operations chief said in court that his U.S. captors tortured him for years and forced him to falsely confess to the bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole and to many other terrorist plots , according to a Pentagon transcript released Friday .
Abd al Rahim al Nashiri , a Saudi of Yemeni descent , told a military board at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , that he had nothing to do with the bombing of the warship in Yemen in 2000 -- or with any other terrorist activity .
Speaking under oath , he said he made up a long list of Al Qaeda plots and attacks so his captors would stop torturing him , even telling interrogators that Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had a nuclear bomb .
“ I just said those things to make the people happy .
But when they freed me , I told them all , ‘ I only told you these things to make you happy , ’ ” Nashiri said at a March 14 hearing held by military officials to determine if he should be designated as an enemy combatant and tried before a military commission .

Nashiri , 42 , said his U.S. captors began torturing him as soon as he was arrested in November 2002 in the United Arab Emirates ; the torture stopped , he said , when he was transferred from secret CIA custody to Guantanamo last September along with 13 other “ high value ” detainees .
Among them was confessed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed .
In an unclassified summary of the evidence against him , military officials said Nashiri was an experienced terrorist operative with significant military and explosives training .
They said he played an important role in the Cole bombing , which killed 17 U.S. sailors as the ship refueled in the port of Aden .
The evidence summary also linked Nashiri to the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 that killed at least 224 people , and said he is suspected of masterminding the October 2002 attack on the French oil tanker Limburg .
Nashiri ’s hearing was the first time that an accused Al Qaeda detainee in U.S. custody has made such detailed allegations that have become public .
Legal experts said they raise new and serious questions about how torture claims will affect the judicial process now beginning for captives in the Bush administration ’s 5 - year - old global counterterrorism campaign .

Eugene R. Fidell , a military law expert and critic of administration detainee policies , said Nashiri ’s claims -- true or not -- are not surprising because there have been allegations of CIA torture of Al Qaeda detainees for years .
But Nashiri ’s assertions were made during an official U.S. military justice proceeding , Fidell said .
Unless the Bush administration , Congress , Pentagon and CIA address the allegations in some formal way , they could undermine the legitimacy of upcoming military commission proceedings for Nashiri and other Al Qaeda leaders , he said .
“ People knew that this was going to be an issue , and here ’s the proof , ” said Fidell , president of the National Institute of Military Justice .
“ Someone has got to get to the bottom of these allegations .
If there is nothing there , fine .
If there is something there , they are going to need to address it . ”
During his hearing , Nashiri said through a translator that his captors tortured him while questioning him .
“ One time they tortured me one way , and another time they tortured me in a different way , ” he said .

Mohammed , during a similar hearing this month , claimed responsibility for terrorist plots that included the 1993 World Trade Center attack , the 2002 bombings of nightclubs in Indonesia and the so - called shoe - bomber plot to down U.S. airliners .
At his hearing , he hinted that he had been tortured .
But the bulk of his allegations were heard during the classified portion of his proceeding and have not been made public .
Without commenting on Nashiri ’s specific claims , CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said Friday : “ The United States does not conduct or condone torture , and the agency ’s terrorist interrogation program has been implemented lawfully , with great care and close review .
It has produced vital information that has helped disrupt plots and save lives . ”
The military officials who presided over Nashiri ’s hearing , whose names were redacted from the transcript , said they would investigate his claims of torture .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman declined to comment on the allegations but said they would be “ fully investigated ” by the Department of Defense .
Curt Goering , Amnesty International USA ’s senior deputy executive director , said that a thorough and credible investigation of Nashiri ’s allegations must be done before any Al Qaeda operatives are tried .

“ One of the most elementary precepts of the rule of law is the absolute inadmissibility in any legitimate legal proceeding of any shred of evidence obtained by torture , ” Goering said .
“ Although the Pentagon has said they will investigate , given the Bush administration record so far on these matters , it strains credulity that any such investigation would be anything other than substandard , or [ that ] those responsible would be held accountable . ”
Specific details of Nashiri ’s alleged torture were not included in the 36 - page transcript of his hearing before a Combatant Status Review Tribunal ; there was also a classified hearing for which a transcript has not been released .
Some of his claims appeared to be redacted by U.S. government censors , who had delayed the release of the transcript for a week , saying they were still reviewing it .
At a briefing Friday with reporters , Pentagon spokesman Whitman said any redactions of information in the transcript were made in the interest of national security .
At least four U.S. military officers participated in the hearing , but they spent virtually all of their time asking Nashiri about details of the alleged plots and not about his claims of torture .
Advertisement
There is little doubt that U.S. officials will designate Nashiri as an enemy combatant .
At the very least , one U.S. counterterrorism official said Friday , “ There is extremely strong information from multiple sources that this individual was key to the Cole bombing and other maritime plots . ”
Nashiri denied those accusations during his hearing and said he made up the claim that Bin Laden had a nuclear bomb .
He also said he made up Al Qaeda plans to bomb American ships in the Gulf and a plan to hijack a plane and crash it into a ship .
But in several often - rambling comments and answers , he made many incriminating statements .
Nashiri said he knew virtually all of the players known to be involved in the Cole bombing and other Al Qaeda plots .
He said he visited Bin Laden often , and that the Al Qaeda leader gave him as much as $ 500,000 over the years for personal expenses and business deals .
Advertisement
In turn , Nashiri said , he gave much of that to other known militants who probably used the funds to carry out Al Qaeda attacks .
“ But I ’m not responsible if they take the money and they go and fight or do something else ” related to terrorism , Nashiri told the military hearing officers .
Asked if he had ever trained in an Al Qaeda camp or swore allegiance to Bin Laden , Nashiri said he had not .
But he admitted meeting many Al Qaeda operatives while visiting “ the battlefields ” in Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Chechnya and elsewhere .

B ackstage at the Carlos Miele show , all the accents are Russian .
The models are rubbing off makeup , having transformed from Miele ’s glamorous jet - setters back into harried teenagers .
They look skinny but not cadaverous .
Yet after a week in the Bryant Park tents , I realize I ca n’t trust my own judgment :
It ’s already become impossible to see the difference between thin and thin .
I walk up to Nataliya Gotsii , who grimaces when I ask her about new industry guidelines on eating disorders .
Everyone at Fashion
Week makes this face when I raise the subject :
After a year of media coverage criticizing the size - zero model , fashion has gotten tired of explaining itself .
But Gotsii has particular reason to worry .
She was one of the models whose photos have been used to illustrate the controversy — a shot of her ribs was flashed on CNN in order to elicit shocked reactions from celebrities .
“ It ’s all about the Ukrainian models , ” she tells me with frustration .
“ After last Fashion Week , I hear a lot about myself , in the news !
I did n’t come back here for two months because clients refused to work with me .
Me and Snejana and the other Ukrainian models . ”
All of the runway models are thin , she points out , and she wonders why she was singled out .
“ Maybe , some of the girls , they skinny , but they look natural ?
Some of the girls , they do n’t look healthy ? ”
Her mother cried when she saw those pictures , says Gotsii .
But her body was Photoshopped , she claims .
Those circles under her eyes ( and I can see them : pale - brown half - moons ) are genetic — her brother has them , too .
“ Nobody cares , they just take a name and put a lot of shit .
We ’re going out , we ’re having dinners , everybody ’s eating , there ’s no anorexia in this business ! ”
It ’s not true , of course .
A week after our conversation , a perilously thin teenage model , Eliana Ramos , would die in Uruguay , apparently of a heart attack , making it three model deaths in the past seven months .
In August , Ramos ’s older sister Luisel died after restricting herself to a diet of lettuce leaves and Diet Coke .
In November , Brazilian model Ana Carolina Reston died weighing just 88 pounds .
But Gotsii resents being dragged into the debate .
In those notorious pictures from last season , she had worn a white halter top dangling from chains ; you could count her vertebrae .
In a taupe bikini she stood , hands on hips , staring into the camera , a tanned skeleton .
If she looked so terrible , if she looked run-down , it had nothing to do with food , she argues .
Already today Gotsii has walked in two shows , and she has another one scheduled for tonight .
Her first fitting had begun at 6:30 a.m .
Next week , she ’s off to Paris , then Milan .
“ You live for almost one month just about fashion .
Fashion , fashion , fashion — it makes you tired in the head .
In two weeks , maybe I will look tired again . ”
I look at her and try to remember the pictures I ’ve seen .
Does she look too thin ?
She ’s not wearing a bikini right now , so I ca n’t tell .
She looks fine , if a little tired .
And then she looks me in the eye and asks , “ I ’m not so scary , am I ? ”
R aise the issue of eating disorders during Fashion Week , and someone will inevitably bring up that lost , glorious era of the supermodel : Christy , Naomi , Cindy , Linda , the four - headed stompy - legged beast with big shiny hair , the one that would n’t get up for less than $ 10,000 .
Those were the days when models took up space .
They were stars .
They made demands .
And their faces were everywhere .
To paraphrase from Sunset Boulevard , sometimes it feels like it ’s not the clothes that have gotten small , it ’s the models .
( Although , of course , the clothes have shrunk , too , sample sizes dwindling from a 6 to a 4 to a 2 and below . )
These days , fashion people do not talk about models with awe .
Instead , they speak of them with condescending affection , as if they were lovable circus folk .
Again and again , I hear that they are “ beautiful freaks , ” “ genetic anomalies ” — girls born to be bone - thin , with giraffelike necks and the wide , pretty doll faces that are the latest visual sensation .
But there is also pity for the models , who are , many people pointed out to me , basically high - school dropouts , teenagers from poor countries , whose careers last a very short time .
They are infinitely replaceable .
Although top girls can make up to $ 100,000 in a week of shows , the vast majority get nowhere near that ; some of the more prominent designers pay the girls only in clothes .

In the great anorexia debate , models are talked about but rarely heard .
Which is why it was so startling when Natalia Vodianova , one of those great and silent beautiful ones , the Cinderella from Russia , rose to speak at the Council of Fashion Designers of America panel on eating disorders .
It was Monday , the first day of Fashion Week , at 8 a.m .
There was an air of anticlimax in the room , since the group ’s guidelines — released to the media weeks before — had already been picked apart like a chicken sandwich .
Whereas Madrid and Milan had passed rules barring models whose body - mass index fell below 18 and 18.5 , respectively , the U.S. organization presented nonbinding suggestions .
Designers should offer healthy food backstage , eliminate drinking , and ban smoking .
They should stop using models under 16 and should not keep them up past midnight ( a suggestion that made the girls sound a bit like gremlins ) .
The guidelines seemed at once a good first step and a bit of preemptive ass - covering , but even these mild suggestions were unlikely to stick :
Could an industry devoted to unrealistic standards of beauty really recognize an eating disorder , let alone prevent one ?
Already , designers like Karl Lagerfeld were grumbling about “ politically correct Fascism . ”
Things proceeded with muted goodwill for half an hour .
There was Dr. Susan Ice , the medical director of the Renfrew Center , an eating - disorder - treatment organization , who emphasized that these were “ biopsychosocial illnesses ” rooted in childhood and genetics .
Fitness guru David Kirsch pledged to “ educate , enlighten , and empower all . ”
Joy Bauer , the nutritionist for the New York City Ballet , offered workshops to debunk weight - loss myths and teach models “ to eat for increased energy levels , for optimal beauty , for better skin , hair , teeth , muscle tone , debloating — things that I know they ’re interested in . ”
Then Vodianova stood up , with her sad and enormous eyes , her beautiful wide face familiar from the cover of Vogue and ads for Calvin Klein .
She began by quoting Oscar Wilde : “ ‘ To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance ’ — a very wonderful and inspired saying .
But I hope you will agree that no relationship comes that easy .
“ I come from a poor background , ” Vodianova told the carefully vetted crowd of fashionistas and their critics .
Anna Wintour sat to her right , face concealed by the familiar bob .
“ I ate because I wanted to stay alive , and it never occurred to me to think of food in any other way . ”
In 2000 , when she arrived in Paris at the age of 17 , she discovered that her fellow models were obsessed with weight .
“ At first I kind of sneered , thinking that this would never affect me .
But as I began working , I began paying attention to my body shape for the first time …
Eating was secondary .
But I found a lot of new friends who were living the same lifestyle , and things were far too exciting to worry about it . ”
At 19 , Vodianova gave birth to a son and quickly became skinnier than ever , impressing the fashion world .
At five - nine , she weighed only 106 pounds , her hair was thinning , she was anxious and depressed — and she was a runway star with her first major advertising contract .
After a friend confronted her , she sought help and got healthier , adding on a few pounds .
But when she got up to 112 pounds , her agent sat her down : Designers were complaining she was n’t as thin as she used to be .
“ I defended myself , saying it was crazy to consider measurements like 33 - 27 - 34 to be normal .
I think because I was one of the girls most in demand it helped me to be able to forget the incident quickly .
On the other hand , it makes me think that if I had been weak at the time , I can really imagine how it could have helped me endanger myself . ”
The models she had met on her way to the top , she told the audience , were more malleable .
“ They were very young , a lot of them were very lonely , far from home and their loved ones .
Most came from poor backgrounds and were helping their families .
They left their childhood behind with dreams of a better life , and for most of them , there was nothing they would n’t do to live those dreams . ”

A ll through Fashion Week , the models told me they felt persecuted by the media conversation , as if they were being blamed for their bodies .
“ You know , I do n’t sing because I do n’t have the voice , ” said Flavia , 22 , with a sigh .
“ If I do n’t have this body , I could not be a model .
I eat like a pig ! ”
“ I ’m this kind of person who can eat whatever I want , ” echoed Eva .
“ I ’m so happy that I still can eat ice cream and everything . ”
“ There ’s always going to be that one somebody who has taken it too far , ” Sophie told me .
I asked her if she knew of anybody who had .
No , she said .
“ All the girls in my model apartment eat everything .
We stuff our face . ”
But another model , Marvy Rieder , told me she had no patience for that kind of talk .
“ It ’s b.s. , ” she said flatly on the phone from the Netherlands , where she was busily packing for a photo shoot in Zambia .
A Dutch model who has worked to educate the public on the subject of eating disorders , Rieder beat out 20,000 girls to be the face of Guess watches .
Then she came to New York , where she was told that if she wanted to do runway work , she needed to lose weight .
She dieted and exercised , but that was n’t sufficient .
“ I started skipping things .
I was still eating , but not enough , really not enough , and going to the gym every day . ”
Her roommates in the model apartment were eating a can of corn a day , Rieder said .
“ Or an apple .
Or whatever .
And that ’s just one of the things I ’ve seen . ”
I asked Rieder if models are open about restricting food .
No , she told me .
“ They hide it .
By saying , ‘ I just ate so much at home , I ’m not hungry anymore . ’
I ’ve heard it a million times . ”
Why do models not speak out about these issues ?
“ In my opinion , I think it ’s because they ’re afraid of losing work , ” said Rieder .
Sabrina Hunter , 27 , agrees .
I found the gorgeous Afro- Caribbean woman not strutting the catwalk but working the Cingular booth in the pavilion outside .
She ’d left runway modeling , she told me , because the pressure was so intense that it required her to eat in a disordered way .
At five - ten , Hunter was expected to be “ 115 or lower , preferably . ”
After she signed with an American agency , she was given a choice : Lose weight or gain and be a plus - size model .
After trying to gain unsuccessfully , she went the opposite direction , eating 600 calories and jogging five miles a day .
“ It made me extremely moody and depressed .
And I looked it , in the face .
But that ’s how all the models look , ” she says .
Both Rieder and Hunter have known models who are naturally skinny .
But many of these girls are exceptionally young :
A model who is effortlessly flat - chested and hipless at 14 will start to struggle as she hits her late teens .
If she ’s already rising in the industry , she may find that she needs to take more - extreme measures to continue to fit the bony aesthetic .
And that goes double for the new breed of models , many of whom come , like Vodianova , from the poorest regions of Eastern Europe .
For these girls , pressures to stay thin may be a small price to pay for escaping the small towns they came from .
“ One of the interesting things about these models today is that they get used and spit out so quickly , ” says Magali Amadei , a model who has been open about her recovery from bulimia .
“ The era of the supermodel is over , so girls working today do n’t have the earning power .
These girls come into the business young , and they are disposable .
On top of that , people often talk about your appearance in front of you , as if you ca n’t hear them . ”
Such pressures can be the most intense on girls who walk the runway , a job that possesses a strange , Catch - 22 quality .
Models must not distract from the clothes , and yet their chance to succeed is to stand out .
If she gets noticed , a model can grab the big prize — a major ad campaign .
These contracts offer financial security and celebrity , which translates to a modicum of power , although nothing compared with the days when models rather than celebrities commanded the covers of fashion magazines .
“ It ’s a far more complex issue than people realize , ” Suzy Menkes , the fashion writer for the International Herald Tribune , told me .
“ You know , many of these girls were brought up in the postcommunist years on an extremely bad diet .
From childhood , they ’ve not been properly nourished .
That may make them very appealing to designers , but they do n’t start off with a healthy body .
And nothing is simple .
I think it must be incredibly difficult to come from a vegetable stall in the Ukraine and find yourself in Paris amongst Ladurée macaroons .
People have to accept that it ’s a much bigger picture than terrible fashion folk starving to get into frocks . ”
Backstage at Vera Wang , I run into Tanya Dziahileva , who might as well be the younger version of Natalia Vodianova .
She ’s 15 years old and has been working since she was 14 .
She ’s from Belarus .
Vodianova had described herself as wearing “ some kind of pink glasses ” when she began modeling , and I can see that Tanya is wearing them too .
After days of watching metronomic struts and thousand - yard stares , I realize she ’s the first model I ’ve really seen smile .
It ’s not just a smile , either :
She is beaming with excitement , her words pouring out of her like Champagne .
“ The models is models , it ’s not like normal people , you know ?
They have to be beautiful , with good skin , and everything perfect . ”
The girls who got sick , she thinks , “ were just models who were so stupid , to do n’t eat food , you know ?
You have to eat good !
I eat gorgeous food .
I eat sushi , I eat meat , I eat steaks .
I eat more than you , I ’m sure .
“ You know , it ’s actually really nice , that people take care about the models , ” she says softly , when I tell her about the CFDA guidelines , which would ban her from the catwalk .
“ But I ’m 15 years old and I feel like I can do this .
And I do n’t want to stop it !
I do n’t want to stop it for one month , I do n’t want to stop it for one day .
Some girls , you know , they look so young , and so , I do n’t know — I feel that I need to come to their home and help them go to sleep !
But I ca n’t say I feel like I ’m 15 .
I feel like I ’m 20 .
I feel like I ’m 30 !
Because I feel great .
My life is gorgeous !
Who at 15 years old can see all the world , you know ?
It ’s just incredible , it ’s beautiful , it ’s amazing , it ’s — Fashion World ! ”
On Thursday of fashion week , I went to the far West Village to see Marchesa , the label designed by Harvey Weinstein ’s … girlfriend ?
( No one can finish the sentence for me . )
There was no runway .
Instead , the models were perched around the space in live tableaux : one of them balanced on a spiral staircase above a reflecting pool ; others standing in pairs , gazing above the heads of the guests , like a glamorous variation on the Buckingham Palace guards .
“ I was still eating , ” says Marvy Rieder .
“ But really not enough . ”
Her roommates could make a can of corn last a day .
It was awkward , and accidentally funny , to act as if the models standing three feet away from us were mannequins .
André Leon
Talley strode through , gesturing at the outfits , shouting “ You must buy all of these ! ” at a pretty socialite he was steering by the elbow .
A handsome young man walked straight up to a model and looked her up and down .
The moment felt uncomfortably erotic — she could n’t move , he could — but then he seemed embarrassed and moved away , back to his girlfriend , and they laughed .
If Fashion Week is about reinforcing hierarchies , skinniness has always been a way to compete .
Being thin means control and , symbolically , that you are rich , that you are young , that you are beautiful , that you are powerful .
And yet the models themselves , who are skinnier and younger than anyone , seem like the weakest people here : manual laborers with short shelf lives .
And whatever their eating habits , the girls in the gowns attract , like anorexics , an unstable mix of envy , anxiety , and scorn , a cultural response reserved for women reduced ( or maybe elevated ) to their bodies .
And for observers of the catwalk , there remains the nagging question :
Why this skinny ?
Why now ?
Why are designers casting bodies that are , if not actively anorexic , practically indistinguishable from the girls at Renfrew ?
I hear two dominant theories .
The first is that fashion is aspirational .
There ’s makeup ; there ’s lighting ; it is intended to be extreme , not realistic — to inspire envy , by providing a vision of an impossible life the audience member would love to live .
One editor I spoke with wondered if the tiny socialites , the demographic that can afford these expensive garments , naturally prefer to see even tinier girls on the runway , so they could have something to aspire to .
According to this theory , we would all love to be that thin .
The other theory is that the girls need to be skinny because they need to be invisible .
Clothing stands out best when the body is a blank .
And the better the clothes are , the more extreme the skinniness must be .
Certainly , the glittering sacks that many designers are featuring these days flatter only a body that recedes inside them ( like the Mary - Kate Olsen look , these puffy garments have an unnerving resemblance to the extra- large sweatshirts I remember anorexics wearing back in college ) .
“ Models are quote - unquote hangers , ” points out Kate Armenta , the booker for Vogue — although she is also eager to detach her own publication from any responsibility for this issue .
“ Honestly , I have to give credit to Anna , ” she tells me .
“ She ’s always been very outspoken against thin models .
Vogue has never tried to perpetuate that look . ”
( A perusal of the magazine would seem to indicate otherwise . )
But , of course , these two explanations are diametrically opposed .
In the first vision , the models must be thin so people look at them .
In the second , they must be thin so that no one will notice them .
And when I ask the buyers and the customers , they seem baffled about the reason for it all .
“ Our clients are n’t this thin ! ” says Lance Lawson , the owner and buyer for Jake , a high - end designer store in Chicago .
When you see the actual runway samples , he adds , “ it looks like children ’s clothing .
We ’ll say , ‘ What size is this ? ’ and even in the showroom they laugh : ‘ Oh , that ’s not a size . ’ ’’
The truth is , no one really has a good explanation for the change .
The sophisticated fashion observer notes that this is just how fashion works :
The Gibson girl gives way to the flapper , then to the big - shouldered forties girl and her busty fifties counterpart , and on to Twiggy , the eighties Amazons , Kate Moss , the waifs , and heroin chic — and for the past ten years , thinner and thinner , younger and younger , in what can feel like some sort of terrifying endgame .
Celebrity culture has added its own catalyst , that parade of starlets dwindling competitively in US Weekly .
Women ’s bodies have always been theater , and this is just another act .
Fashion historian Valerie Steele wonders if this is n’t the flip side of the obesity crisis : “ As everyone is blimping up , we ’re idealizing thinness .
It ca n’t be separated . ”
But unlike many fashion observers , Steele is n’t willing to acknowledge that models are especially thin at all — or , if they are , that it ’s the outside world ’s business .
“ When there ’s a thin actress or singer , no one says we have to fatten up actresses and singers !
No , it ’s fashion that ’s the whipping boy .
You know : ‘ It ’s so criminal that fashion employs underage girls in the Third World ! ’ ” she argues .
“ Well , so does the electronics industry . ”
That ’s true , of course .
It ’s all true : that gymnasts get eating disorders , too , that Hollywood is also a problem , and why are n’t we talking about world hunger instead ?
But finally , the conversation shrinks to a tautology :
The clothes are on very thin girls , so clothes must look best on very thin girls .
And there are questions it is hard to ask in Fashion World , too bumptious and too basic :
Are n’t clothes intended to flatter those who purchase them ?
What kind of message does this send to young women ?
And , the electronics industry aside , is n’t there something a little creepy about using teenage girls from poor countries to model gowns that get bought mainly by incredibly wealthy adult women ?
After the CFDA meeting , I met with Dr. Cynthia Bulik , director of the Eating Disorders Program at the University of North Carolina , who had come to judge the industry ’s efforts in person .
She was n’t impressed .
“ When Dr. Ice ” — the official representative of the eating - disorder treatment community — “ said that you can be healthy at BMI 14 , I practically swallowed my tongue .
That ’s emaciated !
Did she really say that ? ” ( She did . )
Being thin means , symbolically , that you are rich , young , beautiful , and powerful .
Yet the models themselves seem like the weakest people in the room .
The critics are n’t asking for scales backstage , insists Bulik .
All they want is a yearly medical checkup , something that would combine BMI with an overall health examination , performed by a doctor , not an agent or a stylist .
“ Why not make it a doctor ’s responsibility ? ” asks Bulik .
“ The agents and designers do n’t have the skill set to make the diagnosis .
But they are in the position to say , ‘ You need to have a certificate of health . ’ ”
At the panel discussion , Diane Von Furstenberg told a story about a model who had seemed overly skinny the last time she saw her .
The model called to attend this year ’s casting , and the designer worried she would have to reject her .
“ And she showed up — and she was actually healthy !
I could see it !
What I think happened is that with everyone talking about it ” — the anorexia issue — “ she realized she would n’t be getting a job .
I did n’t address it with her ; she did n’t address it with me .
But I felt so good . ”
It was an oddly touching story — I could hear the relief in Von Furstenberg ’s voice .
She seemed to be expressing fashion ’s deepest wish : that with no one actually doing anything , the models themselves would get the message .
It might even be true : A year of public shaming seems to be nudging the industry toward something , even if it ’s just a matter of token gestures , like putting Jennifer Hudson on the cover of Vogue .
Yet despite the jockeying for blame — Are the agents responsible ?
The magazines ?
The designers ?
The stylists ?— it ’s the models who will inevitably be the fall girls , embarrassing the industry when they go one step too far and become thin instead of thin .
At times , the issue does n’t seem to be about food at all .
It ’s about the discomfort everyone feels when the girls in the gowns become visible , exposing not just their ribs but the strange vulnerability of their lives .
Toward the end of the week , I feel sick of it all .
And the news has turned : Anna Nicole Smith has died , she of the TrimSpa ad reading simply BE ENVIED .
I go home to watch a TiVo ’d Ugly Betty .
Rebecca Romijn is strutting and bragging , having a fantastic time , as the transsexual brother turned sister of the editor - in - chief of Mode .
Here was the cocky strut I had imagined I would find on the runways .
And I remembered back in the eighties , when I thought the supermodels were bad role models .
Who knew I could ever miss them this much ?
The 24/7 Happy Hour .
Be positive , upbeat and perky at all times .
Once , the job of corporate functionaries was to make things happen .
Today , their mission is apparently to keep their colleagues company in the office .
As " How Full Is Your Bucket ? " asserts , " Ninety - nine out of every 100 people report that they want to be around more positive people . "
Every book in the genre enjoins a relentless positivity of outlook .
In the " Tuesdays With Morrie " - like fable of " The Present , " the anonymous " young man " chirps to the wise " old man , " " So , if what I believe and do today is positive , I help create a better tomorrow ! "
In fact , negative thoughts -- as toward the boss who laid you off or passed you over for a promotion -- will not only be visible to your comrades , they " can be harmful to your health and might even shorten your life span . "
If you happen to be downsized , right - sized or outsourced again , just grin and bear your smiley face to the next potential employer , as the happy folks in " We Got Fired ! . . .
And It 's the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Us " advise .
Avoid Victimism and Anyone Who Indulges in It .
People who fail at being positive -- and dwell morbidly on their last demotion or downsizing , for example -- easily fall into what " The 8th Habit " diagnoses as " the mind - set of victimism and culture of blame . "
Avoid them , even though " it 's very easy to hang out and share suffering with people who are committed to lose . "
Poor people , we discover in " Secrets of the Millionaire Mind , " are that way because they " choose to play the role of the victim . "
Avoid them too .
Masters of the Universe .
Being positive and upbeat not only improves your health and popularity , it actually changes the world .
Yes , your thoughts can alter the physical universe , which , according to " Secrets of the Millionaire Mind , " " is akin to a big mail - order department , " in which you " ' order ' what you get by sending energetic messages out to the universe . "
The author ascribes this wisdom to the " Law of Attraction , " which was explained scientifically in the 2001 book " The Ultimate Secret to Getting Absolutely Everything You Want . "
Thoughts exert a gravitational - type force on the world , so that " whenever you think something , the thought immediately attracts its physical equivalent . "
If you think money -- in a totally urgent , focused and positive way , of course -- it will come flying into your pockets .
The Mice Come Out Ahead .
Although the plot of " Who Moved My Cheese ? " centers on two tiny , maze - dwelling , cheese - dependent people named Hem and Haw , there are also two subsidiary characters , both mice .
When the cheese is moved , the tiny people waste time ranting and raving " at the injustice of it all , " as the book 's title suggests .
But the mice just scurry off to locate an alternative cheese source .
They prevail , we learn , because they " kept life simple .
They did n't overanalyze or overcomplicate things . "
In the mysteriously titled " QBQ !
The Question Behind the Question , " we are told that questions beginning with " who " or " why " are symptoms of " victim thinking . "
Happily , rodents are less prone to it than humans .
That may be why we never learn the identity of the Cheese Mover ; the who -question reveals a dangerous human tendency to " overanalyze , " which could lead you to look upward , resentfully , toward the C - suites where the true Masters of the Universe dwell .
地下鉄強風新聞 地下鉄の出入口は風がつよい。 いままでぼくはそれを、気圧の違いのせいなのだろうとばくぜんと考えていた。東京ドームの入口のように、つねに吹いている風だろうと。 でもある日、友人が意外なことを言った。 「 電車を降りてから急いで出口に向かうと、強風に会わなくて済むよ。 」 なにそれ。なんでだろう。そもそも、あの風はどういう仕組みで吹いているんだろう？ （text by 三土たつお ）
風が吹くしくみ仮説 友人にそう言われて、ぼくははっとした。そうか、あの風は電車が起こしているのか。 だとすると、その理屈はたぶんこうだ 。
１．電車がホームに入ってくるとき。
電車が線路上の空気を押してくるために、風は中から外へ吹き出す。
２ ．電車がホームから出ていくとき。
いままで電車のあった場所が急に空になるので、まわりの空気がそこを埋めようとする。風は外から中へ吹き込む。
たぶんそういうことなんだろう。少なくとも無理はないように思う。
でもそうすると、電車が入ってくるときと出て行くときで、風の向きが逆になることになる。そんなのは今まで意識したことがない。 確かめよう この考えは正しいのか。正しくないとしても、そもそもあの風はどんなふうに吹いているのか。どうしても確かめたい。
そのためには、まずは風速を計る機械が必要だろう。以前マイナスイオンを計測したときにもお世話になったニチワさんに問い合わせ、風速計を借りてきた。

NEW YORK - With gas prices above $ 3 a gallon , software engineer Daniel Fry has been commuting to work over the Brooklyn Bridge in a car pool of sorts .
It 's actually more like a convoy — of motor scooters .
" It 's fun to ride in a group , " said Fry , 28 , who joins a group of riders for coffee early Friday mornings before commuting into Manhattan via scooter .
" In a big mass of scooters people look out for you more . "
Fry is part of a growing community of scooter enthusiasts in New York and across the country who are taking to the streets in record numbers with gas prices so high .
Fry fills up the 1.5 - gallon gas tank of his scooter for under $ 5 .
" The funniest thing is pulling into a gas station behind an SUV and seeing them pay 75 bucks , " he says .
Scooter riders are also mobilizing in ways never seen before .
Riders are joining clubs , setting up Internet message boards , and even lobbying city governments for more friendly laws .
One club , the New York Scooter Club , meets Wednesday evenings at a bar in Manhattan .
They discuss mechanics , the relative merits of classic metal - framed scooters vs. the newer synthetic models , and the simple joys of scooter travel .
After the gathering , the members mount up for an 8 p.m. ride around town .
On weekends , they organize day trips out of the city on scooters , first popularized in the 1960s and ' 70s by movies like Federico Fellini's " La Dolce Vita , " and The Who 's " Quadrophenia . "
A scooter boom has been under way over the last few years as the vehicles came back into fashion .
Retail sales in the U.S. have shot up from 12,000 scooters in 1997 to 113,000 in 2005 , according to the Motorcycle Industry Council , a promotional trade organization .
But this spring , the boom has turned into a bonanza , with more and more people realizing that scooters can get up to 100 miles per gallon and can weave around traffic jams .
" The phone has been ringing and recently the calls begin with talk about gas prices , " says Aaron Peterson , manager of Vespa Soho , a Manhattan dealer of the most classic Italian scooter .
Sales at the Chicago - based Genuine Scooter Company , one of the country 's larger scooter dealers , which owns the popular Stella brand , have been doubling annually for the last three years , with even faster growth projected for this year , according to owner Philip McCaleb .
The Stella gets about 90 miles per gallon .
" We are trying to combine fun and fuel economy and three - dollar gas is helping , " McCaleb said .
Dealers say high gas prices have attracted a whole different crowd from the usual fashionable set , who buy classic Italian models .
" I 'm seeing a lot of people from blue - collar businesses , who are paying $ 100 to fill up their vans , " said Nick Mendizabal , owner of Brooklynbretta , a scooter dealership .
" A lot of people who thought scooters were not so masculine are now asking , ' How fast do they go ? ' and ` What 's the mileage ? ' "
Some of the scooter clubs are n't as practical .
The Jedi Knights , a scooter club for Star Wars fans founded in Ann Arbor , Mich . , has spread to more than a half - dozen cities .
In New York , the club recently built a speeder - bike modeled after the vehicle featured in " Return of the Jedi . "
" The Jedi Knights are about taking ourselves lightly , " explains member Gregory Heller .
" We are into ' Star Wars ' and into scooters and that 's a pretty high level of dorkiness . "
On a more serious level , Heller helped organize a charity for fellow scooter riders suffering after Hurricane Katrina .
He is also active lobbying the New York City government for designated parking for scooters and motorcycles , which frequently get knocked over when competing with cars for legal parking .
Heller says he got into scooters after traveling in Greece a few years ago .
When he got back he thought it would be a romantic and efficient way to get around New York .
" It was go anywhere , park anywhere , wind in your hair , " he says .
For others , the scooter is a cheap transportation solution .
But most riders agree on the chief appeal .
" At the end of the day , it 's just fun riding a scooter around a city , " said Jonathan Faulhaber , who attends the New York Scooter Club meetings .

Story Highlights • Scientists release a 21 - page report strongly linking humans to climate change
• Report scientist : Evidence of warming on the planet is unequivocal
• Scientists predict global temperature increases of 3.2-7.1 degrees F by 2100
• Sea levels could rise between 7 and 23 inches by the end of the century
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) -- Global warming is here and humans are " very likely " the blame , an international group of scientists meeting in Paris , France , announced Friday .
" The evidence for warming having happened on the planet is unequivocal , " said U.S. government scientist Susan Solomon , who also is a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
" We can see that in rising air temperatures , we can see it in changes in snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere .
We can see it in global sea rise .
It 's unequivocal , " she said .
( Watch scientist Susan Solomon deliver the grim news on global warming )
In a 21 - page report for policymakers , the group of climate experts unanimously linked -- with " 90 percent " certainty -- the increase of average global temperatures since the mid-20th century to the increase of manmade greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
Fossil fuels like methane and carbon dioxide trap heat near the surface , a process known as the greenhouse effect .
The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon , but human activities , like the burning of fossil fuels , can pour enormous volumes of these gases into the atmosphere , raising the planet 's temperature and destabilizing the climate .
( Watch what happens to our planet when manmade emissions get trapped in the atmosphere )
The report found it was " likely " -- " more likely than not " in some cases -- that manmade greenhouse gases have contributed to hotter days and nights , and more of them , more killer heat waves than before , heavier rainfall more often , major droughts in more regions , stronger and more frequent cyclones and " increased incidence " of extremely high sea levels .
The report noted that 11 of the last 12 years have ranked among the 12 warmest years on record with the oceans absorbing more than 80 percent of the heat added to the climate system .
Add in the melt - off of glaciers and sea ice and sea levels are rising .
The IPCC predicted global temperature increases of 1.8 to 4 degrees Celsius ( 3.2 to 7.1 degrees Fahrenheit ) by 2100 and sea levels to rise between 7 and 23 inches ( 18 and 58 centimeters ) by the end of the century .
( Watch how rising sea levels could affect San Francisco )
" An additional 3.9 - 7.8 inches ( 10 - 20 centimeters ) are possible if recent , surprising melting of polar ice sheets continues , " the report stated .
The group will meet again in April to discuss the socioeconomic impact of climate change .
Defining ' likely '
The IPCC was established in 1988 to study climate change information .
The group does n't do independent research but instead reviews scientific literature from around the world .
The United Nations - sanctioned group was formed by the World Meteorological Organization and U.N. Environment Program .
The group 's goal is to produce " a balanced reporting of existing viewpoints " on the causes of global warming , according to its Web site .
The panel 's reports are influential references for policymakers , scientists and other climate change experts .
Friday 's release is the beginning of the panel 's first major report since 2001 .
The rest of the report is due out later this year .
The 2001 report found that the 1990s were " very likely " the warmest decade on record .
It also said that most of the observed warming over the last 50 years was " likely due to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities . "
The authors defined " likely " as between 66 percent to 90 percent probable , and " very likely " as a 90 to 99 percent .
Renewed concern in U.S .
Friday 's report comes amid renewed debate in the United States .
( Full story )
In his State of the Union address , President Bush called for the use of more environmentally friendly technologies to " confront the serious challenge of global climate change . "
It was the first time he has discussed the issue in a State of the Union address .
The White House has said Bush 's proposals would stop the growth of carbon dioxide emissions from cars , light trucks and sport utility vehicles within 10 years .

Cognitive behavior and social networks seem to have been altered as larger , more complex insect societies ( insect 2.0 ) , such as ants , evolved from smaller , simpler ones ( insect 1.0 ) .
Researchers headed by Sean O'Donnell , a University of Washington associate professor of psychology , found that a key region in the brains of a primitively social paper wasp is better developed in dominant females than in subordinate ones .
" This finding , the first of its kind , contrasts with most of the prior work on social insect brain development .
Earlier studies , including one of ours , were done on highly social species with large colony sizes .
Among these species , age plays an important role in task performance and workers that leave the nest to forage generally have better - developed brains , " he said .
" We found the opposite pattern with a primitively social wasp .
Here , the stay - at - home dominant females had better brain development .
In this species , direct dominance interactions among the females dictate task performance .
Dominance and social interactions were more important than foraging tasks in explaining brain development .
"
In the new study , O'Donnell and colleagues from the University of Texas studied the brain development of the primitively social wasp Mischocyttarus mastigophorus in the tropical cloud forest near Monteverde , Costa Rica .
These wasps live in colonies ranging in size from a handful to several dozen individuals where the division of labor is governed by aggression .
The researchers examined an area of the insects ' brain called the mushroom bodies .
There is one mushroom body on top of each hemisphere of the wasp brain and these structures have a vague resemblance to the cerebrum in human and other vertebrates .
The researchers were particularly interested in the calyx , a part of the mushroom body where neural connections are made .
The researchers collected and marked individuals including the queens from seven wasp nests , and observed their behavior .
Later these individuals were recaptured and their brains were examined .
Data showed that calyces were larger among the queens and the stay - at - home females .
This is the opposite of what a number of researchers have found among highly social species with large colonies sizes .
Several years ago , O'Donnell and his UT collaborators found that among Polybia aequatorialis , a highly social wasp that also lives in the same region of Costa Rica , there is more individual work specialization and individuals take on a sequence of jobs as they age .
In such highly social species , workers that leave the nest to forage generally have better - developed brains .
" It seems pretty clear that primitively social colonies were the ancestral condition and that highly social colonies developed and evolved from them , said O'Donnell .
He added that what is intriguing is that the pattern of brain development found in Polybia , a highly social group of wasps , is the same as in honey bees , another highly social insect .
" This shows that what job you do puts pressure on brain development in the highly social species , " he said .
" In contrasts , status seems to be the major brain demand in the primitively social species .
This research suggests that task behavior and brain development has changed in a fundamental way between primitively social and the larger more complex social insect colonies .
"
The work is important because O'Donnell said social insects are a great model for understanding the design of brains and the relationship between brain design and social complexity .
" And it has implications for human society because the evolution of our own society may affect brain development .
Social behavior places pretty heavy demands on the human brain . "
Here 's a classic Rumsfeldism : " We do have a saying in America : if you 're in a hole , stop digging ... erm , I 'm not sure I should have said that . "
In Part 2 of his historical excavation of the life and world of Donald Rumsfeld ( not to speak of the worlds of both President Bushes , the neocons , the U.S. military , the GOP , and an indolent media ) , Roger Morris , already deep in that hole , just keeps digging away .
In doing so , he offers us the rest of Rumsfeld 's long march to power , his lasting legacies , and the costly lessons of this comeback kid .
So much that went unheeded in the years in which Rumsfeld once again scaled the heights of power is now , thanks to Morris , compactly on the record .
" The absence of evidence is not necessarily the evidence of absence " is another infamous Rumsfeldism .
How true .
And in Rumsfeld 's absence , the evidence of how he changed our world for the worse will be with us to consider for years to come .
So , if you missed it , check out " Sharp Elbows , " the first part of " The Undertaker 's Tally , " and then settle in for the sequel , the one you thought you knew until you read " The Power and the Glory . "
Read it and remember , the bell tolls for thee .

" A blindly harmful stopcock , " one medical journal called the remedy , which could be poisonous to infants only slightly above Searle 's recommended dosage .
Even taken according to directions , Lomotil was known to mask dangerous dehydration and cause a lethal build - up of fluids internally .
Having advertised the medicine as " ideal for every situation , " Searle did not undertake a cautionary labeling change until the end of 1981 , nearly five years into Rumsfeld 's tenure , and then only when threatened with damaging publicity by children 's advocacy groups .
Part of the vast outrage of multinational " pharmas " exploiting the Third World , the company under Rumsfeld would , like the more publicized Upjohn with its Depo - Provera , be implicated in widespread bribery of officials ( and others ) in poorer countries to promote the sale of oral contraceptives which had been found unsafe for American or European women .
In the documented version of reality , derived from litigation and relatively obscure investigations in the U.S. and abroad , Searle turned out to enjoy its notable rise less thanks to Rumsfeldian innovative managerial genius than to old - fashioned reckless marketing of pharmaceuticals already on the shelf and the calling in of lobbying " markers " via its well - connected Republican CEO .
And over it all wafted the distinctive odor of corrupt practices .
A case in point was Searle 's anti-diarrhea medicine Lomotil , sold ever more widely and profitably internationally ( in industry terms " dumped " ) -- especially in Africa in the late 1970s -- despite the company 's failure to warn of its potentially dire effects on younger children .
The legend went this way : Political prodigy slashes payroll 60 % , turns decrepit loser into mega - profit - maker , earns industry kudos and multiple millions .
In looking at men of prominence like Rumsfeld who revolve in and out of the private sector , the Washington media almost invariably adopts the press - release or booster business - page version of events from what inside - the - Beltway types call " the real world . "
In Rumsfeld 's case , behind the image of corporate savior lay a far more relevant and ominous history .
In 1976 , when Jimmy Carter took the Presidency from Gerald Ford , outgoing Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld went off to seek corporate wealth as head of G.D. Searle , a Skokie pharmaceutical company .
His period running the business , inherited by the family of his North Shore friend and early backer Dan Searle , would become part of Rumsfeld 's legend of success as a master manager , negligently accepted as fact by the media and Congressional representatives at his 2001 confirmation hearings .
But Searle 's magic potion , concocted well before Rumsfeld 's arrival , was to be the controversial artificial sweetener aspartame , marketed under the trade name NutraSweet .
By 1977 , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) had staunchly refused to approve aspartame for some 16 years , finding test data dubious or inconclusive and fearing that potential long - term dangers might prove prohibitive .
As Rumsfeld took over in Skokie , the FDA was taking the rare step of recommending to Justice Department prosecutors that a grand jury investigate the company 's applications for FDA approval for " willful and knowing failure to make reports concealing material facts and making false statements " in connection with the statutory application process required by law and FDA standards .
Over the next four years , federal regulators held firm against Searle 's heavily financed campaigns .
Only with Reagan 's election in 1980 did fix and favor supplant science and the public interest .
Having campaigned for the new president and been named to his transition team , Rumsfeld told his Searle sales force , according to later testimony , that " he would call in all his markers and that no matter what , he would see to it that aspartame would be approved "
The sequel would be a classic of the genre : Searle 's reapplication to the FDA the day Reagan was inaugurated ; the prompt appointment of an agreeable FDA commissioner who would later go to work for Searle 's public relations firm for $ 1,000 a day ; further questionable , company - commissioned tests with more doubts by FDA scientists but approval of aspartame nonetheless ; a later plague of health problems but by then vast profits throughout the corporate food economy followed by lavish , multi-company contributions to Congressional committee members to stifle any outcry ; eventually , a $ 350 million class - action suit alleging racketeering , fraud , and multiple abuses centering on Rumsfeld , who meanwhile had become gloriously rich from aspartame and the $ 2.7 - billion sale of Searle to Monsanto in 1985 .
In his return to the Pentagon in 2001 , he would go duly unscathed by any of the company 's history .
By the time litigation would be filed , the United States was already 18 months into the occupation of Iraq .
Envoy
As it was , despite his business conquests , Rumsfeld missed an even greater prize .
He had been on a short list to become Ronald Reagan 's running mate in the 1980 presidential campaign when the candidate unexpectedly reached for his defeated primary rival ( and Rumsfeld nemesis ) George H.W. Bush .
While , over the next 12 years , Bush went on to the vice - presidency and presidency , and Jim Baker -- equally detested by Rumsfeld -- went along with his patron to White House staff and cabinet power , Rumsfeld would build his Searle fortune and bide his time .
The one exception to his involuntary Reagan - era exile from government would be a stint in 1983 - 1984 as special presidential envoy to the Middle East .
He would be sent to arrange U.S. support for Saddam Hussein's Iraq in its war with the hated Iranians of Ayatollah Khomeini , a role little noticed at the time which nonetheless produced the notorious photo of Rumsfeld shaking hands with the Iraqi dictator .
The deeper story was far more embarrassing than any simple handshake .
Most of the relevant records on Rumsfeld 's several - month assignment are still classified , though it is clear that , as at the Office of Equal Opportunity ( OEO ) , he took on his mission with a passion .
He worked to shower on Saddam ( in a manner as unnoticed as possible ) an infamous flow of intelligence , financial credits , and sensitive materials and technology that would come to underpin Iraqi chemical and bacteriological warfare programs , leading to hideous gas attacks on Shia dissidents and Kurds as well as the Iranian forces .
In general , Rumsfeld put his shoulder to the wheel to shore up the war - worn Ba'athist regime that had attacked Iran in 1980 .
In this mid-1980s de facto alliance with Saddam , as in much else , Rumsfeld was never alone .
He was joined in this pro-Iraqi tilt in the Middle East by President Reagan , Vice President Bush , Secretary of State George Shultz , Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger , National Security Advisors William Clark and Robert McFarlane , and a number of still obscure men like Paul Wolfowitz at State , Colin Powell , then Weinberger 's aide at the Pentagon , and Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle , not to speak of his zealot acolyte assistant Douglas Feith ( who would return in a pivotal post under Rumsfeld in 2001 ) as well as Bill Casey and Robert Gates at the CIA , among other officials .
Their gambit was , in turn , backed by Senators and Congressmen in both parties who were briefed on Rumsfeld 's mission and obligingly shunned oversight of the manifold aspects of the sometimes illegal collusion with the Iraqis .
Their dereliction was assured , in part , by the general animus toward Iran on a Capitol Hill then effectively controlled by the Republicans , and increasingly under the bipartisan influence of the growing Israeli lobby and its Tel Aviv handlers .
The lobby quietly , cynically pushed both for Reagan administration aid to Iraq and for covert arms - dealing with Iran ( later exposed in the Iran - Contra scandal ) , viewing the ongoing no -winners carnage of two Islamic states as a boon .
All this went on largely unreported , given the customary media diffidence or indolence on national security issues .
Historically , the moral outrage and far - reaching political folly of Washington 's furtive arming of one tyranny to bleed another , with untold casualties on each side ( including the murderous suppression of would - be democrats in both countries ) , would belong at the doorstep of Reagan 's reactionary regime and the Washington foreign - policy establishment as a whole .
Rumsfeld 's role was instrumental and in some respects crucial , but only part of the larger disgrace .
At the same time , in the intelligence briefings he received as the first ranking U.S. official to go to Iraq since the Baghdad Pact of the 1950s , he would have been uniquely aware , as no other senior figure in Washington , of the brutal character of Saddam Hussein 's regime and , in particular , the sectarian , regional , tribal , and clan politics that lay behind it .
The Ba'athists were a government , after all , that the CIA itself had helped to recruit and install in the coup of 1963 , reinstalled in 1968 when the Agency 's original clients lost control , and then watched closely while Baghdad had a flirtation ( involving an arms - supply relationship ) with the feared Russians ( whose influence the bloody 1963 coup was supposed to counter ) .
This was particularly true in the aftermath of the Arab - Israeli War of 1973 with its peace agreements from which Iraq emerged as a principal remaining challenge to Israel .
By 1983 - 1984 , the volatile , complex currents of Iraq 's political culture , Saddam 's essentially family and clan rule , and the now crude , now subtle layering of Sunni and Shia in the Ba'athist bureaucracy and plutocracy , as well as the wartime distrust and savage repression of a suspect , subordinate Shia majority , were well known to outside intelligence agencies as well as scholars and journalists .
The CIA , DIA and State Department Bureaus of Near Eastern Affairs and Intelligence and Research -- and certainly Rumsfeld as presidential envoy -- also had reason to understand much about Saddam 's grandiose ambition , in Iraq 's old rivalry with Egypt , to lead a pan -Arab nationalist renaissance to some kind of future parity with Israel 's nuclear - armed military might .
In addition to the usual extensive intelligence - sharing with Israel 's Mossad , less than two years before Rumsfeld 's Iraq mission CIA operatives had literally lit the way for Israeli F - 16 fighter bombers in their June 1981 surprise attack on Saddam 's fledgling nuclear reactor at Osiraq .
They planted guidance transmitters along the low - level flight path under Jordanian and Iraqi radar to the point of painting the target with lasers .
The Agency and Mossad then watched as the Iraqis dauntlessly , defiantly began to rebuild and expand their nuclear program .
From some 400 scientists and technicians with $ 400 million in funding , that program would grow to perhaps 7,000 scientists and technicians with as much as $ 10 billion at their command , some of which was indirectly made possible by the bounty Rumsfeld carried to Baghdad in the mid-1980s
For anyone dealing seriously with these issues , there could have been little doubt that Saddam would use the considerable aid and trade Rumsfeld was sliding his way under the table to mount a better - armed , more bloody war on Iran , to further the regime 's most ambitious dreams of weapons development , and to tyrannize all the more savagely potentially rebellious Iraqi Shiites and Kurds .
As Washington watched , he did all of that -- and no one could have been less surprised than Rumsfeld himself .
Long afterward , as some of the ugly essence of his mission to Baghdad dribbled out amid the ruins of Bush 's Iraqi occupation , Rumsfeld would be faulted for pandering to , and appeasing , Saddam ( whose gassing of the Kurds had already begun ) -- in the wake of a single , timorous , hypocritical statement issued in Washington in March 1984 criticizing his use of chemical weapons .
The actual toll of the policy to which he was integral would prove so much higher as time passed .
Iraqi chemical weapons plants bombed in the 1991 Gulf War released agents to which some 100,000 American troops were exposed .
The infamous Gulf War Syndrome might even be traced in some measure to the U.S. credits , materiel , and technology Rumsfeld knowingly conveyed seven years before .
So , too , of course , could Saddam 's brutal 1980s repression of the Shia , underlying the sectarian animus and resolve for vengeance and dominance by the U.S. - installed Shia regime after 2003 that shaped Rumsfeld 's , and America's , historic failure in Iraq .
Others colluded at every turn in the long scandal of policy toward Iraq .
Colin Powell , then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , and Dick Cheney , as Secretary of Defense during the First Gulf War , would , for instance , be directly complicit in the Syndrome outrage .
Yet none of the participants in the larger post - 9/11 disaster was more directly responsible than Rumsfeld .
While Reagan 's special envoy was , with his usual energy and sharp elbows , dickering with the Iraqis in the mid-1980s , Condoleezza Rice was an assistant professor of no scholarly distinction at Stanford ; Cheney a third - term congressman from Wyoming squirming up the House leadership ladder ; future viceroy of Baghdad L. Paul " Jerry " Bremer moving from State Department clerk and Alexander Haig protégé to lavish - party giving ambassador to the Netherlands ; and George W. Bush , still by his own account given to " heavy drinking , " absorbed in changing the name of his chronically failed Arbusto Energy oil company to Bush Exploration .
Waiting Game
By 1987 , Rumsfeld was flexing his muscles once more , preparing for the ultimate goal , assembling money and party support for a presidential run against George H. W. Bush in 1988 .
But after a dozen years out of office , and against the entrenched power of an heir apparent , he would soon enough discover that backing just was not there .
Off more recent prominence and with a wider political base , Cheney would try to mount his own presidential campaign in the early 1990s , only to meet the same bitter rejection .
Historians will only guess at the rancor building in these two deeply ambitious , deeply disappointed figures at the president they had , George W. Bush , whom they no doubt saw as manifestly , maddeningly inferior .
The Rumsfeld - Cheney recompense , at vast cost to the nation and world , would be their fierce seizure of power after September 11 , 2001 .
Rumsfeld spent the 1990s again in business , becoming CEO of General Instruments , then Chairman of Gilead Sciences Pharmaceuticals , with another history reminiscent of Searle .
In 1990 , he joined the board of ABB , a Swedish - Swiss conglomerate that had gobbled up companies in the latter 1980s , including Westinghouse energy operations , and would move aggressively to win a $ 200 - million contract for " the design and key components " for light - water nuclear reactors in North Korea .
Rumsfeld pursued this prize even while chairing a Congressional commission on missile threats that found a " clear danger " for the future from Pyongyang .
In the alarming report , his otherwise fulsome résumé failed to mention that he was an ABB director .
In 1996 , he took leave from Gilead to become chief foreign policy advisor , along with Wolfowitz , in Robert Dole 's failed presidential run .
He would end as the campaign 's eighteen - hour - a - day manager .
By 1997 , amid the full - scale takeover of the Washington GOP by the long - churning cabal of neoconservatives , he joined Cheney and Wolfowitz on a Newt Gingrich - instigated Congressional Policy Advisory Board to shape attacks on the second Clinton Administration .
In January 1998 , he signed the celebrated letter so publicly sent to Clinton from the right - wing , Israeli lobby - dominated Project for a New American Century .
Alongside Wolfowitz , Perle , and others soon to be key players in the younger Bush 's regime , he vigorously urged the " removal " of Saddam .
In July 1998 , there followed the " Rumsfeld Commission " report on missile threats , wildly claiming , in an unnamed debut of the " axis of evil " drawn from the testimony and staff work of right - wing ideologues , that Iran , Iraq , and North Korea would each be able to " inflict major destruction " on the U.S. by 2002 .
Through it all , including the first seven - and - a- half months of their rule after the seamy election of 2000 , there would be no trace of the actual danger that erupted out of a September morning sky in 2001 .
Though he had repaired surface relations with the Bushes , Rumsfeld took no major role in the 2000 race .
In any case , the elder Bush had erased him from his son's list of possible running mates , while ultimately waving through Cheney , whose reactionary animus had been relatively well masked at the Pentagon in 1989 - 92 .
When , post- election , Cheney vetoed Governor Tom Ridge for the Pentagon , and there were throbbing neocon fears that a cosmetic Powell , bureaucrat at heart , would be far too equivocal at the State Department , Rumsfeld would be Cheney's , and so Bush 's , antidote .
His appointment was a mark of the extreme poverty of Republican talent the administration reflected so graphically .
The supposed party of national security , having held the White House for five of the last eight terms and dominated Congress for much of the previous 30 years , had no serious alternative to a man who had perched atop the Pentagon a full quarter - century before .
Apart from the patently right - wing , widely discredited missile panel he had chaired , Rumsfeld had shown no palpable interest or competence in the ever more complex defense issues accumulating since then , much less the rapidly changing politics of the post - Cold War world .
Nonetheless , fit , relatively youthful at 69 , he strode again into the E - Ring .
There was speculation that the old Halloween Massacre goal was still there , that Cheney , with his uncertain health , might step aside in 2004 , that the undertaker might yet reach the Oval Office .
Mastery
Rumsfeld began his Pentagon reprise by seizing on a dead Russian marshal and an octogenarian Washington bureaucrat few had ever heard of .
Like Osama bin Laden , steely - haired Nikolai Ogarkov first came to light during the Soviet war in Afghanistan .
In 1977 , at 50 , he had become a prodigal chief of the Soviet General Staff .
In that superannuated , medal - mummified company , he proved a dynamic , technically inclined , forward - thinking young general .
Over the ensuing years , he would be an impressive Moscow spokesman on arms control , and defend stubbornly , even abjectly , the 1983 shooting down of a civilian Korean Airlines 747 that had veered into Soviet air space .
Ogarkov would fall from power in a 1984 Kremlin struggle over weapons spending , write a valedictory book warning of American militarism , and die in post -Soviet obscurity in 1994 .
But his main , if esoteric , historical distinction would lie in a slight 1982 pamphlet in which he blamed the early , nearly lethal Russian defeats in World War II on a failure to adapt to the new German blitzkrieg concepts in tank warfare .
Recent U.S. advances in weapons technology , he argued , could leave the Russians similarly vulnerable if they did n't adapt quickly enough .
Sweeping changes in tactics and arms as well as more agile , responsive armed forces were needed to face the American challenge , the Marshal advised .
Otherwise , Soviet forces would fall into a series of devastating traps on a future remote - targeted battlefield in which the enemy would utilize the latest computerized surveillance and information systems in a new form of high - tech warfare .
His vision soon gained vogue as much in Washington as amid the stultified upper reaches of the Soviet military of the early 1980s .
It was grandly christened -- and welcomed by Pentagon aficionados -- as the " Revolution in Military Affairs " or , in that acronym - laden world , RMA .
There was a certain banality to Ogarkov 's stress on technology .
That a fighting force should be best attuned to the battlefield and adversary of the moment -- modern , adaptable , quick , and informed -- should have been self - evident , on the order of the bloody lesson 80 years before of the Tsarist cavalry charging entrenched machine guns in the Russo - Japanese War .
Yet however obvious the premise , the RMA concept -- transported to the Pentagon and put in the context of an onrushing generation of electronic warfare , of near - nuclear effects with non-nuclear means , along with Ogarkov 's call for fresh tactics ( and thus new weaponry and higher spending ) -- was taken up by innovators , opportunists , and their assorted hybrids on both sides of the Cold War .
This was particularly so among the Soviets , whose rusty Europe - heavy military was already being shaken and bled in Afghanistan by the Mujahideen -- in 1982 - 1983 , despite ample Saudi money , still only partially armed by their cynical CIA , Pakistani , and Chinese handlers .
At any rate , Ogarkov 's truism was also grist for the Pentagon 's back - ring band of civilian military " theorists , " career bureaucrats ever in search of a mission and occupationally disposed to attribute evil genius -- requiring a suitable Washington budgetary response -- to the Red Menace .
Short , bald , and with stylishly severe wire - rimmed glasses , Andrew Marshall was a Dickensian clerk of a man who took up the bureaucratic cudgel RMA represented and brought it down inside the Pentagon .
An economist by training , he had begun at RAND as an analyst in the late 1940s , when Rumsfeld was still in New Trier High School .
Marshall was archetypical in the career - making fear and folly of the U.S. - Russian mirror - image rivalry .
He had been a protégé of think - the - unthinkable , World War III theorist Herman Kahn , and then , via Henry Kissinger 's mentor Fritz Kraemer , had gone to work for Kissinger at the National Security Council ( NSC ) in the first Nixon term .
In 1973 , he moved on to the Pentagon where he presided over his own obscure nest , the Office of Net Assessment , from Rumsfeld I to II , while gradually gaining the reputation of resident genius of new war methods .
Discreet guru to reactionaries , ignored but thought untouchable by Democrats when in power , Marshall looked on as the Joint Chiefs not only spied on Kissinger 's arms control negotiations with the Russians , but also played an ardent supporting role in Nixon 's fall .
He subsequently signed on to Rumsfeld I 's denial of defeat in Vietnam and then , on RMA 's advent , used the concept to evoke ominous fears of a new Kremlin military prowess , justifying the orgy of Pentagon spending that took place during the Reagan era .
( Ironically , of course , Ogarkov in 1982 was arguing for a Russian response to a still largely prospective American escalation of weaponry and warfare . )
While the U.S. armaments spree of the 1980s paid for some new RMA developments , most of the expenditures fit snugly within the corrupt , obtuse old Cold War system , with America 's armed forces tailored to a lumbering Soviet threat in Europe , and no serious anticipation of the neo- insurgency wars that actually lay ahead .
As Marshall toyed with " flexibility " -- and the Joint Chiefs cherry - picked his conjuring of Moscow 's might for their own budgetary purposes , while ignoring the real import , and limits , of RMA -- the Cold War ended in the equivocations and evasions of Bill Clinton 's two terms in office and the low - rent , self - congratulatory installing of mafia regimes in Bosnia and Kosovo .
The gnome - like Marshall , well past retirement but a lionized witness before the missile - threat commission , hung on for Rumsfeld 's return .
The resulting history is far too close for much documented detail , though its silhouette is plain enough .
Summoning Marshall as soothsayer , Rumsfeld made RMA the logo of his determination to gain managerial dominance over the Joint Chiefs and the Pentagon bureaucracy , exactly the opportunity he thought he had missed 25 years earlier .
Under the old banner of a clash between a brave , beleaguered secretary of defense and the recalcitrant brass astride an impossible , " glandular " system , he held up the all - purpose , all - seasons ideal of Pentagon " reform . "
That " reform " movement was to be his ultimate takedown , his claim to greatness , and perhaps -- who knew in 2001 -- one last shot at the presidency .
Amid the inevitable claims of " streamlining " and " modernizing , " Democrats applauded and reporters gushed reflexively about Rumsfeld as a celebrity CEO and national quipster .
The willing ignorance , denial , careless trust , or craven acquiescence that marked the essential submissiveness of the political and media culture to Rumsfeld 's rule were only part of a larger , thoughtless national abdication of judgment and responsibility in the wars he would propel in both Afghanistan and Iraq .
In blindly striking out after 9/11 -- a reflexive , grandly opportunistic , richly self - satisfying political act in America -- without seriously understanding the politics or history of either country , he plunged the Pentagon into blundering , plundering occupations that made the nightmares of 2007 and beyond nearly inevitable .
That was the price -- in the utter absence of serious dialogue in the 2000 election or the first eight months of 2001 -- of the original uncontested surrender of foreign - policy power and initiative to such evident presidential incompetence ( including the shocking ineptitude of NSC Advisor Condoleezza Rice and her staff ) and the long predictable Rumsfeld - Cheney dominance .
All of it was plain in Washington soon after George W. Bush 's arrival in the Oval Office ; none of it was then questioned , much less challenged , by Congress , the remnant foreign policy establishment , or the mainstream media .
No democratic process so completely failed a test of substance as America 's after 9/11 .
No ensuing catastrophe was more consensual .
History will unravel only slowly Rumsfeld 's relationship to the neocons , who dominated the middle and upper reaches of his Pentagon , a relationship more complex than contemporary hagiographies or demonologies have had it .
Historically , he was their ally , patron , legitimizing figurehead , but never really of them , never a fellow ideologue , dogmatist , or slavish adherent to much of what they pursued .
In enlisting Wolfowitz , Perle and their train , he would use them , much as he used Marshall , as he had used so many before , as a means to what was so largely a personal , megalomaniacal end .
But that use , too , was characteristically heedless of substance and cost .
He opened government as never before to men who habitually , automatically assumed that U.S. and Israeli interests were identical , with no objectivity about American policy in a Middle East they scarcely understood to begin with .
Their ignorance and presumption were matched only by their zeal to cluster in decisive quarters of the new Bush regime where decisions of grand strategy , of war and peace , were now shaped and predetermined .
" Like cancer cells , " as eyewitness , Lieutenant Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski , would describe them in action in Rumsfeld 's Defense Department .
Half - educated and fanatically loyal to the rote Israeli lobby view of the Middle East and the larger neocon craze for American post - Cold War global hegemony , they crowded the domains of the number three official at the Pentagon , Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith , whose career was a model of their kind and whose notorious Office of Special Plans was created as a fount for the fraudulent intelligence spurring the invasion of Iraq .
Historians will debate , too , the obvious blurred allegiance of what some call these American " Likudniks " with their utter conformity to the belligerent ultra-Zionist mentality of the Israeli right .
Never before -- not even in the post - World War II heyday of the powerful China Lobby with its formidable grip on Capitol Hill but not within the upper reaches of the Executive itself -- had so many of such uncritical adherence to the policies of a foreign power been so well placed in Washington .
As often in American politics and government , however , no conspiracies were necessary , though a Pentagon - Israeli lobby spy scandal has yet to be played out .
Unrelieved substantive shallowness , a perversely narrow sociology of knowledge , long - jockeyed - for power and career advancement , a grandiose parochial vision of a Pax Americana world nursed in a hundred forgotten think - tank papers and incestuous conferences -- all that as well imposed a stifling , disastrous orthodoxy on the administration .
Not least , they operated without the need to support their prejudices or delusions in authentic high - level debate , flourishing in their members - only domains of the Pentagon , the NSC Staff , and the State Department , enjoying exclusive channels of communication to the White House controlled by Cheney , and unchallenged under a President of uniquely closed mind .
As for Rumsfeld 's relations with his generals , the subject of veiled accusations of his heedlessness to dissent or running roughshod over warnings of serious problems , we actually know very little .
The calamity in Iraq has brought more public criticism by senior officers than any other war in American history , including Vietnam , but almost all of it hurled from the relatively safe seats of two - and three - star retirement -- and forlornly after the fact .
This much is clear :
No major Pentagon leaks , the time - honored Washington weapon of dissenting commanders , marked the run-up to the invasion .
There have been no public resignations in protest of his policies .
And the negligence , incompetence , and inertia of commanders in recognizing and coping with the insurgency , in dealing with scandals of prisoner abuse , inadequate equipment and more , have been all too obvious .
There is no evidence that any ranking American officer on duty pressed an intellectual or moral challenge to the unfolding debacle -- even after it was too glaring to be ignored .
As in so much else in his long record , Rumsfeld enjoyed , by Washington 's inimitable mix of careerism and cowardice , submission and opportunism , a large supporting cast in his folly .
Takedown
In the exhilarating dash to Baghdad in 2003 , none of the admiring gallery seemed to notice that Rumsfeld 's " new " military was largely the old one , " reformed " in name only ; nor did many note that the vaunted lean , mean machine of RMA and the again - lionized Marshall had no grasp of how profoundly political was the act of overthrowing 40 years of Ba'athist rule ; how deeply political was the campaign to which so many American lives , so much of the country 's material and symbolic national treasures , would be committed .
Rumsfeld would take his victory tour in the Gulf that spring as if circling the mat after a stunningly swift pin .
What was his toughest call , trailing reporters asked -- part of the traditional garlands of victory tossed his way -- and how did he " feel " at such a victorious moment ?
It was hardly the time for the media , the seemingly omnipotent military , or the rest of government and the political culture to reflect on how much " shock and awe " depended on overwhelming force brought down on the near - defenseless , on how much the concept reeked of racism and colonial pretense -- of natives on the scene and in the vicinity " shocked and awed " like Zulus pounded and panicked by the Queen 's own latest howitzers .
It was far too early for other questions -- about a force cosseted at the end of vulnerable supply lines , nicely photogenic in night goggles but without enough body armor ; about acronyms like IED that had yet to enter the vocabularies of either commanders or reporters ; about the familiar chase for medals and the absence of an enemy admitting defeat and ready to surrender ( a missing essential of " victory " that would have much worried Maxwell Taylor ) .
Unreformed , uninformed commanders , uninstructed beyond brief battles , led their charges into Iraq relying on their generals .
The generals relied on civilians .
The civilians relied on ( or were seduced or bullied by ) the neocons .
The neocons relied on their own ersatz expertise , Mossad insiders , and Iraqi exiles long out of touch with their homeland .
The exiles -- holed up in Baghdad palaces with U.S. - paid - for mercenary guards , ignorant and contemptuous of the Iraq that had passed them by , and where they were now powerless , even with the might of the Pentagon behind them -- relied on the Americans .
Rumsfeld , as always , relied on himself .
The ranks trusted him -- and political decision - makers -- to know and manage post - Saddam politics in Iraq to secure the victory as well as to provide the political setting that fulfilled the military triumph .
When they failed miserably , condemning the American force to a corrupt , untenable occupation and slow - wasting attrition of men and prestige , the debacle was complete .
Beyond Iraq were his other lasting legacies .
As no other cabinet officer in history , he turned over crucial , self - sustaining functions of his department to privateers and private armies .
He surrendered vital supply and commissariat services for the American military to profit - plundering contractors for whom U.S. forces were neither fellow warriors , nor even share - holders , but captive " customers " to be treated with the offhandedness afforded by guaranteed contracts .
He ceded security and combat functions essential to the national mission to a corps of thousands of hired guns whose qualifications , standards of conduct and ultimate loyalty -- all integral to the safety and success of American forces -- were beyond effective governmental control or measure .
( Exposed in a Congressional hearing February 7 , the scandal of the infamous Blackwell Security Corporation , shirking amid vast profit the arming and protection of its own ranks , would be only a glimpse of the larger disgrace . )
Not since the British hired hordes of Hessians to crush George Washington 's revolutionary army had a military force tracing to America been so utterly mercenary .
The potential direct and indirect levy on policy and the armed forces would not be known for years .
As no other cabinet officer in history , he squandered the integrity of his department and the unique , indispensable code of honor of its services .
He joined , and often led , the rest of an intellectually degraded administration , heedless of Constitutional and human rights , in violating the very heart of their ostensibly conservative convictions .
With the ready sanctioning , and then de facto cover -up of torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo , and the less noticed but equally gruesome prisons at Bagram Air Base and elsewhere in Afghanistan , he changed , for untold millions , the symbol of America and its once - proud military from freedom and the rule of law to the unforgettable prisoner 's hood and shackles .
Rumsfeld 's impact would not vanish with terms of office or elections .
By the very nature of contracts , personnel practices , and imparted ethics -- some of Washington 's most permanent monuments -- his legacies would remain deep in the tissue and soul of the institution he was entrusted to lead .
At the end , a pathetic climax to his more than four decades either in government or imploringly on its threshold , there was only his hackneyed memo on Iraq policy -- leaked , even more pathetically , in an apparent attempt somehow to vindicate him after all .
Thus , he growled that the Iraqi regime , like some seedy wrestling team , should " pull up its socks " ; and , most poignantly , ever the politician conducting lethal policy as politics , he advised that Washington " announce that whatever new approach the US decides on , the US is doing so on a trial basis .
This will give us the ability to re-adjust and move to another course , if necessary , and therefore not ' lose . ' "
As he left office for the last time , it would be only the loss that mattered .
As a pathologically unfit president struggled to recoup his historic blunder , as the neocons and Israeli lobby pressed on a gullible media and restive but still captive Congress the myth of an Iranian nuclear threat , as the Navy and Air Force , lesser actors in the Iraq action , promised wondrous results in Persia , the chaos and ineffable danger were left to Robert Gates , the puffy courtier .
Weeks after Rumsfeld 's departure , history -- the little ever really known or understood -- was already being waved off , forgotten .
The past was too complicated and troublesome , too guilt - ridden and close to home , too filled with chilling consequences .
The worst of it was the most basic and damning .
Donald Rumsfeld and all he represented , all he did and did not do , came out of us .
The undertaker 's tally , including Iraq , was compiled at our leave , one way or another , at every turn .
His tragedy was always ours .

Bosnians sought a guilty verdict at the court in The Hague
But the International Court of Justice did rule that Belgrade had violated international law by failing to prevent the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica .
Bosnia brought the case and would have sought billions of dollars from Serbia in compensation if successful .
The case is the first of a state being charged with genocide .
Individuals have been convicted of genocide in Bosnia .
The Bosnian Muslim leader expressed disappointment at the ruling , which was welcomed both in Serbia and the Bosnian Serb Republic .
At least 100,000 people died in the 1992-1995 war , triggered by the break - up of the former Yugoslavia .
Bosnia 's Muslims and Croats wanted to cut ties with Belgrade , a move opposed by Bosnian Serbs .
No reparations
The case , Bosnia and Herzegovina versus Serbia and Montenegro , began a year ago and a panel of judges has been deliberating since hearings ended in May 2006 .
INTERNATIONAL COURT
UN 's highest legal body , resolving disputes between states Based in the Peace Palace in The Hague , began work in 1946
The court has 15 judges of different nationalities elected to nine - year terms of office
If one state fails to comply with a ruling , the other party can take the issue to the UN Security Council
Q&A : World Court Press reaction
Bosnia argued that Belgrade incited ethnic hatred , armed Bosnian Serbs and was an active participant in the killings .
Belgrade said the conflict was an internal war between Bosnia 's ethnic groups and denied any state role in genocide .
In the ruling , the president of the court , Judge Rosalyn Higgins , said : " The court finds that the acts of genocide at Srebrenica cannot be attributed to the respondent 's ( Serbia ) state organs . "
However the court added that the leaders of Serbia failed to comply with its international obligation to prevent the killings and punish hose responsible .
The court also rejected Bosnia 's claim for reparations .
" Financial compensation is not the appropriate form of reparation , " the ruling said .
The war crimes tribunal in The Hague has already found individuals guilty of genocide in Bosnia and established the Srebrenica massacre as genocide .
Stalled talks
Under a 1995 peace accord , Bosnia remained a single state , but power was devolved to a Muslim - Croat federation and a Bosnian Serb Republic .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I do n't understand why the country should be held accountable

The BBC's Nicholas Walton in Sarajevo says many Bosnian Muslims were hoping for a clear ruling that Serbia as a state was responsible for pursuing a genocide in Bosnia during the 1990s .
The Bosnian Muslim member of the country 's tripartite presidency , Haris Siladzic , told the BBC there was " disappointment " at the outcome .
However he welcomed the fact that the court had " ruled that Serbia and Montenegro had violated the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide by not preventing or punishing the perpetrators of the genocide " .
In the Serb Republic , Krstan Simic , a senior member of the governing ruling Union of Independent Social - Democrats , said he was pleased that the judges had taken " real facts " into account .
In Serbia itself , President Boris Tadic welcomed the judgement and urged parliament to pass a declaration " condemning the crime in Srebrenica without any doubt " .
The German presidency of the European Union urged Serbia " to use today 's judgment as a further opportunity to distance itself from the crimes committed by the Milosevic regime " .
The ruling comes with Serbia still facing challenges linked to the break - up of the former Yugoslavia .
Admission talks with the EU have been stalled over Belgrade 's failure to hand over war crimes suspects for trial .
When Frances Beinecke , president of one of the country ’s biggest and most prominent environmental groups , watches shorebirds soaring off the coast of Denmark , she ’s not having a leisurely summer day at the beach–she ’s trying to find a way to use wind energy to overturn the United States ’ heavy dependence on fossil fuels .
And when she visits a farm in Wisconsin , it ’s not just any homestead .
She is following in the footsteps of Aldo Leopold , the father of U.S. wildlife management , in his classic nature essay collection A Sand County Almanac .
“ We spent the night in the Shack , ” she said proudly , a place where Leopold himself spent time away .
Beinecke , who became leader of the Natural Resource Defense Council in January 2006 , is only the second president NRDC has had since its founding in 1970 .
NRDC ’s mission under her predecessor , John Adams , was to protect the planet using courtroom litigation , such as in 2003 when Adams brought the U.S.
Navy to trial to prevent them from using an international navy sonar system that was so loud it could injure , deafen , or kill whales .
Under Beinecke , the NRDC is continuing the fight for environmental justice .
In their current high profile case , Massachusetts vs. EPA , the NRDC team hopes the U.S. Supreme Court will rule that the EPA must regulate carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming .
Beinecke calls herself “ an ambassador of the institution to the outside . ”
Traveling is crucial , she said , because she feels “ more empowered to speak once I have experienced it . ”
Seeing events in person , like the Katrina aftermath or wind farms , helps her to paint a picture for government officials and the public , garnering support for her causes .
As president , Beinecke leads an organization that employs not only lawyers , but economists , scientists , foresters , and engineers .
Her masters degree from Yale ’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies stands in contrast to John Adams ’ background as a federal prosecutor , but Richard Stewart , Director of the Center for Environmental and Land Use Law at New York University , noted that though Beinecke ’s background is very different , she is “ an extremely competent and able person ” who is “ open to a variety of strategies and techniques . ”
Her predecessor began NRDC with the mindset , “ let ’s sue the bastards , ” Stewart said , but eventually expanded NRDC ’s litigation focused policy to one that included working with government agencies , the public , and corporations to find collaborative solutions to environmental problems .
For instance , NRDC has developed guidelines for “ green buildings , ” and has been working with developers and builders to promote these structures , which encourage a healthy living and working environment by conserving energy , maintaining safe indoor air quality , using environmentally safe building materials , and maintaining water safety .
Currently all four of NRDC ’s office buildings are green buildings , and the organization is working to make their recommendations a part of standard construction practice .
NRDC ’s initiatives , such as developing guidelines for green buildings and suing polluters , seem to be popular : in just two years the organization ’s membership doubled to 1.2 million people .
Noticing this , Beinecke is using her time as president to make people aware of other initiatives they can help with , such as the letter writing campaign to Congress that NRDC is sponsoring .
NRDC will even provide letter writers with sample letters to follow for various environmental issues .
High profile cases also increase public awareness of NRDC and its mission .
In Massachusetts vs. EPA , Massachusetts and eleven other states are suing to ensure the EPA will actually regulate greenhouse gases ; the EPA does not believe the Clean Air Act gives it the authority to do this .
Oral arguments for the case were planned to happen no later than December 2006 .
Beinecke was not always the activist she is at NRDC .
“ I did n’t grow up thinking about the environment , ” she said .
Her eyes opened at the first Earth Day celebration in 1970 , when 20 million people from around the country rallied for the environment .
Around that time , she also formed an attachment with mountains .
“ I fell in love with the Adirondacks , ” she said in her office , where a six - foot - long representation of Long Lake in the Adirondacks , painted by her daughter Carrie Elston , hangs .
Even Beinecke ’s dog Homer is named after the great Adirondack artist Winslow Homer .
Both Earth Day and the mountains led her to get her master ’s degree from Yale ’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies .
As her daughter ’s painting suggests , Beinecke ’s family is passionate about the environment .
Her husband Paul Elston helped her found the New York League of Conservation Voters , which aims to protect the New York environment through political action , in addition to founding the Long Lake Energy Corporation , chairing the New York City Water Board , and presiding over the Riverdale Nature Preservancy .
The couple ’s three daughters are all activists for the NRDC .
The combination of Beinecke ’s investment to the environment , both in and outside of her job , has paved the way for her ascension to NRDC ’s presidency .
NRDC Deputy Director Patricia Sullivan , who has worked with Beinecke since she began as an NRDC intern 30 years ago , says Beinecke “ has had every possible rank in the organization ” and “ has the most extraordinary grasp of the whole picture . ”
Friend and ex-roommate Sigourney Weaver also turns to Beinecke for motivation , saying on the NRDC website that she draws inspiration from Beinecke ’s unyielding courage and resolve when facing intense situations .
Weaver also claims to have based her character Ripley in the Alien movies on Beinecke .
“ Whenever I needed to know how Ripley would act , I ’d ask myself ‘ What would Frances do ? ’ ”

Want to get a heated debate going among technologists ?
Ask them this question :
Can the open source software movement defeat ( or severely cripple ) Microsoft in the marketplace ?
With little academic attention focused on this question , Harvard Business School professors Pankaj Ghemawat and Ramon Casadesus - Masanell decided to dive in .
Most research to date into the OSS movement has focused on the organization and management issues surrounding OSS .
Ghemawat and Casadesus - Masanell chose to explore the fundamental competitive dynamics question : Will OSS ever displace traditional software from its market leadership position ?
" We believe that there is still a great deal of confusion and puzzlement on how this competitive battle will develop , " say the authors of the academic paper Dynamic Mixed Duopoly : A Model Motivated by Linux vs. Windows , which has just been accepted for publication in a special issue of Management Science .
Ultimately , the authors believe , neither side is likely to be forced from the battlefield —
Microsoft has too much market share and OSS offers too many benefits for users .
But there are strategies each can use successfully against the other , as they detail in this e-mail interview .
Sean Silverthorne :
Why should OSS ever displace traditional software ?
Ramon Casadesus - Masanell and Pankaj Ghemawat :
One main advantage of open source software is that because users can modify the code directly ( as they encounter problems or have new ideas on how to improve it ) , the development cycle is significantly shorter .
Proponents of OSS claim that if this demand - side learning ( as we call it ) is sufficiently strong , OSS will oust traditional software .
In addition , software engineers claim that the better architecture of most OSS projects make them a potentially superior product , adding to the probability of success .
However , OSS has disadvantages too .
Most importantly , it comes from behind in terms of market share ( installed base ) .
Because the value of an operating system depends critically on the number of users , traditional software has an advantage .
Clearly , a larger installed base implies that there will be stronger direct and indirect network effects , and this will enhance the value of the operating system to current and potential users .
In addition , a larger installed base also implies that there will be more feedback on bugs and more suggestions for new features .
Our paper introduces a dynamic mixed duopoly model in which a profit - maximizing competitor ( Microsoft ) interacts with a competitor that prices at zero ( Linux ) , with the installed base affecting their relative values over time .
We use a formal model to ask what conditions are needed for Linux to take over Windows .
The questions that we address are : Is Linux 's superior demand - side learning sufficient to win out ?
What is the effect of forced procurement by governments and some large corporations on the long - run equilibrium ?
How do cost asymmetries play out ?
Can Microsoft use piracy strategically to improve its market position ?
From a managerial perspective , these are significant questions .
If it turns out that OSS will incontestably displace traditional software , software firms need to adapt as quickly as possible to the new competitive landscape by , for example , incorporating some aspects of the open source development model , or else be ready to exit .
In fact , the model suggests ways in which the likelihood of OSS winning out can be minimized ( see below ) .
If , to the contrary , OSS turns out not to be a threat to the traditional model , firms should not waste time and attention trying to figure out ways to fight this battle .
Q : Could you summarize your results ?
A : First of all , let us make a caveat regarding our approach .
Our methodology is formal economic modelling .
What this means is that we construct a stylized mathematical model of the relationship .
The model captures what we believe are the most important features of the Linux - Windows competitive battle ( faster demand - side learning on the part of Linux and an initial installed base advantage for Windows ) , but makes important assumptions regarding other aspects .
Without these simplifications , the model would not be tractable and it would not be possible to obtain results .
After having analyzed the base model , we relax some of these assumptions .
Harnessing demand - side learning more efficiently is not sufficient for Linux to win the competitive battle against Windows .
Our main result is that in the absence of cost asymmetries and as long as Windows has a first - mover advantage ( a larger installed base at time zero ) , Linux never displaces Windows of its leadership position .
This result holds true regardless of the strength of Linux 's demand - side learning .
Furthermore , the result persists regardless of the intrinsically better design and potential differential value of Linux .
In other words , harnessing demand - side learning more efficiently is not sufficient for Linux to win the competitive battle against Windows .
Having obtained this basic result , we investigate the conditions that will warrant that Linux ends up forcing Windows out .
We do this by modifying the model in two ways .
First of all , we look at the effect of having buyers such as governments and some large corporations committed to deployment of Linux in their organizations .
We call such buyers strategic .
In addition to cost - related reasons , governments back Linux because having access to the source code allows them to verify that sensitive data is treated securely .
Binary code makes it hard to figure out who has access to information flowing in a network .
Companies such as IBM , in contrast , back Linux because they see in OSS one way to diminish Microsoft 's dominance .
We find that the presence of strategic buyers together with Linux 's sufficiently strong demand - side learning results in Windows being driven out of the market .
This may be one main reason why Microsoft has been providing chunks of Windows ' source code to governments .
Second , we look at the role of cost asymmetries .
In the base model we assume that the cost structures of Windows and Linux for the development , distribution , and support of software coincide .
A natural question is then whether the central result that Windows survives in the long - run equilibrium regardless of the speed of Linux 's demand - side learning persists if there are cost asymmetries .
We find that because OSS implies lower profits for Microsoft , the larger the cost differences are between Linux and Windows , the less able Microsoft is to guarantee the survival of Windows .
We also show that it is not all bad news to Microsoft .
We analyze the effect of having forward - looking buyers and the presence of piracy , and conclude that both benefit Microsoft .
We question the effectiveness of influencing forward - looking buyers ' perceptions on the value of an operating system .
The model suggests that the more forward - looking buyers are , the more advantageous it is to use fear , uncertainty , and doubt ( FUD ) tactics to drive the competing system out .
Consider SCO , a small " vulture " firm that had bought up the intellectual property rights to a particular version of Unix and threatened Linux users with lawsuits over infringement of those rights unless they agree to pay substantial licensing fees .
IBM , which was one of the prime corporate sponsors of Linux as well as the target of a lawsuit by SCO that sought $ 1 billion in damages , alleged in mid-2003 that SCO was in cahoots with Microsoft .
Our model indicates that if buyers are sufficiently forward - looking , such actions may jeopardize the ability of Linux to continue as an effective competitor in the operating system space .
We also look at the effect of piracy and ask whether piracy can ever be beneficial to Microsoft .
This extension was motivated by analyzing data on a cross-section of countries on Linux penetration and piracy rates .
We found that in countries where piracy is highest , Linux has the lowest penetration rate .
The model shows that Microsoft can use piracy as an effective tool to price discriminate , and that piracy may even result in higher profits to Microsoft !
Finally , the paper investigates the societal welfare consequences of OSS availability by comparing different industry structures ( monopoly and duopoly ) .
We find that while a monopoly of Linux is always preferable ( from the point of view of societal welfare ) to a Windows monopoly , it is ambiguous whether a duopoly Linux - Windows is better than a Windows monopoly .
The basic trade - off is the following : With a duopoly , more individuals and organizations use PCs because prices are lower , and this raises welfare .
However , with a duopoly , no operating system ends up exploiting fully its potential because developers ' efforts wind up divided between the two systems .
However , with a monopoly , the efforts to develop new software and improve the platform are directed towards one system only and this may turn out to be better from a social welfare perspective .
Q : In general , what surprised you about the results ?
What assumptions did you have going in that did n't hold up ?
A : When we began the project , we thought that network effects and demand - side learning would result in Linux forcing Windows out .
After all , we reasoned , if Windows is sold at a positive price and Linux is free , there will always be Linux users , and if the strength of Linux 's network effect is large , the value of Linux to prospective users should eventually become larger than that of Windows .
Well … we were wrong ( and this illustrates the usefulness of developing a formal model ) .
What we had missed is that Microsoft 's initial advantage ( larger installed base ) together with its pricing power allow the company to price strategically to control Linux 's market share going forward .
By lowering the price of Windows , the demand for Linux shrinks to the point where Linux is not a threat to the survival of Windows .
The model also shows that a " milking strategy " ( setting high prices in the short term and leaving the market at some point in the future ) is not desirable to Microsoft .
The reason is that if Microsoft follows such a strategy , as the last period becomes closer and closer , the relative benefit of abandoning it and lowering prices to survive a few more periods increases dramatically .
The model shows that Microsoft can use piracy as an effective tool to price discriminate , and that piracy may even result in higher profits to Microsoft !
The " Windows persistence " result turns out to be robust to different specifications of the model .
In fact , in the first few months into the project we had developed several alternative models and every one of them yielded this very same finding .
In addition to this main result , we were also surprised to find that piracy may end up increasing Microsoft 's profits .
To understand why , notice that there are two types of pirates : those who would not have bought Windows in the first place because it is too expensive , and those who would have bought Windows but now decide to pirate it .
The first category increases Windows ' installed base without affecting sales .
As a consequence , this group increases the value of Windows .
And thanks to these pirates , Microsoft is able to set higher prices in the future ( because the value of the system goes up ) .
In addition , having these pirates means that Linux 's installed base does not grow as much as it would have if piracy were n't there .
The second type of pirates ( those who in the absence of piracy would have bought Windows ) reduces Windows ' sales and profit .
Thus , if the proportion of first - type pirates is sufficiently large , Microsoft 's profits will increase with piracy .
Finally , the social welfare result that a Windows monopoly is not always worse than a Linux - Windows monopoly was also unexpected .
This questions the social desirability of policies aimed at guaranteeing Linux 's survival .
Q : You mention in the paper that the model is not to be taken as a literal model of the Linux / Microsoft competition .
But can you say anything about why Linux has enjoyed success against Microsoft ?
A : Linux 's success against Microsoft is still relative .
In the client space , Windows is the undisputable leader , and in the server space , Linux and Windows have both been gaining positions for the past ten years .
The big losers are Novell , Unix , Solaris … everybody except Linux and Windows .
Despite this , Microsoft is visibly concerned about Linux 's upsurge .
The Halloween memos ( see http://www.opensource.org/halloween/) are an obvious testimony of this concern : " OSS poses a direct , short - term revenue and platform threat to Microsoft , particularly in server space .
Additionally , the intrinsic parallelism and free idea exchange in OSS has benefits that are not replicable with our current licensing model and therefore present a long - term developer mindshare threat . "
Microsoft has a great deal to lose if Linux wins the operating systems battle .
Microsoft is a software company , and a defeat in operating systems would point to the vulnerability of its entire business portfolio .
In addition , the operating systems group is one of Microsoft 's biggest revenue generators .
Moreover , to a large extent Microsoft 's sustained success over time in such a dreadfully rugged landscape has been due to its dominant position in operating systems .
It is well known that Microsoft won the browser wars leveraging its dominant position in client operating systems .
And the same will happen in the media player space unless the American or European antitrust authorities prevent it .
We expect Microsoft to put all its ammunition to fight this battle .
Part of the reason why Linux has made significant inroads is the determination of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation to have a free ( as in freedom ) operating system .
According to Stallman , application software will never be truly free unless there is a free operating system that supports it .
Thus , since the moment Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman joined forces , a big chunk of the foundation 's efforts have been directed at building a free operating system .
Then there are some large corporations and governments backing the development of Linux .
These players use Linux as a way to curb Microsoft 's dominance .
This support is important because there are tedious portions of the code that would rarely be developed spontaneously by members of the Linux - developer community .
Q : From your modelling , what can Microsoft do strategically to remain competitive against a product that is argued to be of better quality , is updated more frequently , and is free ?
A : A few actions that the model suggests Microsoft could do to remain competitive are :
Increase its own demand - side learning .
Listen to the demands of the user community to better exploit the benefits of demand - side learning .
Microsoft must facilitate communication between the user base and the company to have prompt feedback on the performance of its products .
Make an effort to incorporate improvements in the code ( fix bugs and introduce new features ) as soon as possible .
Reward those who propose improvements for the code .
At the very least , Microsoft could publicly acknowledge those who proposed new features or discovered bugs .
Feed its direct and indirect network effects .
Support as much as possible the independent software vendor community so that the quantity and quality of complements is substantially above that of Linux .
Encourage competition between the different ISVs .
The lower the prices of applications , the more appealing the Microsoft system will be .
Price discriminate .
Give Windows and applications away to schools and universities so that users build their file libraries on Microsoft , not Linux .
Minimize the number of strategic buyers .
Let governments access the source code and give guarantees that sensitive data is treated confidentially .
Price discriminate .
Give binary away to organizations and individuals who are not willing to spend money on Windows but who would be willing to use Linux because it is free .
Reduce costs to be able to sustain long periods of time with low prices .
Decrease Linux 's demand - side learning .
Because the way to do this involves some questionable ( from a legal point of view ) actions , we will refrain from suggesting specifics .
Lessen Linux 's direct and indirect network effects .
Make it as hard as possible for Windows applications to work on Linux .
Same for MS Office documents .
" Promote " Linux 's code forking .
Infuse fear , uncertainty , and doubt into the Linux user community .
For this to work , the statements must be perceived as credible .
Credibility requires some past FUD announcements to be realized .
Q : Is there a scenario where Linux could be kicked out of the market by Microsoft ?
A : Strictly speaking , within our model the only way in which Microsoft can get rid of Linux is by setting the price at zero .
But , even if Microsoft did that , the company would still be selling MS Office for a positive price .
Thus , we conjecture that even in this case , there would be people developing and using Linux .
The more important question is :
What motivates developers to contribute to open source projects in the first place ?
As long as the drivers are there , Linux will persist .
Given that Linux was born in 1992 in an industry already dominated by Microsoft , and given that the financial motive is secondary , it will be very hard for anyone to oust Linux .
The organizational stream of research on OSS has identified several drivers of motivation to contribute to open source projects .
For Microsoft to have a chance to kick Linux out of the market , it needs to successfully fight them .
First , some developers see software as scientific knowledge to be shared " like the sharing of recipes among cooks . "
In fact , some describe software developers more like artists seeking fun , challenge , and beauty in their work than like calculative , square - minded engineers .
Second , some individuals find it fun to go against Microsoft .
As the OSS / free software movement gains momentum and developers foresee that victory is within reach , they increase their effort to accomplish this .
Third , because most OSS projects have a log file listing all contributors to the code , some developers find it desirable to participate in OSS projects to signal their ability and to enhance their chances of promotion and professional advancement .
Finally , user - developers sometimes fix bugs that they find and then release the improved code so that everybody can benefit .
It will be very hard for anyone to oust Linux .
To the motivations of independent developers to contribute to Linux , we have to add the important support that the free operating system receives from companies and governments .
As long as the motives that induce these organizations to back Linux persist , Linux will not go away .
Finally , and as we mentioned above , having a free operating system is central to the mission of the Free Software Foundation , Richard Stallman , and Linus Torvalds .
It is thus hard to see how Microsoft can " persuade " Stallman or Torvalds to cave .
And even if it did …
Linux is no longer Stallman's or Torvalds ' property .
The project is dispersed and there is no " owner " of the code .
Thus , someone else can take the lead .
Q : What 's next for the both of you for future research projects ?
A : There are several ways in which our work on Linux can be extended .
One avenue would be to empirically estimate the difference in demand - side learning between Linux and Windows .
This would allow us to make educated guesses on the chances of survival of Windows and make managerial and policy recommendations to OSS advocates , Microsoft , and administrations .
In its present form , the paper models the organization of Linux 's development in a very stylized way .
Having a closer look at issues of effort coordination may help us better understand how to deal with code forking , one of OSS 's biggest potential problems .
A second organizational issue that could also benefit from formal analysis is that of incentives to contribute to OSS .
While most research on this issue has been sociological in nature , the economic approach may shed light on why supposedly rational individuals are willing to spend valuable time and effort without extrinsic , financial incentives .
A final question that we believe is of utmost importance but that has not attracted much attention thus far ( at least among academics ) is :
What are the drivers of adoption of OSS ?
Aside from its empirical relevance for both individuals and organizations , it is an interesting question from a theoretical point of view , too .
The presence of network effects and demand - side learning make this a non-trivial problem .
We conjecture that there are multiple equilibria and that the use of FUD to mold perceptions about future value becomes crucial .
There is an international flavour to the shortlist
The Bookseller magazine has released its shortlist for the Oddest Titles prize , honouring fringe publishing .
Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Seaweed Symposium is also in the running , with a public vote due to decide the winner .
The winning author receives a bottle of champagne for their efforts .
SHORTLISTED TITLES

Last year 's contest was won by Gary Leon Hill for his impressively titled The People Who Don't Know They 're Dead : How They Attach Themselves to Unsuspecting Bystanders and What to Do About It .
Joel Rickett , deputy editor of The Bookseller , said : " While rival literary awards like the Costas and the Orange Broadband Prize have sold out , The Bookseller / Diagram Prize has refused all offers of corporate sponsorship for 29 years .
" It continues to celebrate the bizarre , the strange , and the simply odd .
This year 's shortlist shows that despite publishers cutting back their lists , literary diversity continues to flourish . "
The shortlist was compiled from entries that caught the eye of publishers , booksellers and librarians across the world .
Another of this year 's contenders for the prize starts off simply enough with D Di Mascio 's Delicious Ice - Cream , but continues with the subtitle D Di Mascio of Coventry : An Ice Cream Company of Repute , with an Interesting and Varied Fleet of Ice Cream Vans .
The winner will be revealed on 13 April , ahead of the London Book Fair .
How Open Source Projects Survive Poisonous People ( And You Can Too ) 20 February , 2007
Someone just recommend this video to me .
I thought it was very interesting perspective about orgainizing and managing an open source project so I thought I ’d share it with the community .
Google Tech Talks January 25 , 2007
ABSTRACT
Every open source project runs into people who are selfish , uncooperative , and disrespectful .
These people can silently poison the atmosphere of a happy developer community .
Come learn how to identify these people and peacefully de-fuse them before they derail your project .
Told through a series of ( often amusing ) real - life anecdotes and experiences .

And when I say favourite , I mean as in personality and not palatability , so stop salivating .
Unlike the vicious swimming crabs or teh aggressive grapsids and the feeling rock crabs , the hairy crab seems to be the most gentle - natured of all the crabs in Labrador and our favourite !
After some initial efforts to move away , it will eventually rest in your palm , usually evicting squeals of " how sweet " from visitors to Labrador .
It is not a good idea to think of eating this small crab since other than seaweed , it may eat toxic zoanthids ( colonial anemones ) which can make this crab mildly poisonous .
It looks hairy because the body is covered by long hairs .
These are slightly suspended when submerged in water and trap sediments , allowing the crab to blend into its surroundings by breaking the body outline .
It is slow moving and rarely seen unless you know where to look - under rocks in a specific zone along the shoreline .
Yueat Tin had a look last month ( May 2005 ) and took this photo .
Airani will be bringing the crew of the Malay magazine programme 647 to Labrador tomorow ( 09 Jun 2005 ) and promised to show them her favourite crab , the teddy - bear crab , so its going to get famous !
Laura Bush , Iraq expert , just now on Larry King Live :
Many parts of Iraq are stable now .
But , uh , of course , what we see on television is the one bombing a day that discourages everyone .
Iraq 's Shi'ite vice president and a cabinet minister were wounded in an apparent assassination attempt on Monday when a bomb killed six people at a ministry in Baghdad where they were attending a ceremony .
Near the volatile western city of Ramadi , a suicide bomber blew up an ambulance at a police station , killing 14 people including women and children , a local hospital official said .
Yeah , it 's such a great place that Iraq .
So stable , well , except for that pesky " one bombing a day . "
Once again , Laura Bush blames the media -- and Larry King let her get away with it , of course .
Laura should talk to CNN's Michael Ware about that -- actually Larry King should talk to him , too .
That damn Reuters said there were at least two bombings today :
Otherwise , it 's a really stable place .
Larry asked Laura Bush about the twins , but he did n't ask the most important question :
Since , things are going so well in Iraq , Laura , have your daughters signed up for a tour of duty yet ?

Fire Ant Raft - Solenopsis invicta
Kisssimee River Prarie Reserve , Florida , USA
June 4 , 2005
Size : the mass is about 1 ft
This raft was seen floating in a flooded portion of the Kissimmee Prarie .
Im prettty sure the genus is Solenopsis , but Im not sure which species , and I doubt that its identifiable from this picture .
It was taken from about 5 feet above the subject from a swamp buggy , and there was about 3 feet of water on the ground , so there was no getting a closer shot .
Can you imagine what would happen if something walked into one of these rafts ?
I cant even think about what to do if that happened , I doubt even dunking underwater would accomplish anything ...
Eesh , scary little buggers
GE ( General Electric ) acaba de anunciar que ha creado un nuevo tipo de plástico al que denomina un " superhydrophobicity " que tiene la particularidad de ser un extremo repelente de fluídos basados en agua .
¿ Qué significa esto ?
Pues por ejemplo , si alguna vez una botella de Ketchup te ha dado trabajo para sacar el Ketchup , ahora este prácticamente saldrá por su cuenta , ya que las paredes internas de plástico de este material repelerían el Ketchup a un nivel de no permitir que ni una gota de Ketchup quede pegada del interior de la botella .
Así mismo uno puede vertir miel pegajosa al material y esta no se adhiere , lo que tambien facilitaría sacar miel de un enbase tan fácil como si fuera leche .
Pero este noble nuevo material tiene usos que van mucho más allá de la cotidianiedad de la cocina , hasta llegar a resolver muchos problemas médicos que requieren de " microfluidés " para que particulas insertadas en el cuerpo humano pasen por sus artérias como si fueran agua , entre muchos usos más que todavía no podemos imaginarnos .
Según los científicos , se inspiraron en la configuración estructurar de las hojas de la planta de Lotus , que ya poseen esta propiedad naturalmente .

Britain is considering adopting racial and ethnic profiling procedures to help identify potential terrorists , a move British Metropolitan police chief superintendent Ali Dizaei has condemned as creating the new offence of “ traveling while Asian ” .
And two young men of “ Middle Eastern or Asian ” appearance were removed from a holiday flight after their fellow passengers complained that they were acting suspiciously :
In the early hours of Wednesday a number of passengers on Monarch Airlines flight ZB613 left the plane , refusing to fly unless the two men were removed , causing a three - hour delay .
Passengers are reported to have become suspicious after the men were overheard apparently speaking Arabic and seen repeatedly checking their watches , although this has not been confirmed by the airline .
If people who speak Arabic and check their watches frequently in airports are to be acted against , and if the colour of one ’s skin is to once again become the determining factor in how one is treated by the police , perhaps it ’s time to start jamming the culture a little bit .
That ’s why I propose we put our heads together and start up a new company selling t- shirts with Arabic on them whose sayings translate into punchy commentary such as Declare Jihad on Illiteracy , or I Love America , or perhaps I Prayed to Allah on a Plane and All I Got Was This Lousy T - Shirt .
We could also screen - print the image of some bearded , scary - looking dude on them to really make the point , like Abraham Lincoln :

Here we are again , with the fourth installment in the Stippy “ Only in Japan ” Video series .
This time we will explore a mysterious trait of Japanese cyclists – the fact that they fail to see the safety benefits of using bicycle helmets !
Note :
If you have only tuned in to this series on stippy .com recently , you really need to catch up on the first , second and third parts also .
Check them all out , they are well worth the laugh ..!
In many countries around the world , cyclists are obliged ( sometimes forced by the law ) to wear a helmet when riding a bicycle .
Throughout South East Asia it is common to see people without helmets , but this can be attributed to a lower level of safety consciousness than in more developed nations .
Japan on the other hand has no excuse to not be more helmet aware , and through this video , we hope to bring the current state of helmet wearing in Japan to the surface !
( The video does provide for a good chuckle also .. ) .
Even though proposals to make helmets mandatory for children to some local and prefectural governments have been made by various community action groups for some strange reason these have historically been rejected in early stages , long before votes are taken by local parliaments to enforce them as law .
Bicycle helmets are 85 to 88 percent effective in mitigating head and brain injuries , making the use of helmets the single most effective way to reduce head injuries and fatalities resulting from bicycle crashes .
Despite the fact that nearly 70 percent of all fatal bicycle crashes involve head injuries , it is very difficult to find bicyclists that wear helmets here in Japan .
One article on asahi.com ( Asahi Newspaper ) dated 22nd Dec 2004 titled , “ Working to get Helmets on Kids while Riding with Mum ” ( ママチャリ乗せるなら子にヘルメット 広がる普及の動き ) showed the reason why mothers of kindergarten children refuse to even use a helmet on their kids .
The following mother ’s example was a representative of most other parents that were interviewed :
４歳の長男を乗せていた主婦（３３）はヘルメットを持っているが、使っていないという。「幼稚園の送迎時に使ったら、まだ珍しいから、ほかの親に『何でかぶせているの？』という目で見られた。もっと普及すれば使いやすいんですが」( Translation :
One mother who had her 4 year old son with her on the bike said that she does have a helmet for her child , but never uses it .
“ When I take him to kindergarten , a helmet would deviate from the norm , and other mother ’s would look at me , as if to say , ‘ what is that on his head !?’.
It is embarrassing so I do n’t use it .
If only it would become more common to wear helmets .. ” )
It seems that the Japanese are so concerned with how they appear to others , that they are willing to risk the safety of themselves , and more worrying their children , by continuing to repel the practice of wearing bicycle helmets .
Simon Adams and Andrew Johnson decided to find out why , by hitting the streets of Tokyo and asking , “ Where ’s your Helmet ? ” .

豊かな人生のための四つの法則
An Australian military commander has tried to ensure truth does not become a casualty of conflict in East Timor , but embarrassed a TV network in the process .
Australian commander in East Timor Brigadier Michael Slater appeared this morning in a live cross from Dili to the Nine Network 's Today show , with helmeted and heavily armed Australian soldiers standing behind him .
He was pressed by Today host Jessica Rowe about whether Dili really was as safe as the Australian military claimed , given the presence of armed soldiers at his shoulder .
By giving ordinary adult mice a drug – a synthetic designed to mimic fat – Salk Institute scientist Dr. Ronald M. Evans is now able to chemically switch on PPAR-d , the master regulator that controls the ability of cells to burn fat .
Even when the mice are not active , turning on the chemical switch activates the same fat - burning process that occurs during exercise .
The resulting shift in energy balance ( calories in , calories burned ) makes the mice resistant to weight gain on a high fat diet .
The hope , Dr. Evans told scientists attending Experimental Biology 2007 in Washington , DC , is that such metabolic trickery will lead to a new approach to new treatment and prevention of human metabolic syndrome .
Sometimes called syndrome X , this consists of obesity and the often dire health consequences of obesity : high blood pressure , high levels of fat in the blood , heart disease , and resistance to insulin and diabetes .
Dr. Evan ’s Experimental Biology presentation on April 30 is part of the scientific program of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology .
This chemical switch is not the first success Dr. Evan ’s laboratory has had in being able to turn on the PPAR-d switch in adipose or fat cells , activating local metabolism and increasing the amount of calories burned .
As a Howard Hughes Medical Investigator at The Salk Institute ’s Gene Expression Laboratory , Dr. Evans discovered the role of the gene for PPAR-d , the master regulator of fat metabolism .
By permanently turning on this delta switch in mice through genetic engineering , he was able to create a mouse with an innate resistance to weight gain and twice the physical endurance of normal mice .
Because they were able to run an hour longer than a normal mouse , they were dubbed “ marathon mice . ”
Subsequent work in the Evans laboratory found that activation of PPAR-d in these mice also suppresses the inflammatory response associated with arthrosclerosis .
But the genetic metabolic engineering that created the marathon mouse is permanent , turned on before birth .
While a dramatic proof of concept that metabolic engineering is a potentially viable approach , it offers no help to an adult whose muscles are already formed and who now would benefit greatly from having more active , fat - burning muscles .
That is why the potential of chemical metabolic engineering – possibly a one - a- day pill as opposed to permanent genetic metabolic engineering – is so exciting , says Dr. Evans .
In today ’s society , too few people get an ideal amount of exercise , some because of medical problems or excess weight that makes exercise difficult .
Having access to an “ exercise pill ” would improve the quality of muscles , since muscles like to be exercised , and increase the burning of energy or excess fat in the body .
And that would result in less fatty tissue , lower amounts of fat circulating in the blood , lower blood glucose levels and less resistance to insulin , lowering the risks of heart disease and diabetes .

Download the testking 642-611 dumps and testking 352-001 practice exam to prepare and pass real exam on time .
The ability to chemically engineer changes in metabolism also has given the researchers more insight into how the PPAR-d switch works , says Dr. Evans .
Genetically engineering changes in metabolism in the marathon mice triggers both increased fat burning and increased endurance .
Adult normal mice that receive the drug to switch on PPAR-d show increased fat burning and resistance to weight gain , but they do not show increased endurance .
Dr. Evans says this suggests the delta switch can operate in different modes , and the laboratory is in the process of figuring out exactly how .
He hopes his strategy will make it possible .

In Part I , we examined the evolving Hubbert Linearization ( HL ) of Texas oil production , and found that the predictive precision of the technique was quite poor .
The error range was on the order of 3 decades .
However , some have suggested that the trends just need to stabilize , and then we can be more confident in the predictions .
Others offered rationalizations for why Texas behaved as it did , and suggested that the HL is still a useful predictive tool provided we somehow filter the data .
Still others suggested that it is futile to attempt to linearize non-linear data .
In this essay , we will push this issue further .
I will examine more cases that cast grave doubts in my mind that the HL can accurately predict anything .
The Sinking of the Titanic
A number of people have latched on to the sinking of the Titanic as an appropriate analogy for the debate over the methodology and timing of peak oil forecasts .
I see those analogies as missing a number of key points .
If you wish to apply an appropriate analogy , try the following .
After the Titanic hit the iceberg , a debate quickly ensued on how fast it would sink .
One train of thought was that it did n’t matter , because everyone was doomed anyway after the precious few lifeboats were utilized .
Most of these people sat idly by biting their fingernails while others made decisions that would affect them .
One train of thought suggested that based on the alignment of the stars – which had correctly forecast prior disasters - sinking in 2 hours was inevitable .
These people proceeded to warn everyone to expect the ship to go down in 2 hours .
They demonstrated unwavering faith in their forecast .
But another group employed a more scientific approach .
First , they challenged the faith - based group to show a case in which their methodology had ever been demonstrated to work .
Challenges to their arguments were met with repetitious assertions of the original claims .
Yet the scientific group continued to challenge the argument – not because they did n’t think the ship was sinking – but because they saw some inherent dangers in faith - based arguments and they were not satisfied with the integrity of the conclusions .
In response to their challenges , the scientific group was accused of mounting frantic , even hysterical attacks on the faith - based arguments .
They were accused of having agendas and of being non-believers .
The faith - based proponents were praised by their followers for maintaining faith in the face of these challenges .
However , the challenges persisted , and some in the scientific group pointed to data suggesting that the ship would actually sink in 4 hours .
( To be fair , some scientifically minded investigators concluded that the ship would sink in 2 hours ) .
But two hours after the iceberg was struck , the faith - based group began to cry “ We are all doomed ! ” A number of people , unable to bear the tension any longer , decided to end it all before they were plunged into the icy water .
But the 2 - hour mark came and went , and while it was clear that the ship was sinking , the voices of the faith - based group had been silenced .
They had either jumped overboard as the 2 - hour mark bore down upon them , or they were ignored because their assertions now rang hollow .
They still sought influence , but their previous tactics now undermined the possibility of sounding a warning .
At the 3 - hour mark , a few small rescue boats made it to the area .
While there were not enough boats to save everyone , some of those who had taken a cautious approach toward the faith - based group were saved .
However , there was a very large group of people who did not differentiate between the arguments of the faith - based group and those of the scientific group .
They decided to discount both messages .
“ After all , ” they argued , “ these sinkers have already shown that they ca n’t forecast very well . ”
So this group called into question the credibility of the scientific group based on the missed forecast of the faith - based group .
They convinced great numbers that the Titanic would n’t sink at all , and that they were safer taking their chances there than by climbing into a rescue boat on the open sea .
Of course we know how the story turned out .
The cry of “ wolf ” at the 2 - hour mark resulted in great loss of life when the Titanic actually did go down at the 4 - hour mark .
Those who survived were the ones who valued the scientific approach of cautiously evaluating and challenging the data .
Many doomers were wiped out at the 2 - hour mark , and many cornucopians – along with the vast majority of the passengers - were wiped out at the 4 - hour mark .
So the debate over the timing of the Titanic ’s sinking actually had great significance for all 3 groups .
And while we do n’t know if any rescue boats will actually arrive or just how long we have until the ship sinks , the debate does matter to many people .
Oilsville – The Constant Production Case
Consider the case of a fictional society called Oilsville .
Oilsville discovered a great oil reserve in 1955 and began full production on January 1 , 1960 .
The size of the recoverable reserve is at least 5 trillion barrels .
Oilsville ’s policy makers decided that they would maintain their oil production constant at 10 billion barrels per year .
It was estimated that the new find would provide for the needs of Oilsville for at least 500 years , provided they maintained their longstanding policy of keeping their population relatively constant .
Note that we have made no assumptions about how they produce their oil .
We do n’t know if there is a water - cut , we do n’t know if they are using horizontal wells , and we do n’t know how hard they are pumping their fields .
All we know is that they are keeping production constant .
So , let ’s do a series of HLs for Oilsville to better understand the HL behaviour under these circumstances .
First , fix in your mind what you think the HL for Oilsville will look like after 20 years of steady production .
Form your hypothesis .
So , what does the HL actually look like ?
Figure 1 . Hubbert Linearization of Flat Production Case after 20 Years .
At the end of 1980 , they have produced 200 billion barrels , or 4 % of their total URR of 5 trillion barrels .
The last 10 points on the graph have stabilized such that we can make an estimate of URR based on the HL .
It appears from the HL that the predicted URR is 300 billion barrels .
However , this is only 6 % of the actual URR .
The %
Qt indicated by the HL is ( 200/300 ) or 66.7 % , indicating a fairly advanced stage of depletion and likely well past peak .
Yet the actual depletion is 4 % .
Furthermore , recall that even though the production rate is constant , the slope of the line is negative .
This may confuse some into thinking that production is declining .
Maybe that one was a fluke .
Let ’s look at 1990 .
Figure 2 . Hubbert Linearization of Flat Production Case after 30 Years .
Hmm .
The URR according to the HL prediction has now increased to 460 billion barrels , still only 9.2 % of the actual URR .
The %
Qt implied by the HL is now ( 300/460 ) , or 65.2 % , while the true % Qt is ( 300/5,000 ) , or 6 % .
Also , by 1990 they had produced 300 billion barrels , which only 10 years earlier was predicted as the URR by the HL .
These HL predictions are not remotely in the ballpark .
Let ’s jump to 2000 .
Figure 3 . Hubbert Linearization of Flat Production Case after 40 Years .
It ’s more of the same .
The URR is trending to a higher value .
The HL is now predicting that the URR is 580 billion barrels , or 11.6 % of the true value .
Cumulative production in 2000 is 400 billion barrels , giving an implied Qt of ( 400/580 ) , or 69 % .
The actual % Qt at this point is ( 400/5000 ) , or 8 % .
But let ’s look at one more in 2010 :
Figure 4 . Hubbert Linearization of Flat Production Case after 50 Years .
Again , the pattern is the same .
URR as indicated by the HL continues to grow , and now stands at 630 billion barrels , or 12.6 % of the true URR .
Yet cumulative production is now at 500 billion barrels , giving a predicted ( 500/630 ) , or 79 % of Qt .
That ’s right ; the HL is telling us that they are 79 % depleted , when they are actually only ( 500/5,000 ) , or 10 % depleted .
The HL has failed in this case , and furthermore it will show the same tendency for any area having relatively flat production over an extended period of time .
I will leave that one for the reader to do as an exercise .
But the problem is – as someone mentioned following my previous essay – linearization of non-linear data .
That is why we so often see “ doglegs ” when we stop and plot the graphs .
Often , the dogleg is a mere manifestation of the fact that we are drawing a straight line through a curve , and the points at the end do n’t fit .
The Rising Production Case
Now , if that does n’t convince you that there is a problem , perhaps this will .
Instead of a constant production rate , let ’s assume they increase production each year by 0.1 billion barrels per year .
Let ’s also say we no longer know anything about reserves .
You could assume any number you want .
Let ’s revisit the HL from 1960 with this new assumption :
Figure 5 . Hubbert Linearization of Flat Production Case after 20 Years .
At the end of 1980 , they have produced 219 billion barrels .
Despite the fact that production has increased each year , and despite the fact that the reserves could for all practical purposes be infinite , the HL predicts a URR of 348 billion barrels .
So , 20 years into production , the HL says they are at ( 219/348 ) , or 62.9 % of Qt. Furthermore , the R - squared of the last 10 points is a respectable 0.969 , indicating a very good fit for the trend line .
To me this is indicative of a major malfunction in the HL , given that all we know is that production has increased every year .
Once again , the HL has failed badly in Oilsville .
And while you may dismiss this case as an unrealistic example , consider the implications .
This example suggests that it is not possible to forecast a production peak prior to the production actually turning downward .
Given this , I conclude that it is highly unlikely that Hubbert actually used this sort of linearization technique in making his forecasts .
The Ideal Production Case
“ No fair , ” you say .
“ You are feeding the HL contrived and unrealistic cases .
You ca n’t expect it to behave in these instances . ”
So , let ’s examine an ideal case .
Consider the case in Oilsville where the production rate increases by 5 % each year for 20 years , and then starts to decline at 5 % a year indefinitely .
What we see in this case is an eventual convergence toward a URR of 861.3 Gbl .
This should be an ideal case for the HL .
Peak production will occur in 1980 , and we will cross the 50 % depletion mark in 1984 .
We know all of the important parameters .
But can the HL predict the results ?
Let ’s look first at the HL for 1980 :
Figure 6 . Hubbert Linearization of Ideal Production Case after 20 Years .
Even though production has risen each year to 1980 , the HL is still under - predicting the URR .
The R - squared is indicating a good fit at 0.945 .
The trend line is predicting a URR of 702 Gbl , an under- prediction of 159 Gbl.
Cumulative production in 1980 is 330.7
Gbl , which means that they are at ( 330.7/702 ) , or 47 % of predicted Qt. But the actual position is ( 330.7/861.3 ) , or 38 % of Qt. Remember , that last point represents the year of peak production .
Let ’s jump forward 10 years .
Figure 7 . Hubbert Linearization of Ideal Production Case after 30 Years .
The 50 % depletion mark was crossed in 1984 .
The HL is now predicting a Qt of 667 Gbl , which is a greater error than the previous prediction .
The R - squared in this case implies a better fit than in the previous graph ( 0.986 now versus 0.945 for the previous case ) .
Yet the actual URR is being under - predicted by 194 Gbl. Cumulative production in 1990 is 543.6
Gbl , putting the actual % Qt at ( 543.6/861.3 ) , or 63 % .
The predicted % Qt is ( 543.6/667 ) , or 81.5 % .
The HL is lying to us even in the ideal case where we have specified all of the important parameters .
In none of these cases has the HL come close to providing accurate predictions .
Saudi Arabia
If the HL is not even reliable when all the important parameters are defined , then it is pointless to use it in a case in which we are trying to predict the parameters .
The HL has failed all validation tests .
As someone accurately said in another thread , my motive here is that I really want to know “ what the heck is going on . ”
Given the enormous errors in the HL predictions where URR is persistently under - predicted , I do n’t have any confidence in the ability of this model to do that .
We saw this in the case of Texas , where the URR grew by 50 % in 20 years .
The HL has failed us in every single test case .
But let ’s go ahead and look at the case of Saudi Arabia .
So , what does the actual HL look like for Saudi ?
First , we need production statistics from Saudi .
After 1960 , those numbers are available from the EIA .
( 1 , 2 ) Prior to that , I had to cobble data together from several sources .
According to Matt Simmons ’ Twilight in the Desert , ( 3 ) the first major oil discovery in Saudi Arabia occurred in 1938 .
Simmons further indicates that production was slow during World War II , and that at the end of the war Saudi was producing 60,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) .
Figure 3.3 in Twilight shows that in 1950 , Saudi was producing about 0.5 million bpd , and by 1960 , production had risen to just over 1 million bpd .
To calculate cumulative production prior to 1960 , I assumed an average of 30,000 bpd from 1938 through 1945 , and then an average of 250,000 bpd until 1950 , and finally an average of 750,000 bpd from 1950 to 1960 .
There may be an actual cumulative number available , but I have n’t found it .
Regardless , later production rates are high enough that even if we assumed no production prior to 1950 , it would have minimal effect on the results .
But based on my assumptions , I calculated a total of 3.2 billion barrels produced in Saudi Arabia before 1960 .
Using those assumptions , the entire HL graph for Saudi Arabia looks like this :
Figure 8 . Hubbert Linearization of Saudi Arabia in 2007 .
This curve is quite consistent with previous HLs of Saudi Arabia .
The HL was very erratic until 1991 , at which point the slope became relatively stable .
By 2000 , there were 10 points that looked to have stabilized :
Figure 9 . Hubbert Linearization of Saudi Arabia 1991 - 2000 .
The HL performed in 2000 predicted a URR of 151 Gbl .
That would put cumulative production through 2000 at ( 88.7/151 ) , or 58.7 % of Qt. The R - squared is 0.969 .
Now let ’s include production numbers through 2006 :
Figure 10 .
Hubbert Linearization of Saudi Arabia 1991 - 2007 .
The addition of a mere 6 years of production data has shifted the URR prediction to 185 Gbl.
Between 2000 and the end of 2006 Saudi Arabia produced 19 Gbl , but the URR prediction increased by 34 Gbl .
Because of this , the 2006 HL is at a slightly lower % of Qt than the 2000 HL .
In 2000 , the graph showed that Saudi was at 58.7 % of Qt , but in 2006 the graph indicates that Saudi is at ( 107.5/185 ) , or 58.1 % of Qt .
This implies that one could have used the HL to make a stronger case for an imminent Saudi peak in 2000 than in 2007 .
Furthermore , the R - squared in 2006 – 0.856 - is worse than in 2000 , indicating that the stability of the line has degraded .
Yet this is the data that is being used by some to forecast the peak of Saudi oil production .
Perhaps you can now understand my extreme scepticism that the HL has the ability to accurately make such a prediction .
Conclusion
Based on the case studies I have carried out – both hypothetical and real – I conclude that the Hubbert Linearization technique does not have the capability of predicting a production peak in real time .
Furthermore , I believe it is the responsibility of those who are using this technique as a basis of their peak predictions to validate the model .
Each case I have investigated showed a failure of the HL technique and an incorrect prediction .
This was true for Texas , it was true for the idealized cases , and we are now seeing evolution in the HL for Saudi Arabia .
But it is not my responsibility to investigate every possible variation of when the HL “ might ” work .
I could spend the rest of my life evaluating case after case .
I think it is a much more reasonable request to ask proponents to provide details on some cases in which it did work - or would have worked – to predict a peak in something resembling real time .
If we are to have any confidence in the HL model , I think it is fair to request the following of HL proponents :
1 ) . Please validate your model .
Demonstrate any case – real or hypothetical – in which the HL would have predicted a peak in real time .
Details are preferred over assertions .
2 ) . Please define the conditions and parameters of the HL ( e.g. , % Qt , P/Q intercept ) that indicate a production peak .
3 ) . Please identify cases in which the HL would be expected not to work .
4 ) . Please identify any other criteria ( filtering , etc. ) that need to be fulfilled before the method should be used .
I know that some have a difference of opinion on whether this debate even matters .
I am of the belief that it does , and that we should rigorously challenge all of our assumptions .
Furthermore , I know that there are some who believe that peak is imminent , but who also agree that continually testing and evaluating conclusions is necessary .
I want to make it clear that there is a big difference – especially in the ability to persuade others – in the faith - based approach and the more rigorous approaches .
This is true regardless of the ultimate conclusion of the approach .

The BBC's David Loyn has had exclusive access to Taleban forces mobilised against the British army in Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan .
There is no army on earth as mobile as the Taleban .
I remember it as their secret weapon when I travelled with them in the mid-1990s , as they swept aside rival mujahideen to take most of the country .
Piled into the back of open Toyota trucks , their vehicle of choice , and carrying no possessions other than their weapons , they can move nimbly .
The bare arid landscape of northern Helmand suits them well .
After one hair - raising race across the desert last week , patrolling the large area where they can move at will , they screamed to a stop at a river bank .
Hardy
It was sunset , and time to pray before breaking the Ramadan fast they had kept since sunrise .
Before praying , they washed in a dank - looking pool at the side of the almost - dry river bed .
Afghanistan has been in the grip of a severe drought for several years , but the lack of clean water does not seem to concern these hardy men .
We rose up and saved almost the whole country from the evils of corruption and corrupt commanders ... that 's why people are supporting the Taleban again now
Mohammed Anif
Taleban spokesman
They clean their teeth with sharpened sticks taken from trees , and sleep with only the thinnest shawls to cover them .
They have surprised the British by the ferocity of their fighting and their willingness to take casualties .
Their belief in the imminence of paradise means that few exhibit fear .
When we stopped for the night , they would break into groups to eat in different houses in a village .
They demand and get food and shelter from places where they stop , but it is impossible to say how enthusiastic the villagers really are .
Power base
These remote villages , scattered across the huge expanse of the northern Helmand desert , are very poor , and made poorer by the drought .
Taleban fighters appear both ferocious and fearless
The food we shared was just a bowl of rice , a vegetable stew made only of okra , and flat roughly - ground country bread .
The failure of aid policies to make a difference in southern Afghanistan and increasing corruption in the government and the national army , are spreading the power base of the Taleban .
The trucking companies , who backed them first in 1994 when they emerged to clear illegal checkpoints on the roads , are now backing them again .
This time the checkpoints are manned by Afghan government soldiers , who demand money at gunpoint from every driver .
The failure of the international community to stop this makes the military task of the British - led Nato force in the south much harder .
The Taleban official spokesman , Mohammed Anif , explained : " When the Islamic movement of the Taleban started in the first place , the main reason was because of concern among people about corruption .
" People were fed up with having to bribe governors , and other authorities .
" We rose up and saved almost the whole country from the evils of corruption and corrupt commanders .
That 's why people are supporting the Taleban again now . "
Civilian casualties
The intensifying conflict itself also plays into their hands .
It is hard for Nato to promote its mission as humanitarian given the inevitable civilian casualties of conflict .
The Taleban deny British claims that hundreds of their soldiers have been killed .
Sher and Nur Ahmad were orphaned when a bomb fell on their home
They say that since they wear only the loose long cotton shirts and trousers - shalwar kameez - of any local villager , then the British cannot easily tell them apart .
In a village damaged by a British attack on the night of 7 October , some people were too angry to talk to me because I was British .
One merely pointed to the torn and bloody women 's clothing left in the ruins of the house and said bitterly , " Are these the kind of houses they have come to build - the kind where clothing is cut to pieces ? " .
Nato sources describe this village as being heavily defended by the Taleban , who fired on their forces throughout the operation .
British soldiers landed in helicopters , arrested a suspect and flew away .
But they left six dead in one family , including three young girls , and partially demolished the mosque .
Thousands of people have fled the fighting , many seeking refuge in Kandahar city , where they are putting severe pressure on the ability of the UN's World Food Programme to help .
They fear for the homes and farms they have left behind , and while not active Taleban supporters , it is clear that most blame Nato more for the worsening violence .
Folk memory
One man , Nazar Mohammed , now squatting with his family in a building site in Kandahar , said the Taleban have most to gain in the continuing conflict .
Nazar Mohammed says it is hard to cooperate with foreigners
" It 's very obvious .
Right now we see foreigners with tanks driving through our vineyards .
They destroy people 's orchards .
" They break through the walls and just drive across .
When they take up positions in the village like this , nobody can cooperate with them . "
There is one other factor that increases Taleban morale .
Few have any education beyond years spent in the madrassas , the fundamentalist religious schools in Pakistan that have produced an endless supply of Taleban for more than a decade .
But all know the story of Afghanistan 's past victories over the British .
Engraved in their collective folk memory of Afghanistan 's warrior history are tales of the defeat of the British in 1842 and 1880 along with the defeat of the Russians in the 1980s .
The Taleban disappeared to the mountains after their defeat in 2001 , and found it hard to recruit .
Five years on they are back , and regrouping against an old enemy .
The rovers are testing a " smart " software upgrade
Space agency scientists have begun testing four new skills included in flight software that has been uploaded to the robots ' onboard computers .
The two American rovers , Spirit and Opportunity , are approaching their third year on the Martian surface .
One of the new capabilities is designed to allow the craft to make " intelligent " decisions in the study of Martian clouds and dust devils .
Spirit has photographed dozens of dusty whirlwinds in action , and both rovers have photographed clouds .
Until now , however , scientists on Earth have had to sift through many transmitted images from Mars to find the few shots that have relevant detail .
With the new software boost , the rovers can recognize dust devils or clouds and select only the relevant parts of those images to send back to Earth .
Decisions , decisions
Another novel skill , called " visual target tracking " , enables a rover to keep recognising a particular landscape feature as it moves .
" The rover keeps updating its template of what the feature looks like .
It may be a rock that looks bigger as the rover approaches it , or maybe the shape looks different from a different angle , but the rover still knows it 's the same rock , " said Khaled Ali , of Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , US .
The software might allow a rover to pick out dust devils by itself
The combination gives Spirit and Opportunity a capability which engineers call " go and touch " .
This has yet to be tested on Mars .
So far in the mission , whenever a rover has driven to a new location , team members on Earth have had to wait for images of the site to arrive on the ground in order to decide where the rover should place its contact instruments .
After the new software has been tested and validated , the crew will have the option of letting a rover choose a science target for itself the same day it drives at a new location .
The new software also improves the autonomy of each rover for navigating away from hazards by building better maps of their surroundings than they have done previously .
by on
Here in San Francisco , supporting impeachment is like preaching to the choir , but I am now convinced that it has gone from desirable to necessary .
Now that Congress has voted to withdraw our troops from Iraq , the U.S. government is at an impasse .
George Bush is “ the Decider , ” and he stubbornly refuses to work with a new Congress that was elected to end this disastrous War .
If anything , growing opposition will only make this President dig deeper into his heels .
He ’s a lame duck who will never have to face the voters again , so why should he give in to the will of the people ?
Before the Democrats wimp out and drop their efforts to withdraw , we must ratchet up the pressure – and the logical solution at this point is to call for his impeachment .
For months , political observers have noted the strong interest that voters have about the 2008 election – even though the first ballot wo n’t be cast for another year .
The reason is that voters are so sick of the Bush Administration that they have moved on .
But with the President ’s approval ratings in Nixon territory ( and likely to continue dipping further ) , why not just put the Administration out of its misery and impeach Bush and Cheney now ?
On April 5th , Beltway pundit Joe Klein wrote that the Bush Administration is in “ epic collapse . ”
According to Klein , the three latest developments from the White House – the showdown on Iraq , the scandal at Walter Reed Hospital and the firing of the eight U.S. Attorneys – “ precisely illuminate the three qualities that make this Administration one of the worst in American history : arrogance ( Iraq ) , incompetence ( Walter Reed ) and cynicism ( the U.S. Attorneys ) . ”
As the public moves beyond this arrogant , incompetent and cynical Administration , Bush and Cheney are determined to thwart Congress while they still can .
For weeks ,
Bush has said that he will veto any legislation that calls for a deadline to get out of Iraq – although that ’s the only way to end the War .
And if no budget gets passed by the time money runs out , the President has the nerve to blame Democrats for “ not supporting our troops ” – even though everyone knows it ’s his fault that we ’re there to begin with .
While there are legitimate concerns about what would happen politically if Congress pushes for impeachment , a better question is what will happen if they do n’t pursue it .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will push for stronger withdrawal legislation after the President ’s veto , but it ’s clear that many lack the resolve to continue fighting .
Already , Barack Obama – who has earned support for having opposed the War from the start – has said that Congress will not de-fund the War , and that “ nobody wants to play chicken with our troops on the ground . ”
As the standoff continues , who does n’t believe that Congress — rather than the President — will blink first ?
Bush has n’t even vetoed the spending bill , and Democrats are already talking capitulation .
Yesterday , Senator Carl Levin ( who chairs the Armed Services Committee ) said that if the President goes ahead with his veto , Democrats may agree to remove a withdrawal date .
“ We ’re not going to cut off funding for the troops , ” he said .
Congress needs to take bold action that will show the President that they ’re not playing around .
If he continues to blame them for “ putting our troops in harm ’s way , ” they must vote to remove him ( and Dick Cheney ) from office .
Impeachment is no longer just a “ San Francisco value , ” as more and more Americans believe that it ’s the right thing to do .
A Newsweek poll from last October found a slight majority ( 51 - 44 ) in favor of impeachment , up ten points from a year ago .
Since then , we have seen a President who refuses to read the mandate from the 2006 elections , believes that we should escalate – not withdraw – from Iraq , claims to “ support our troops ” but wo n’t give them the proper care they need , and fires U.S. Attorneys for political reasons .
For years , the movement to impeach Bush and Cheney has built up grass - roots support across the country .
Last November , San Francisco and Berkeley voters easily passed propositions in favor of it .
In Vermont , 39 towns have passed pro-impeachment resolutions – and it has been introduced and debated in ten state legislatures throughout the country .
Congressmen John Lewis and Keith Ellison have supported impeachment for years , and Senator Russ Feingold moved to censure the President after the NSA “ wire - tapping ” scandal broke out .
Now even Republicans like Senator Chuck Hagel are coming around on this issue .
“ Any president , ” said Hagel , “ who says ‘ I do n’t care ’ or ‘ I will not respond to what the people of this country are saying about Iraq or anything else ’ or ‘ I do n’t care what the Congress does , I am going to proceed ’ — if a president really believes that , then there are ways to deal with that .
This is not a monarchy . ”
The Democratic leadership in Congress is still queasy about pressing for impeachment – but they must realize that it ’s necessary to avoid surrendering to this Administration .
Nancy Pelosi said last November that impeachment was “ off the table , ” but she also resisted for years a deadline to get out of Iraq – until progressives pushed her to make it happen .
In December 2005 , Barbara Boxer asked for the legal opinions of four constitutional scholars on the grounds for impeachment .
She later said that she was n’t “ ready ” to go forward with it , but will she be ready now ?
John Conyers is the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , and he now has the power to investigate abuses in the Bush Administration .
When he was the ranking minority member , Conyers attempted to look into the Downing Street Memo – but the Republicans who controlled the committee would n’t give him the time of day .
Now the Judiciary Committee must begin investigations – on the NSA Wiretapping Scandal , the use of torture at Guantanamo , the Valerie Plame affair , and the Administration ’s criminally incompetent response to Hurricane Katrina .
Along with the President ’s current standoff with Congress ( where over 70 % of Americans support withdrawing from Iraq ) , hearings that illuminate the abuses of the Bush Administration will help bring public pressure for impeachment .
Of course , any effort to impeach George Bush must simultaneously impeach Dick Cheney .
Like his father , President Bush has pursued the cynical strategy of choosing a Vice President who is even more despicable than he is – discouraging any talk of impeachment .
But with Cheney at the heart of every decision in the White House , it wo n’t be hard to find strong grounds to impeach him at the same time .
If Bush and Cheney were impeached , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would become President .
Pelosi has already shown leadership by going to Syria – and meeting with foreign leaders who the Bush Administration wo n’t even talk to .
The fact that George Bush harshly condemned her visit proves that she must be doing something right .
Everyone wants to see a woman become President , but would n’t you rather it be Nancy Pelosi than Hillary Clinton ?
The Bush - Cheney Administration has ruined this country for six years too many .
Our next President will inherit a mess that will take decades to repair .
It ’s time to bring it to an end – now , rather than in two years .

Proof # 26 - Notice that the Bible 's author is not " all - knowing "
Why , when you read the Bible , are you not left in awe ?
For example , look though this small collection of Bible verses :
So we are forced to ask a question :
Why does n't a book written by God leave you with a sense of wonder and amazement ?
If you are reading a book written by the all - powerful , all - knowing , all - loving creator of the universe , would n't you expect to be stunned by the brilliance , the clarity and the wisdom of the author ?
Would you not expect each new page to intoxicate you with its incredible prose and its spectacular insight ?
Instead , opening the Bible inevitably creates a feeling of dumbfoundment .
Have you ever noticed that ?
Instead of brilliance , much of the Bible contains nonsense .
Several of the topics of the previous proofs , for example where we discussed the Bible 's advocacy of slavery , are excellent examples .
But they are just the tip of the iceberg .
You can open the Bible to almost any page and find nonsense instead of wisdom .
Why , in other words , is the Bible so useless ?
Why does the author of the Bible , who is supposed to be God , who is supposed to be all - knowing , know so little ?
Why is the knowledge of the author limited to the knowledge of the primitive men who wrote the book ?
If you think about what you are reading in the Bible in the context of an all - knowing God who supposedly wrote it , none of it makes any sense .
But if you think about the Bible as being a book written by primitive men like you would find in the remote regions of Afghanistan today , it makes complete sense .
The reason is because God is imaginary .
" God " had nothing to do with the Bible .
The Bible was written by primitive men , many of who were obviously insane .
Bush allegedly assures Saudis no war exit on his watch RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday May 9 , 2007 Print
This Email
This President Bush is said to have assured the government of Saudi Arabia that the US will not withdraw from Iraq in his presidency , according to a little - noticed remark in a column in Wednesday 's Washington Post .
The assurance was reportedly made to quash the perception in the Arab world that the administration has lost control of the war and troops are on their way out no matter what , according to a column by David Ignatius .
 That gives us 18 months to plan ,  one Saudi source told Ignatius .
Vice President Dick Cheney 's tour of the Middle East this week includes a meeting with Saudi King Abdullah , where the two are expected to reaffirm the alliance between their two countries .
Saudi Arabia has helped the US by containing Iranian influence in the Middle East , but Abdullah has seemed to be distancing himself recently , as in his recent criticism of Americas illegitimate presence in Iraq , Ignatius says .
Abdullah is reportedly frustrated with the performance of Iraqs government under Primer Minister Nouri al - Maliki and is quietly backing former interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi , who is close to building a large enough coalition of Sunnis , Kurds and Secular Shiites to take over .
The Bush administration fears the upheaval that would come with another change in leadership and is unenthusiastic about Allawi .

Scientists are keen to look into language development
But these are not the only animals with communication skills - in the animal kingdom , it is all about getting your message out there .
And in a bid to understand how one of the most complex communication systems of all - human language - came about , scientists are also studying animals that , like us , use sound to communicate .
Surprisingly , they have discovered our closest relatives , despite their signing prowess , do not have much of a vocal repertoire .
Dr Klaus Zuberbuhler , an expert in primate communication from the University of St Andrews , UK , says : " Most of the non - human primate species only have a fairly limited number of sounds that they can generate . "
Combining sounds
But while primate " vocabulary " is restricted , scientists have found many species can attach meanings to some sounds to convey information .
Vervet monkeys , for example , have three distinct alarm calls that trigger three distinct response calls .
Putty - nosed monkeys can combine their calls
And some species , says Dr Zuberbuhler , can do even more : they possess the ability to use and understand simple grammar .
Putty - nosed monkeys , he explains , can combine their calls to create a sequence that carries a more complex meaning .
In the laboratory , some primates have also demonstrated an understanding of human language ; Kanzi , a male bonobo , is said to be able to understand about 3,000 words , as well as simple sentences .
His trainer Dr Sue Savage - Rumbaugh has said he can even combine words to form simple sentences of his own .
Kanzi is obviously intelligent , Dr Zuberbuhler comments , " but [ he ] is tested on human linguistic systems , not on his own natural way of communicating , and this is an artificial system " .
Rico the super- dog
As with non -human primates , most other mammals have the ability to understand some language but the inability to " talk " back .
Rico the border collie is a prime example , says Professor Julia Fischer , an animal behaviour expert at the German Primate Center .
" All he can do is bark and growl , but he knows the name of over 200 toys and he can understand simple syntax , " she says .
Rico can understand the names of over 200 toys
" I thought it would be a great model to study how animals attach meaning to sounds . "
However , she points out that like Kanzi , Rico is " enculturated " because he lives among humans .
But , she says , he still shows us what such animals can do .
Scientists are trying to find out why most mammals have the ability to understand language but lack the capacity to articulate .
While there have been suggestions that it could be down to simple neurological limitations , such as lack of tongue control , some think the Fox P2 gene may be key .
Humans with a defective version of the gene have a great deal of trouble with speech .
Professor Fischer says : " When you look at the evolution of this gene , there are only three changes between mice and men - that 's 70 million years - and two of them occurred after the split between chimps and humans .
" Maybe this constraint in articulating has had something to do with this gene . "
Animal mimics
Despite the fact that most animals are stumped when it comes to vocal communication , a limited number of species are able to perform the feat of hearing a sound , copying it , and then reproducing it - something scientists call vocal learning .
This trick of imitation plays a key part in human language .
" One reason why we are looking at vocal learning , " explains Vincent Janik , of the Gatty Marine Research Institute at the University of St Andrews , " is because it is so important to humans " .
However , the small group of animals that can do this are rather dissimilar to humans - and to each other .
The vocal learners are an eclectic bunch
For example , on the list are dolphins that can copy signature whistles and humpback whales that learn and copy distinctive and complex songs .
And parrots are also famous for their mimicry : African grey parrots N'kisi and Alex have wowed with their vocabulary .
Seals , bats , elephants , songbirds and hummingbirds are other members of this eclectic bunch of vocal learners .
The key , says Dr Janik , is to find out why such diverse group of animals all possess this ability .
Let 's talk about sex
Professor Erich Jarvis of the US - based Duke University Medical Center is studying brain pathways in the three types of birds that have a vocal learning ability - songbirds , hummingbirds and parrots - to try to answer this question .
" The question is : how can Mother Nature come up with this solution for this supposedly complex behaviour which gives rise to civilisation in humans , " he explains .
He has found that humans and these three species of birds share a similar pathway that is involved with learned vocalisations .
Similar pathways were found in human and bird brains
And he believes they may have evolved out of a pre-existing pathway that controlled motor behaviours .
" It 's like the evolution of wings .
Wings evolved in bats , bird and ancient flying dinosaurs , and each time they did , they evolved from a substrate - the upper limbs .
In the brain , there is something that this complex behaviour is evolving from . "
But in terms of why this ability may have evolved , Professor Jarvis believes it all comes down to sex .
The clue , he says , is the more complicated the song , the more complicated the syntax , the more attractive that particular animal is to the opposite sex .
He explains : " Of the species that produce learned song , all of them will do it in mating interactions - including humans .
You just think about singing and the Jennifer Lopezes and so forth - singing in humans is used for both abstract communication and to feel good to the opposite sex .
" And you find this in whales , and you find this in songbirds , parrots and hummingbirds .
They all do that . "
Dr Klaus Zuberbuhler explains that the key to animal communication studies is to try to elucidate why humans are so unusual in their speech and language capacities .
" Looking at other animals will hopefully give us some ideas of the building blocks of human language , " he says .

I ‘m still wondering where all the damn outrage is , and I ’m not talking about the Foley scandal .
On Sept. 29 , the Senate voted 100 - 0 in favor of the pork - swollen Pentagon budget , which earmarked $ 70 billion for our ongoing military ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan .
There was no debate over the appropriation , and not one Democrat voted against the egregious spending .
On the same day , the Senate also overwhelmingly approved the dismantling of habeas corpus for " enemy combatants . "
Twelve Democrats sided with the Republicans to allow the U.S. government to detain people arbitrarily and indefinitely .
We should n’t be all that surprised the Democrats did n’t filibuster the awful bill , which also expanded the definition of " enemy combatant " to include anyone who " has purposefully and materially supported hostilities against the United States , " whatever that ’s supposed to mean .
No , the Democrats have long been on the front lines of the federal government ’s assault on our civil liberties .
In fact , what we are seeing today is just a logical continuation of a foundation laid during the Clinton era .
Before the now well - known PATRIOT
Act there was the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act , which was signed into law following the Oklahoma City bombing of April 19 , 1995 .
" The act was wide - ranging , dealing with everything from the making of plastic explosives to trading in nuclear materials , " writes Georgetown law professor David Cole and James X. Dempsey in Terrorism and the Constitution .
" Members of Congress immediately felt tremendous pressure to pass anti-terrorism legislation , " Cole and Dempsey recall .
" It did not matter that the proposals in the president ’s initial bill were directed largely against international terrorism , while the Oklahoma bombing was the work of homegrown discontents .
Eager to get the bill on the president ’s desk by the April 19 anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing , the Senate adopted the conference report on April 17 in a 91 - 8 vote .
The next day , the House also adopted the report by a vote of 293-133 .
On April 24 , President Clinton signed the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 . "
" To make the death penalty effective , " explains civil liberties expert Elaine Cassel in The War on Civil Liberties , " meant making it harder to appeal convictions of capital offenses . "
Clinton ’s law , says Cassel , also " [ made ] it a crime to support even the lawful activities of an organization labeled as terrorist [ authorized ] the FBI to investigate the crime of ‘ material support ’ for terrorism based solely on activities protected under the First Amendment [ froze the ] assets of any U.S. citizen or domestic organization believed to be an agent of a terrorist group , without specifying an ‘ agent ’ [ expanded ] the powers of the secret court [ repealed ] the law that barred the FBI from opening investigations based solely on activities protected under the First Amendment [ and allowed ] the Immigration and Naturalization Service ( now called the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ) to deport citizens ( mostly Muslims ) upon the order of INS officials . "
Of course , these are but a few of the ways in which the Clinton administration infringed upon civil liberties .
Speaking of the legacy of these breaches of our guaranteed civil liberties , Clinton himself admitted to making " a number of ill - advised changes in our immigration laws , having nothing to do with fighting terrorism . "
Sounds familiar , does n’t it ?
In the wake of Sept. 11 , it was n’t surprising that Clinton ’s successor George W. Bush legislated additional infringements upon civil liberties in the name of patriotism and national security .
And yes , the Democrats overwhelmingly supported the PATRIOT
Act in both of its awful versions .
But it was n’t the PATRIOT
Act that allowed the federal government to make those sweeping detentions across the country immediately following 9/11  it was Clinton ’s Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty bill .
So who is honestly supposed to believe that ushering the Democrats back into office in November will bring any sort of legitimate change  in Iraq or back at home ?
Is there really something for nothing ?
Almost all free services ( whether it be network television , online search , or free directory assistance ) offer something for free to consumers because it is being subsidized by third - party advertisers .
That ’s nothing new or surprising .
As an investor in Jingle Network ’s 1-800 - FREE411 service , I ’ve spent a lot of time thinking about Google ’s free directory assistance offering – and wondering why they are offering it without any advertising .
Why would they take on that cost ( including the toll free call + call completion + SMS cost ) for nothing ?
Is it just to gain market share , or is there another reason ?
It was only after I read Tim O’Reilly ’s recent blog post , that the answer hit me : Just like the witch Ursula in the Little Mermaid , Google wants your voice .
Take this quote from Mike McCue ( CEO of TellMe ) from February of 2007 ( just two months before Microsoft bought TellMe ) :
“ … our search index is better than Google 's right now .
The grammars that we have -- we do about 10 billion speech utterances a year .
So what we are able to do is make the speech recognition system smarter and smarter .
And that is something that Google can't get until they get that similar kind of traffic .
How are they going to get that traffic ?
It 's a chicken - and - egg problem . ”
So is Google collecting our utterances ?
It appears they are – check out Google ’s 411 Privacy Policy :
“ We also collect and store a copy of the voice commands you make to the service , so we can audit , evaluate , and improve the voice recognition capabilities of the service . ”
Assuming each call has four utterances – and costs 3 cents each on average – then it would cost Google about $ 8 M for 1 billion utterances ( or $ 80 M to match TellMe ’s 10 billion utterances ) .
A bargain compared to buying Tellme for $ 800 M .
I agree with Tim O’Reilly ’s conclusion that Google ’s launch of a directory assistance product was accelerated ( and is driven ) by their desire to compete with Microsoft .
But one thing Tim did n’t discuss is the privacy implications of Google ’s actions .
Google is recording and storing voice prints of all users - and it's not a stretch to imagine that they are matching them up to caller - id numbers to build out user profiles .
And this is very valuable data to have .
Collect enough voice signatures and you can tell if a caller is a male or a female – and possibly even detect where they are from by their accent .
And Google ’s privacy policy lets them save your recordings for an undisclosed period of time .
Should Google own your voice ?
What privacy issues does that raise ?
All of the recent controversy about Google ’s privacy policy does n’t even contemplate them archiving your voice .
Given the high level of concern about Google ’s retention of text search logs , I imagine it wo n't be long until privacy advocates focus on this as well .
[ Insert shameless plug here ->
If you do n’t want your voice recordings saved , feel free to call 1- 800 - FREE411 -- they do n’t store any voice recordings … ]
I think it ’s important for consumers to recognize what they are “ paying ” for a free service .
With 1 - 800 - FREE411 , you ’re “ paying ” by listening to their advertisements .
With Google , you ’re paying by giving them your voice .
At least Ursula clearly disclosed her bargain to Ariel .
How to Bypass BIOS Passwords BIOS passwords can be add extra layer of security for desktop and laptop computers , and are used to either prevent a user from changing the BIOS settings or to prevent the PC from booting without a password .
BIOS passwords can also be a liability if a user forgot their passwords , or if a malicious user changes the password .
Sending the unit back to the manufacturer to have the BIOS reset can be expensive and is usually not covered in an a typical warranty .
However , there are a few known backdoors and other tricks of the trade that can be used to bypass or reset the BIOS password on most systems .
Backdoor Passwords
Many BIOS manufacturers have provided backdoor passwords that can be used to access the BIOS setup in the event you have lost your password .
These passwords are case sensitive , so you may wish to try a variety of combinations .
WARNING : Some BIOS configurations will lock you out of the system completely if you type in an incorrect password more than 3 times .
Read your manufacturers documentation for the BIOS setting before you begin typing in passwords .

Most Toshiba laptops and some desktop systems will bypass the BIOS password if the left shift key is held down during boot IBM Aptiva BIOS Press both mouse buttons repeatedly during the boot Using the Motherboard " Clear CMOS " Jumper or Dipswitch settings
Many motherboards feature a set of jumpers or dipswitches that will clear the CMOS and wipe all of the custom settings including BIOS passwords .
The locations of these jumpers / dipswitches will vary depending on the motherboard manufacturer and ideally you should always refer to the motherboard or computer manufacturers documentation .
If the documentation is unavailable , the jumpers / dipswitches can sometimes be found along the edge of the motherboard , next to the CMOS battery , or near the processor .
Some manufacturers may label the jumper / dipswitch CLEAR - CLEAR CMOS - CLR - CLRPWD - PASSWD - PASSWORD - PWD .
On laptop computers , the dipswitches are usually found under the keyboard or within a compartment at the bottom of the laptop .
Please remember to unplug your PC and use a grounding strip before reaching into your PC and touching the motherboard .
Once you locate and rest the jumper switches , turn the computer on and check if the password has been cleared .
If it has , turn the computer off and return the jumpers or dipswitches to its original position .
Removing the CMOS Battery
The CMOS settings on most systems are buffered by a small battery that is attached to the motherboard .
( It looks like a small watch battery ) .
If you unplug the PC and remove the battery for 10 - 15 minutes , the CMOS may reset itself and the password should be blank .
( Along with any other machine specific settings , so be sure you are familiar with manually reconfiguring the BIOS settings before you do this . )
Some manufacturers backup the power to the CMOS chipset by using a capacitor , so if your first attempt fails , leave the battery out ( with the system unplugged ) for at least 24 hours .
Some batteries are actually soldered onto the motherboard making this task more difficult .
Unsoldering the battery incorrectly may damage your motherboard and other components , so please do n't attempt this if you are inexperienced .
Another option may be to remove the CMOS chip from the motherboard for a period of time .
Note : Removing the battery to reset the CMOS will not work for all PC's , and almost all of the newer laptops store their BIOS passwords in a manner which does not require continuous power , so removing the CMOS battery may not work at all .
IBM Thinkpad laptops lock the hard drive as well as the BIOS when the supervisor password is set .
If you reset the BIOS password , but cannot reset the hard drive password , you may not be able to access the drive and it will remain locked , even if you place it in a new laptop .
IBM
Thinkpads have special jumper switches on the motherboard , and these should be used to reset the system .
For the past two months , the Busekros family has been fighting a court battle to regain custody of their 15 - year - old daughter , Melissa .
German police took her from her home here , and placed her in a psychiatric ward .
The reason :
She was being home - schooled , which violates Germany 's compulsory education law .
Melissa 's plight has struck a chord with US evangelicals , who often see home - schooling as a way to instill Christian values .
American evangelical groups have rushed to the family 's aid , providing legal counsel and lobbying the German parliament .
Many American Christians have reached out to the Busekros family , who now have two wicker baskets stuffed with hundreds of letters from supporters .
" It reminds us that we are not alone , that there are people standing behind us and giving us the strength to fight , " says Melissa 's mother , Gudrun .
The Busekros case is emblematic of the growing effort by US Christian legal organizations to take the " culture wars " overseas .
Pushing back against a perceived assault on their values by an increasingly secular society , the groups are striving to influence European law on issues ranging from home schooling to stem - cell research to gay marriage .
A few recent examples include :
• In Britain , the Alliance Defense Fund ( ADF ) , an organization founded by American evangelical leaders , is funding a lawsuit brought by a Christian man who was fired for refusing to work on Sunday .
It is also helping to develop the legal strategy .
• In Sweden , ADF played a key role in persuading the Supreme Court to dismiss charges against Ake Green , a pastor who was convicted of hate - crime charges after he delivered a sermon in which he called gays a " deep cancerous tumor in the entire society . "
• In Aruba and the Czech Republic , Pat Robertson 's legal organization , the American Center for Law and Justice ( ACLJ ) , helped defeat bills that would have legalized same - sex unions .
• In France , ACLJ affiliate ECLJ ( the European Center for Law and Justice ) , is staging a legal challenge against an antisect law that it says is being used to clamp down on evangelical Christian churches .
• And on the European Union level , ECLJ is lobbying to block funding for embryonic stem - cell research .
US courts eye European precedents
Why are American groups going to such lengths to shape the laws in other countries ?
" We realized that if we did n't try to mold precedents abroad , they could come back to hurt us , and that the American legal system as we know might change , " says Benjamin Bull , chief counsel for the ADF .
He notes that , for example , US judges have drawn on foreign precedents and international standards in several key cases , such as the Supreme Court 's 2003 ruling in Lawrence v. Texas , which legalized sodomy in the Lone Star State .
In Germany , one of ADF 's allied organizations , the Georgia - based International Human Rights Group ( IHRG ; formerly the European Defense Fund ) , has had a hand in more than 40 German home - schooling cases .
Last year , the group 's president , Joel Thornton , and a German lawyer appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of one home - schooling family .
They argued that forcing the family 's Christian children to attend public schools , where the curriculum sometimes runs counter to their beliefs , was a threat to religious freedom .
But the EU court rejected this argument , saying , " Schools represented society , and it was in the children 's interest to become part of that society . "
On the local level , however , IHRG and its German ally , Schuzh , have won several cases and scored some coups at the negotiating table .
Take , for instance , the case of the Twelve Tribes , a controversial evangelical movement that was founded in the US .
Followers live in small , communal groups largely cut off from society .
Until last August , a pocket of Twelve Tribes disciples in Bavaria had been locked in a struggle to keep their children out of public schools .
During that time , they had stacked up around ¤ 130,000 ( $ 175,000 ) in fines and seen seven fathers thrown in jail .
IHRG and Schuzh were able to persuade the Bavarian ministry of education to allow the group to set up its own school , where children learn creationism instead of evolution and forgo sex education .
The school is now up and running .
Daughter 's faith mocked
At the moment , IHRG and Schuzh are involved in more than a dozen home - schooling cases wending their way through the German court system and have appealed to the European Court of Human Rights to hear several of them .
One of their top priorities is the case of the 15 - year - old home - schooled girl Melissa Busekros .
Her parents say that her classmates would mock her faith , kneeling in front of her with their hands pressed together in prayer and saying , " Hail Mary . "
( Though the Busekroses are evangelical Christians , the students in heavily Roman Catholic Bavaria did n't appear to recognize the distinction . )
The last straw came when she started failing Latin and math , at which point her parents began home - schooling her .
After more than two years of trying to get Melissa back in school , state officials pulled her from her home in February and placed her in a psychiatric ward .
The Erlangen youth - welfare office declined to comment on her case , but a psychological evaluation that the office ordered said Melissa was suffering from emotional problems , including " school phobia , " and had to be removed from her home for own well - being .
She is now living with a foster family .
US group encourages confrontation
Mr. Thornton , IHRG 's president , has been meeting regularly with Melissa 's parents and other German home - schooling families since the organization was founded in 2004 .
Often , he says , he encourages them to invite confrontation so that he can draw media attention to their cases .
" I try to teach them the American attitude and understanding that this is a fight you can fight – that standing up for their beliefs in the court system is a God - given right , " he explains .
While Thornton works to educate European Evangelicals about the American approach to such legal battles , the European Center for Law and Justice is striving to educate American students about European law " from a Christian perspective . "
For the past several years , it has hosted a five - week summer session in Strasbourg for law students at Pat Robertson 's Regents University .
Much of the focus is on issues such as hate - crime laws and same - sex marriage .
The program culminates in a summit with international leaders .
Last year 's group included American Ambassador to the European Union C. Boyden Gray , former US Attorney General John Ashcroft , a deputy prime minister , and a handful of EU lawmakers .
The goal , says ECLJ attorney Roger Kiska , is " preparing the next generation of Christian lawyers to work on a global level . "

BACKGROUND INFORMATION : HUBBLE'S TOP SCIENCE FINDINGS
( An interactive version of this document is available in the " Related Links " section of this release . )
When Galileo used his homemade telescope 400 years ago to view mountains on the Moon , satellites circling Jupiter , and myriad stars in our Milky Way Galaxy , he launched a revolution that changed our view of an Earth - centered universe .
The launch of NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope aboard the space shuttle Discovery 15 years ago initiated another revolution in astronomy .
For the first time , a large telescope that sees in visible light began orbiting above Earth 's distorting atmosphere , which blurs starlight and makes images appear fuzzy .
Astronomers anticipated great discoveries from Hubble .
The telescope has delivered as promised and continues serving up new discoveries .
Astronomers and astrophysicists using Hubble data have published more than 4,000 scientific papers , on topics from the solar system to the very distant universe .
The following list highlights some of Hubble 's greatest achievements .
Shining a Light on Dark Matter
Astronomers used Hubble to make the first three - dimensional map of dark matter , which is considered the construction scaffolding of the universe .
Dark matter 's invisible gravity allows normal matter in the form of gas and dust to collect and build up into stars and galaxies .
The Hubble telescope played a starring role in helping to shed light on dark matter , which is much more abundant than normal matter .
Although astronomers cannot see dark matter , they can detect it in galaxy clusters by observing how its gravity bends the light of more distant background galaxies , a phenomenon called gravitational lensing .
Astronomers constructed the map by using Hubble to measure the shapes of half a million faraway galaxies .
The new map provides the best evidence to date that normal matter , largely in the form of galaxies , accumulates along the densest concentrations of dark matter .
The map , which stretches halfway back to the beginning of the universe , reveals a loose network of filaments that grew over time and intersect in massive structures at the locations of galaxy clusters .
Astronomers also used gravitational lensing in a previous study to make the first direct detection for the existence of dark matter .
Hubble teamed up with the Chandra X- ray Observatory , the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope , and the Magellan optical telescopes to make the discovery .
Astronomers found that dark matter and normal matter were pulled apart by the tremendous collision of two large clusters of galaxies , called the Bullet Cluster .
A Speedy Universe
By witnessing bursts of light from faraway exploding stars , Hubble helped astronomers discover dark energy .
This mysterious , invisible energy exerts a repulsive force that pervades our universe .
Several years later , Hubble provided evidence that dark energy has been engaged in a tug of war with gravity for billions of years .
Dark energy , which works in opposition to gravity , shoves galaxies away from each other at ever - increasing speeds , making the universe expand at an ever - faster pace .
But dark energy was n't always in the driver 's seat .
By studying distant supernovae , Hubble traced dark energy all the way back to 9 billion years ago , when the universe was less than half its present size .
During that epoch , dark energy was struggling with gravity for control of the cosmos , obstructing the gravitational pull of the universe 's matter even before it began to win the cosmic tug of war .
Dark energy finally won the struggle with gravity about 5 billion years ago .
By knowing more about how dark energy behaves over time , astronomers hope to gain a better understanding of what it is .
Astronomers still understand almost nothing about dark energy , even though it appears to comprise about 70 percent of the universe 's energy .
Galaxies from the Ground Up
Hubble provided solid evidence that galaxies grew over time to become the giant galaxies we see today .
The telescope snapped images of galaxies in the faraway universe in a series of unique observations : the Hubble Deep Fields , the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey , the Hubble Ultra Deep Field , and as part of an armada of observatories in the All - wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey .
Some of the galaxies existed when the cosmos was only 700 million years old .
The observations provided the deepest views of the cosmos in visible , ultraviolet , and near - infrared light .
In the most recent foray into the universe 's farthest regions , Hubble uncovered a rich tapestry of at least 50,000 galaxies .
The galaxies unveiled by Hubble are smaller than today 's giant galaxies , reinforcing the idea that large galaxies built up over time as smaller galaxies collided and merged .
Many of the galaxies are ablaze with star birth .
By studying galaxies at different epochs , astronomers can see how galaxies change over time .
The process is analogous to a very large scrapbook of pictures documenting the lives of children from infancy to adulthood .
The deep views also revealed that the early universe was a fertile breeding ground for stars .
Observations showed that the universe made a significant portion of its stars in a torrential firestorm of star birth that abruptly lit up the pitch - dark heavens just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang .
Though stars continue to be born today in galaxies , the star - birth rate is about half the rate of the opulent early years .
Planets , Planets Everywhere
Peering into the crowded bulge of our Milky Way Galaxy , Hubble looked farther than ever before to nab a group of planet candidates outside our solar system .
Astronomers used Hubble to conduct a census of Jupiter - sized extrasolar planets residing in the bulge of our Milky Way Galaxy .
Looking at a narrow slice of sky , the telescope nabbed 16 potential alien worlds orbiting a variety of stars .
Astronomers have estimated that about 5 percent of stars in the galaxy may have Jupiter - sized , star - hugging planets .
So this discovery means there are probably billions of such planets in our Milky Way .
Five of the newly found planet candidates represent a new extreme type of planet .
Dubbed Ultra -Short - Period Planets , these worlds whirl around their stars in less than an Earth day .
Astronomers made the discoveries by measuring the slight dimming of a star as a planet passed in front of it , an event called a transit .
The telescope also made the first direct measurements of the chemical composition of an extrasolar planet 's atmosphere , detecting sodium , oxygen , and carbon in the atmosphere of the Jupiter - sized planet HD209458 b .
Hubble also found that the planet 's outer hydrogen - rich atmosphere is heated so much by its star that it is evaporating into space .
The planet circles its star in a tight 3.5 - day orbit .
These unique observations demonstrate that Hubble and other telescopes can sample the chemical makeup of the atmospheres of alien worlds .
Astronomers could use the same technique someday to determine whether life exists on extrasolar planets .
Besides testing the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet , Hubble also made precise measurements of the masses of two distant worlds .
Monster Black Holes Are Everywhere
Hubble probed the dense , central regions of galaxies and provided decisive evidence that supermassive black holes reside in many of them .
Giant black holes are compact " monsters " weighing millions to billions the mass of our Sun .
They have so much gravity that they gobble up any material that ventures near them .
These elusive " eating machines " cannot be observed directly , because nothing , not even light , escapes their grasp .
But the telescope provided indirect , yet compelling , evidence of their existence .
Hubble helped astronomers determine the masses of several black holes by measuring the velocities of material whirling around them .
The telescope 's census of many galaxies showed an intimate relationship between galaxies and their resident black holes .
The survey revealed that a black hole 's mass is dependent on the weight of its host galaxy 's bulge , a spherical region consisting of stars in a galaxy 's central region .
Large galaxies , for example , have massive black holes ; less massive galaxies have smaller black holes .
This close relationship may be evidence that black holes co-evolved with their galaxies , feasting on a measured diet of gas and stars residing in the hearts of those galaxies .
The Biggest " Bangs " Since the Big Bang
Imagine a powerful burst of light and other radiation that can burn away the ozone in Earth 's atmosphere .
Luckily , flashes of such strong radiation occur so far away they will not scorch our planet .
These brilliant flashbulbs are called gamma-ray bursts .
They may represent the most powerful explosions in the universe since the Big Bang .
Hubble images showed that these brief flashes of radiation arise from far - flung galaxies , which are forming stars at enormously high rates .
Hubble 's observations confirmed that the bursts of light originated from the collapse of massive stars .
Astronomers using Hubble also found that a certain type of extremely energetic gamma-ray bursts are more likely to occur in galaxies with fewer heavy elements , such as carbon and oxygen .
The Milky Way Galaxy , which is rich in heavy elements released by many generations of stars , is therefore an unlikely place for them to pop off .
Planet Construction Zones
Astronomers used Hubble to confirm that planets form in dust disks around stars .
The telescope showed that a previously detected planet around the nearby star Epsilon Eridani is orbiting at a 30 - degree angle to our line of sight , the same inclination as the star 's dust disk .
Although astronomers had long inferred that planets form in such disks , this is the first time the two objects have been observed around the same star .
Some stars have more than one dust disk .
Hubble images of the nearby star Beta Pictoris revealed two such disks .
The observation confirmed a decade of speculation that a warp in the young star 's dust disk may actually be a second disk inclined to the star .
The best explanation for the second disk is that an unseen planet , up to 20 times Jupiter 's mass , is orbiting it and using gravity to sweep up material from the primary disk .
The telescope also witnessed the early stages of planet formation when it observed a blizzard of particles around a star .
The fluffy particles are evidence of planet formation because they were probably shed by much larger , unseen , snowball - sized objects that had collided with each other .
Going Out in a Blaze of Glory
A Sun - like star ends its life in a blaze of glory , much as trees display colorful foliage in autumn before the barrenness of winter .
Sun - like stars die gracefully by ejecting their outer gaseous layers into space .
Eventually , the outer layers begin to glow in vibrant colors of red , blue , and green .
The colorful glowing shroud is called a planetary nebula .
Hubble revealed unprecedented details of the death of Sun - like stars .
Ground - based images suggested that many of these objects had simple spherical shapes .
Hubble showed , however , that their shapes are more complex .
Some look like pinwheels , others like butterflies , and still others like hourglasses .
Turning its vision to the tattered remains of a massive star 's explosive death , Hubble helped astronomers rewrite the textbooks on exploding stars .
The telescope 's observations of Supernova 1987A showed that the real world is more complicated and interesting than anyone could imagine .
Hubble began observing the supernova shortly after the telescope was launched in 1990 .
Among Hubble 's findings were three mysterious rings of material encircling the doomed star .
The telescope also spied brightened spots on the middle ring 's inner region , caused by an expanding wave of material from the explosion slamming into it .
How Old is the Universe ?
Hubble observations allowed astronomers to calculate a precise age for the universe using two independent methods .
The findings reduced the uncertainty to 10 percent .
The first method relied on determining the expansion rate of the universe , a value called the Hubble constant .
In May 1999 a team of astronomers obtained a value for the Hubble constant by measuring the distances to nearly two dozen galaxies , some as far as 65 million light - years from Earth .
By obtaining a value for the Hubble constant , the team then determined that the universe is about 13 billion years old .
In the second method astronomers calculated a lower limit for the universe's age by measuring the light from old , dim , burned - out stars , called white dwarfs .
The ancient white dwarf stars , as seen by Hubble , are at least 12 to 13 billion years old .
Quasars , the Light Fantastic
Quasars have been so elusive and mysterious that the hunt to define them would have taxed even the superior analytical skills of detective Sherlock Holmes .
Since their discovery in 1963 , astronomers have been trying to crack the mystery of how these compact dynamos of light and other radiation , which lie at the outer reaches of the universe , produce so much energy .
Quasars are no larger than our solar system but outshine galaxies of hundreds of billions of stars .
These light beacons have left trails of evidence and plenty of clues , but scientists have only just begun to understand their behavior .
Astronomers using Hubble tracked down the " homes " of quasars to the centers of faraway galaxies .
Hubble 's observations bolstered the idea that quasars are powered by a gush of radiation unleashed by black holes in the cores of these galaxies .
A Shattered Comet Rocks Jupiter
Imagine setting off every atomic bomb on Earth all at once .
Now imagine repeating such an apocalyptic explosion two dozen times in a week !
Unleashing such energy would destroy Earth 's surface , but the giant planet Jupiter hardly flinched when it underwent such a catastrophe in 1994 .
Hubble provided a ringside seat to a once - in - a - millennium event when two dozen chunks of a comet smashed into Jupiter .
The telescope snapped dramatic images of massive explosions that sent towering mushroom - shaped fireballs of hot gas into the Jovian sky .
The doomed comet , called Shoemaker - Levy 9 , had been pulled apart two years earlier by Jupiter 's gravity .
Each impact left temporary black , sooty scars in Jupiter 's planetary clouds .
Pluto and Beyond
Hubble explored the outskirts of our solar system to study Pluto and other icy objects .
The telescope spied two new moons orbiting Pluto .
Named Nix and Hydra , the moons have the same color as Charon , Pluto 's only other known moon .
The moons ' common color further reinforces the idea that all three moons were born from a single titanic collision between Pluto and another similarly sized Kuiper Belt object billions of years ago .
Hubble also searched the solar system 's last frontier , a region called the Kuiper Belt , to view the frozen bodies residing there .
The Kuiper Belt contains the relics from the early solar system , and may offer clues to the origin and evolution of our Sun and planets .
With Hubble 's help , astronomers discovered that an object named Eris is only slightly larger than Pluto .
The diameter of Eris is 1,490 miles .
By comparison , Pluto 's diameter , as measured by Hubble , is 1,422 miles .
Studying the solar system 's farthest known object , unofficially named Sedna , Hubble provided surprising evidence that the frozen body does not appear to have a companion moon of any substantial size .
Turning its gaze closer to Earth , Hubble found that Ceres , the largest known asteroid , may be a " mini planet , " sharing many characteristics of rocky , terrestrial planets like Earth .
Ceres ' mantle , which wraps around the asteroid 's core , may even be composed of water ice .
Ceres resides in the asteroid belt , a region between Mars and Jupiter .
In its 17 years of exploring the heavens , NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has made nearly 800,000 observations and snapped nearly 500,000 images of more than 25,000 celestial objects .
Hubble does not travel to stars , planets and galaxies .
It takes pictures of them as it whirls around Earth at 17,500 miles an hour .
In its 17 - year lifetime , the telescope has made nearly 100,000 trips around our planet .
Those trips have racked up plenty of frequent - flier - miles , about 2.4 billion , which is the equivalent of a round trip to Saturn .
The 17 years ' worth of observations has produced more than 30 terabytes of data , equal to about 25 percent of the information stored in the Library of Congress .
Each day the orbiting observatory generates about 10 gigabytes of data , enough information to fill the hard drive of a typical home computer in two weeks .
The Hubble archive sends about 66 gigabytes of data each day to astronomers throughout the world .
Astronomers using Hubble data have published nearly 7,000 scientific papers , making it one of the most productive scientific instruments ever built .
The service offers anonymous use of the internet
Relakks , as the service is known , allows users to send and receive files through a heavily - encrypted connection .
It claims to be the first commercial darknet , a virtual network set up to share files between trusted users .
The service is endorsed by political group the Pirate Party which is running for election in Sweden under a banner to reform the country 's copyright laws .
" There are many legitimate reasons to want to be completely anonymous on the internet , " said Rickard Falkvinge , chairman of the Pirate Party .
" The right to exchange information in private is fundamental to the democratic society .
Without a safe and convenient way of accessing the internet anonymously , this right is rendered null and void . "
Closed groups
A darknet is a cordoned - off , anonymised section of the net where users can meet , chat and swap data .
Usually darknets are confined to small tight - knit groups such as hackers who use the secure connections to distribute information and hacking tools .
We do n't have any control over what is being sent over the network but that 's the point
Rickard Falkvinge
Many are invitation - only services where potential members have to upload material to prove themselves to the group before they are granted full access .
Similar identity - hiding tools such as Tor are used by net dissidents in countries like China to avoid persecution for their activities on the web .
Some previous attempts to launch large scale anonymous networks , such as Nullsoft 's Waste program have been unsuccessful .
After its release in 2003 , Waste was removed from distribution by Nullsoft 's parent company AOL .
Unique service
The new system claims to be the world 's first commercial darknet .
It is provided by Swedish company Relakks and is endorsed by the Pirate Party .
It works by giving a user 's computer a new IP address , the unique number the machine uses to identify itself and communicate with other machines over the net .
Copyright law and file - sharing are divisive topics in Sweden
IP numbers allocated by your internet service provider ( ISP ) can be used to trace and identify a specific computer on a network .
Computers using the Relakks system look like they have a Swedish IP address , no matter where they are in the world .
Users can then share files , such as music or films , with any other users .
In theory anyone monitoring user 's online activities will not be able to trace their geographical location .
The Pirate Party acknowledge that the service could be used to distribute copyright material or other content such as images of child abuse .
" We hear the argument a lot , " Mr Falkvinge told the BBC News website .
" No , we do n't have any control over what is being sent over the network but that 's the point .
" People who want to hide their activities online already have the means to do so .
We 're just giving those tools to the general public . "
Democratic rights
File sharing and copyright law is a divisive topic in Sweden .
Until recently the country was a hotbed of piracy where films , music and software were readily swapped online .
Last year , it outlawed the unauthorised downloading of copyrighted movies and music in an attempt to curb piracy , after criticism from Hollywood .
What is the difference between trusting them and trusting my own ISP not to give me away ?
Smirnov
The Pirate Party was launched in part to temper what they say are " aggressive " tactics by the entertainment industry to enforce copyright infringement .
They say techniques such as tracing IP addresses threaten privacy and democracy .
The Relakks service , they say , offers people the ability to use the internet " without fear of being monitored or logged " .
It costs five euro ( £3 ) per month with some of the funds going towards supporting the Pirate Party .
However , not everyone is convinced that it is what it claims to be .
Many dispute whether Relakks really is the first commercial darknet .
Other services like Hamachi and Groove already offer similar services .
In a forum on the website of the US Pirate Party , an affiliated but distinct political group , a post by a user called Smirnov also questioned whether the service is really anonymous .
" You can't connect to Relakks anonymously , because then they'd have no way of verifying you are a paying customer - so Relakks knows who you really are when all your traffic goes through them .
" What is the difference between trusting them and trusting my own ISP not to give me away ? "

｢権利｣の反対語は｢義務｣、と小学生のときに覚えた。｢｢具体的｣の反対は｢抽象的｣｣と同じくらい小学生にとってはレベルの高い反対語知識。ただ、意味まではわかっていなかった。
そうかだから権利の反対語は義務なんだ、と理解したのは、大学時代の一般教養の法学の授業で。
誰かと誰かが物の売り買いをする。
売り手には｢代金をもらう権利｣と｢物を渡す義務｣
買い手には｢代金を支払う義務｣と｢物を受け取る権利｣
売り手の権利と買い手の義務、売り手の義務と買い手の権利が対応している。
おお、権利と義務は反対語だ!
だから私は｢権利には義務が伴う｣という言葉は、｢Aさんの権利には、Aさんの権利を実現するというBさんの義務が伴う｣(a)*1という意味かと思っていた。で、その言葉に納得していた。言論の自由と言う国民の権利があるなら、その権利を侵害しないという国家の義務がある、ということになる。
ところが｢権利には義務が伴う｣で検索すると、ぱっとしか見ていないけれど、どうやら世間では｢Aさんに権利があるならAさんは義務も負う｣(b)という意味で使われることがあるようだ。入学式の訓辞とかで。
売り買いだと確かに売り手は権利も義務も同時に負う。その種のものは確か双務契約とかいうのだっけ。でも贈与みたいに贈り手が｢物を渡す義務｣貰い手が｢物をもらう権利｣と、かたっぽが権利だけ、もうかたっぽが義務だけ、という類型の行動だってある。だから(b)の解釈にはうーむ納得できない。権利に義務が伴う、権利と義務がきれいに対応するってのは(a)みたいな関係なんだから*2。
｢ Aさんの権利には 、Aさんの権利を実現するというBさんの義務が伴う、だからAさんは自分の色々な権利を他人に尊重してもらいたいなら、Aさんが尊重してほしいのと同じ権利を他の人が主張したときには、それを実現する義務をAさんは負うべきだね｣(c)という理解なら納得できる。間をすっとばすと(b)のように見えるが、(a)がもともとの意味なのだ。
けど、どうもなあ、 ｢ " 小学生 " たるものお席に静かに座っていられなければならない( " 小学生 "
には落ち着いて着席し続ける能力が伴う)｣くらいの感覚で｢権利には義務が云々｣って言っているように思えると気になる。
注：6日のエントリの｢追記2｣にて｢気になる理由｣２つ。
あ、そうか、｢権利と義務ってのは双務契約みたいにセットになっているのが普通なんだよ、だから権利には義務が伴うんだよ｣(d)という意味で言っていると考えればいいのか。(b)の限定版。双務契約じゃない類型の契約は例外とみなす、と。(さっき自然債務を除くという注を打ったときに思い至った。私は(a)( c)で自然債務を例外として除いた上で｢権利には義務が〜｣を理解したわけだが、それなら、双務契約じゃない契約おもいだした片務契約を例外として除けば(b ) ( d ) の理解もありだ。 )
めでたく自己完結 。
この項は 、http://d.hatena.ne.jp/good2nd/20070504/1178246705を読んで、憲法改正がらみで権利には義務が云々をよく見かけるよなあ、と思ったことがきっかけで書きました。*3

In the typical presidential election , conservative Christians who have some understanding of the benefits of liberty and limited government and do n’t blindly follow the Republican Party do one of three things : they do n’t vote , they “ waste ” their vote on a third party , or else they hold their nose , close their eyes , stop their ears , and fight a gag reflex as they vote for the Republican candidate because they consider him to be the lesser of two evils .
But most of these Christians have short memories , for when the lesser evil turns out to be just as evil as the greater evil , or sometimes even worse , they generally repeat the process all over again .
The newest individual to announce that he is seeking the Republican nomination for president is Ron Paul .
He formally declared his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination on March 12 , 2007 , when he appeared as a guest on C - SPAN .
Ron Paul is a veteran .
He is a physician .
He currently represents the 14th district in Texas ( south of Houston ) in the U.S. House of Representatives , a seat which he has held since 1997 .
He previously represented Texas ’s 22nd district in 1976 and again from 1979 to 1985 .
Dr. Paul was the Libertarian Party nominee for president in 1988 .
He is the former honorary chair of the Republican Liberty Caucus .
He consistently scores a perfect 100 on The New American magazine ’s “ Conservative Index . ”
He has received many awards and honors during his career in Congress from organizations such as the National Taxpayers Union , Citizens Against Government Waste , Council for a Competitive Economy , and Young Americans for Freedom .
But will he be the candidate of the Christian Right ?
By the Christian Right ’s own criteria , their candidate ought to be Ron Paul .
Ron Paul is a man of faith .
He is a Protestant Christian and a regular churchgoer .
Ron Paul is pro-life .
As a specialist in obstetrics / gynecology , he has delivered more than 4,000 babies .
Dr. Paul is not just an opponent of partial - birth abortion ; he is an opponent of abortion itself .
He is also opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research .
Ron Paul is a believer in family values .
Unlike many Christian “ leaders ” and Republican politicians who have admitted to adulterous affairs and / or been married multiple times , Dr. Paul has been married to the same woman for fifty years .
He and his wife have been blessed with five children and seventeen grandchildren .
Ron Paul is opposed to same - sex marriage .
Although he does n’t want to strip homosexuals of their civil rights , he has voted to prohibit federal funding for the joint adoption of a child between individuals who are not related by blood or marriage .
Ron Paul is a patriot .
He served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1967 .
He opposes federal court jurisdiction over the question of whether the phrase “ under God ” should be included in the pledge of allegiance .
Ron Paul is opposed to unrestricted immigration .
Because he believes that true citizenship requires cultural connections and an allegiance to the United States , he favors an end to birthright citizenship .
And because he believes that it insults legal immigrants , he does not favor amnesty for illegal immigrants in any form .
He opposes welfare state subsidies for illegal immigrants that alienate taxpayers and breed suspicion of immigrants .
Dr. Paul also believes that all federal government business should be conducted in English .
Ron Paul is opposed to gun control .
Not only does he believe that gun control makes people demonstrably less safe , he also thinks it ’s a myth that gun control reduces crime .
Representative Paul introduced legislation in Congress that would have repealed waiting periods and instant background checks .
Ron Paul is a strict constitutionalist .
He never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution .
He has consistently voted to lower or abolish federal taxes , spending , and regulation .
Congressman Paul was recently recognized , for the tenth year in a row , as a “ Taxpayer ’s Friend ” by the National Taxpayers Union .
Ron Paul is opposed to the United Nations .
He has introduced legislation to withdraw the United States from the UN .
Dr. Paul believes that the UN is rife with corruption .
It serves as a forum for rampant anti-Americanism .
Instead of being reformed , the UN needs to be renounced .
Dr. Paul is against any kind of world government or new world order .
Ron Paul is the premier advocate for liberty in politics today .
He believes in absolute religious and political liberty for all Americans .
He strongly supports private property rights .
He believes that government exists to protect the life , liberty , and property of its citizens .
But even though he appears to live up to the usual criteria of the Christian Right , the question still remains : Will Ron Paul be the candidate of the Christian Right ?
As a Christian , I admire Dr. Paul ’s principled stand on many issues , but I do n’t believe the leadership of the Christian Right will embrace him .
I think they love centralization more than federalism .
I think they love political power more than liberty .
I think they love war more than peace .
I think they love politicians more than principles .
I think they love faith - based socialism more than the free market .
And I think they love the state more than God Almighty .

The national addiction to junk food is leaving millions malnourished - with some suffering conditions more usually associated with African famine victims .
The number of hospital patients diagnosed with malnutrition has risen by 44 per cent in just five years , with almost 4,000 cases last year .
But experts warn this is just the tip of the iceberg , estimating that up to six percent of the population - or 3.6 million people - are malnourished .
They say our growing reliance on fast food , coupled with soaring rates of binge - drinking , means many are lacking the vitamins and minerals essential for health .
The result , in the most extreme cases , is pot-bellies , wasted limbs and emaciated bodies - all conditions more usually associated with famine victims in the developing world .
While malnutrition can be fatal , in more mild forms it can cause a host of symptoms that impact on every day life , from hair loss and muscle wastage to food cravings and lethargy .
No age - group is exempt and treatment of malnutrition cost the NHS more than £ 7.3 billion a year - more than twice the annual obesity bill .
Joining forces to highlight the scale of the problem , doctors and celebrity chefs warned that obesity was far from the only consequence of a fast food diet , high in fat and sugar and low in vitamins and minerals .
Dr Mike Stroud , a University of Southampton expert who helped draw up government malnutrition guidelines , said : " The modern diet is not providing enough vitamins .
" Malnourishment is going to make you more vulnerable to illnesses and less able to cope with them . "
Dr Alistair McKinlay , an Aberdeen University gastro - enterologist and one of Britain 's leading authorities on malnutrition , said : " If you are young an well , you can still end up malnourished .
" In 75 per cent of people , the problem is not identified . "
Gordon Ramsay said it was up to parents to educate their children on healthy eating .
The chef , who is a father of four , said : " If we are going to be a healthy nation , then you 've got to discipline the parents .
" Children eat with their eyes .
They 're lazy .
" If you do n't tell them about what they 're eating , trust me , they will eat as much crap as they can when they get home .
" They get connected to junk food in a way that becomes obsessive . "
Jamie Oliver , who has relentlessly campaigned to improve the quality of school dinners , told the Independent on Sunday : " I think parents are unaware of how much junk their kids are eating and drinking .
" As well as the frightening rise in obesity , there 's a growing number of kids , of whatever shape and size , that simply are n't getting enough nutrients like iron , calcium and vitamins .
" It 's having a huge effect on their brainpower , behaviour and ability to concentrate and learn at school . "
The warning follows estimates that 40 per cent of hospital and care home residents are malnourished , with staff lacking the time to help the weak and elderly eat meals which are often unappealing
The British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition , a charity which tries to increase awareness of malnutrition , called for the screening of all hospital patients to be made mandatory .
Spokesman Rhonda Smith said : " We want more people to be identified as being clinically malnourished , so that appropriate treatment pathways can be put in place . "
Conservative peer Lord Hanningfield , who obtained the hospital figures , said : " It is time patients were routinely screened for malnutrition and offered specialist nutrition support . "
The call comes as Britain fights a rising tide of obesity .
A growing reliance on fast food and time - saving technology has led to the UK developing the worst weight problem in Europe , with almost a quarter of adults classed as obese .
Children fare little better , with obesity figures doubling among six - year - olds and trebling among 15 - year - olds in ten years .
Experts have warned that unless the Government acts now , an entire generation faces an old age blighted by heart disease , cancer , diabetes and other diseases brought on by obesity .
I ’ve read the little background material on Google ’s Base and still ca n’t see whether the material you put there can be found by other search engines .
I also cannot find evidence of an API that shares any standards for tags and structure .
Is Base open or closed ?
So far , closed .
What we need instead is a means of letting you tag and structure your data so it can be found reliably by any search engine no matter where it is on the internet .
That would stay true to the distributed internet Google has so masterfully exploited .
I wish I were hearing more noise from the microformats guys to act as competitors — or at least as pressure on Google for openness and standards .
Imagine if you could go to a page that lets you put in your resume or house ad or job ad and it spits out tagged XML you could put on the web anywhere to be found by anyone .
Or imagine putting tags on restaurant reviews you post on your blog so anyone could aggregate or search for , say , all the cuisine=mexican restaurants in location=chicago .
Well , you do n’t really have to imagine that .
If you aggreed on the tags , you could start doing that today via Del.icio.us and Technorati .
And imagine if you could go to Google or other services — e.g. , Indeed and SimplyHired for jobs or Baristanet for three Jersey towns — and see the tags they use so you can swarm around those tags and find and be found .
That ’s the openness we need .
If Google spearheads that with a truly open API that can be adapted by the community , then great .
That is our distributed marketplace .
But if not , then Google is only trying to recreate the centralized marketplaces of old — otherwise known as newspapers .
That worked for newspapers when they had monopolies .
They do n’t anymore .
Does Google think it has a monopoly ?
: Mark Pincus hopes
Google is not trying to recreate Walmart .
It ’s a heartfelt , practically tear - wrenching ode to what Google coulda shoulda been :
my other big question is whether google is opening this service to the same crawling it has benefitted from to the tune of $ 108 billion ? … my take is google has chosen between two paths .
one which i thought they were on was to be a platform to enable great things on the web .
google could have powered everything with its search engine , ad infrastructure , massive crawling and computing power .
it could have been a democratizing force , enabling small services to flourish in being found and in serving them a platform on which to innovate .
instead google has chosen to be merely another big corporate titan .
like microsoft , it ’s choosing to go for the gold , enriching their shareholders rather than enabling industries ….
like msft , google is now going after every other oppty around it , taking advantage of its trojan horse position .
suddenly every company is at risk .
companies as far away as walmart have to have a ‘ google strategy ’ .
today , vc ’s ask every new startup how they will compete with google .
( at least we dont have to answer the msft question any more . ) … in fact , google feels a like walmart today .
once the excitement over trying out their latest release wears off we are left with the realization that they are going to ultimately put the corner grocer ( being craigslist ) out of business , and suck value out of an economy not add back .
… one last thought to all those ‘ web 2.0 ’ers ’ listening .
WHEN ARE WE ALL GOING TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE THAT NONE OF US COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER ?
WE ALL COMPETE WITH GOOGLE , MSFT AND YAHOO .
the only chance we have of enabling an independent industry is to come together , leverage s resources , create and protect a level playing field .
otherwise , we are all in the business of creating great products in the hope we can sell to them before they build it .
how fucking boring is that ?
Right .
That is precisely why some of us are working on figuring out open ad marketplaces and why I wish the microformats guys were getting more ink pixels .
The answer to any monopoly — water to wicked witches everywhere — is openness .
: I ’ve been meaning to link to this PC4 Media post on microformats for months ; now I have the excuse and the memory to do it :
MicroFormats Enable Distributed Applications !
Exactly .
Microformats could be as big an innovation as databases were .
If databases let us store information .
Microformats let us access the world ’s databases .
Potentially !
Yes , APIs do this too .
But , microformats make the database ( or data store ) distributed .
Not controlled by one entity .
This could be as big as “ http ” .
If you do n’t get how microformats can change your business , prepare to be outdone .
: See also Fred Wilson on base .
: And see Umair Haque :
There ’s only one question that matters , strategically : is Base the AOL - style walled garden of the 00s ?
That is , are returns to info owned by Google going to be lower than decentralized info ? …
What that means is that Google keeps indexing the world ’s information , albeit at increasingly costly factor prices ; while superior returns begin flowing to reconstructors and smart aggregators .
This scenario devalues centralized mechanisms / walled gardens , like Base – because they ’re not part of the attention ecosystem ; they ’re part of GoogleWorld ( we really do need a name for all the info Google owns ) … .
But I think what it does do is begin to point to a growing vital point competitors can strike … .
Then there ’s Amazon , eBay , VCs , and media – all attention economy players , who seem totally intent on missing the tectonic shifts right under their feet , which are eroding all their returns .
The key question for any company today is :
How do you play in the distributed world ?
How do you stop the 1.0 insistence of having to control and own and how do you instead make money by enabling others ?
That was where Google ’s own gigantic growth was .
But sometimes it ’s hardest to learn the lessons you yourself teach .
Umair adds :
Another , marginally related point – it also points to the uncooling of Google .
I mean , Base ?
Can you get more Orwellian , lame , sinister , connected to all the wrong stuff ?
EG : Al Qaeda means “ the Base ” .

Good notes there from ROR and SimpyHired .
After receiving years of press so bad that the US Trade Representative is now calling for its head by name , AllofMP3.com has launched a press offensive of sorts .
After giving their first press conference earlier this year to counter the mounting criticism , AllofMP3 has given another one , this time to address the new bilateral trade agreement between the US and Russia that looks set to put them out of business .
John Kheit , an IP attorney for Chadbourne & Parke in New York , is representing AllofMP3 , and he had one basic point to make in the wake of the trade agreement : AllofMP3 is legal , and it 's not going anywhere .
Although the agreement indicates quite clearly that the Russians have agreed to brand AllofMP3 an illicit site , Kheit points out that diplomats can talk as much as they want , but AllofMP3 is n't illegal until judges decide .
" Legality is not decided by a legislative branch or an executive branch .
It 's decided by a court , " he said in response to a question from Ars Technica .
And no such ruling has been handed down .
The company also believes it is legal for US consumers to use , and has issued a lengthy statement outlining its position .
Kheit believes that AllofMP3 is currently legal under Russian copyright law , and he points to Article 39 of that law as proof .
The article , headed " Use of a Published Phonogram for Commercial Purposes Without Consent from the Phonogram Producer and the Performer " in its English translation , appears to allow collection societies like ROMS to issue licenses for music , even when they do not have the permission of the copyright holder .
That right only applies in three circumstances , though : public performance , broadcasting , and the " communication of the phonogram to the public by cable . "
It does not cover " the communication of the phonogram to the public . "
What does that mean , exactly ?
We 'll leave it to Russian IP attorneys to work that out , but section 39 provides the legal basis for AllofMP3 's claims of legitimacy .
The bilateral trade agreement specifies that Russia will change its laws by the middle of 2007 so that collection societies cannot act without the approval of copyright holders .
A plain reading of this condition indicates that AllofMP3 , whether legal now or not , will no longer be able to offer most of its music once the law is changed .
Still , Kheit insists , the company will abide by the law and will adapt as conditions warrant .
Also of interest was the claim that AllofMP3 has not been as badly damaged by the inability to accept Visa and MasterCard payments as many would suspect .
That 's because most users have credit with the site and only use it over time .
But as it grows increasingly difficult to add more money to one 's account , the company will start to feel the squeeze in the months to come unless they can work out alternative payment systems that are as safe and easy as paying directly by credit card .
The Bush administration announced yesterday the winner of a competition to design the nation ’s first new nuclear weapon in nearly two decades and immediately set out to reassure Russia and China that the weapon , if built , would pose no new threat to either nation .
If President Bush decides to authorize production and Congress agrees , the research could lead to a long , expensive process to replace all American nuclear warheads in the next few decades with new designs .
The first to be replaced with the new Reliable Replacement Weapon would be the W - 76 , a warhead for missiles deployed on submarines .
Officials said the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California would design the replacement warhead based on previously tested components , allowing the administration to argue that no new underground tests would be necessary before deploying the new weapon .

relatively hard CRIMINAL CUPBEARERS
An evil king has 1000 bottles of wine .
A neighboring queen plots to kill the bad king , and sends a servant to poison the wine .
The king 's guards catch the servant after he has only poisoned one bottle .
The guards do n't know which bottle was poisoned , but they do know that the poison is so potent that even if it was diluted 1,000,000 times , it would still be fatal .
Furthermore , the effects of the poison take one month to surface .
The king decides he will get some of his prisoners in his vast dungeons to drink the wine .
Rather than using 1000 prisoners each assigned to a particular bottle , this king knows that he needs to murder no more than 10 prisoners to figure out what bottle is poisoned , and will still be able to drink the rest of the wine in 5 weeks time .
How does he pull this off ?
BIRTHDAY TWINS Sheila and He-Man are twins ; Sheila is the OLDER twin .
Assume they were born immediately after each other , an infinitesimally small - but nonzero - amount of time apart .
During one year in the course of their lives , Sheila celebrates her birthday two days AFTER He - Man does .
How is this possible ?
10/28/2002 3:58 AM
Bonus :
What is the maximum amount of time by which Sheila and He - Man can be apart in their birthday celebrations during the same year ?
I think it 's more than two days .
Note : For both Sheila and He -Man , these birthday celebrations happen on the actual birthday date -- it cannot be a celebration that occurs at a date earlier or later than the actual birthday date for whatever reasons of convenience .
Also , the solution has nothing to do with the theory of relativity or any other over complicated nonsense like that .
CIRCULAR JAIL CELL
There is a circular jail with 100 cells numbered 1-100 .
Each cell has an inmate and the door is locked .
One night the jailor gets drunk and starts running around the jail in circles .
In his first round he opens each door .
In his second round he visits every 2nd door ( 2,4,6---) and shuts the door .
In the 3rd round he visits every 3rd door ( 3,6,9 ---) and if the door is shut he opens it , if it is open he shuts it .
This continues for 100 rounds ( i.e. 4,8,12 ---; 5,10,15 ---; ---; 49,98 etc. ) and exhausted the jailor falls down .
How many prisoners found their doors open after 100 rounds ?
100 PRISONERS AND A LIGHT BULB
>=P 100 prisoners are imprisoned in solitary cells .
Each cell is windowless and soundproof .
There 's a central living room with one light bulb ; the bulb is initially off .
No prisoner can see the light bulb from his or her own cell .
Each day , the warden picks a prisoner equally at random , and that prisoner visits the central living room ; at the end of the day the prisoner is returned to his cell .
While in the living room , the prisoner can toggle the bulb if he or she wishes .
Also , the prisoner has the option of asserting the claim that all 100 prisoners have been to the living room .
If this assertion is false ( that is , some prisoners still have n't been to the living room ) , all 100 prisoners will be shot for their stupidity .
However , if it is indeed true , all prisoners are set free and inducted into MENSA , since the world can always use more smart people .
Thus , the assertion should only be made if the prisoner is 100 % certain of its validity .
Before this whole procedure begins , the prisoners are allowed to get together in the courtyard to discuss a plan .
What is the optimal plan they can agree on , so that eventually , someone will make a correct assertion ?
Note 1 : ( 1/8/2003 3:51 PM
Update )
What is meant by optimal ?
If your solution is optimal , it means you can prove that no other algorithm can produce a lower average running time .
This is usually very hard to do though , and I would be surprised if anyone ever sends me such a proof .
So the best we can do in the meantime is try to beat the best average running time we know of .
The number to beat so far is around 3500 days .
So BEFORE YOU E-MAIL ME YOUR SOLUTION , check its average time to see if beats the 4000 day ballpark .
If you get a number around 27 - 28 years , then you 've found the solution most people who solve the puzzle come up with .
However , it 's not optimal .
Note 2 : ( 1/8/2003 3:49 PM

How to compute average running time ?
The preferred method is to do a probabilistic analysis using pencil and paper .
But if you have n't learned about stuff like that , a much simpler way is to just program your solution and run it maybe 100 times , recording how many days elapsed in each invocation .
Afterwards you should have an array of 100 numbers .
Now take the average of all them , and you 'll have an empirical average which is close to the theoretical one .

The problem statement used to say " The prisoners are allowed to get together one night to discuss a plan . "
In the forum , quite a few people mentioned the clever solution of simply having the planning meeting in the central living room , and then asserting that everyone has been there on the first day of the random selection process .
To assure that this problem is not so easily defeated , I have stipulated that the meeting happen in the courtyard .
Note 4 : Does anyone know where this riddle originated ?
I got it from a friend who got it from another friend who does n't know where it comes from .

5 CARD MAGIC TRICK
M this is a magic trick performed by two magicians , A and B , with one regular , shuffled deck of 52 cards .
A asks a member of the audience to randomly select 5 cards out of a deck .
the audience member -- who we will refer to as C from here on -- then hands the 5 cards back to magician A. after looking at the 5 cards , A picks one of the 5 cards and gives it back to C .
A then arranges the other four cards in some way , and gives those 4 cards face down , in a neat pile , to B .
B looks at these 4 cards and then determines what card is in C's hand ( the missing 5th card ) .
how is this trick done ?
Note 1 : There 's no secretive message communication in the solution , like encoded speech or ninja hand signals or ESP or whatever ... the only communication between the two magicians is in the logic of the 4 cards transferred from A to B .
Think of these magicians as mathematicians .
Note 2 : After you 've figured this one out , try 5 CARD MAGIC TRICK REDUX for the next level of difficulty .
Note 3 : This magic trick is originally credited to magician and mathematician Fitch Cheney .
THREE -WAY PISTOL DUEL you 're a cyborg in a pistol duel with two other cyborgs .
you have been programmed to fire pistols with an accuracy of 33 % .
the other two cyborgs shoot with accuracies of 100 % and 50 % , respectively .
the rules of the duel are one shot per-cyborg per-round .
the shooting order is from worst shooter to best shooter .
thus , you go first , the 50 % guy goes second , and the 100 % guy goes third ; repeat .
if a cyborg dies , we just skip his or her turn , obviously .
what should you shoot at in round 1 to maximize your chances of survival over time ?
CALENDAR CUBES
I a corporate business man has two cubes on his office desk .
every day he arranges both cubes so that the front faces show the current day of the month .
what numbers are on the faces of the cubes to allow this ?
Note :
You can't represent the day " 7 " with a single cube with a side that says 7 on it .
You have to use both cubes all the time .
So the 7th day would be " 07 " .
I also should note that this is a really sly problem .
Almost unfair .
FORK IN THE ROAD I
At a fork in the road between two cities , you see 2 people .
One always tells the truth , and comes from the city of safety .
The other person always lies and comes from the city of cannibals , where they will eat you .
They both look exactly the same .
You must choose one of the persons , and ask him one and only one question ( no compound questions either , such as " is this shirt red and which way to safety ? " ) .
What question could you ask to find out which path leads to the city of safety ?
Big Hint :
The answer is a very common question .
FORK IN THE ROAD II A traveler , on his way to a certain village A , reaches a road junction , where he can turn left or right .
He knows that only one of the two roads leads to village A , but unfortunately , he does not know which one .
Fortunately , he sees two twin - brothers standing at the road junction , and he decides to ask them for directions .
The traveler knows that one of the two brothers always tells the truth and the other one always lies .
Unfortunately , he does not know which one always tells the truth and which one always lies .
How can the traveler find out the way to village A by asking just one question to one of the two brothers ?
Note 1 : Much harder than the more commonly known FORK IN THE ROAD I .
Yes , they are different problems .
It 's worth noting that a solution to FORK IN THE ROAD II will work equally well on FORK IN THE ROAD I ; however , not necessarily the converse .
Note 2 : Actually , there 's yet another solution which solves both I and II equally well , and it is not that difficult to come up with .
EGG DROPPING you have two eggs .
you need to figure out how high an egg can fall from a 100 story building before it breaks .
the eggs might break from the first floor , or might even survive a drop from the 100th floor -- you have no a priori information .
what is the largest number of egg drops you would ever have to do to find the right floor ?
( i.e. what 's the most efficient way to drop the eggs and determine an answer ? ) you are allowed to break both eggs , as long as you identify the correct floor afterwards .
after you 've solved the above problem , generalize .
define the " break floor " as the lowest floor in a building from which an egg would break if dropped .
given an n story building and a supply of d eggs , find the strategy which minimizes ( in the worst case ) the number of experimental drops required to determine the break floor .
Note : Interestingly , the solution is similar to a commercial algorithm used for stress - testing the reliability of TCP / IP networks .
Got this from Spring 2002 CS170 , taught by Dr. Satish Rao . GREEDY PIRATES
A pirate ship captures a treasure of 1000 golden coins .
The treasure has to be split among the 5 pirates : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 in order of rank .
The pirates have the following important characteristics : infinitely smart , bloodthirsty , greedy .
Starting with pirate 5 they can make a proposal how to split up the treasure .
This proposal can either be accepted or the pirate is thrown overboard .
A proposal is accepted if and only if a majority of the pirates agrees on it .
What proposal should pirate 5 make ?
DAUGHTERS ' AGES Local Berkeley professors Dr. Demmel and Dr. Shewchuk bump into each other on Telegraph Ave .
They have n't seen each other since Vietnam .
Shewchuk hey !
how have you been ?
Demmel great !
i got married and i have three daughters now Shewchuk really ?
how old are they ?
Demmel well , the product of their ages is 72 , and the sum of their ages is the same as the number on that building over there ..
Shewchuk right , ok ... oh wait ... hmm , i still do n't know Demmel oh sorry , the oldest one just started to play the piano Shewchuk wonderful !
my oldest is the same age !
How old are the daughters ?
SINGLE - FILE HAT EXECUTION 10 straight - jacketed prisoners are on death row .
Tomorrow they will be arranged in single file , all facing one direction .
The guy in the front of the line ( he ca n't see anything in front of him ) will be called the 1st guy , and the guy in the back of the line ( he can see the heads of the other nine people ) will be called the 10th guy .
An executioner will then put a hat on everyone 's head ; the hat will either be black or white , totally random .
Prisoners cannot see the color of their own hat .
The executioner then goes to the 10th guy and asks him what color hat he is wearing ; the prisoner can respond with either " black " or " white " .
If what he says matches the color of the hat he 's wearing , he will live .
Else , he dies .
The executioner then proceeds to the 9th guy , and asks the same question , then asks the 8th guy ... this continues until all of the prisoners have been queried .
This is the night before the execution .
The prisoners are allowed to get together to discuss a plan for maximizing the number of lives saved tomorrow .
What is the optimal plan ?
After you have solved the above problem , generalize .
There are N prisoners and K different colors of hats .
What 's the optimal plan ?
Hint : if there are N prisoners , you can save N - 1 lives , guaranteed !
TRIANGLIA Trianglia is a jacked - up island where no road has a dead end , and all the crossroads are " Y " shaped .
The young prince of Trianglia mounts his horse , and is about to go on a quest to explore the land of Trianglia .
He gets to the road by his palace , when the mother queen comes out and shouts : " But Charles , how will you find your way back ? " .
" Do n't worry Elizabeth " , the prince replies , " I will turn right in every second crossroad to which I arrive , and left otherwise .
Thus I shall surely return to the palace sooner or later . "
Is the prince right ?
FOUR GHOST SHIPS
Four ghostly galleons – call them E , F , G and H , – sail on a ghostly sea so foggy that visibility is nearly zero .
Each pursues its course steadily , changing neither its speed nor heading .
G collides with H amidships ; but since they are ghostly galleons they pass through each other with no damage nor change in course .
As they part , H’s captain hears G’s say “ Damnation !
That ’s our third collision this night ! ”
A little while later , F runs into H amidships with the same effect ( none ) and H ’s captain hears the same outburst from F’s .
What can H’s captain do to avoid a third collision and yet reach his original destination , whatever it may be , and why will doing that succeed ?

CAMEL BANANA TRANSPORT
You have 3,000 bananas and a camel which can carry at most 1,000 bananas at a time .
The camel eats a banana before moving a unit .
You want to transport the bananas 1,000 units .
What is the maximum number of uneaten bananas that you can move 1,000 units ?
Problem source : 11th Grade Honors Precalculus , Dr. James J. Hogan High School INFINITE QUARTER SEQUENCE
You are wearing a blindfold and thick gloves .
An infinite number of quarters are laid out before you on a table of infinite area .
Someone tells you that 20 of these quarters are tails and the rest are heads .
He says that if you can split the quarters into 2 piles where the number of tails quarters is the same in both piles , then you win all of the quarters .
You are allowed to move the quarters and to flip them over , but you can never tell what state a quarter is currently in ( the blindfold prevents you from seeing , and the gloves prevent you from feeling which side is heads or tails ) .
How do you partition the quarters so that you can win them all ?
Hint 1 : Your algorithm should run in under 30 seconds .
Hint 2 : If an infinite number of quarters confuses you , try 100 .
VANISHING DOLLAR
Three men go to a cheap motel , and the desk clerk charges them a sum of $ 30.00 for the night .
The three of them split the cost ten dollars each .
Later the manager comes over and tells the desk clerk that he overcharged the men , since the actual cost should have been $ 25.00 .
The manager gives the bellboy $ 5.00 and tells him to give it to the men .
The bellboy , however , decides to cheat the men and pockets $ 2.00 , giving each of the men only one dollar .
Now each man has paid $ 9.00 to stay for the night , and 3 x $ 9.00 = $ 27.00 .
The bellboy has pocketed $ 2.00 .
But $ 27.00 + $ 2.00 = $ 29.00 .
Where is the missing $ 1.00 ?
WTF ?
ZENO'S PARADOX
M The Tortoise challenged the great warrior Achilles to a 100 meter foot race , claiming that he would win as long as Achilles granted him a little headstart .
Achilles laughed , for he was a mighty warrior swift of foot , whereas the Tortoise was heavy and slow .
" How long of a head start do you need ? " asked Achilles , smiling .
" Ten meters , " said the Tortoise .
Achilles laughs .
" OK , you will most definitely lose , but we can race if you really want . "
" Actually , I will most definitely win , and I can prove it to you with a simple argument , " said the Tortoise .
" Go on then , " Achilles replied , with less confidence than he felt before .
He knew he was the superior athlete , but he also knew the Tortoise had the sharper wits , and he had lost many a bewildering argument with him before this .
" Suppose , " began the Tortoise , " that you give me a 10 - meter head start .
Would you say that you could cover that 10 meters between us very quickly ? "
" Very quickly , " Achilles affirmed .
" And in that time , how far should I have gone , do you think ? "
" Perhaps a meter - no more , " said Achilles after a moment 's thought .
" Very well , " replied the Tortoise , " so now there is a meter between us .
And you would catch up that distance very quickly ? "
" Very quickly indeed ! "
" And yet , in that time I shall have gone a little way farther , so that now you must catch that distance up , yes ? "
" Ye -es , " said Achilles slowly .
" And while you are doing so , I shall have gone a little way farther , so that you must then catch up the new distance , " the Tortoise continued smoothly .
Achilles said nothing .
" And so you see , in each moment you must be catching up the distance between us , and yet I - at the same time - will be adding a new distance , however small , for you to catch up again . "
" Indeed , it must be so , " said Achilles wearily .
" And so you can never catch up , " the Tortoise concluded sympathetically .
" You are right , as always , " said Achilles sadly - and conceded the race .
Was it really impossible for Achilles to win the race ?
Explain .

DIFFERENTIATION DISASTER
M We know that the derivative of x2 with respect to x is 2x .
However , what if we rewrite x2 as the sum of x x's , and then take the derivative : d/ dx [ x2 ] = d/dx [ x + x + x + ... ( x times ) ] = d/dx [ x ] + d/ dx [ x ] + d/ dx [ x ] ... ( x times ) = 1 + 1 + 1 + ... ( x times ) = x
This argument shows that the derivative of x2 with respect to x is actually x .
So what 's going on here ?
Note :
Most people with some math experience can show that some part of the argument is erroneous .
As in simply , something does n't follow .
However , a full solution will explain why this argument attacks something that lies at the very heart of calculus itself , and that is what really explains why it 's erroneous .

CIGARETTES ON A TABLE
>=P
You have an infinite cache of cigarettes .
What is the maximum number of cigarettes you can place on a table so that every cigarette touches every other cigarette ?
( You ca n't bend the cigarettes . )
Rigorously prove that your number is optimal .
Note 1 : You can't just do a star configuration , like an asterisk .
Remember that a cigarette has a thickness , and can't be treated as a line of infinitesimally small width .
Thus , in an asterisk configuration of six cigarettes , there will be a hexagonal hole in the middle , and any cigarette would not be touching the cigarette opposite to it .
Also , you can't just make an octagonal ring of cigarettes , because then each cigarette would only be touching the cigarettes directly to the right and left of it -- the question wants every cigarette to touch each other directly , not just be somehow indirectly connected to every other cigarette .
Note 2 : Check out cigarettes .
shtml for my analysis so far ( spoiler warning : contains solution configurations for 6 and 7 cigarettes ) , and this bulletin board thread for what some others have thought about this problem .
Note 3 : Now that you have constructed an optimal configuration and proven it 's optimality , generalize .
Suppose you have an infinite cache of cylindrical widgets of height h and radius r. Derive a closed - form formula that calculates the number of widgets in the max clique configuration .
And send the formula to me please =)
I believe this can be done because this problem is referenced in this following Calvin University math assignment .

3 - BIT SENSORS
You have two 3 - bit sensors , A and B , that measure the same thing , whatever it is -- temperature of the room , radioactivity levels , whatever .
Both sensors are hooked up to the same CPU , which takes in the sensor readings .
You know that the sensors are designed so that their readings can be off by at most one bit .
We claim that if B knows that A has sent the CPU a 3 - bit sequence , then B only needs to send 2 bits , and the CPU will be able to reconstruct B's 3 - bit measurement , thereby conserving bandwidth .
How is this so ?
Hint :
See the maximum minimum Hamming distance riddle for some powerful ideas .

This riddle is actually related to some signal processing research I 'm doing at UC Berkeley .

MESSAGE RECONSTRUCTION
M alice sends different partial messages to a bunch of different receivers .
by partial , we mean that one message by itself does n't convey any meaningful information .
let us denote the set of receivers as R. the messages are designed such that if any n receivers get together , they can somehow pool their partial messages together to get a meaningful message -- alice 's intended message .
however , if any n - 1 or less receivers get together , they can't reconstruct anything meaningful whatsoever .
n < | R|. what kind of messages are being sent by alice , and what mathematical function do the receivers apply on their pooled partial data to determine the intended message ?
Note :
If you solved this riddle about 30 years ago , you could 've published a paper on it and earned a Ph.D. Unfortunately , someone 's already done that .
His full name is not very well known , but the initial of his last name is peppered across cyberspace .
MONOTONIC SUBSEQUENCE
M Consider a finite sequence of distinct integers .
A subsequence is a sequence formed by deleting some items from the original sequence without disturbing their relative ordering .
A subsequence is called monotone if it is either increasing ( each term is larger than the one before it ) or decreasing ( each term is smaller than the one before it ) .
For example , if the sequence is 4 , 6 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 1 , 2 , 9 , 8 , 10 , then 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 is a monotone ( increasing ) subsequence of length 4 and 6 , 5 , 2 is a monotone ( decreasing ) subsequence of length 3 . a )
Find a sequence of 9 distinct integers that has no monotone subsequence of length 4 . b)
Show that every such sequence of length 10 has a monotone subsequence of length 4 . c) Generalize .
How long must the sequence be to guarantee a monotone subsequence of length n?
7 BOOLEAN QUESTIONS
M I am thinking of an integer n with 0 <= n <= 15 .
To figure out what number I 'm thinking of , you can ask me 7 yes - or - no questions -- questions that can only be answered with either " yes " or " no " .
The questions must be independent of each other , their answers , and the order in which they are answered .
( So you ca n't ask a question like , " if the answer to the previous question was " yes " , then is n larger than 10 , otherwise is n even ? " )
When you ask me your seven questions , I am allowed to LIE about at most one of the answers .
What seven questions can you ask to determine n?
MEAN , MEDIAN , NEITHER
Alice i was driving on a highway recently for one hour at a constant and very special speed .
Bob what was so special about it ?
Alice the number of cars i passed was the same as the number of cars that passed me !
Bob your speed must have been the mean of the speeds of the cars on the road .
Alice or was it the median ?
Bob these two are often confused .
maybe it 's neither ?
we 'll have to think about this .
Was Alice 's speed the mean , median , or neither ?
Note : Assume that any car on the road drives at a constant nonzero speed of s miles per hour , where s is a positive inte - ger .
And suppose that for each s , the cars driving at speed s are spaced uniformly , with d(s ) cars per mile , d(s ) being an integer .
And because each mile looks the same as any other by the uniformity hypothesis , we can take mean and median to refer to the set of cars in a fixed one - mile segment , the half - open interval [ M , M+1 ) , at some instant .
UPSIDE - DOWN LCD DISPLAY
In an LCD display some numbers , when viewed upside - down , are images of other numbers .
For example , 1995 becomes 5661 .
The fifth number that can be read upside down is 8 , and the 15th is 21 , which is 12 when viewed upside - down .
What is the millionth number that is meaningful upside - down ?
HOTEL KEY CARD
A certain hotel room lock is opened by scanning a key card .
In theory , one enters the room by inserting and removing the key card once .
In practice , however , the key card is ambiguously labeled , so that either of two orientations might be the correct orientation of the card .
In theory , of course , one could just try one orientation , and if it did n't work try the other .
In practice , however , the card reader sometimes fails , so that after trying each orientation once , one may still not have gained access to the room .
A few more details : ( a) Either of the two orientations is equally likely to be cor- rect .
( b)
The success rate of a correctly oriented card is p with 0 < p < 1 . ( c ) Failure on either side of the card is indistinguishable , so it does not give any information about whether the orientation of the card was correct .
( d) An attempted scan takes 1 second to succeed or fail ; reversing the orientation also takes 1 second .
The last property means that in 3 seconds one could try one orientation 3 times or each orientation once ( using the middle second to flip it over ) .
In either case , of course , one might still be standing in the hall and need to decide what to do next .
So what attempt strategy would you use to enter the room ?
Why ?
Feel free to consider fixed values of p ( p = .5 or p = .9 , for example ) as special cases .
What if p is fixed but unknown ?
CARD GAME
Alice " Here 's the deal .
You give me $ 10 .
Then I will deal four cards ( from a regular 52 card deck ) , chosen randomly , face down .
You get to look at # 1 first and decide whether to keep it .
If not , look at # 2 and decide whether to keep that one .
If not look at # 3 , and decide .
If you do n't take that , then # 4 is your choice .
If your chosen value is n , I will pay you $n .
Then we can reshuffle the entire deck , you give me another $ 10 , and we can play again , and again , and again . "
Bob " Hmmm .... I need a good strategy to beat you at this game , but I think I can do it . "
Help Bob out with a strategy that will win .
Note that the cards all have face value with the following exceptions : Ace=1 , Jack = 11 , Queen = 12 , and King = 13 .
INFINITE COIN FLIPS Given a coin with probability p of landing on heads after a flip , what is the probability that the number of heads will ever equal the number of tails assuming an infinite number of flips ?
ENVELOPE GAMBLE I
There are two envelopes in front of you each with a non -zero sum of money .
You are informed one has twice as much money as the other .
You are then allowed to select either envelope and keep the money inside .
After you select one and before opening it you are given the option to change your mind and switch to the other one ?
You think to yourself that if your envelope has x dollars there is a 50 % chance the other one has x/2 dollars and a 50 % chance it has 2 x dollars .
The expected return , you compute , is .5[.5 x + 2 x ] =1.25 x which seems like a favorable gamble .
Do you switch and why ?
Assume you are neither risk averse nor risk prone , in other words you will take any good gamble and avoid any bad one .
BUTTON TRAP ROOM
You are trapped in a small phone booth shaped room .
In the middle of each side of the room there is a hole .
In each hole there is a push button that can be in either an off or on setting .
You can't see in the holes but you can reach your hands in them and push the buttons .
You can't tell by feel whether they are in the on or off position .
You may stick your hands in any two holes at the same time and push neither , either , or both of the buttons as you please .
Nothing will happen until you remove both hands from the holes .
You succeed if you get all the buttons into the same position , after which time you will immediately be released from the room .
Unless you escape , after removing your hands the room will spin around , disorienting you so you can't tell which side is which .
How can you escape ?
Now generalize .
You are in a room with N sides , each side having a hole with a push button .
What is the minimum number of hands you need to escape the trap room ?
Note : Regarding the original setup with N = 4 , the fewest possible turns that I know of is seven .
HEAT SEEKING MISSILES
M Four heat - seeking missiles are initially placed at the corners of a square with side length s. Each missile flies at a constant speed toward the missile on its left .
Describe the path each missile takes until it collides with the rest in the square 's center .
What is this path 's length ?
Generalize to n missiles on a regular n- gon .
MOUSE EATING CHEESE CUBES
A cubic piece of cheese has been subdivided into 27 subcubes ( so that it looks like a Rubik 's Cube ) .
A mouse starts to eat a corner subcube .
After eating any given subcube it goes on to another adjacent subcube .
Is it possible for the mouse to eat all 27 subcubes and finish with the center cube ?
21 SQUARES
CPU
The figure below is a square composed of 21 smaller squares .
Each of the 21 smaller squares has a side of integer length and all 21 are different sizes .
Find any solution for the size of the 21 smaller squares .
TRUTHS , FALSEHOOD , RANDOMNESS
Of three men , one man always tells the truth , one always tells lies , and one answers yes or no randomly .
Each man knows which man is who .
You may ask three yes / no question to determine who is who .
If you ask the same question to more than one person you must count it as question used for each person whom you ask .
What three questions should you ask ?
24 I Create the number 24 using only these numbers once each : 3 , 3 , 7 , 7 .
You may use only the following functions : + , - , * , /.
This is not a trick question ; for example , the answer does not involve a number system other than base 10 and does not allow for decimal points .
STATISTICS LIES
The religious keeper of the web page The Premature Death of Rockstars argues that rock stars do not live as long as the general population .
He states that the average age at death of rock stars is 36.9 and 75.8 for the general population .
What is wrong with this use of these statistics ?
This is an illustrated example of lying with statistics .
13 PIRATES
Thirteen pirates put their treasure in a safe .
They decide that the safe should be able to be opened if any majority of pirates agree but not be able to be opened if any minority agree .
The pirates do n't trust each other so they consult a locksmith .
The locksmith puts a specific number of locks on the safe such that every lock must be opened to open the safe .
Then he distributes keys to the pirates such that every pirate has some but not all of the keys .
Any given lock can have multiple keys but any given key can only open one lock .
What is the least number of locks required ?
12 BALLS
You have 12 identical - looking balls .
One of these balls has a different weight from all the others .
You also have a two - pan balance for comparing weights .
Using the balance in the smallest number of times possible , determine which ball has the unique weight , and also determine whether it is heavier or lighter than the others .
GUESS NUMBER FOR MONEY I I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100 .
You can guess a number and I will tell you if it is high or low .
If you get it right on the first guess I will pay you $ 5 , on the second guess $ 4 , and so on .
If you get it right on the sixth guess I will pay you nothing , on the seventh guess you owe me $ 1 , on the eight you owe me $ 2 , and so forth ( 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 ...) Q1 ) Should you play the game with me ?

MAXIMUM MINIMUM HAMMING DISTANCE
M , >=P
You have n bitstrings , each of length k .
Define the Hamming distance between two bitstrings as the number of bits on which the strings differ ( e.g. the Hamming distance between 0000 and 1100 is 2 ) .
Assume the strings have been chosen such that the Hamming distance between * any * two strings is maximized .
In other words ( but perhaps more confusing words ) , the minimum Hamming distance of the set has been maximized .
Write down a closed form formula which computes the maximum minimum Hamming distance for any given n and k .
Note 1 : Here is the notion of Hamming space , summarized in a useful picture :
This is the Hamming space for k=3 .
Start at a vertex .
Change one bit to cross one edge .
Change two bits to cross two edges .
Change three bits to cross three edges .
Note the important difference between Hamming space and the everyday notion of numeric distance .
Whereas we would normally say that 100 ( 4 in binary ) and 000 ( 0 in binary ) are 4 units apart , in Hamming space , they are only one unit apart , and very close .
Note 2 : This is a problem that my research partner and I came across while studying error correcting codes .
There must exist a closed - form formula , but we have been unable to derive it or find it .
For a second , it seemed like we had it , but then it was wrong .
It most likely involves mods and floors and ceilings .

>=P
The professor for class Logic 315 says on Friday : " We 're going to have a surprise quiz next week , but I 'm not telling you what day ... if you can figure out what day it will be on , I 'll cancel the quiz . "
The students get together and decide that the quiz can't be on Friday , as if the quiz does n't happen by Thursday , it 'll be obvious the quiz is on Friday .
Similarly , the quiz can't be on Thursday , because we know it wo n't be on Friday , and if the quiz does n't happen by Wednesday , it 'll be obvious it's on Thursday ( because it can't be on Friday ) .
Same thing for Wednesday , Tuesday and Monday .
So it can't be on ANY day , so there 's no quiz next week ! "
They tell the professor , who smiles and says , " Well , nice to see you 're thinking about it . "
On Tuesday , the professor gives the quiz , totally unexpected !
What 's the flaw in the students ' thinking ?
Note : ( Update 1/28/2003 2:40 AM )
There are many possible solutions , but I have included the >=P symbol because supposedly the math community has not agreed on an official explanation .
I do n't fully understand why this is so .
Forum thread : click here SIMULTANEOUS HAT COLOR GUESSING
Three players enter a room and a red or blue hat is placed on each person 's head .
The color of each hat is determined by a coin toss , with the outcome of one coin toss having no effect on the others .
Each person can see the other players ' hats but not his own .
No communication of any sort is allowed , except for an initial strategy session before the game begins .
Once they have had a chance to look at the other hats , the players must simultaneously guess the color of their own hats or pass .
The group shares a hypothetical $ 3 million prize if at least one player guesses correctly and no players guess incorrectly .
The same game can be played with any number of players .
The general problem is to find a strategy for the group that maximizes its chances of winning the prize .
Hint :
See the maximum minimum Hamming distance riddle for some powerful ideas .
CALENDAR CUBES
II a corporate business man has three cubes on his office desk .
every month , he arranges the cubes so that the front faces show the current month 's three letter abbreviation ( e.g. JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC }. what letters are on the faces of each cube ?
Note 1 : This might be insanely difficult .
Just remember to be creative .
Special thanks to Bruce Preston for sending this to me , along with a wonderful GIF of his solution !
Note 2 : Although the month abbreviations I have typed above are all capitalized , you may have to be more flexible with your fonts to construct a working solution .
PAST , PRESENT , FUTURE
There are three omniscient gods sitting in a chamber : Past , Present and Future .
They are all truthful , but with the following caveat : Present answers the question currently being asked , Past answers the last question asked in their chamber , and Future answers the next question which will be asked in their chamber .
Despite their manipulation of which question to answer , each still answers immediately as if answering the question currently being asked .
Furthermore , the gods answer in a language in which " yes " and " no " are replaced by " da " and " ya " , but you do not know which is which .
You only know that their answers are consistent amongst themselves .
With three questions , determine which god is which .
Note 1 : ( standard )
Because of possible time conflicts , you must determine your questions ahead of time , rather than based on previous answers .
You are , however , allowed to choose who you ask each of your three questions to dynamically , and scoping is also dynamic ( e.g. the pronoun " you " in a question will always refer to the person you choose to ask the question to , not a predetermined person ) .
No self - referential questions ( e.g. " is this question true iff ... " ) .
No time related questions ( e.g. , " if the answer to my second question was ' no ' , then ... otherwise ... " ) are permissible , as this could lead to paradoxes within the space - time continuum ) .
Finally , note that if you ask Past your first question or Future your last question , the answer will give you no additional information because you do not know what the last or next questions are !

1000 WIRES
A thousand wires hang on a very high tower , so high that you cannot see what tip belongs with what bottom .
This is something you are interested in knowing .
You have a battery and a light bulb which will light up if two wires connect it to the battery with appropriate polarity ( i.e. the battery and bulb each have two contact points , and one of each is + and the other side is -) .
Wires may be tied together to form longer wires , and you can see the bulb light up even if you are on the opposite side of the tower .
Since the tower is so high , you want to minimize the number of times you have to climb up and / or down the staircase , regardless of how much you have to do while you are at the top or bottom .

PICARD'S THEOREM PROOF THAT 0 = 1
M In complex analysis , an entire function is defined as a function which is infinitely differentiable at every point in C ( for example : constants , polynomials , e^x , etc. ) .
Picard 's
Theorem says that every nonconstant entire function f misses at most one point ( i.e. f( C ) = C or C - {x0} ) .
For example , every nonconstant polynomial hits every point , and e^x misses only 0 . Now consider the function f( x ) = e^( e^x ) .
Since e^x is entire , f is also entire by the chain rule .
But it misses 0 since the base e^y misses 0 , and it misses 1 since the top e^x misses 0 so that e^( e^x ) misses e^0 = 1 .
But by Picard 's
Theorem there can be only one missing point , so the two missing points must be the same .
Therefore , 0 = 1 . COUNTER GAME Alice and Bob are going to play a game , with the following rules :
Alice picks a probability p , 0 <= p < 0.5
Bob takes any finite number of counters B .
Alice takes any finite number of counters A .
These happen in sequence , so Bob chooses B knowing p , and Alice chooses A knowing p and B .
A series of rounds are then played .
Each round , either Bob gives Alice a counter ( probability p ) or Alice gives Bob a counter ( probability 1 - p ) .
The game terminates when one player is out of counters , and that player is the loser .
Whom does this game favor ?
Analyze and discuss probabilities .

UNIVERSAL TRUTH MACHINE
Someone claims to have invented a Universal Truth Machine ( UTM ) , a machine that takes a proposition as input , and returns " true " , " false " , or " undecidable " as output .
Example : input output " 2 + 2 = 4 " " true " " 0 + 2 = 4 " " false " " this proposition is false " " undecidable "
Devise a true proposition that the UTM will claim to be false , thereby disproving the inventor 's claim .

SMULLYAN WAS WRONG ( From Raymond Smullyan 's book What is the Name of This Book ? )
In WitNoTB ? , Smullyan introduces his Knights , Knaves , and Normals .
Knights always tell the truth , Knaves always lie , and Normals can do either .
In the subchapter titled " How to Marry a King 's Daughter " , Smullyan tells the story of a king who wants his daughter to marry a nice normal Normal , not one of those goody - goody Knights or devious scoundrel Knaves .
Smullyan asks the following questions ( easy puzzles ) :
How can you make a true statement that will convince the King you are a Normal ?
How can you make a false statement that will convince the King you are a Normal ?
How can you make a statement that will convince the King you are a Normal , but he wo n't know whether it 's true or false ?
Then Smullyan tells the story of a different King , one who is not so kindly disposed towards Normals .
In fact , he sees them as wishy - washy girly - men , unreliable and untrustworthy .
A Knight will always be true , and a Knave is wholly reliable as long as you remember to believe the exact opposite of what he says , while a Normal will deceive you when you least expect it .
He wants his daughter to marry anyone but a Normal .
Smullyan asks : how many statements must you make to convince the King ?
Smullyan 's answer was : no statements you make can ever convince the King you are no Normal .
Since a Normal can say anything , any statement you make could be made by a Normal .
There is no way to prove your abnormality to the King .
Smullyan was wrong !
There is a subtle flaw in his argument , and in fact it is quite possible for a non-Normal to prove it .
So the puzzle for you is ( harder puzzles ) :
How can you , in one statement , convince the King you are a Knight ?
How can you , in one statement , convince the King you are a Knave ?
How can you , in one statement , convince the King you are not a Normal , but leave him unable to deduce whether you are a Knight or a Knave ?

THE GODS OF GIBBERLAND
There are three omniscient gods sitting in a chamber : GibberKnight , GibberKnave , and GibberKnexus , the gods of the knights , knaves , and knexuses of Gibberland .
Knights always answer the truth , knaves always lie , and knexuses always answer the XOR of what the knight and knave would answer .
Unfortunately , the language spoken in Gibberland is so unintelligible that not only do you not know which words correspond to " yes " and " no " , but you do n't even know what the two words that represent them are !
All you know is that there is only one word for each .
With only three questions , determine which god is which .
Note 1 : What follows are standard rules that are generally assumed unless otherwise noted .
The gods only answer yes / no questions .
Each god answers in the single word of their language as appropriate to the question ; i.e. each god always gives one of only two possible responses , one affirmative and one negative ( e.g. they would always answer " Yes " rather than " That would be true " ) .
Each question asked must be addressed to a single specific god ; asking one question to all the gods would constitute three questions .
Asking a single god multiple questions is permissible .
The question you choose to ask and the god you choose to address may be dynamically chosen based on the answers to previous questions .
No self - referential questions ( e.g. " is this question true iff ... " ) .
Note 2 : Because of possible loop conflicts , you may not ask any questions regarding how a knexus would answer .

INTRODUCTIONS ALL AROUND
The town of Friendville has an interesting property .
Given any two people in the town , they either know eachother or they do n't .
If they do n't know eachother , then they can be introduced to eachother .
One single introduction will work for both people .
That is , " Tom this is Phil , Phil this is Tom " counts as one introduction .
The other interesting property that this town has , is that if any group of n people get together , the number of introductions that must be made in order that everyone in the group knows everyone else is at most n- 1 .
Problem :
Prove that the town can be divided into two groups ( A and B ) such that everyone in group A knows each other , and everyone in group B knows each other .

5 CARD MAGIC TRICK REDUX
This is a magic trick performed by two magicians , Alice and Bob , with one shuffled deck of N unique cards .
( Nothing is mentioned about suits : you may consider these cards to be simply enumerated from 1 to N. )
Alice asks a member of the audience , Carol , to randomly select 5 cards out of a deck .
Carol then returns her chosen 5 cards to Alice .
After looking at the 5 cards , Alice picks one of the 5 cards and gives it back to Carol .
Alice then arranges the other four cards in some way , and gives them to Bob in a neat , face - down pile .
Bob examines these 4 cards and determines what card is in Carol 's hand ( the missing 5th card ) .
Carol is astonished !
What is the largest number of cards N that the deck can contain before the trick is no longer performable ?
Prove it .
How specifically do you execute the trick on a deck of maximal size N? Note 1 : There 's no secretive message communication in the solution , like encoded speech or ninja hand signals or ESP or whatever ... the only communication between the two magicians is encoded in the 4 cards transferred from Alice to Bob .
Think of these magicians as mathematicians .
Note 2 : Essentially , this is the same 5 card magic trick , but now I am challenging you to get away with it using a deck larger than 52 playing cards .
100 PRISONERS AND TWO LIGHT BULBS 100 prisoners in solitary cells .
There 's a central living room with two light bulbs .
The initial states of these light bulbs is unknown .
No prisoner can see these light bulbs from his or her own cell .
Every now and then , whenever he feels like it , the warden picks a prisoner at random , and that prisoner enters the central living room .
While there , the prisoner can toggle the bulbs if he or she wishes .
Also , the prisoner has the option of asserting the claim that all 100 prisoners have been to the living room .
If this assertion is false ( that is , some prisoners still have n't been to the living room ) , all 100 prisoners will be executed .
However , if it is indeed true , all prisoners are set free .
Thus , the assertion should only be made if the prisoner is 100 % certain of its validity .
Before the warden begins this sick game , the prisoners are allowed to get together one night in the cafeteria to discuss a plan .
What plan should they agree on , so that eventually , someone will make a correct assertion ?
( Alternatively phrased : Devise an algorithm that has a 100 % chance of success , optimizing for the expected number of warden choices until success . )
After that , try generalizing to N light bulbs ( disclaimer : I do n't know where this N bulb thing leads ) .
Note : Summary of differences between this riddle and the notorious " 100 prisoners and one light bulb " : two light bulbs

warden chooses whenever he feels like it , rather than once a day .
THE OPERATORS OF BOOLANIA
There are three omniscient gods sitting in a chamber : AND , OR , and XOR .
They all answer the truth , but they all apply their namesake operations in one of the following ways : BACKWARD :
The operator is applied to ALL of the questions that have been asked THUS FAR .
UNIVERSAL : The operator is applied to ALL of the questions ( you have to pick your questions beforehand ) .
SELFLESS :
The operator is applied to ALL of the questions NOT asked to them ( you pick your questions beforehand ) .
For each of the 3 cases , determine with proof the minimum number of questions that will allow you to identify which god is which .
Note 1 : ( Standard ; rules that are generally assumed unless otherwise noted . )
The gods only answer yes / no questions .
Each god answers in the single word of their language as appropriate to the question ; i.e. each god always gives one of only two possible responses , one affirmative and one negative ( e.g. they would always answer " Yes " rather than " That would be true " ) .
Each question asked must be addressed to a single specific god ; asking one question to all the gods would constitute three questions .
Asking a single god multiple questions is permissible .
The question you choose to ask and the god you choose to address may be dynamically chosen based on the answers to previous questions .
Note 2 : ( Specific )
Because of possible time conflicts , you must determine your questions ahead of time , rather than based on previous answers .
However , you are still allowed to choose who you ask each of your three questions to dynamically .
Scoping is also dynamic ; e.g. the pronoun " you " in a question will always refer to the person to whom you are currently asking a question , not a predetermined person .
No time related questions ( e.g. , " if the answer to my second question was ' no ' , then X otherwise Y " ) are permissible , as this could lead to paradoxes within the space - time continuum .

THE PUZZLE FORUM
There are three puzzlers in the puzzle forum : A Newbie , a Senior Riddler , and an Uberpuzzler .
All three are honest , but can only give answers to the best of their knowledge .
Newbies are confused creatures .
Until their fifteenth posts , they are only able to make random responses !*
Senior Riddlers have great powers of perception , but are not yet infallible .
In fact , they have been known to give incorrect responses up to once per day !**
They are always able to deduce the identities of their fellow puzzlers , but have no access to individual thoughts or the future .
Uberpuzzlers are omniscient beings who are your greatest allies in the Puzzle Forum !!!
Not only do they always know and tell the truth , but they also have a special power of Influence !
Uberpuzzlers are able to telepathically communicate with anyone else in the room , and thereby clarify the person 's thoughts so that he knows the answer to the current question .
However , they must do so BEFORE the other person chooses an answer , or it may be too late .
The Uberpuzzler can exert Influence arbitrarily often .
However , before each session in the Puzzle Forum , he randomly chooses a limit for how many times he will apply his special power ( i.e. how helpful he will be ) .
The result is a secret ; all you know is that the limit is always a positive integer .
Furthermore , an Uberpuzzler only uses his power of Influence in a very specific way .
First , he determines the goal of the puzzler ( which may , for example , be to identify all three puzzlers in five questions ) .
Then he will determine the strategy of the puzzler ( in this case , it would be a binary tree of questions , with each node determining a question and the person who should be asked ; i.e. a fully dynamic set of questions and answerers ) .
Finally , IF POSSIBLE UNDER HIS CHOSEN INFLUENCE LIMITATION , he will determine circumstances ( in this case , questions following certain reply paths such as TFF or T or TFFTF ) for each possible situation ( in this case , permutations of the three people ) under which he would apply his Influence , such that over all situations , the final set of responses would be distinct relative to the situation .
( Thus , he employs a strategy defined as a mapping f : S3 x { ( T| F ) * } -> { 0,1} , which can be interpreted as follows : for each ordering of the puzzlers " sigma " ( a permutation in S3 , e.g. USN ) and set of responses " s " ( a string in ( T|F ) * , e.g. TFTF ) , he will exert Influence on the question following a response of s in the permutation sigma iff f( sigma , s ) = 1 .
The Uberpuzzler may choose ANY mapping f such that the strings of all possible responses will be disjoint for the six orderings of the puzzlers -- IF POSSIBLE given the limitations .
Note that this is different from saying that the puzzler chooses when the Uberpuzzler applies Influence !
In general , the Uberpuzzler may have more than one way to make the answer sets disjoint , but the puzzler will not know which one he is employing !!!)
Determine with proof the minimum number of questions which will allow you to identify which puzzler is which . [*
The Newbie does not make any new posts during questioning . ;) ] [**
It is assumed that the question asking session takes place during the confines of one day . ]

E-mail him feedback : click here WILLY'S TRUE COLORS Willywutang recently took a personality test ... he failed :)
Actually , the test was set up so he could n't fail .
There were four personality " colors " , and the objective was to decide which color was strongest in him .
There were three test sections , and in each section , he had to rank the four colors from 1 ( weakest ) to 4 ( strongest ) .
At the end of the test , he summed up the rankings from each section to get his personality " profile " .
The minimum he could score on any color was therefore 3 , and the maximum was 12 .
After he knew how he scored for each color , the test asked him to color in a circle ( with crayons ) in proportion to his color scores .
Willywutang complained that he did n't have a protractor to measure out the exact angles .
( I wonder what this says about his personality ? )
Willywutang then remarked loudly that the test makers could have divided up the circle beforehand ( pie- chart style ) and then he would only have to color between the lines .
The natural question is , of course :
What is the minimum number of divisions that must be made so that the circle can be colored to accurately represent any possible proportion of colors ?
How are these divisions arranged ?

SHUFFLING CARDS
You have a deck of 52 cards - for convenience , number them 1 through 52 .
You cut the cards into two equal halves and shuffle them perfectly .
That is , the cards were in the order 1,2,3 , ...,52 and now they are 1,27,2,28 , ...,26,52 .
Let 's call this a perfect in - shuffle .
If you repeat this in - shuffling process , will the cards ever return to their initial ordering ?
If so , how many in - shuffles will it take ?
How does the solution change if you have a deck of 64 cards , or 10 , or in general , n cards ?
For odd integer values of n , in - shuffling will take 1,2,3 , ... , n to 1, ( n+ 3 ) /2,2,( n+ 5) /2 , ... , n, ( n+1 ) / 2 . For example , when n=5 , the first shuffle in - yields 1,4,2,5,3 .
What if you do out - shuffles instead ?
( 27,1,28,2 , ...,52,26 ) TWO - FACE BOMB
The diabolical Two - Face has acquired an atomic bomb , and is setting it to detonate somewhere in Gotham City in 2 days .
Two - Face plans to deactivate the bomb only if the mayor agrees to pay him 2 bazillion dollars .
The bomb can be deactivated with a 2,000 digit passcode that only Two - Face will know .
In signature style , Two - Face wants exactly half of the passcode digits to be " 2 "s , and the other half to be " 1 " s .
Two - Face anticipates that Batman , the world 's greatest detective , will probably find the bomb somehow .
To reduce chances of Batman cracking the passcode and foiling the plan , Two - Face wants to choose a passcode equally at random , and without sacrificing the aforementioned symmetry .
One way of doing this would be to just conjure " 2 " s and " 1 " s randomly off the top of his head , while making sure that in the end , the total number of " 2 " s equals the total number of " 1 " s .
However , Two - Face does n't trust his mind to be truly random .
It sure would be nice if he had a computer or calculator to generate random numbers , but there are no such devices nearby .
So Two - Face once again pulls out his fair - sided coin , the elegant tool he uses to make all decisions in life .
Using only his coin , how can Two - Face construct a satisfactory passcode equally at random ?
And at least how long / how many flips will the construction take ?

BORROMEAN CIRCLES
Borromean Circles are three perfect circles ( perhaps of different radii ) made of wire and so artfully linked in space that they cannot be separated ; however , if any one circle were removed , the others would fall apart .
Example diagram : Prove that perfect Borromean Circles are actually impossible to construct .
Note : ( Useless historical information ) Borromean circles were the symbol of the Borromean League founded in 1586 to reimpose Catholicism over Protestant areas of Switzerland , which was almost destroyed by consequent prolonged warfare .
The League named itself after a controversial but widely admired St. Carlo Borromeo ( 1538 - 84 , canonized in 1610 ) , Cardinal and Archbishop of Milan , whose influential family had been established on the four little Borromean islands in Lake Maggiore , which runs North - East across the border between Italy and the Swiss canton of Ticino .
MOONSTONE
The Moonstone , a fabulous gem , has been stolen again .
Witnesses saw one person steal it , but cannot describe him ( or her ) at all , nor has any physical evidence been found .
Police suspect some one of the three most notorious jewel thieves may be responsible and have all three under close surveillance , including telephoto lenses and paraboloidal microphones , but lack a reason to arrest any of them .
Each suspect , denying involvement in the theft , has expressed his curiosity : Who took the Moonstone this time ?
Later the three were observed dining together .
Each one had occasion to leave their table and visit the lavatory ; during his absence the two at the table flipped a ( presumably fair ) coin , hiding its face from the absentee ( and from the surveillance team ) but not from each other .
After the third suspect returned , all three winked at each other and dispersed silently .
The surveillance team saw only the back of one suspect ’s head when he winked , so his wink was not recorded .
The team says all three suspects know now whether one of them stole the gem but , if he did , the other two do not know which one did ; and the team does not know whether one did .
How was all this information communicated ?
DERIVATIVE CANCELLATION
M When equations z = z(y ) and y = y( x ) can be solved for x = x ( z ) satisfying z = z ( y ( x ( z ) ) ) , then 1 = dz / dz = ( dz / dy ) ( dy / dx ) ( dx / dz ) as if all the d...'s were parts of fractions that cancelled each other out .
But in a different situation when an equation f( x , y , z ) = 0 can be solved for any one of the variables x , y , z as a function of the other two satisfying , for example , f( x , y , z( x , y ) ) = 0 , then ( @z /@y ) ( @y / @x ) ( @x / @z ) = - 1 where " @ " denotes the funky partial derivative symbol that looks like a reversed " 6 " .
Prove this last equation and explain why the " @ "s do n't cancel out the way the d ...'s did .
HEADS - UP 3 overlapping circles are drawn to cut the plane into 7 finite regions , each with 3 circular arcs as its boundary .
7 coins are placed , 1 in each region , all Heads - Up .
Then a game is played , consisting of a sequence of coin flipping steps .
At each step a circle is chosen , and one of the following two operations is performed upon all coins in it : Operation A : Turn every coin Heads - Up .
Operation B : Reverse every coin .
The object of the game is to put the coin in the central ( inside - most ) region Heads - Down , and all other coins Heads - Up .
Is this objective accomplishable ?
Hint : Consider what each kind of operation will do the following predicate concerning an odd number of coins : " Every circle has an odd number of conis Heads - Down . "
UVWXYZ
M Alice and Bob play a game .
Starting with Alice , they alternate in selecting digits for a 6 - digit decimal number UVWXYZ that they construct from left to right .
Alice chooses U , then Bob chooses V , then Alice chooses W , and so on .
No digit can be repeated .
Alice wins if UVWXYZ is not a prime .
Can Alice always win ?
Update

There was a typo : I had written " Alice wins if UWXYZ is not a prime " .
Thanks [ SWF ] .
HAPPY AND SAD NUMBERS
>=P Consider the following process : Pick a positive integer .
Square each of digits and add the squares together , to get a new number .
Repeat steps 2 - 3 with the new number .
" Happy numbers " are numbers destined to reduce to one .
" Sad numbers " are those that get stuck in an infinite loop of distinct numbers ; for example , the loop { 89 , 145 , 42 , 20 , 4 , 16 , 37 , 58 , 89 , 145 , ... } .
In general , what kinds of numbers are happy , and what kinds are sad ?
Give a closed - form expression for which integers are happy , and which integers are sad .
2N+1 COINS
Player A has n+1 coins , while player B has n coins .
Both players throw all of their coins simultaneously and observe the number that come up heads .
Assuming all the coins are unbiased , what is the probability that A obtains more heads than B? BRICK PIERCING A solid cube 20x20x20 is built out of bricks each 2x2x1 .
All bricks are laid with their faces parallel to the cube ’s faces , though bricks need not be laid flat .
Prove that at least one straight line perpendicular to a face of the cube pierces its interior but no brick ’s interior .
HIGH BUILDINGS AND STREET VENDORS
>=P Consider a country in which people live in high buildings and buy things from street vendors , using some form of money .
Each building is equipped with a pulley in the eaves over which runs a long rope with a basket on it , operable by either party .
Is there a system by which a resident and a vendor who do n't trust each other can conduct trade ?
Note that either party may plan to play the opposite role with someone else later .
RUBIK'S CUBE
>=P
You are given a Rubik 's cube in a randomly chosen initial position .
Denote a " move " as a 90 degree rotation of a face .
" God 's Algorithm " is the name of an algorithm which solves a Rubik 's cube in the fewest number of moves .
Determine a lower bound for the number of moves God 's Algorithm requires .
Determine an upper bound .
Can you devise a small , simple algorithm to solve a Rubik 's cube in the minimum number of moves ?
( e.g. not brute - force lookup tables ) Note 1 : Forum thread : click here Note 2 : What is a Rubik 's cube ?
It is the most famous puzzle in history .
Enro Rubik invented it in 1974 , and already about one - eighth of the world 's population has had its hands on it .
The Rubik 's cube consists of 27 smaller cubes .
Initially , all faces of the cube are the same color .
You can rotate 9 - block sections of the cube to break this pattern , as illustrated by the image below .
Afterwards , the objective is to return the Rubik 's cube to its initial state of monochromatic faces .
Given that you did n't know the steps taken to randomize the cube faces , this is surprisingly difficult to do .
Enro Rubik was a lecturer in the Department of Interior Design at the Academy of Applied Arts and Crafts in Budapest .
While giving lectures , he liked to illustrate his ideas with actual models made from wood , cardboard , plastic , and other common materials .
He created the cube as an experiment in aesthetic geometric forms , and to help students with spatial visualization .
Rubik himself did not expect the process of returning the cube to its initial state to be so difficult .
Eventually the Cube caught on as an international phenomenon .
Today it is a common household item , and the subject of many mathematical papers .
CALENDAR CUBES III
A corporate business man has two cubes on his office desk .
Every day he arranges both cubes so that the front faces show the current day of the month in Roman numerals .
What numbers are on the faces of the cubes to allow this ?
You can have as few ( including zero ) or as many numerals on a single face as you wish .
TRIANGLIA II When the Prince of Trianglia ( an island where all intersections are Ys , and no roads lead to dead ends ) returned from his voyage of discovery , he issued two edicts :
Because he spent a month trapped by a washed - out road , new roads are to be built so that there is more than one route to every portion of Trianglia .
Because dirt roads are tiresome and boring , all roads will be paved with either red , yellow , or blue bricks ( each road having only one color ) .
The color of each road should be chosen so that every intersection is the meeting of roads of all three colors .
Can the Trianglians assign a color to each of the roads to satisfy the second edict ?
If so , how ?
A quote from the " Fun Facts about Trianglia " Tourist brochure : " Trianglians are very superstitious about having things over their heads when they are travelling .
There are no overpasses or tunnels anywhere in Trianglia . "

DATA CORRUPTION
M We have a discrete time signal x[ n ] that is bandlimited to pi/3 .
In other words , if X( w ) is the discrete - time fourier transform ( DTFT ) of x[n ] , then : for pi/3 < w < pi , |X ( w ) | = 0 .
In the process of retrieving x[ n ] from a hard disk , one sequence value has become corrupted , resulting in a corrupted signal y[ n ] .
The graphs below show the real and imaginary parts of the DTFT of y[ n ] .
By examining the above graphs , estimate n 0 , the index of the sequence value that has been corrupted .
Explain .
If y[n 0 ] = x[n 0 ] + c , estimate c. Explain your reasoning .
Note 1 : Requires some knowledge of the discrete - time fourier transform .
A pretty cool puzzle nevertheless .

FORK IN THE ROAD III Willywutang had been travelling for nearly two days when he came to the fork in the road .
Willy knew it was inevitable , but he was prepared .
Willy knew from the various puzzles he had solved that one path led to the City of Safety , and the other path led to the City of Cannibals .
There should also be two people waiting at the intersection , who , willingly or not , would tell him how to get to the City of Safety ...
Slouched against a tree trunk near the intersection was a scruffy stranger .
Willy stopped in his tracks and stared at the man , very worried .
He was certain to be from one of the two cities , but which one ?
Where was the second person ?
The man returned Willy 's gaze , saying nothing .
There was a tense silence , broken only when the mysterious stranger finally spoke up .
" If you 're wonderin ' where the other guy is , he 's home sick today .
You see , he 's from the City of Cannibals , and someone came through here with a bad cold .
You 're lucky that I 'm here , from the City of Safety ! "
Willy was too much on his guard to be reassured by the scruffy man 's story .
Perhaps it was true , and perhaps it was n't .
Willy also knew the rules about getting directions -- he could ask just one yes / no question .
Is there any way Willy could find out which path led to the City of Safety ?

THREE LOCKS
Three criminals just robbed a bank and go back to their hideout .
They put the money behind a high tech security door .
There are 3 locks on the door , each activated / deactivated by a button next to it .
All locks are originally deactivated , and once a lock is activated it is impossible to tell whether it is activated or not .
The three criminals want to work out a system so that any two of them can access the money but a single criminal cannot .
The 2 criminals accessing the money must be assured that all locks are deactivated , otherwise an alarm will sound , and built - in lasers will shoot them .
Also , each criminal may only give information about which locks he toggled to one other criminal .
Figure out how their system will work .
THE LOVE TRIANGLE
Here is the story of three unhappy people : Angelica , Bernardo , and Cameron .
Angelica and Cameron have been friends since childhood .
Cameron is hopelessly in love with Angelica , but Angelica has always thought of Cameron as " just a friend " .
During high school , a new boy , Bernardo , moves into the area .
Bernardo immediately catches the attention of Angelica , who falls head - over - heels for him .
However , Bernardo is not interested in women -- he is strongly attracted to Cameron .
Cameron , of course , is jealous of Bernardo , because he has stolen Angelica 's love away .
Angelica is angry at Cameron , because she feels that Bernardo 's lack of attention to her is Cameron 's fault .
Bernardo is jealous of Angelica , who recieves all of Cameron 's attention .
What are these three to do ?
( Please , this is a rhetorical question -- there is no need to answer it )
One day , you meet them , all together in a chat room .
They are all using nicknames : Uberkewl , Vaxxipaxx , and Willywutang ( in no particular order ) .
Because they are so jealous and screwed - up , each of them will only answer a question truthfully only if : one of your last two questions was to their sweetheart , and your last question was n't to the person with whom they are upset .
Otherwise , they will answer spitefully - - giving you the answer that will confuse you the most .
Your task is to figure out who is who .
Is it possible ?
If so , how many questions might you have to ask ?

THE LOVE SQUARE
In the Hemlock Grove retirement villa , four seniors are discovering the joys and sorrows of a " love square " .
Amelia , Bertrand , Claire , and Donald have gotten themselves mixed up in a little more than they can handle .
Amelia has fallen for Bertrand , with his youthfully craggy face and his deep gravely voice .
Bertrand does not realize this , and secretly admires Claire , with her youthful temperament and derring - do .
Claire is oblivious to Bertrand 's feelings , and is instead obsessed with Donald and his mysterious past .
Donald does n't know that Claire is interested in him , but he has the hots for Amelia .
Of course , Bertrand realizes that Claire likes Donald , and has secretly vowed to get Donald on the bad side of the cleaning staff .
Donald shares Bertrand 's emnity , since his beloved Amelia is bewitched by the old git .
He has been trying to get a bird to build its nest over top of Bertrand 's patio door for nearly a year now .
Amelia recognizes the glint in Bertrand 's eye when he looks at Claire , and she is determined to sabotage Claire 's next candlelight supper by replacing her baking powder with powdered salt .
Claire is likewise jealous of Amelia , that slut , and she plans to run her over on the sidewalk with her electric three - wheeled buggy .
One day , you meet all four of these unhappy individuals in a chat room , going under the nicknames UsUxOrZ , VampireBob , WussMania , and Xanadu .
Because they are all slightly crazy ( they are in love after all ) , each person will only answer a question correctly if : one of your last two questions was asked of their sweetheart , and
your last question was not to their enemy .
Otherwise , they will tell you whatever they feel like telling you .
Is there any way that you can deduce the identities of these four individuals ?
How many questions must you ask to determine who is who ?

INFINITE RESISTOR NETWORK
Imagine an infinitely extending grid of squares .
Between every two adjacent intersection points is a resistor of 1 ohm .
Compute the resistance between two adjacent intersection points .
Note :
Anyone know how to solve this problem by comparing resistance to commute times of random walks on graphs ?
H uv +
H vu = 2 mR uv , where H uv is the hitting time between vertices u and v , and R uv is the resistance between u and v .
We should be able to show that the ratio of commute time to edges converges to a stable value as the grid size approaches infinity .

NEWCOMB'S DILEMMA
A great advance has occured in the field of artificial intelligence .
A computer has been programmed to predict your actions , and has proven itself able to do so with amazing accuracy .
You have put it through many difficult and devious tests , yet it has always been correct in its predictions .
A certain multibillionaire with a twisted sense of humor has decided to reward you for your great discovery .
He take you into a room with two boxes and tells you that box A contains $ 10,000 while box B either contains nothing , or a certified check for 1 billion dollars .
You will be allowed to open exactly one box and keep it contents .
The catch is this : Earlier , your program was asked what you would do .
If the computer predicted you would open box A , then the 1 billion dollar check was placed in box B .
If the computer predicted you would open box B , the box will be empty .
Which box should you open ?
Note that box B was prepared before you enter the room .
Note : From the pages of Martin Gardner .
" Newcomb " refers to William A. Newcomb , a physicist at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory , who came up with the puzzle in 1960 .

TAKE THE LAST CHIP Turkey Sandwich was worried about an upcoming test in Discrete Mathematics and was finding it hard to get to sleep .
Turkey awoke early in the morning , aroused by devilish laughter , only to see an impish looking homunculus sitting at the bottom of the bed next to a seemingly infinite pile of chips .
Hello
Turkey it said , would you like to play a little game ?
This pile contains 43546758343209876 chips and the bottom chip represents your immortal soul .
The rules are quite simple .
The first player takes some chips , but not all of them .
After that we take it in turns to take some chips .
The only rule now is that a player cannot take more in their turn than the previous player took .
The winner is the player who takes the last chip .
If I win I get to keep your soul and if you win , you get an A in the test .
Would you like to go first or second ?
This seemed a reasonable bet to Turkey .
Can you give
Turkey a strategy for playing no matter how many chips there are ?

COOPERATIVE CHECKERS
Is it possible for two checker players , playing cooperatively , to king all twelve of both players ' checkers ?
Keep in mind the following rules of checkers :
The initial checkers setup is to use only the black squares of a chessboard , with red checkers on the 12 North - most squares , and black checkers on the 12 South - most squares .
Players alternate turns , and cannot pass their turn
If a player can " jump " an opposing player 's piece , he must do so .
This is where all the difficulty arises .
If a player cannot jump , then he must move one of his checkers diagonally .
All non -kinged checkers can only move forward .
When a checker gets to the opposing end of the board , it is " kinged " and can now move backwards as well as forwards .

LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY VERIFICATION
>=P 1/19/2003 1:56 AM
Here 's the puzzle :
How do you make sense of this puzzle ?
I 'd like to salvage the following interesting puzzle such that it is solvable , but I do n't know how to -- or even if the answer is supposed to be that it 's not solvable .
Exact quote : " There is a Man A , who claims to know Tamil Language .
You dont know Tamil language so you can not test him .
You hire another Man B , who knows Tamil Language , to test this .
Both A and B knows your language too .
Though you dont trust both of these guys still you want to test that A knows B . Also you know that A and B dont know any other language too .
How will you test man A knows Tamil ? " I think it 's supposed to be a good puzzle because the page I found it on had it next to sink the sub and single - file hat execution , as examples of problems the webmaster discusses with his CS faculty .
Problem is , I do n't know what entails not trusting B . Does it mean B will translate our English queries reliably , but wo n't reliably tell us if A responds in Tamil properly ?
I e-mailed the author for clarification and his answer was meaningless , and then I e-mailed again and he stopped responding ( I think he 's sick of me ) .
I wo n't reprint his e-mail address here .
Perhaps we can figure out what is necessary to fix the problem ?
Note 1 : I believe the riddle is supposed to say " you want to test that A knows Tamil " instead of " you want to test that A knows B. " Note 2 : [ redPepper ] from the riddle forum offers the following amusing answer : " I found the correct riddle 's wording .
Here it is : " ' There is a Man A who claims to know English language .
He 's a CS student and likes logic riddles .
You like riddles too so you ask him for one .
Unfortunately the riddle is worded poorly , which is a problem for a logic riddle where every detail is important .
English is obviously not Man A 's native language .
You can hire another Man B who knows Man A's language and also proper English , to translate the riddle .
Though you do n't know what is Man A 's language .
Maybe it 's Tamil .
You can communicate with Man A in English through e-mail but you can only ask one question , after which any new e-mail will be ignored .
How will you gather a correctly worded riddle ? ' " WALKING ON A STRETCHING RUBBER BAND 1/19/2003 1:56 AM
A taut rubber band connects a wall to the back side of a toy racecar 1 meter away .
Starting at time t=0 , the racecar drives away from the wall at 1 meter per second , stretching but never breaking the rubber band .
At the same time , an ant resting on the rubber band near the wall starts to move toward the racecar at 1 centimeter per second .
Does the ant ever reach the racecar ?
If so , in exactly how much time ?
Why ?
Note 1 : Treat the ant as a dot , like in geometry .
Its initial position at t=0 - is 0 distance away from the wall .
Note 2 : Assume that the angle of incidence between the rubber band and the wall never changes .
( In other words , this is all happening along one dimension . )
Note 3 : Does this remind you of something related to cosmology ( " the study of the physical universe considered as a totality of phenomena in time and space " ) ?

A bacterium asexually reproduces k children for the next generation according to a probability distribution P ( X = k ) , where X is a random variable that returns the number of children it has between 0 and +infinity .
After reproducing , a bacterium dies .
What is the probability that the bacterial colony lasts forever ?
In general , what statistical property should an offspring distribution have to ensure immortality ?

TOPOLOGICAL RINGS 2/3/2003 3:30 PM
Imagine the object above in the figure to the left made from perfectly elastic material .
Can you transform it so as to unlink the two rings as in the figure on the right ?
One possible way is to cut one ring , move the other ring through the gap , and rejoin the the first ring exactly as it was .
That would be a legitimate topological transformation .
However , it is also possible to transform the first shape into the second without any cutting , simply by manipulating the objects in the appropriate manner ( stretching , bending , but not breaking ) .
Can you see how to do it ?
FIRING SQUAD SYNCHRONIZATION
2/5/2003 3:57 AM
A prisoner is awaiting execution by firing squad .
A row of N robotic soldiers stands nearby .
These robotic soldiers can be in a finite number of states ( they are all finite state machines ) .
A clock provides a sequence of time steps : 0 , 1 , 2 , etc . .
At each step , the state of each soldier is given by a transition function .
This function takes three arguments as input : the soldier 's previous state , the previous state of the soldier to the right , and the previous state of the soldier to the left .
The transition function must be identical for all soldiers except for the soldiers at the ends of the row , whom could have different transition functions .
One of the soldiers at one end of the row is deemed the general of the squad .
Initially at time 0 , the general is in state q init , whereas all other soliders are in state q sleep .
The objective is to get all soldiers to enter the state q bang simultaneously for the first time , thereby riddling the prisoner with N bullets .
Design state machines and transition functions for the robotic soldiers which will accomplish this objective , given that the number of states for a soldier cannot depend on N .
What is the running time of your system in terms of N ? Hint ( achievable running time ) :
If your machines are sufficiently clever , you can achieve O ( N ) time !
There 's even a solution that takes exactly 2N - 2 time steps .
Note 1 : If we did not specify " for the first time " , a trivial solution would be to have all soldiers keep firing , and eventually they will all be in state q bang .
Note 2 : In a sense , the heart of this problem is that no soldier knows what N is .
Note 3 : Problem originally posed by J. Myhill in 1957 .
Note 4 : This problem describes something called a cellular automaton .
The soldiers are like " cells " , and how a cell is updated depends on the state of nearby cells .
Perhaps the most well - known cellular automaton is John Conway 's Game of Life .
ASCENTS IN PERMUTATIONS
2/5/2003 4:00 AM
The number of ascents in a permutation is the number of times when one number is greater than the one directly preceding it .
Examples : [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] has 4 ascents in it , ( 2>1 , 3 > 2 , 4>3 , 5 > 4 ) , [ 1,4,3,2,5 ] has 2 ascents in it , ( 4> 1 , 5 > 2 ) , and [ 5,4,3,2,1 ] has none .
Create a program to count the number of permutations of n distinct numbers with exactly r ascents in it .
ROAD LAYOUT 2/5/2003 4:00 AM
Discrete - Case
N cities are located at integer coordinates on a Cartesian grid .
Your task is to lay down roads along the grid such that all the cities are connected , and the total amount of road you lay down is minimized .
Devise an algorithm to solve this problem in general .
Continuous - Case
N cities are located at real coordinates on the Cartesian plane .
Your task is to lay down roads such that all the cities are connected , and the total amount of road you lay down is minimized .
Devise an algorithm to solve this problem in general .
N - Dimensional Case
N cities are located at real coordinates in an N - dimensional world .
Your task is to lay down roads such that all the cities are connected , and the total amount of road you lay down is minimized .
Devise an algorithm to solve this problem in general .
Note 1 : ( potentially unnecessary clarification ) I use the modifier " connected " in the graph theory sense , meaning there exists a path from one city to any other city .
In the Discrete - Case , when I say " along the grid " , I mean that roads can only travel horizontally or vertically .
A road network is comprised of line segments , and the endpoints of any line segment should lie on integer coordinates .
Also , note that the problem does not restrict the endpoints of a line segment to the locations of the cities .
So it will often be beneficial to invent intermediate points where roads should intersect .
Finally , of course the more efficient your algorithm is , the better .
Note 2 : John Leen , who did graduate research on bubble surfaces , told me what the problem is officially called .
The discrete case is called the Rectilinear Steiner Tree problem , and the continuous case is the Euclidean Steiner Tree problem .
Formally , you are given a weighted graph in which a subset of the vertices are identified as terminals , and you want to find a minimum - weight connected subgraph that includes all terminals .
In general , finding a Steiner Tree is NP - hard .
Note 3 : [ Icarus ] from the forum gives us some fascinating facts : ' The continuous case can also be approached by experimental means .
Set up a map on a board and place pegs at the location of each town .
Place a second thin board on top to form a " peg sandwich " .
Dip the contraption in a good bubble solution an after when you pull it out , cut holes in the thin board to allow any trapped air to escape .
The remaining bubble film between the pegs should follow the lines of a road system that is a local minimum ( that is , small variations will all be longer , but it is possible that a major variation would be shorter ) . '
WORM PROPAGATION
>=P 2/2/2003 3:31 AM
A hacker is attacking a computer network .
Each computer on the network is connected to various other computers .
The hacker releases a worm on a source computer .
When a worm infects a computer , that computer can propagate a copy of the worm to a connected computer at a rate of once per second .
Suppose the hacker knows the layout of the network ; i.e. , he knows which computers are connected to which .
How should the worm proceed to infect the whole network as quickly as possible ?
Also , if possible , describe an algorithm for computing the minimum time till total network infection .
( Admittedly a computer science background will help here , but it is not absolutely necessary . )
Note 1 : Writing credits to Yosen Lin. Note 2 : ( Updated 4/7/2003 1:11 AM )
It appears that Yosen has rediscovered a very difficult problem , the minimal gossip time problem .
None of us know of a good solution to this besides brute - force , which would take really , really long .
There is some tradeoff involved between graph bushiness and branch depth , which leads me to suspect that the problem is NP - hard .

POLYGON AREA 3/9/2003 4:48 AM
Given a bunch of ( x , y ) coordinates that form the vertices of one non-self - intersecting polygon , how would you go about finding the area of that polygon ?
What is the most clever / elegant solution you can devise ?
The desired answer is remarkably simple .
Note : Notice I did not say the polygon has to be regular or convex .
A regular polygon has all sides of equal length .
A convex polygon is a polygon such that all line segments formed between any two vertices must lie inside the polygon boundaries .
HARD TIMES FOR AIRLINES Let us distinguish Towns from Cities .
Airlines avoid cancelling service between cities for fear of losing busy airports ’ gate assignments to competitors .
However , in hard times , airlines do cancel nonstop services between towns , and sometimes cancel nonstop services between towns and cities .
The FAA insists that every town be connected to at least one city by nonstop airline service .
Every town is so connected now , and some towns to more than one city .
Suppose that , for every collection of towns , the number of towns in the collection does not exceed the number of cities each connected currently by nonstop airline service to at least one town in the collection .
Show how airlines can cancel some city « town nonstop flight services leaving no city connected to more than one town and yet every town connected to just one city , barely satisfying the FAA , without adding any new service to the flight - schedule .
Explain why your chosen process works .
IMPISH PIXIE 4/7/2003 12:17 AM
Suppose you have an infinite number of small balls , all of which have been uniquely numbered from 1 upwards .
What is more , you have an infinitely large bucket , by which I mean it can be made as large as necessary .
You decide to fill the bucket by throwing in all the balls , in order .
Starting from 1 , every minute you throw in two balls .
But every minute , an impish pixie takes one ball back out .
He always extracts the lowest - numbered ball in the bucket .
For example : 1st minute : You throw in Ball 1 and Ball 2 .
Pixie extracts Ball 1 . 2nd minute : You throw in Ball 3 and Ball 4 . Pixie extracts Ball 2 . 3rd minute :
You throw in Ball 5 and Ball 6 .
Pixie extracts Ball 3 . and so on ...
QUESTION : After an infinite amount of time has elapsed , how many balls are in the bucket ?
Argument 1 : There is an infinite number of balls in the bucket .
After 1 minute there is 1 ball .
After 2 minutes there are 2 balls .
After 3 minutes there are 3 balls , etc. Argument 2 : There are no balls in the bucket .
If there are some balls in the bucket , what is the lowest - numbered ball ?
It ca n't be Ball 1 ; that was extracted after 1 minute .
Similarly , it can't be Ball 2 ; that was extracted after 2 minutes .
It ca n't be Ball 3 ; that was extracted after 3 minutes , etc .
If the phrase ' after an infinite amount of time has elapsed ' bothers you , then we can change the problem so that the 1st put - in - and - take - out operation is completed in 1/ 2 minute , the 2nd operation is completed in 1 / 4 minute , the 3rd in 1/8 minute , and so on .
Now you can ask the question after 60 seconds , and " infinite time " is not longer an issue .
ELLIPSOID POWER GENERATION

A property of ellipsoids is that if the inside surface is a perfect reflector , a ray of light originating at one focus will reflect off of the ellipsoid and pass through the other focus .
In the figure below FC is a portion of ellipse with foci A and B. DE is a portion of a larger ellipse also having foci A and B. Arcs CD and EF are part of the circle with center B. Points A , C , and D lie on the same line and A , E , and F are also collinear .
Think of a perfect reflector made by revolving this shape about line AB to form an axisymmetric shape .
Any photon originating at A must strike one of the ellipsoid surfaces and will be reflected toward B .
For photons orginating at B , some strike the ellipsoids and reflect toward A , but some also strike the spherical portion of the reflector and come right back to B .
Take two small identical objects of the same temperature and place one at A and the other at B inside the reflector .
Also the rest of the space inside the reflector is vacuum .
Objects emit thermal radiation based on temperature in the form of photons .
All the radiation from A strikes B . Only a fraction of that emitted from B arrives at A .
So with time B will become hotter than A .
In theory , this temperature difference can be used to generate power .
If this would not work , why not ?
If it would work , why are n't ellipsoids being used to generate power ?

Take any three circles of differing radius in the plane .
For each pair of circles , draw two tangent lines that touch both circles and cross each other outside the convex hull of the circles .
You now have three intersections , one for each pair of circles .
Prove that these three points lie on a line .

Gunmen today killed five Shia primary school teachers and a driver in a school in Iskandariya , south of Baghdad , a police spokesman said .
" These men were terrorists in police uniform , " the spokesman told Reuters .
He said the gunmen arrived at the school in two civilian cars , led the teachers and the school driver to a part of the school where no children were present , and shot them .
Sectarian killings are rife in Iraq , where the Shia and Kurdish - dominated government , backed by US forces , is facing an armed insurgency by Sunni Arabs .
But school teachers have rarely been targets for attacks .
Also today , a suicide car bomber killed at least 10 Iraqis in an attack near government buildings in Baghdad , police said .
The bomber targeted a police checkpoint guarding Iraq 's oil and irrigation ministries and national police academy , police captain Nabil Abdel Qadir said .
Seven policemen and three people died aboard a private bus carrying 24 oil ministry employees and their driver .
Thirty - six Iraqis were wounded , 14 of them policemen and 22 of them bus passengers , Mr Qadir said .
Government workers are often searched at the checkpoint before being allowed to walk to their offices about 100 metres away .
The oil minister , Ibrahim Bahr al - Uloum , who rushed to the site , said : " The insurgents are targeting Iraqi government employees and worshippers in mosques .
These savage acts wo n't undermine the forthcoming people 's referendum on the new Iraqi constitution . "
US forces and the Iraqi government today started to release 1,000 detainees from the notorious Abu Ghraib prison to mark the Muslim holy month of Ramadan , which begins next week , in an attempt to win over moderates in the country .
The first 500 prisoners , who are not thought to have been charged or convicted of any crime , were driven out of the prison on public buses this morning .
The rest would be freed later this week , the US military said , stressing that none of those let out had faced allegations of serious or violent crimes .
The prisoner release appeared to be part of the Iraqi government 's effort to persuade citizens , especially the Sunni minority , to vote in the October 15 national referendum on Iraq 's draft constitution .
Approval of the draft constitution would be an important step in Iraq 's democratic transformation .
But many Sunni leaders and insurgents are calling for a boycott or a " no " vote in the referendum , saying the draft document would leave Iraq 's minority Sunnis with far less power than the country 's Kurds and majority Shiites .
If two - thirds of voters in just three of Iraq 's 18 provinces vote " no " in the referendum , the constitution would have to be rewritten and Iraq 's parliament dissolved and replaced in another election .
The release came at the request of Sunni representatives taking part in constitutional talks .
The officials asked the Iraqi government to start releasing thousands of prisoners who have been languishing in the jail for months without charge .
Abu Ghraib prison , built by Saddam 's regime in the 1970s on the outskirts of Baghdad , was retained as a major detention centre by the US authorities after the occupation of Iraq in 2003 .
It gained notoriety after a number of US military personnel were charged with humiliating and assaulting detainees there .

Industrialised globalisation in many ways reaches its logical extreme in the shape of the brewery : corporate - led globalisation consolidates power and wealth into ever fewer hands , all the while burning fossil fuels and stamping out diversity .
In recent years , big breweries around the world have managed to continue their unfettered growth through mega-mergers , the only path of growth left .
Belgium 's Interbrew merged with Brazil 's AmBev to control almost a sixth of the world 's beer market .
Likewise , Molson merged with Coors , and South African Breweries merged with Miller , creating behemoth beer corporations .
Anheuser - Busch ( makers of Bud ) produces one in every 10 commercial beers globally and controls half of the American market .
However , brewers around the world , particularly in America , are once again fomenting a revolution , this one led by a band called the anti-globalisation crowd , but more accurately termed the sustainability movement .
Sustainability embraces the values of community and equality and maximises the benefits of science and technology , while respecting the sanctity of nature .
Corporations are the foremost operators in the unsustainable global economy .
By contrast , the new wave of small local breweries and brewer pubs are innovating closed - loop systems that move away from wasteful , polluting , oil - dependent business practices .
The craft beer movement is putting into practice a sustainability model called " bioregionalism " .
Brewers are using small - scale technologies , developing local markets , reducing packaging and shipping , making use of locally available materials , and reducing overall waste through eco-industrial design .
In under 20 years , the number of breweries in America has risen from 44 to 2,000 , nearly all of which are small - scale .
They are producing beers of every known style and creating radical new ones using every conceivable flavouring .
A similar localisation of brewing is happening in Britain .
It is hard to get more micro than the new Colonsay Brewery , which last week began deliveries of beer across the tiny Hebridean isle ( population 100 ) .
Homebrewing is also experiencing explosive growth as people take brewing back into the kitchen .
Microbrewing , by definition small - scale and locally oriented , is inherently more sustainable .
But many of these brewers are also intentionally innovating new environmental practices and working to build strong local communities .
New Belgium Brewing in Colorado is one of many breweries to run entirely on wind power .
The Keystone Brewery in Dorset uses almost entirely locally sourced ingredients and is developing solar heating .
Pubs such as the Duke of Cambridge in north London exclusively serve organic beers by Pitfield Brewing .
Could beer save the world ?
In the age of globalisation , we are capable of the wholesale destruction of life on Earth , not to mention to the elimination of unique beer cultures around the world , especially in industrialising countries .
We are in grave need of some life - affirming energy to counterbalance this penchant for mass annihilation .
With global climate change dominating the headlines , military debacles pitting the west against the Middle East , and the wealth gap increasing , we face questions about the very survival of our species .
And beer can provide some of the answers .

19 . Beyond Exception Handling : Conditions and Restarts
One of Lisp 's great features is its condition system .
It serves a similar purpose to the exception handling systems in Java , Python , and C ++ but is more flexible .
In fact , its flexibility extends beyond error handling -- conditions are more general than exceptions in that a condition can represent any occurrence during a program 's execution that may be of interest to code at different levels on the call stack .
For example , in the section " Other Uses for Conditions , " you 'll see that conditions can be used to emit warnings without disrupting execution of the code that emits the warning while allowing code higher on the call stack to control whether the warning message is printed .
For the time being , however , I 'll focus on error handling .
The condition system is more flexible than exception systems because instead of providing a two - part division between the code that signals an error1 and the code that handles it , 2 the condition system splits the responsibilities into three parts -- signaling a condition , handling it , and restarting .
In this chapter , I 'll describe how you could use conditions in part of a hypothetical application for analyzing log files .
You 'll see how you could use the condition system to allow a low - level function to detect a problem while parsing a log file and signal an error , to allow mid-level code to provide several possible ways of recovering from such an error , and to allow code at the highest level of the application to define a policy for choosing which recovery strategy to use .
To start , I 'll introduce some terminology : errors , as I 'll use the term , are the consequences of Murphy 's law .
If something can go wrong , it will : a file that your program needs to read will be missing , a disk that you need to write to will be full , the server you 're talking to will crash , or the network will go down .
If any of these things happen , it may stop a piece of code from doing what you want .
But there 's no bug ; there 's no place in the code that you can fix to make the nonexistent file exist or the disk not be full .
However , if the rest of the program is depending on the actions that were going to be taken , then you 'd better deal with the error somehow or you will have introduced a bug .
So , errors are n't caused by bugs , but neglecting to handle an error is almost certainly a bug .
So , what does it mean to handle an error ?
In a well - written program , each function is a black box hiding its inner workings .
Programs are then built out of layers of functions : high - level functions are built on top of the lower - level functions , and so on .
This hierarchy of functionality manifests itself at runtime in the form of the call stack : if high calls medium , which calls low , when the flow of control is in low , it 's also still in medium and high , that is , they 're still on the call stack .
Because each function is a black box , function boundaries are an excellent place to deal with errors .
Each function -- low , for example -- has a job to do .
Its direct caller -- medium in this case -- is counting on it to do its job .
However , an error that prevents it from doing its job puts all its callers at risk : medium called low because it needs the work done that low does ; if that work does n't get done , medium is in trouble .
But this means that medium 's caller , high , is also in trouble -- and so on up the call stack to the very top of the program .
On the other hand , because each function is a black box , if any of the functions in the call stack can somehow do their job despite underlying errors , then none of the functions above it needs to know there was a problem -- all those functions care about is that the function they called somehow did the work expected of it .
In most languages , errors are handled by returning from a failing function and giving the caller the choice of either recovering or failing itself .
Some languages use the normal function return mechanism , while languages with exceptions return control by throwing or raising an exception .
Exceptions are a vast improvement over using normal function returns , but both schemes suffer from a common flaw : while searching for a function that can recover , the stack unwinds , which means code that might recover has to do so without the context of what the lower - level code was trying to do when the error actually occurred .
Consider the hypothetical call chain of high , medium , low .
If low fails and medium can't recover , the ball is in high 's court .
For high to handle the error , it must either do its job without any help from medium or somehow change things so calling medium will work and call it again .
The first option is theoretically clean but implies a lot of extra code -- a whole extra implementation of whatever it was medium was supposed to do .
And the further the stack unwinds , the more work that needs to be redone .
The second option -- patching things up and retrying -- is tricky ; for high to be able to change the state of the world so a second call into medium wo n't end up causing an error in low , it 'd need an unseemly knowledge of the inner workings of both medium and low , contrary to the notion that each function is a black box .
The Lisp Way
Common Lisp 's error handling system gives you a way out of this conundrum by letting you separate the code that actually recovers from an error from the code that decides how to recover .
Thus , you can put recovery code in low - level functions without committing to actually using any particular recovery strategy , leaving that decision to code in high - level functions .
To get a sense of how this works , let 's suppose you 're writing an application that reads some sort of textual log file , such as a Web server 's log .
Somewhere in your application you 'll have a function to parse the individual log entries .
Let 's assume you 'll write a function , parse - log - entry , that will be passed a string containing the text of a single log entry and that is supposed to return a log - entry object representing the entry .
This function will be called from a function , parse - log - file , that reads a complete log file and returns a list of objects representing all the entries in the file .
To keep things simple , the parse - log - entry function will not be required to parse incorrectly formatted entries .
It will , however , be able to detect when its input is malformed .
But what should it do when it detects bad input ?
In C you 'd return a special value to indicate there was a problem .
In Java or Python you 'd throw or raise an exception .
In Common Lisp , you signal a condition .
Conditions
A condition is an object whose class indicates the general nature of the condition and whose instance data carries information about the details of the particular circumstances that lead to the condition being signaled .
3
In this hypothetical log analysis program , you might define a condition class , malformed - log - entry - error , that parse - log - entry will signal if it 's given data it can't parse .
Condition classes are defined with the DEFINE - CONDITION macro , which works essentially the same as DEFCLASS except that the default superclass of classes defined with DEFINE - CONDITION is CONDITION rather than STANDARD - OBJECT .
Slots are specified in the same way , and condition classes can singly and multiply inherit from other classes that descend from CONDITION .
But for historical reasons , condition classes are n't required to be instances of STANDARD - OBJECT , so some of the functions you use with DEFCLASS ed classes are n't required to work with conditions .
In particular , a condition 's slots can't be accessed using SLOT - VALUE ; you must specify either a : reader option or an : accessor option for any slot whose value you intend to use .
Likewise , new condition objects are created with MAKE - CONDITION rather than MAKE - INSTANCE .
MAKE - CONDITION initializes the slots of the new condition based on the : initarg s it 's passed , but there 's no way to further customize a condition 's initialization , equivalent to INITIALIZE - INSTANCE .4
When using the condition system for error handling , you should define your conditions as subclasses of ERROR , a subclass of CONDITION .
Thus , you might define malformed - log - entry - error , with a slot to hold the argument that was passed to parse - log - entry , like this :
( define - condition malformed - log - entry - error ( error ) ( ( text :initarg : text : reader text ) ) )
Condition Handlers
In parse - log - entry you 'll signal a malformed - log - entry - error if you can't parse the log entry .
You signal errors with the function ERROR , which calls the lower - level function SIGNAL and drops into the debugger if the condition is n't handled .
You can call ERROR two ways : you can pass it an already instantiated condition object , or you can pass it the name of the condition class and any initargs needed to construct a new condition , and it will instantiate the condition for you .
The former is occasionally useful for resignaling an existing condition object , but the latter is more concise .
Thus , you could write parse - log - entry like this , eliding the details of actually parsing a log entry :
( defun parse - log - entry ( text ) ( if ( well - formed - log - entry - p text ) ( make - instance ' log-entry ... ) ( error ' malformed - log - entry - error : text text ) ) )
What happens when the error is signaled depends on the code above parse - log - entry on the call stack .
To avoid landing in the debugger , you must establish a condition handler in one of the functions leading to the call to parse - log - entry .
When a condition is signaled , the signaling machinery looks through a list of active condition handlers , looking for a handler that can handle the condition being signaled based on the condition 's class .
Each condition handler consists of a type specifier indicating what types of conditions it can handle and a function that takes a single argument , the condition .
At any given moment there can be many active condition handlers established at various levels of the call stack .
When a condition is signaled , the signaling machinery finds the most recently established handler whose type specifier is compatible with the condition being signaled and calls its function , passing it the condition object .
The handler function can then choose whether to handle the condition .
The function can decline to handle the condition by simply returning normally , in which case control returns to the SIGNAL function , which will search for the next most recently established handler with a compatible type specifier .
To handle the condition , the function must transfer control out of SIGNAL via a nonlocal exit .
In the next section , you 'll see how a handler can choose where to transfer control .
However , many condition handlers simply want to unwind the stack to the place where they were established and then run some code .
The macro HANDLER - CASE establishes this kind of condition handler .
The basic form of a HANDLER - CASE is as follows :
( handler - case expression error- clause * )
where each error - clause is of the following form :
( condition - type ( [ var ] ) code )
If the expression returns normally , then its value is returned by the HANDLER - CASE .
The body of a HANDLER - CASE must be a single expression ; you can use PROGN to combine several expressions into a single form .
If , however , the expression signals a condition that 's an instance of any of the condition - types specified in any error - clause , then the code in the appropriate error clause is executed and its value returned by the HANDLER - CASE .
The var , if included , is the name of the variable that will hold the condition object when the handler code is executed .
If the code does n't need to access the condition object , you can omit the variable name .
For instance , one way to handle the malformed - log - entry - error signaled by parse - log - entry in its caller , parse - log - file , would be to skip the malformed entry .
In the following function , the HANDLER - CASE expression will either return the value returned by parse - log - entry or return NIL if a malformed - log - entry - error is signaled .
( The it in the LOOP clause collect it is another LOOP keyword , which refers to the value of the most recently evaluated conditional test , in this case the value of entry . )
( defun parse - log - file ( file ) ( with - open - file ( in file : direction : input ) ( loop for text = ( read - line in nil nil ) while text for entry = ( handler - case ( parse - log - entry text ) ( malformed - log - entry - error ( ) nil ) ) when entry collect it ) ) )
When parse - log - entry returns normally , its value will be assigned to entry and collected by the LOOP .
But if parse - log - entry signals a malformed - log - entry - error , then the error clause will return NIL , which wo n't be collected .
JAVA -STYLE EXCEPTON HANDLING
HANDLER -CASE is the nearest analog in Common Lisp to Java - or Python - style exception handling .
Where you might write this in Java : try { doStuff ( ) ; doMoreStuff ( ) ; } catch ( SomeException se ) { recover ( se ) ; } or this in Python : try : doStuff ( ) doMoreStuff ( ) except SomeException , se : recover ( se ) in Common Lisp you 'd write this : ( handler - case ( progn ( do - stuff ) ( do - more - stuff ) ) ( some - exception ( se ) ( recover se ) ) )
This version of parse - log - file has one serious deficiency : it 's doing too much .
As its name suggests , the job of parse - log - file is to parse the file and produce a list of log - entry objects ; if it can't , it 's not its place to decide what to do instead .
What if you want to use parse - log - file in an application that wants to tell the user that the log file is corrupted or one that wants to recover from malformed entries by fixing them up and re-parsing them ?
Or maybe an application is fine with skipping them but only until a certain number of corrupted entries have been seen .
You could try to fix this problem by moving the HANDLER - CASE to a higher - level function .
However , then you 'd have no way to implement the current policy of skipping individual entries -- when the error was signaled , the stack would be unwound all the way to the higher - level function , abandoning the parsing of the log file altogether .
What you want is a way to provide the current recovery strategy without requiring that it always be used .
Restarts
The condition system lets you do this by splitting the error handling code into two parts .
You place code that actually recovers from errors into restarts , and condition handlers can then handle a condition by invoking an appropriate restart .
You can place restart code in mid- or low - level functions , such as parse - log - file or parse - log - entry , while moving the condition handlers into the upper levels of the application .
To change parse - log - file so it establishes a restart instead of a condition handler , you can change the HANDLER - CASE to a RESTART - CASE .
The form of RESTART - CASE is quite similar to a HANDLER - CASE except the names of restarts are just names , not necessarily the names of condition types .
In general , a restart name should describe the action the restart takes .
In parse - log - file , you can call the restart skip - log - entry since that 's what it does .
The new version will look like this :
( defun parse - log - file ( file ) ( with - open - file ( in file : direction : input ) ( loop for text = ( read - line in nil nil ) while text for entry = ( restart - case ( parse - log - entry text ) ( skip - log - entry ( ) nil ) ) when entry collect it ) ) )
If you invoke this version of parse - log - file on a log file containing corrupted entries , it wo n't handle the error directly ; you 'll end up in the debugger .
However , there among the various restarts presented by the debugger will be one called skip - log - entry , which , if you choose it , will cause parse - log - file to continue on its way as before .
To avoid ending up in the debugger , you can establish a condition handler that invokes the skip - log - entry restart automatically .
The advantage of establishing a restart rather than having parse - log - file handle the error directly is it makes parse - log - file usable in more situations .
The higher - level code that invokes parse - log - file does n't have to invoke the skip - log - entry restart .
It can choose to handle the error at a higher level .
Or , as I 'll show in the next section , you can add restarts to parse - log - entry to provide other recovery strategies , and then condition handlers can choose which strategy they want to use .
But before I can talk about that , you need to see how to set up a condition handler that will invoke the skip - log - entry restart .
You can set up the handler anywhere in the chain of calls leading to parse - log - file .
This may be quite high up in your application , not necessarily in parse - log - file 's direct caller .
For instance , suppose the main entry point to your application is a function , log- analyzer , that finds a bunch of logs and analyzes them with the function analyze - log , which eventually leads to a call to parse - log - file .
Without any error handling , it might look like this :
( defun log - analyzer ( ) ( dolist ( log ( find - all - logs ) ) ( analyze - log log ) ) )
The job of analyze - log is to call , directly or indirectly , parse - log - file and then do something with the list of log entries returned .
An extremely simple version might look like this :
( defun analyze - log ( log ) ( dolist ( entry ( parse - log - file log ) ) ( analyze - entry entry ) ) )
where the function analyze - entry is presumably responsible for extracting whatever information you care about from each log entry and stashing it away somewhere .
Thus , the path from the top - level function , log - analyzer , to parse - log - entry , which actually signals an error , is as follows :
Assuming you always want to skip malformed log entries , you could change this function to establish a condition handler that invokes the skip - log - entry restart for you .
However , you can't use HANDLER - CASE to establish the condition handler because then the stack would be unwound to the function where the HANDLER - CASE appears .
Instead , you need to use the lower - level macro HANDLER - BIND .
The basic form of HANDLER - BIND is as follows :
( handler - bind ( binding * ) form * )
where each binding is a list of a condition type and a handler function of one argument .
After the handler bindings , the body of the HANDLER - BIND can contain any number of forms .
Unlike the handler code in HANDLER - CASE , the handler code must be a function object , and it must accept a single argument .
A more important difference between HANDLER - BIND and HANDLER - CASE is that the handler function bound by HANDLER - BIND will be run without unwinding the stack -- the flow of control will still be in the call to parse - log - entry when this function is called .
The call to INVOKE - RESTART will find and invoke the most recently bound restart with the given name .
So you can add a handler to log - analyzer that will invoke the skip - log - entry restart established in parse - log - file like this :
5
( defun log - analyzer ( ) ( handler - bind ( ( malformed-log-entry - error #'( lambda ( c ) ( invoke - restart ' skip- log-entry ) ) ) ) ( dolist ( log ( find - all - logs ) ) ( analyze - log log ) ) ) )
In this HANDLER - BIND , the handler function is an anonymous function that invokes the restart skip - log - entry .
You could also define a named function that does the same thing and bind it instead .
In fact , a common practice when defining a restart is to define a function , with the same name and taking a single argument , the condition , that invokes the eponymous restart .
Such functions are called restart functions .
You could define a restart function for skip - log - entry like this :
( defun skip - log- entry ( c ) ( invoke - restart ' skip - log-entry ) )
Then you could change the definition of log-analyzer to this :
( defun log - analyzer ( ) ( handler - bind ( ( malformed - log-entry - error #' skip - log- entry ) ) ( dolist ( log ( find - all - logs ) ) ( analyze - log log ) ) ) )
As written , the skip - log - entry restart function assumes that a skip - log - entry restart has been established .
If a malformed - log - entry - error is ever signaled by code called from log - analyzer without a skip - log - entry having been established , the call to INVOKE - RESTART will signal a CONTROL - ERROR when it fails to find the skip - log - entry restart .
If you want to allow for the possibility that a malformed - log - entry - error might be signaled from code that does n't have a skip - log - entry restart established , you could change the skip - log - entry function to this :
( defun skip - log - entry ( c ) ( let ( ( restart ( find- restart ' skip - log-entry ) ) ) ( when restart ( invoke - restart restart ) ) ) )
FIND - RESTART looks for a restart with a given name and returns an object representing the restart if the restart is found and NIL if not .
You can invoke the restart by passing the restart object to INVOKE - RESTART .
Thus , when skip - log - entry is bound with HANDLER - BIND , it will handle the condition by invoking the skip - log - entry restart if one is available and otherwise will return normally , giving other condition handlers , bound higher on the stack , a chance to handle the condition .
Providing Multiple Restarts
Since restarts must be explicitly invoked to have any effect , you can define multiple restarts , each providing a different recovery strategy .
As I mentioned earlier , not all log - parsing applications will necessarily want to skip malformed entries .
Some applications might want parse - log - file to include a special kind of object representing malformed entries in the list of log - entry objects ; other applications may have some way to repair a malformed entry and may want a way to pass the fixed entry back to parse - log - entry .
To allow more complex recovery protocols , restarts can take arbitrary arguments , which are passed in the call to INVOKE - RESTART .
You can provide support for both the recovery strategies I just mentioned by adding two restarts to parse - log - entry , each of which takes a single argument .
One simply returns the value it 's passed as the return value of parse - log - entry , while the other tries to parse its argument in the place of the original log entry .
( defun parse - log - entry ( text ) ( if ( well - formed - log - entry - p text ) ( make - instance ' log-entry ... ) ( restart - case ( error ' malformed - log - entry - error : text text ) ( use - value ( value ) value ) ( reparse - entry ( fixed - text ) ( parse - log - entry fixed - text ) ) ) ) )
The name USE - VALUE is a standard name for this kind of restart .
Common Lisp defines a restart function for USE - VALUE similar to the skip - log - entry function you just defined .
So , if you wanted to change the policy on malformed entries to one that created an instance of malformed - log - entry , you could change log- analyzer to this ( assuming the existence of a malformed - log - entry class with a : text initarg ) :
( defun log - analyzer ( ) ( handler - bind ( ( malformed-log-entry - error #'( lambda ( c ) ( use - value ( make - instance ' malformed - log - entry : text ( text c ) ) ) ) ) ) ( dolist ( log ( find - all - logs ) ) ( analyze - log log ) ) ) )
You could also have put these new restarts into parse - log - file instead of parse - log - entry .
However , you generally want to put restarts in the lowest - level code possible .
It would n't , though , be appropriate to move the skip - log - entry restart into parse - log - entry since that would cause parse - log - entry to sometimes return normally with NIL , the very thing you started out trying to avoid .
And it'd be an equally bad idea to remove the skip - log - entry restart on the theory that the condition handler could get the same effect by invoking the use - value restart with NIL as the argument ; that would require the condition handler to have intimate knowledge of how the parse - log - file works .
As it stands , the skip - log - entry is a properly abstracted part of the log- parsing API .
Other Uses for Conditions
While conditions are mainly used for error handling , they can be used for other purposes -- you can use conditions , condition handlers , and restarts to build a variety of protocols between low - and high - level code .
The key to understanding the potential of conditions is to understand that merely signaling a condition has no effect on the flow of control .
The primitive signaling function SIGNAL implements the mechanism of searching for an applicable condition handler and invoking its handler function .
The reason a handler can decline to handle a condition by returning normally is because the call to the handler function is just a regular function call -- when the handler returns , control passes back to SIGNAL , which then looks for another , less recently bound handler that can handle the condition .
If SIGNAL runs out of condition handlers before the condition is handled , it also returns normally .
The ERROR function you 've been using calls SIGNAL .
If the error is handled by a condition handler that transfers control via HANDLER - CASE or by invoking a restart , then the call to SIGNAL never returns .
But if SIGNAL returns , ERROR invokes the debugger by calling the function stored in * DEBUGGER - HOOK * .
Thus , a call to ERROR can never return normally ; the condition must be handled either by a condition handler or in the debugger .
Another condition signaling function , WARN , provides an example of a different kind of protocol built on the condition system .
Like ERROR , WARN calls SIGNAL to signal a condition .
But if SIGNAL returns , WARN does n't invoke the debugger -- it prints the condition to * ERROR - OUTPUT * and returns NIL , allowing its caller to proceed .
WARN also establishes a restart , MUFFLE - WARNING , around the call to SIGNAL that can be used by a condition handler to make WARN return without printing anything .
The restart function MUFFLE - WARNING finds and invokes its eponymous restart , signaling a CONTROL - ERROR if no such restart is available .
Of course , a condition signaled with WARN could also be handled in some other way - - a condition handler could " promote " a warning to an error by handling it as if it were an error .
For instance , in the log - parsing application , if there were ways a log entry could be slightly malformed but still parsable , you could write parse - log - entry to go ahead and parse the slightly defective entries but to signal a condition with WARN when it did .
Then the larger application could choose to let the warning print , to muffle the warning , or to treat the warning like an error , recovering the same way it would from a malformed - log - entry - error .
A third error - signaling function , CERROR , provides yet another protocol .
Like ERROR , CERROR will drop you into the debugger if the condition it signals is n't handled .
But like WARN , it establishes a restart before it signals the condition .
The restart , CONTINUE , causes CERROR to return normally -- if the restart is invoked by a condition handler , it will keep you out of the debugger altogether .
Otherwise , you can use the restart once you 're in the debugger to resume the computation immediately after the call to CERROR .
The function CONTINUE finds and invokes the CONTINUE restart if it 's available and returns NIL otherwise .
You can also build your own protocols on SIGNAL -- whenever low - level code needs to communicate information back up the call stack to higher - level code , the condition mechanism is a reasonable mechanism to use .
But for most purposes , one of the standard error or warning protocols should suffice .
You 'll use the condition system in future practical chapters , both for regular error handling and , in Chapter 25 , to help in handling a tricky corner case of parsing ID3 files .
Unfortunately , it 's the fate of error handling to always get short shrift in programming texts -- proper error handling , or lack thereof , is often the biggest difference between illustrative code and hardened , production - quality code .
The trick to writing the latter has more to do with adopting a particularly rigorous way of thinking about software than with the details of any particular programming language constructs .
That said , if your goal is to write that kind of software , you 'll find the Common Lisp condition system is an excellent tool for writing robust code and one that fits quite nicely into Common Lisp 's incremental development style .
Writing Robust Software
For information on writing robust software , you could do worse than to start by finding a copy of Software Reliability ( John Wiley & Sons , 1976 ) by Glenford J. Meyers .
Bertrand Meyer 's writings on Design By Contract also provide a useful way of thinking about software correctness .
For instance , see Chapters 11 and 12 of his Object - Oriented Software Construction ( Prentice Hall , 1997 ) .
Keep in mind , however , that Bertrand Meyer is the inventor of Eiffel , a statically typed bondage and discipline language in the Algol / Ada school .
While he has a lot of smart things to say about object orientation and software reliability , there 's a fairly wide gap between his view of programming and The Lisp Way .
Finally , for an excellent overview of the larger issues surrounding building fault - tolerant systems , see Chapter 3 of the classic Transaction Processing : Concepts and Techniques ( Morgan Kaufmann , 1993 ) by Jim Gray and Andreas Reuter .
In the next chapter I 'll give a quick overview of some of the 25 special operators you have n't had a chance to use yet , at least not directly .

Immigrant suburbs sometimes look like war zones
Police responsible for law enforcement in France 's tense immigrant - majority housing estates liken their job to a military mission .
" What we have is urban warfare , " according to Patrick Trotignon , a 30 - year veteran working for the police union Synergie .
Gaelle James , an officer who works in Montreuil , a poor suburb just east of Paris , agrees .
" We are confronted by ever more criminals who are getting ever more violent , " she says .
" They are now out to kill cops . "
This may sound like hyperbole - but a year after a wave of rioting spread through France 's ghettos , a number of attacks in recent weeks seem to confirm this grim assessment .
On 13 October , for instance , police responding to an emergency call in Epinay - sur - Seine , north of Paris , drove into a trap - two cars blocked their vehicle , which was set upon by dozens of youths wielding iron bars and knives .
The officers fought their way out without firing their guns , but one ended up in hospital with a broken jaw .
" Doctors and other emergency services no longer venture into some estates , " she notes .
The increasingly organised nature of violence is highlighted in a recent report by the interior ministry 's intelligence service .
A future wave of suburban disturbances , it warns darkly , could target " the last remaining institutional representatives in a number of areas - the police " .
Filming attacks
According to Mr Trotignon , the attacks are the work of teams structured along military lines .
" Operations are planned by senior commanders , with underlings making emergency calls and the foot soldiers carrying out the assaults , " he says .
What 's the point of taking risks to catch criminals when they can just walk out of court ?
Gaelle James
Police lieutenant
" And the icing on the cake is filming the whole thing with your mobile phone . "
The violence in French suburbs has devastating consequences on police morale .
" Those posted there can't leave fast enough , " Mr Trotignon says .
The impoverished area of Seine - Saint - Denis north - east of Paris - where the 2005 riots began - is " haemorrhaging " officers , he adds , as those with enough seniority get transferred to the provinces .
This high turnover means that those tasked with France 's most dangerous districts tend to be young - as the prefect , the top official in Seine - Saint - Denis , noted in a leaked note to the interior ministry .
The prefect and many in the police blame this situation on soft judges reluctant to jail the young offenders .
After last year 's disturbances , the prefect wrote , only one minor in Seine - Saint - Denis was imprisoned out of 85 prosecuted .
" What 's the point of taking risks to catch criminals when they can just walk out of court ? "
Ms James complains .
' Wildlife park '
According to Mr Trotignon , the head of the Seine - Saint - Denis tribunal is nicknamed " Father Christmas " by delinquents .
But few in the suburbs feel they are getting fair - let alone preferential - treatment from the authorities .
Contempt for police , in particular , is almost universal among young men .
Here is a sample of quotes from youths recently interviewed in housing estates near Paris :
" We do n't want a police station here .
Some cops are racist . "
" Riots are caused by police .
They think we are all delinquents . "
" The cops do n't respect us .
They come in and smash doors .
They systematically suspect blacks and Arabs . "
" Some cops are aggressive and use racial slurs when they check you . "
Older residents , of course , express different views .
They deeply resent the rampant lawlessness and want more , not fewer , police .
Youths from the French suburbs say they think all the ingredients for chaos remain
In pictures
" Cars are vandalised and youths fight all the time , but when we call the cops they never come , " complains a North African man living in Clichy - sous - Bois , a dismal ghetto north - east of Paris .
Nadir Dendoune , a 34 - year - old journalist living in l'Ile - Saint - Denis , says what is needed above all is better policing .
" When I was young , the cops were patrolling on mopeds and talked to us , " he recalls .
" Now they do n't know us .
They just patrol the area locked in their cars and look around as if they were in a wildlife park . "
Beatings
In 2002 Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy decided to abandon community policing based on prevention in favour of a strict law - and - order approach .
Beat officers were replaced by shock " anti-crime brigades " who police the suburbs mostly from outside .
Many local officials and youth workers in the suburbs feel this was a dreadful mistake .
2005 UNREST IN FIGURES 9193 cars burnt 2,921 arrests 21 nights of riots Source : French police
" In this area community - based policing played a very positive role .
Officers did real work in the estates , " says Clichy 's deputy mayor , Olivier Klein .
" Now they go in only for tough security missions , but this does not make people more secure . "
Laurence Ribeaucourt , a social worker in the Clichy area , says the riots reveal a growing divide between police and people .
" For the past three years things have been getting steadily worse , " she says .
" Youths tell me they have been beaten up in custody and harassed by police . "
Whether France 's housing estates need soft " prevention " or tough repression is a matter of debate .
What is beyond dispute , however , is that the law is no longer enforced in many of France 's deprived suburbs .
Relations between large sections of the population and the police have broken down .
Both sides are afraid of each other and as long as the climate of fear prevails , the urban warfare will continue .
Something Rotten in AdSense
Google AdSense is a system for web publishers of all sizes , from big newspapers to tiny bloggers .
They sign up with Google to place a small box full of text ads on their site .
You ’ve probably seen it , but if you have n’t , check out Michael ’s tech Interview site for an example .
Advertisers pay Google to have their ads appear in little sidebars .
Well , that ’s not technically correct .
Advertisers actually pay Google if anyone clicks on those ads .
In turn , Google gives a percentage of the money to the web site owner .
As a web site owner , you can make some serious spending cash this way .
Popular sites make hundreds or thousands of dollars a month .
The minute you put AdSense on your site , you might start thinking , hmm , gosh , what happens if I click on the ads on my own site ?
Will I make more money ?
Probably not much .
This problem , called clickfraud , is a tricky one , and Google claims to have algorithms to prevent it .
They wo n’t tell us what they are , justifiably , I think , because that would it easier to defeat the algorithms .
Still , how would you explain complaints like this one from an advertiser :
When I activate my AdSense campaign , not much more than 5 minutes go by before they are all over it ..
Multiple clicks from the same Internet IP ’s in Malaysia , Poland , Hongkong etc .
( I tried to exclude certain countries in my AdSense account , but they seem to go through proxies , so its not much use ) ..
Tried just now and within 2 minutes I had around 20 clicks , which were clearly fraudulent ( they seem to use some kind of tool – no pictures on the site were loaded according to my log ) .
I guess that was around € 20 , which went up in smoke there .
The super - duper top secret internal Google clickfraud prevention system , which is supposed to deduct the invalid clicks at the end of the month , only seems to catch an extremely small fraction of the clicks , but not nearly enough .
I ca n’t see which clicks I actually pay for in the invoice from Google , so it ’s a bit hard to say .
When you connect the dots , what seems to be happening is that scammers are doing four things .
First , they create a lot of fake blogs .
There are slimy companies that make easy to use software to do this for you .
They scrape bits and pieces of legitimate blogs and repost them , as if they were just another link blog .
It is very hard to tell the difference between a fake blog and a real blog until you read it for a while and realize there ’s no human brain behind it , like one of those Jack Format radio stations that fired all their DJs , or maybe FEMA .
Then , they sign up for AdSense .
Then you buy or rent a network of zombie PCs ( that is , home computers that are attached to the Internet permanently which have been infected by a virus allowing them to be controlled remotely ) .
Finally , use those zombie PCs to simulate clicks on the links on your blog .
Because the zombie PCs are all over the Internet , they appear to be legit links coming from all over the Internet .
There might be a technical solution to this , although I ca n’t think of one offhand .
The minute companies start cutting checks to “ affiliates ” at the end of the month that are based on nothing more than clicks , you ’re bound to get the AllAdvantage phenomenon .
AllAdvantage was probably one of the most spectacularly stupid business ideas to come out of the first Dot Com bubble : a company that paid you to look at ads .
That ’s because they fell victim to one of the better business ideas from the first Dot Com bubble : hiring armies of low - paid workers to look at AllAdvantage ads .
Eventually , it stops benefiting the advertiser , and the advertiser figures it out , and stops paying for the whole charade .
It is important to remember that AdSense is just one part of Google ’s revenue .
A more significant part is AdWords , which covers the ads that appear on Google ’s own site .
AdWords are still susceptible to some fraud , although you ca n’t make money clicking on those ads , so it ’s much less of a problem .
There is a minor problem where advertisers hire clickers to click on their competitors ’ ads , which cause their competitors to waste money , but that ’s penny - ante stuff , and rare enough that advertising through AdWords still works well .
Still , with Google rapidly approaching 50 % of the global search market , they can double the number of searches they get on their home page , but not much more than that , unless they can get more page views somehow .
Which is why they are frantically trying to sign up non-fraudulent web sites for AdSense ( they call me every two months ) and constantly seeking new sources of ad inventory , which sounds a heck of a lot like what the web portals of the 90s tried to do .
This is where Google is actually hurt by the long tail world of millions of small sites .
It ’s easy to evaluate the top 100 or 1000 web sites to make sure they ’re reasonably legit .
It ’s much harder to monitor 1,000,000 blogs to make sure that none of them were machine generated for the purpose of scamming AdSense revenue .
Still , I do n’t think Google has a choice : I predict that you ’ll see a massive expulsion of smaller AdSense sites by Google , and it better happen soon , or AdSense will ruin Google ’s reputation among advertisers , something which could be deadly .
Stewart channels Cheney : ' You gotta piss lightning and crap thunder , Alberto ! '
David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Friday April 20 , 2007 Print This Email This Jon Stewart channels Vice President Cheney in advising embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
" It was clear that before Alberto Gonzales would face his Senate inquisitors , he was gonna have to buckle down , " says Stewart on The Daily Show .
" And so he retired to his Department of Justice chambers for several weeks , up to 5 hours a day studying documents , boning up on how humans express sincerity facially . "
Video clips of fictional boxer Rocky Balboa in intense training played in the background as Stewart continued to describe Gonzales ' preparations for his testimony : " All the time , Cheney following him on a bicycle , shouting , ' You gotta piss lightning and crap thunder , Alberto ! ' "
Herzlich willkommen zum Statistikmanipulationsseminar der SVP .
Ich bin ihr Führer Leiter dieses Kurses .
Ziel der heutigen Versammlung : Einen geschliffenen
Text für die Zeitung zu kreieren , denn die Gemeindewahlen stehen an .
Wie gehen wir also vor ?
Zuerst brauchen wir ein Thema .
Für uns von der SVP machen sich die Ausländer immer gut .
Nachdem das
Thema nun klar ist , gehen wir in die Archive der Polizei .
Wir werden später die Quelle zwar zitieren ( Kriminalstatistik der Kriminalpolizei ) , wir verschweigen jedoch gezielt welchen Kanton , damit für die linken Journalisten das Überprüfen der Fakten etwas schwieriger wird .
Nachdem wir nun die Fakten haben , müssen wir schauen , dass wir die gezielt zu unseren Gunsten manipulieren können .
Fälschen dürfen wir natürlich nicht , aber gegen eine etwas differenziertere Darstellung hat niemand etwas einzuwenden .
Ganz wichtig dabei , wir verwenden grundsätzlich prozentuale Anteile , denn da steigen die Zahlen immer .
Effektiv lassen Prozentzahlen zwar keinen reellen Vergleich zu , das merkt der dumme Bürger jedoch nicht .
Eine gute Statistik ist die zu den ‚ Schweren Delikten gegen Leib und Leben ‘ .
Da tschäderets so richtig .
Ich habe hier mal eine Folie vorbereitet :
So sieht die Statistik der Jahre 2002 bis 2005 aus .
Wie auf den ersten Blick zu sehen ist , sind die Unterschiede eigentlich minimal .
Doch das zieht natürlich in der Zeitung keine Leser aufs Inserat .
Deshalb müssen wir als erstes die Balken etwas verändern .
Wir tun dies , indem wir einfach die Achse links ( Auch y- Achse genannt ) etwas verkleinern .
D.h. wir zeigen nur einen Ausschnitt daraus .
So entstehen wunderbare Effekte , wie die nächste Graphik zeigt :
Da die Gemeindewahlen bald anstehen , interessiert uns vor allem der Bereich in 2004 und 2005 .
Weil von 2002 auf 2003 die Zahlen gesunken sind , passt das auch nicht gerade in unsere Argumentation .
Darum lassen wir diese Werte vorerst weg .
Die nächste Graphik sieht dann so aus :
Nicht wahr , so sieht das doch schon viel aussagekräftiger aus .
Wir würzen das Ganze nun mit Schlagworten wie ‚ Ausländer - Brutalos ‘ , Verhätschelern , Linken , Asylmissbraucher , etc .
Dazu machen wir noch gute Sätze wie ‚ Das haben wir den Verhätschelern zu verdanken ‘ oder ‚ Schuld daran sind Linke und Verhätscheler ‘ .
Und so sieht das dann in der Endfassung aus :
Das allerwichtigste aber ist , dass wir gezielt verschweigen , dass in anderen Bereichen die Kriminalität der Ausländer gesunken ist .
Wir müssen unbedingt vermeiden , dass z.B. eine Graphik über die sonstigen Delikte gegen Leib und Leben veröffentlicht wird .
Wie ihr hier sehen könnt :
Und vor allem müssen wir verhindern , dass daran herumgeschraubt wird , dann sieht die Graphik nämlich so aus , und das würde uns natürlich nicht helfen :

Then we include all of the links .

Citibank , one of the largest providers of student loans , as well as five universities have agreed to pay $ 5.2 million to students and the New York State attorney general to resolve an investigation into student loan practices , Andrew M. Cuomo , the attorney general , announced yesterday .
Citibank , which at year ’s end had $ 33.7 billion in student loans outstanding , agreed to pay $ 2 million into a fund to educate students and parents about student loans .
New York University , Syracuse , St. John ’s and Fordham  all in New York  and the University of Pennsylvania will make payments of more than $ 3.2 million to student borrowers who received loans from companies that paid money to the institutions to steer students their way .
Though neither Citibank nor the universities admitted to any wrongdoing , they all agreed to adopt a code of conduct governing relations between student lenders and academic institutions .
St. Lawrence University and Long Island University as well as the State University of New York also agreed to the code .

It ai n’t what you do n’t know that gets you into trouble .
It ’s what you know for sure that just ai n’t so .
– Josh Billings ( or Mark Twain or Artemus Ward or … )
Much well - known business advice is sadly obsolete but can still be found in articles , business books and , not least , in daily use in the workplace .
It seems that some companies are still guided by thinking that is sadly out of date – if it was ever true to begin with .
The worst of these old maxims are not only wrong , they ’re bad for people and bad for business .
Businesses who use them are making their employees unhappy and are harming the bottom line .
Here ’s my pick of the top 5 business maxims in serious need of an update – with a suggested replacement for each .
UPDATE : Now there ’s also a Part II post with 5 more horrendous pieces of business advice .
Old maxim # 1 : Failure is not an option
Meaning :
We absolutely , positively must succeed .
Guess what :
No matter how many times you repeat this maxim , failure remains an option .
Closing your eyes to this fact only makes you more likely to fail .
Putting pressure on people to always succeed makes mistakes more likely because :
People who work under pressure are less effective
People resist reporting bad news
People close their eyes to signs of trouble
This is especially true when it ’s backed up with punishment of those who make mistakes .
Peter Drucker provocatively suggested that businesses should find all the employees who never make mistakes and fire them , because employees who never make mistakes never do anything interesting .
Admitting that mistakes happen and dealing constructively with them when they do makes mistakes less likely .
Also , failure is often the path to new , exciting opportunities that would n’t have appeared otherwise .
Closing your eyes to failure means closing your eyes to these opportunities .
New maxim : Failure happens .
Deal with it .
Old maxim # 2 : The customer is always right
Meaning :
The customer is king .
We satisfy our customers ’ every need .
No .
No , no , no .
This tired business maxim often means that loyal hardworking employees are scorned in favor of unreasonable customers .
It also , ironically , results in bad customer service .
I recently wrote a post outlining 5 reasons “ The Customer Is Always Right ” is wrong , concluding that sticking to “ The customer is always right ” makes employees unhappy and that unhappy employees almost always give customers bad service .
New maxim : Happy employees means happy customers .
Old maxim # 3 : Never be satisfied
Meaning :
You can never be satisified and complacent in business .
You ’ve always gotta want more .
This is a bad mistake which rests on a very fundamental misconception , namely that being satisfied means that you stop acting .
That satisfaction breeds complacency and therefore that a happy , satisifed company will be passive .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
In fact , a constant sense of dissatifaction in an organization sends one powerful message :
We ’re not good enough !
The irony is that this results in worse performance .
People who constantly appreciate all the good in their organization and express their satisifaction create a much more positive working environment characterized by more :
Motivation
Energy
Self - confidence
Happiness at work
This is not about closing your eyes and pretending things are great if they ’re not .
It ’s about appreciating the fact that people in constant states of dissatisfaction erode an organization ’s will and ability to act .
The trick is to appreciate what you have and still aim for more .
Replacement : Always be appreciative but never complacent .
UPDATE : “ but never complacent ” added thanks to Colin G. ’s excellent suggestion .
Old maxim # 4 : Nice guys finish last
Meaning :
We ca n’t be too nice in business .
In fact , being nice may hinder your career and impede results .
That ’s just not true , of course we should be nice at work .
This does n’t mean that you have to be nice to all of the people all of the time , but it means that you absolutely can be a nice person and succeed in business .
I previously wrote about jerks at work and why they ’re bad for business .
The conclusion : Unpleasant people hurt the bottom line .
In a networked world reputation matters , and its more important to be generous and likeable than to be ruthless and efficient .
New maxim : Nice guys get the job done .
Old maxim # 5 : Grow or die
Meaning : A business is either growing or dying .
A business ca n’t be successful if it ’s not growing .
It ’s interesting to see how growth has been elevated to an automatic good , questioned by very few businesses and executives .
Growth certainly has some positive effects especially because it creates new possibilities and challenges for an organization and its people .
I ’m not saying that growth is bad but that growth is n’t always right for every business .
Sometimes a business might be better off spending a quarter or a year not growing but simply consolidating existing business .
Consequently not growing or even shrinking does not automatically represent business failure .
That ’s what Semco ’s CEO Ricard Semler meant when he said this :
There is no correlation between growth and ultimate success .
For a while growth seems very glamorous , but the sustainability of growth is so delicate that many of the mid-sized companies which just stayed where they were doing the same thing are much better off today than the ones that went crazy and came back to nothing .
There are too many automobile plants , too many airplanes .
Who is viable in the airline business ?
If someone asks me , ‘ where will you be in 10 years ’ time ? ’ , I have n’t got the slightest idea .
I do n’t find it perturbing either if we said , ‘ look , in 10 years ’ time Semco could have 500 people instead of 3,000 people ’ ; that sounds just as interesting as 21,000 people .
I ’d hate to see Semco not exist in 10 , 20 , 50 years ’ time , but what form it exists in , what business it ’s in and what size it is are not particularly relevant .
Growing also entails its own risks , especially fast growth on borrowed money .
This almost killed Patagonia in the early 90’s .
Founder Yvon Chouinard says this :
It was back in 1990 or so and we were growing the company by 40 to 50 percent a year and we were doing it by all the textbook business ways — adding more dealers , adding more products , building stores .
Growing it like the American dream , you know — grow , grow , grow .
And one year we predicted 40 to 50 percent growth and there was a recession and all the sudden we only grew 20 percent .
And at the same time , our bank was going belly - up and we had cash - flow problems and it went to absolute hell .
And I had been the person who had never bought anything on credit in all my life .
I always paid cash for everything , and to have to call someone and say , “ I ’m sorry , I ca n’t pay my bills this month , ” was killing me .
And I realized that I was on the same track as society was — endless growth for the sake of growth .
That ’s when I decided to put the brakes on and decided to grow at a more natural rate — which basically means that only when our customers want something do we make more , but we do n’t prime the pump .
New maxim : Grow when you gotta .
Wrap-up
The scary thing about maxims is that they ’re often accepted unquestioningly because they come in the shape of old addages which are repeated – a little like nursery rhymes used to educate children .
That means it ’s not enough to oust the old maxims we need to replace them with new ones that are guaranteed to bring better results for people and for the bottom line .
Here they are at a glance , the tired maxims and the suggested replacements :
Tired old maxim New maxim Failure is not an option Failure happens – deal with it The customer is always right Happy employees means happy customers
Never be satisfied Always be appreciative but never complacent Nice guys finish last Nice guys get results Grow or die Grow when you gotta

11 Craziest Mental disorders
Published on 4/6/2006
Dr. Strangelove syndrome : hands with a life of its own Alien hand syndrome ( or Dr. Strangelove syndrome ) is a neurological disorder in which one of the sufferer 's hands seems to take on a life of its own .
Sometimes the sufferer will not be aware of what the hand is doing until it is brought to his or her attention .
Alien hands can perform complex acts such as undoing buttons or removing clothing .
Foreign accent syndrome : speaking your language with an accent
The syndrome causes people to speak their native language as if they had a foreign accent ; for example , an American native speaker might speak with a French - sounding accent .
It usually follows a severe brain injury , such as a stroke .
Capgras ' syndrome : believing there 's an impostor in the family The Capgras delusion or Capgras ' syndrome is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that an acquaintance , usually a close family member or spouse , has been replaced by an identical looking imposter .
Triskaidekaphobia : fear of the number 13 .
Adolf Hitler was triskaidekaphobic .
A specific fear of Friday the 13th is called paraskavedekatriaphobia or friggatriskaidekaphobia .
Tetraphobia is the fear of the number 4 in China , Japan , and Korea .
Bigorexia : working out too much Bigorexia or Muscle dysmorphia is a disorder in which an individual becomes obsessed that they are not muscular enough .
Sometimes referred to as bigorexia or reverse anorexia nervosa , it is a very specific case of body dysmorphic disorder ( BDD ) .
Muscle dysmorphia can cause individuals to :
- Constantly check themselves in a mirror
- Become distressed if a gym session is missed
- Take potentially dangerous drugs ( e.g. anabolic steroids )
- Neglecting jobs / relationships / family due to exercising
Bibliomania : collecting too many books Bibliomania is an obsessive - compulsive disorder involving the collecting of books to the point where social relations or health are damaged .
The purchase of multiple copies of the same book and edition and the accumulation of books beyond possible capacity of use or enjoyment are frequent symptoms of bibliomania .
Exploding head syndrome : a loud noise in the head
It causes the sufferer to occasionally experience a tremendously loud noise as if from within his or her own head , usually described as an explosion or a roar .
This usually occurs within an hour or two of falling asleep , but is not the result of a dream .
Trichotillomania : urge to pull out scalp hair Trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder characterised by the repeated urge to pull out scalp hair , eyelashes , beard hair , nose hair , pubic hair , eyebrows or other body hair .
It may be distantly related to obsessive - compulsive disorder , with which it shares both similarities and differences .
Androphobia : fear of men Androphobia is an abnormal and persistent fear of men .
Sufferers of this disorder experience anxiety even though they realize they may face no real threat .
Androphobia is one of infinite possible phobias , and as such can be traced back to a specific triggering event , usually a traumatic experience at an early age .
Munchausen syndrome : faking illnesses to gain atention
In Munchausen syndrome , the sufferer feigns , exaggerates , or creates symptoms of illnesses in himself or herself in order to gain attention , sympathy , and comfort from medical personnel .
The role of " patient " is a familiar and comforting one , and it fills a psychological need in people with Munchausen's .
Celebriphilia : pathological desire to have sex with a Celebrity celebriphilia is an abnormally intense desire to have a romantic and / or sexual relationship with a celebrity .

A Security Market for Lemons
More than a year ago , I wrote about the increasing risks of data loss because more and more data fits in smaller and smaller packages .
Today I use a 4 - GB USB memory stick for backup while I am traveling .
I like the convenience , but if I lose the tiny thing I risk all my data .
Encryption is the obvious solution for this problem — I use PGPdisk — but Secustick sounds even better :
It automatically erases itself after a set number of bad password attempts .
The company makes a bunch of other impressive claims :
The product was commissioned , and eventually approved , by the French intelligence service ; it is used by many militaries and banks ; its technology is revolutionary .
Unfortunately , the only impressive aspect of Secustick is its hubris , which was revealed when Tweakers .
net completely broke its security .
There ’s no data self - destruct feature .
The password protection can easily be bypassed .
The data is n’t even encrypted .
As a secure storage device , Secustick is pretty useless .
On the surface , this is just another snake - oil security story .
But there ’s a deeper question :
Why are there so many bad security products out there ?
It ’s not just that designing good security is hard — although it is — and it ’s not just that anyone can design a security product that he himself cannot break .
Why do mediocre security products beat the good ones in the marketplace ?
In 1970 , American economist George Akerlof wrote a paper called “ The Market for ‘ Lemons ‘ ” ( abstract and article for pay here ) , which established asymmetrical information theory .
He eventually won a Nobel Prize for his work , which looks at markets where the seller knows a lot more about the product than the buyer .
Akerlof illustrated his ideas with a used car market .
A used car market includes both good cars and lousy ones ( lemons ) .
The seller knows which is which , but the buyer ca n’t tell the difference — at least until he ’s made his purchase .
I ’ll spare you the math , but what ends up happening is that the buyer bases his purchase price on the value of a used car of average quality .
This means that the best cars do n’t get sold ; their prices are too high .
Which means that the owners of these best cars do n’t put their cars on the market .
And then this starts spiraling .
The removal of the good cars from the market reduces the average price buyers are willing to pay , and then the very good cars no longer sell , and disappear from the market .
And then the good cars , and so on until only the lemons are left .
In a market where the seller has more information about the product than the buyer , bad products can drive the good ones out of the market .
The computer security market has a lot of the same characteristics of Akerlof ’s lemons market .
Take the market for encrypted USB memory sticks .
Several companies make encrypted USB drives — Kingston Technology sent me one in the mail a few days ago — but even I could n’t tell you if Kingston ’s offering is better than Secustick .
Or if it ’s better than any other encrypted USB drives .
They use the same encryption algorithms .
They make the same security claims .
And if I ca n’t tell the difference , most consumers wo n’t be able to either .
Of course , it ’s more expensive to make an actually secure USB drive .
Good security design takes time , and necessarily means limiting functionality .
Good security testing takes even more time , especially if the product is any good .
This means the less - secure product will be cheaper , sooner to market and have more features .
In this market , the more - secure USB drive is going to lose out .
I see this kind of thing happening over and over in computer security .
In the late 1980s and early 1990s , there were more than a hundred competing firewall products .
The few that “ won ” were n’t the most secure firewalls ; they were the ones that were easy to set up , easy to use and did n’t annoy users too much .
Because buyers could n’t base their buying decision on the relative security merits , they based them on these other criteria .
The intrusion detection system , or IDS , market evolved the same way , and before that the antivirus market .
The few products that succeeded were n’t the most secure , because buyers could n’t tell the difference .
How do you solve this ?
You need what economists call a “ signal , ” a way for buyers to tell the difference .
Warranties are a common signal .
Alternatively , an independent auto mechanic can tell good cars from lemons , and a buyer can hire his expertise .
The Secustick story demonstrates this .
If there is a consumer advocate group that has the expertise to evaluate different products , then the lemons can be exposed .
Secustick , for one , seems to have been withdrawn from sale .
But security testing is both expensive and slow , and it just is n’t possible for an independent lab to test everything .
Unfortunately , the exposure of Secustick is an exception .
It was a simple product , and easily exposed once someone bothered to look .
A complex software product — a firewall , an IDS — is very hard to test well .
And , of course , by the time you have tested it , the vendor has a new version on the market .
In reality , we have to rely on a variety of mediocre signals to differentiate the good security products from the bad .
Standardization is one signal .
The widely used AES encryption standard has reduced , although not eliminated , the number of lousy encryption algorithms on the market .
Reputation is a more common signal ; we choose security products based on the reputation of the company selling them , the reputation of some security wizard associated with them , magazine reviews , recommendations from colleagues or general buzz in the media .
All these signals have their problems .
Even product reviews , which should be as comprehensive as the Tweakers ’
Secustick review , rarely are .
Many firewall comparison reviews focus on things the reviewers can easily measure , like packets per second , rather than how secure the products are .
In IDS comparisons , you can find the same bogus “ number of signatures ” comparison .
Buyers lap that stuff up ; in the absence of deep understanding , they happily accept shallow data .
With so many mediocre security products on the market , and the difficulty of coming up with a strong quality signal , vendors do n’t have strong incentives to invest in developing good products .
And the vendors that do tend to die a quiet and lonely death .
